or something like that
DA could get like a lance version of shamash
and HoT's 7t was only a simulation
it doesn't even have to happen in the story either, idk if it ended up happening but BKE didn't have AF when we got AF
yeah i'm not saying it doesn't make sense, i'm just saying they can make anything make sense, they're the ones writing the story too
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
they can make some shit up for DA too
if they can write in a brick in lore
i mean ye exactly
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
HoS got a brick
oh i mean i don't think the lore part of DA getting a revival dk matters, they can just make some shit up
i did
that would be so funny
but then again we did get dpe -> 7tr
i thought DA was getting a revival dk but now px2 is a thing
eh maybe not though
it's really just a matter of time to me <:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
SR release in 1.6 and got a pri in 4.7, 13 patch after pri started
i mean they might still <:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
it's not an if, it's a when
obviously
6.3 was also the last time they made a pri for an already release weapon
was 6.5 the last patch they add old valk to ER?
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
my bad
oh wait no 7.3 is still far away
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
the wrong patch
isn't that
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
anyway i'm planning on crowning helia in 7.3
that sounds awful
<a:GAMBA:920724874467606608>
tet i am going to bet that you are going to have a wonderful future and become an incredible person
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
on <#1041761709410484334>
anyone else wanna put bets
will take a bit cause python is slow as fuck
okay i'll run the simulations and drop it at <#1041761709410484334>
great job
yeah that's not confusing at all
think so too
and then hot at 4.1, ae at 3.7
the one before pe was hos at 4.6
it wasn't that common before
i mean chill out tho
that right?
50 nonawk, 150 awk
no but like seriously though
who cares
they're not even gonna release 2 suit of the same valk anymore
honestly they should
are they removing awk valk
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
50 unawakened 150 unawakened
wha
what's new card values?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
just remove essentine code entirely
i'll just assume same soft pity and now it's literally the exact same as genshin
it's actually going to be really simple
gimme a sec
i'll do calc with new banner
outlier doesn't matter shit
but like for 3s puller
you're low spender so like you can still individually worry about getting lucky or unlucky
i think tradeoff of complexity for more consistency is a fair one
but if it was same price
well, not now that it look like new system is way cheaper
that's why i think it's a sidegrade
old system essentine is very consistent
and frag was rng
essentine was rng
like old old system
it was already very fixed though
that's non awk
looks like an upgrade tho
oh ok
nothing broken before
just changed, simplified, w/e
i wouldn't say fixed
it was really hard to get lucky for some rank up on current banner
it also smooth out curves a fuckton
yeah essentine while it added complexity
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
sounds right tho
lemme look it up
uhhhm
worst case scenario was 120 for h3 ye
i did 2 simulation, a worst case scenario and a more realistic one
and my more optimist (which i believe is closer to what is true) is 86 s0h3
ruby said old gear was 96 for 4/4
a good amount cheaper actually according to my simul
on avg
yeah, a little cheaper
true
if it is that's great tho
so i would be surprised if it was too different power level
is like same cost as old s0 1/4
but i mean s0h1 lv45 stig cost
for like s0h1 lv45 stigs
gotta wait to see how performance is realistically going to look like
yeah maybe opening up that space for lower spending than s0 4/4 is good
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
one just looks cuter
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
no diff
but i think lv35 4/4 sig vs 1/4 maxed craftable alternative
and like sure it looks nice
the only benefit is casual player to get lv35 4/4
for v low benefit
and makes that interact with stig crafting for some reason
like it adds a layer of complexity for upgrading stigs
not really it's adding like a whole layer to dealing with stigs
cause it's complicating it for v little reward
it's exactly because i think simplifying is good that i dislike gear changes tho <:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
but if the number end up similar, i think simplifying a system is a good thing
i haven't calced the numbers
i do think the valk banner change is a good one
oh ok <:caught:1175079388874805351>
cause i don't feel like i'm reacting that badly at all
i don't think i'm overreacting
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
it's a prism + weapon banner
stig is almost flavor now
truly
new system you care about weapon and brute amount of stigs
old system you care about uprate and getting specific piece
but i mean ye like i said later, i don't think comparing pure rate mean anything cause the system are inherently different
yeah i was full of shit <:caught:1175079388874805351>
for competitive player this is at best, at BEST, just complicating the system for a sidegrade
like not only casual player even
great changes mihoyo
kinda crazy how many people are like
<:Gladge:1047969762170388531>
is this gsr talk?
wtf you talking about
cause the thing you're looking for in them are inherently different
i don't think comparing rates in the 2 system mean anything
i'm full of shit <:caught:1175079388874805351>
actually nah it's bullshit
because of guarantee box
and not get 4/4
it's reasonably hard to pull h2 or h3
which is lowkey what actually matter on new system
but idk if it's a big increase for getting stig at all
i mean it is a big increase for onrate stigs
lemme look up
yeah
is it?
i don't think the droprate is jacked
lowkey tho
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
is if you get weapon on first 10 pull
the only way you get 0 stig
i mean
did i get that right?
you want me to compare
2 valk s0h2 4/4 vs 1 valk old s0 4/4?
i dunno what you want me to compare though
i haven't done any calc on valk banner, idk if people care for me to, but i could
wdym
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
but i doubt it would be that impactful if they didn't
that's not too surprising that they'd think about it
oh i see
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
n <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512> rmal weap <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512> n in 2 <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512> 23
yeah ok buddy
wait holy shit 7.3 is going to suck you dry out of torus huh
not bad honestly
accounting for hard pity
worst case scenario
owo math 25.45 + 8.38
owo math 17.07 + 8.38
aight
i'll just calc that out
so i can check
do you have the whole drop table?
that's interesting
oh i see
and it's very likely any dupe weapon you get you'll end up just refining instead
we won't get off-rate anymore to turn into torus
weapon refinement being a thing will also fuck with torus income
oh yeah i didn't think about it but ryuu just point it out
<a:xmaspls:1180158163660591224>
sheeeesh
we're beasts
yeah
this one probably
someone else just wanted to know
thanks <:caught:1175079388874805351>
also do you have the source image for that section?
did you translate it as harmony level yourself?
<a:TheVoices:1143681011272659015>
are you an s2h3 player now ruby
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
and i trust ryuu
yeah that's what ryuu said
coralie come crowned
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
nevermind
During the event, participate in the login event to get: 
✦ Senadina's recommended stigma box ×1
✦ Helia's recommended stigma box ×1 
✦ Coralie's recommended stigma in full set max level
this is just unironically another game <:caught:1175079388874805351>
yeah an h1 also gives you 3-4 prism on avg
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
it's just actually the exact same as priarm
you'll afford lv50 all your stig
the moment you skip 1 valk
like this is very much like priarm
i mean not really though
ruby is <a:TheVoices:1143681011272659015> right now
<a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206>
s0h1 45/45/45 going to be the rl setup
so fucking wild still
this is just literally pri stig on how resources work
for competitive player that will start to play later, this is awful
for competitive player that already plays, this is pretty neutral
this is stacked for casual player who just want to pull valk and put the cute weapon and cute stig on her and jack off later
who cares
even if they start late
i mean for casual player it's alright
it's like torus problem but on turbo steroids
depressing
it's going to be actual
like if in a year they don't do anything about this and you start playing trying to catch up competitively
in a few patches
going to be REALLY BAD for new players
no this is
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
so it won't be an issue for them
but they're starting right now
that guy is going to be pissed
a riku or an aqua that start playing in a few patch
this change don't affect them
for anyone who already spend money on this game
i mean let me be honest
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
now he has a reason
he already was pulling for dupe for fun
oh it 100% won't be a problem for him
realistically speaking, this patch is 24 prism
i wouldn't count the 21 from the exchanges, i think those aren't income, just transforming old currency into new currency
like even for 3 valk patch it's an outlier
also i'm pretty sure 45 is a very very heavy outlier for 3 valk patch
if you only pull r1 of one and r3 of the other, you barely don't have enough on avg tho i think
you easily get enough prism to crown everyone
alright so if you pull r3 of the 2 valk
owo math 63 - 45
okay wait lemme calc something out
is SO cheap
buying the stig
yeah, 4/4 is meaningless now
s0h1
CAN WE GET MUCH HIGHER
s0h1
we could do h
cause genshin is r already, gsr is l?
should we do a new letter
i mean if you start skipping valk you can max your stig even at r1
s0r1 and s0r2 can't afford to max their stig tho <:ICANT:995593696030507099>
i'll post it here too
loli mom
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
weebs stumped by the passage of time
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
einstein is like coralie mother tho
apgo <:BatChest:1179791249927057419>
i mean idk tho i don't think many people would care much
oh yeah huge drama maybe
how will that be huge
bugfix: removed war treasury
i just said s0 instead of s1
i even got the rank is impossible on new banner right
i highlighted it cause ruby complained last time
i just got the date wrong
i found a post i did on blustorm where i went the year is 2025, we just got our first double herrscher patch
could be like tomorrow who knows
i mean you say that tet
probably old
<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492>
lemme check something out
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
wrong emote
<:Maaa:849760556163399710>n
casual player will get their dick hard from being able to craft any stig
it would be actual chaos
and if they did add refinement to old valk
it would just make every valk 2x cheaper for fun if they don't add refinement to old valk
like the banner is balance for it only make sense with refinement
i mean it's impossible to apply it to old valks
those weapon refinement do look huge though
with 70% chance of 4/4
gear banner you get r1 at 40 pull avg
i mean even at my pessimistic calc
r1 player is cheap as fuck
pulling gear does sound cheaper tho
though wishing well is probably still around
i mean ye there's also a 2% chance of r3 without 4/4
r1 and r2 player can't crown your valk
that means crown your valk is only for r3 player
bare 13 prism per patch
so like if we assume they actually go
probability is hard <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
the avg is pushed down from getting lucky
you can see that the most likely number to get is about the 80s range, when soft pity scales up
just because the avg is 48 doesn't mean that 48 is the most likely number to get
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
my old calcs
current avg is about 48 for valk card
70 is not current avg <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
you'd need another 8 to crown your valk
if we get bare minimum of 13 prism
12 dupe is also enough to crown your valk
and 12 dupe
if we do account for hard pity, r3 is 86 pull
14 dupe is easily enough to crown your valk
r3 would cost 120 on avg, and also give 14 dupe
hmmm so according to my calculation, if we don't account for hard pity
ruby how much is avg 4/4 rn?
how much was gear cost before?
these are the numbers accounting with hard pity
yes
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
so like, a dupe is 1 prism
i should mention that that 4/4 is assuming box
first off, non-optimistic number (assuming the number mihoyo post already takes into account hard pity)
okay i'll start posting numbers
i can do those simulation really easily later
oh
hah that's funny
HoH s1 was nut
some valk have stacked s1 tho
yeah i know nothing about that yet
you're talking about new new banner
oh wait
it does if you're lucky enough
it's really disgusting imo
and if you're already at s1 at least get s2
and then maybe get that really important s1
and then you pull a little bit more might aswell crown your valk
like you pull a little bit more, now you're r2 might aswell r3
and then it snowball from there
they're just trying to push you into spending a little bit
lowkey overall price might not even change
you can't afford pull for rank? maybe pull for refinement
mihoyo is kinda going like you can't afford 2s valk? well maybe you can afford s2 valk
to me it's about making the jumps of power more granular
the power level difference doesn't really matter imo
i wouldn't really say that?
aqua simulation right here
i just got luckiest guy ever
holy shit
{'total_rolls': 1, 'gear': {'weapon': 1, 'T': 0, 'M': 0, 'B': 0}, '4/4?': False, 'dupes': 0}
i mean yeah realistically speaking it isn't that impactful it just feels terrible for the player
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
ruby who are you crowning on 7.3
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
thank god there's a box huh
{'weapon': 2, 'T': 2, 'M': 2, 'B': 0} oooh this guy got r2 without get 4/4
<:ICANT:995593696030507099>
is that what lv50 stig is about to become
honkai crown
are we unironically getting
for like avg patch
but i also wouldn't expect for the real minimum to be much higher than that
yeah, i wouldn't expect them to ever go actual minimum
it's not really hard to simulate more, will just be harder to present the data effectively
alright sure
uhhh
like i should assume it's about 1/7 chance for weapon instead of 1/4
i should probably use effective rate instead of equal rate right?
so for the hard pity at 10, carv
yeah thank god indeed
why would you do that
owo math is shy
take your time
and 2x the weapon rate is 4.96%
assuming there's no hidden bullshit, it's ~4.86% per piece
yeah, 14.59 right?
interesting, so it's almost like it's 1 : 6 for weapon : stig
that's close
owo math 2.48 * 2
hmm
wait
yeah ~4.86% per stig, while ~2.48% for weapon, it's not really equal chance
i didn't account for 10 pull pity on my old valk banner simulations, even though theoretically it should matter
i'm still doing the new gear stuff
this is me talking about my old valk banner simulations
o i'm not touching valk stuff just answering elis questions
owo math 14.59 / 3
then it would be easy
if weapon and a single piece had the same rate
uh trying to figure out rates for 10 pull hard pity <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
that's annoying
owo math 2.48 * 4
non awk is 210, awk is 100
and then how much a frag cost essentine is different whether it's awk or not
yes
okay this is more complicated than i thought it would be it'll take me a sec <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
look harder
i also found this
so i'll run the numbers with and without accounting for hard pity
for gear, figuring out soft pity, if it does exist, would be very hard and i'm not interested in that
it makes a pretty sizeable difference
it went like 66 avg without accounting for either -> 51 avg accounting only for hard pity -> 46 avg accounting for both
the 2 things that they don't take into acc is hard pity and soft pity
so it's a very wrong number, it undershots the actual % rate by a bunch
and that % rate is only the baseline %
the way valk supply work, is that they give a % rate of card
okay i'll explain what i'll do now
owo math 2.48 + 14.59
like we already getting 4/4 they wouldn't give us 5/4 for fun
probably not an extra stig for coralie though ye?
every valk ye?
the free box
also
and then at that point just rename sp to a-rank
just all sp
no more a-rank
they finally made the jump?
alright lemme go work on some numbers then
is that so
that right?
and for a-rank weapon, you have to pull dupe on release patch, and after release patch you can buy with asterite
for s-rank weapon, you have to pull dupe
if i understood it correctly
for weapon refinement
if you want all 3 valks
gotta pull for more dupes now <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
in a way that makes it almost worse
or only free stigs?
you get free 4/4?
so for coralie
yeah, figuring out the specifics of pity is always the hard part
thanks
holy shit
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
where's the rates again
i'll do some calcs
gear gacha?
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i mean we all knew crafting would be bait tho
like the number is already pretty bad by itself
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
i mean maybe that's weekly or smth
this better not but for the whole 3 patches
like, as fine as you can realistically be
if you start at 7.3 tho you'll be fine
a new player will be getting fucked by this
so like around 8.0
by new player i mean player that join way after p2 start
i mean
this is just another mechanic that is a huuuuuge fuck you to new player
i mean even if we end up with surplus
yes, eli?
but it still sounds nuts
it went from like 6%->14%
the chances for stig are way higher now from supply
to be clear
it's 1 dupe per prism
8
per stig set
21
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
13
you know what's the baseline prism per patch they promised ruby?
you need 63 prism to max all 3 stig set in 7.3, and you only get 45 max without pulling for dupe stig
tldr you gotta pull for dupe stig to max your stig
this would be easier
pity calc is harder
shouldn't be too hard
how many you get from like x amount of pull
i could calc out
i guess since no pity at all for stig
is so fucking wild to me
being a whale thing now
like having max stigs
addition is really hard in this server
if i understood it correctly
i think you can directly salvage the new stig into prism
nah, it's not trades
then you can go over
if you disassemble new stig dupe
to make it clear tho, from what carv mention, you can get 45 from not disassembling dupe
refs are fucking dead man
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
i mean not only that, lower investment you won't even be able to max all your stig
will probably be less after
i'm willing to bet 45 on 7.3 is an exception since there's 3 stig set in that patch
i would be really surprised if it was 45 per patch
you're just pulling them
you ain't crafting the stig
if you're already pulling for dupe
i mean like we already only get 45 without disassembling dupe, so to even get the 63 you're gonna need to pull for dupe
i mean 63 needed, i wouldn't make crafting a fair expectation
lmfao
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
carv mention you need 7 per stig to max it, so 21 per set
unless i misunderstand it
to max it
carv said 7 for a single stig
it's barely enough for 2
45 is not enough for 3 stig set
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
did you read more tho
the day they add chainsaw man to fortnite
i watched ai-chan get 3 stacks on hrt and went alright i don't have to care now
my eyes just glaze during any mihoyo tutorial
<a:BatChesting:903461076614656091>
after qte
not to charge the chainsaw
they better improve genshin 4 or else <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> 
i hope mihoyo will heed my criticism now that i moved my spending funds from genshin 4 to genshin 5
genshin is really a genre at this point
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
alright
this is too much like genshin, i'm glad i left for genshin
you know, criticism from most people here does fall a little flat
does it even matter
why
the only flashing button they have really looks like they want me to spam that button
though honestly that's kinda mihoyo fault
i would agree but i tried to play lk2 after skipping the tutorial and i didn't know what i was doing
they just let you play on all 3 teams she matters
i think it's funny that she's niche enough that even though she's a support
i logged in to honkai for something and i forgot what so i went to do si2 tutorial
we have to think less
i'm so glad
the flow of battle will become more straightforward yeah that's a thing we've been asking for
so it's like they release elf with every valk now
weapon refinement is just elf funds
i guess if they're killing elf
mechanically then it work similar to elf already, it can just give more personalised buff too
oh ok
like afaik it's just an elf tied to the valk
works
i'm gonna be honest i don't really know how astral ring
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
she's going to get SO much use of that ely elf (until like 7.5)
no ice elf = lumi is having a field day
holy shit whore hrt
the moment they release p2 whore and p2 hrt every team will have an astral ring valk to put as leader
like it's only a matter of time
right?
then that is to say that yeah elf is dead
so now i'm getting worried
and no one corrected me
like last time i talked about it i joked that elf was going to be useless
is elf like dead content
do we have any info how elf will even work with astral ring
bugfix: fixed a bug that made it so the 50/50 always give the new valk guaranteed, now it properly works
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
at least the next one is guarantee
my bad
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
3 new set = 63 needed to max all of them
45 max on 7.3 without getting rid of dupes
21 prism for a full set
okay there's something wrong then
they go oh so they'd love that <a:NOTED:805343536412229642>
and every time we go you know what would be really funny
maybe we have an autistic mihoyo insider here
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
they're just trying to hide the fact that it's worse for the player
if they ever make a system more complicated
like lowkey
and maybe it'll give you a few stig dupes you can use to get prisms and be able to actually level your stigs
and now you also have to decide to pull for weapon refinement too maybe!
rank up is kind of out of question, but they add break up ranking and now it's kinda on question
like if you're a low spender, the only thing you decide to pull is valk and gear
it doesn't look good for me, the best we can expect is a sidegrade but it looks like they're rasing the spending cap with weapon refinement + making new player catch up WAY harder + making lower spenders life way more annoying and a lot of more decision
though i guess it's stuff most old player have a stock of
and it's not cheap either <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
the other 21 you gotta spend mats for it
that's 24 free one
like can s0 player even afford to max their stig under new system?
it's also going to be oops my stigs are lv40 lv45 lv40 <:caught:1175079388874805351>
sorry i can't use that ref cause my valk is s3r2 and not s2r3
so it's not only going to be
okay ain't no fucking way that looks terrible
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
especially since no offrate
catching up is going to be a lot worse
i mean i guess as long as it's enough it's enough
45 is barely enough for 6 stig
isn't 7.3 2 patch valk?
so 24 without whaling
this is fucking wild
how does that even work
but crafting a WHOLE NEW stig is only 2
like how come 4.2 -> 5 is 4 prism
what the fuck?
is max levelling a stig now whale stuff?
is this like
ain't no fucking way you don't even get enough for free to max a single set
what
so 3 stig you need 21
to max a stig
and you need 7
so you get 13 per patch
wait what
then who the fuck knows
if all system are changing
if it's one change it's easy to measure what effect it'll have against all other system we already know
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
like
we don't know if they're looking into releasing more stig set per patch to balance it out
like we don't know how much to craft a gacha piece cost and our income of resource
we really don't
nah
jesus fucking christ
but like we know too little and that by itself means nothing
crafting gacha stig sound nice
yeah this is just too different to make any meaningful claim i think <:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
at best it's a sidegrade
for fun even
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and now they're changing the whole system
i spent like a few tens of hours programming that pull simulator
is about to be completely and utterly useless
all the knowledge i have
it does make me sad that like
it doesn't even look simplified either
i have no faith in mihoyo for it to be cheaper either
it is just unironically another game
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
oh i'm s3r2 sorry i can't use that ref
killing the ref market
they're unironically making this shit genshin in the worst way possible
that's unhinged
i can't believe they actually went with weapon refine
alright idc
oh
what's a suit frag
wait what
right?
surely they didn't remove all frags
do you rank up with stamp?
is only stamp for sale there too
wt
what about like
?
fuck it just get 7 dupes
constellations?
how do you rank them up now
what the fuck?
removed valk frag?
of course it is
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
unless you ran a lot of number
i mean i dunno if one can say it's objectively cheaper
oh shit we getting jp focus?
it's just a whole different gacha system at this point
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i feel like those changes are so big it's hard to evaluate them as changes
alright
okay this is just a different game now
farmable?
oh
like foundry craftable?
what
<:ICANT:995593696030507099>
i said that as a joke
what
cool
i don't think i care that much
like in maybe 5 words
anyone wanna give me a tl;dr
that's a lot of changes
how is she getting shafted this hard
ain't no way man
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i mean i just said i needed it too <a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
do this
use your head
the halloween ones are so cute, S-rank skins
their hair is very pretty
i like rozalili beach skin
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
what is your interpretation of what happened? on page x, this character said this, what do you think this means?
maybe if they start putting like literacy questionnaires after every chapter
lowkey maybe
i look on reddit and some people still don't get it either so like even that's not enough for some people <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
but i didn't so i'm glad
i think i'd be annoyed if i already got all that and i just had to sit around why they spell it out
i dunno honestly <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
carv is going to kill everyone
<:life:1001518241610485781>
okay i gotta catch up the slow ones and had a character explain and spell out all the themes and shit
you know, i'm glad that it's manga that i'm reading, cause i'm getting to the end of the one i'm reading and i feel like the author just went
i'll get to it soon <:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
yeah kinda
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i went somewhere and it straight up told me you're too much of a shitter come back later
if it's ranked stuff i might be too bad to access it
cause i didn't see any in like daily or w/e, it being on event makes sense
oh is that so? it's all event?
i can't even be pissed
especially since it's all cosmetic anw
yeah it looks turbo expensive for fun, but i mean they gotta make their money somehow i guess
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
i'm legit getting 4th place in bottom of the barrel match, going -10lp at 0lp
i'm not actually that attached to mahjong i play it very rarely and i suck
you could retire honkai and move your spending to mahjong soul
we're reducing abyss frequency to help with player anxiety, abyss will now close twice per month
that sounds kinda cbt
yeah that
i remember the like weird elf active thing or w/e
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196> okay
i'm out of the loop
are they changing it?
are you thinking about retire ruby?
true
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
it could be the last part 1 valk battlesuit we ever get
maybe we should be grateful for hua though
but like maybe
i don't trust them to have multiplayer
if they have multiplayer i'd actually be so down
<:joever:1122752199752163419>
i mean i guess it could be just like destiny or w/e
i wonder how they're going to do genshin abyss but fps though
that's like the biggest market section they don't have covered yet
yeah fps would make sense
:muga: ?
yeah i was thinking about it i dunno if that was real, i am a little excited though
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
if genshins so good why is there no genshin 5 yet?
we'll all become genshin <:life:1001518241610485781>
i guess we don't even have to complain though, CN got our back
<:wholetcook:1151659795531710534>
holy shit that last one
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
i can see too much of her arm
i'm down for more scales
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
jesus christ
we're like this ain't even sexy and they're like you're not fucked up enough
you know maybe their sexuality is like 5dimensional
oh is the valk not even exclusive too?
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
it's kinda weird that makima default skin has a jacket over her ass
true
she is mei
literally not even notice cause her skin is the same color as the clothes
recently i discover that flamescion has some like hip windows
lowkey if the clothes are lightly colored enough i don't even notice if it's showing skin or not
is hoh even revealing?
we should have our first fully feral valk
i don't really mind less clothing i just don't really get it <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
yeah they just moved all the clothes away and hide her hands so we can't see the fist design on teaser art for some reason
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
looking at the teaser art vs her ingame though, that teaser art did do her dirty, it looks a lot worse imo
<:Looking:1154847280529162260>
unimaginably based, abs hua
SO true holy shit
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
like what
yeah i agree, idk what hua fan ever go i wish i could see more skin
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
like if you're gonna leak make sure to not put us in hot water
you think mihoyo asks for leakers to add the *stc
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
announcing smth and then backtracking is the issue
that was leak stuff, they never announced anything
it's mostly because i forget often though, i can disable if people want me to
i have a plugin that disable the you are typing thing
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
but like just from how rushed their development must be
i mean i'm just pretty sure they do, there's no way for us to prove either way
i'm pretty sure mihoyo change design of valk until the last day before beta
lowkey it was kind of a blunder to show a teaser that early right <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
you got your seal of approval to complain from carv
i like how you're like
holy shit those boobs are huge
a hua?
who is it
but maybe
idk thats not why she annoys me
i think you gotta be a flavor of fucked up to be an artist
o her cringe isnt either just chronically online
she can be cringe but shes based about that
cloudya is giving her a cloaca for SURE
it's <:joever:1122752199752163419>
carv speaking in riddles now
cowards
i'm pissed
is SO upsetting to me
the fucking boots and gloves being clearly cloth
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the only thing that matter from beta
knowing the valk kit is like
doesn't that turbo sucks
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
trust
there won't be any change at all to the amount of info we get from beta
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
jesus tet
holy shit
is a sick as fuck name
problematic boobs redacted
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
also i don't think it's that bad that this is a new gimmick that only new valk has
what's going to happen with elf? do they just get auto activate with astral ring?
doesn't that replace elf button for new valk?
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
me when i'm 7 and my parents bring me to the mall for the first time
sheeeeesh i'm so proud
eh i guess it's the cross, i could see it being used on SI or CH in MA
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
so they just moved the phys to SI2 only?
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i dunno what i was expecting, still surprised they cooked this this soon though
ok
oh
share vid?
that must've been a lot of work
oh? how much?
yeah that's a big blunder <:wholetcook:1151659795531710534>
idk if their intention matter at all, but that one i don't think i can quite tell
yeah i think that's my take too, i think the fact that it look like they just traced the shots frame by frame steps over a line
how we feelin
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
on that plagiarism thing
what's the take
okay
i mean okay so as far as i care seinen is still just shounen but i'm insecure <a:Noted:914214211138244688>
are you sure? like i think at a younger age it's more of a linear path of how your taste might evolve, but like once you're old enough, your taste won't be linked with your age at all, like someone with a similar age as you might have evolved their taste past w/e the thing you're starting to enjoy only now
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that will happen all the time
i mean but like, that's just your taste evolving
i kinda think like when you get to about 15-16+, i don't think your media taste are linked in a measurable way to your age
what's your definition of younger demographic?
hmmmm yea i dunno if i see that
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
as far as i care, the shounen/seinen split is that seinen is just i like shounen but i'm self conscious about it
tbh i don't completely get what shounen mean
it simply sucks because i haven't watched it
i mean only for fun though, i won't make up reason to hate it
i haven't read or watched any of it, i just have a rule where i hate everything that i've never consumed if it's popular enough
i know a lot of anime op song from random place without knowing it's an anime op or what anime it's from
i think i've heard one of them before and it was good
oh sick! that will be fun
hell yea
how's it going chrom?
hey!
shame
aw man they removed the only good one?
oh
frieren? <:wokejj:1118547247567745164>
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
that's kinda fucked up mihoyo
gh before cny?
so
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:998328905561804830>
that background
god
7.3 full price std s-rank?
7.2 probably discount s-rank
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
the thing i'm definitely most pissed is if they start release v1 info at v3
oh i mean if that's the case then i don't care that much
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
did they say it was going to be under same time schedule?
i'm saying the change making beta into close beta
no i'm not saying about changes in beta content
outside here
are people outside pissed about the beta change?
idling is worth it tho
what the fuck
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
to close off even more info from casual player
which is the only reason i can imagine for making beta test server close and nda
i mean this is a lie tho, it does hide it from casual player
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
it just gives an environment for leaker to clout chase
it's not like making the beta nda and close server actually hide information from anyone besides carv
the bitching isn't that bad, it's not like genshin doesn't bitch either
i mean no way that's the case
<:life:1001518241610485781>
genshin, genshin star rail, genshin impact the 3rd
genshin 3 was under our noses all along
we thought zzz would be genshin 3
man it's actually crazy
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
we'll be align to them in half a year
i mean i guess if they cut down our patch by a week at a time
how many weeks are we behind? 3 or 4?
is it even possible for us to sync?
(pericles was really good)
(it's been a patch)
it's been years
finally some good oc stig
<a:BatChesting:903461076614656091>
she can get a 30k score solo against 2s kallen
holy shit
Small leave me alone
i think i'm happy about that
i dunno how i feel about out of everyone here, i get to be Unhinged
obviously
i only think about myself
no
i am homophobic and hate women she says to the homosexual woman, and expects her to be fine about it
word for word
my bad i still hold grudge over you going i hate you and i will never watch utena with you
how does that feel
cherry, nqn hates you
<a:NOWAYING:1120799446733705277>
that is kinda like schizo thevoices
i have a nowaying
<a:TheVoices:1143681011272659015>
but y'all are actually
you know i'm not really a fan of moriso
you wouldn't get it
the first 3set is just meaty
damn
ooooh
oh wait there's no 2 top
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i already made a joke about that
the powercreep
damn her stig have top mid bot 2set 3set top mid bot 2set and 3set
god that's so much text
she got the same lead?
is she awk SI?
wait
easy to remember
lee is fire in honkai because she's hot and physical in pgr because i want him to get physical with me
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
that's just the stig, right?
you can't fucking tell me thales is actually a person out there
thales
like
if my teacher says something about bathory i'd go lmfao what a fucking noob, marco TM attila B instead
but yea for bathory
cause idk what mendeleev does
i mean for medeleev i wouldn't have that problem
dirac doesn't even register as a possible name of a person, it's the SP stig with the weird impair
my brain cannot understand that they are real people
half of the people in honkai stig
i'm gonna be honest, i'm fully brainrotten
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
one out of four, three out of six
i thought it was a counter
i see
okay
OH
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
1/4 3/6 2/5
what the fuck is that naming scheme
LMFAO
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
that's an artist i think
i feel like they would do turg dirty
you're right mine probably is
molding?
actually true
they complain about gsr having 5 artifact but they got 3 lightcone like what
they even got ei from genshin
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
cause it look like it too
i wouldn't even blame them at this point
think honkai is just a gsr spin off
like if a new player
honkai new UI look giga generic
i think the point from iriya is definitely from how the aesthetic look tho, not how confusing it look
maybe even a little clean
idk if it's mindrot but like for gacha standard it looks pretty alright
hi neko
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
that's a pretty good one though, <:jphPlus2:1062420906720366632>
i'll take that as a compliment honestly
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
ativar o window mode?
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
hi carb
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
i found a carv in the wild
ativar o android
all the fps scam
solve all the window drag issues
true, disable pc client
and like... yeah
iriya said this
aesthetically it is a straight downgrade to me
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
i just click 3 valk and click 3 loadout
i mean like maybe i'm underestimating the time savings in setting up your team
that one i don't mind
leave me the fuck alone
1 misclick and i'm lead to a 5 minute tutorial
it's a fucking horror game
every time i log in to do some dumb shit like a 2s MA
god yes
yeah
it looks like arknights collab
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
we old player lose our familiarity around it but it kinda look just as crowded and confusing to new player
it feels like the worst of both worlds
i mean idk, is it more convenient?
i'll miss it
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
so we only have one patch before the UI downgrade?
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
game journalists
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
these sjw are ruining gaming
they know western audience can't take a straight relationship anymore
it's censorship
i mean probably honkai 4 right?
and i wanna be contrarian
maybe because i feel like she's going to be everyone's favorite
i don't dislike it but for some reason i don't wanna make her my favorite
like the edgy one
idk why
yea that one feel like bait to me
she looks like a gyaru
ai chan one definitely has a niche, just not one i'm extremely into
that one looks very generic for me
yeah okay i do prefer ai chan one more than that one i think
ic
oh
wait isn't that the dudu fan?
that look like ai chan
lil hair circle things
i thought it was dudu fan cause she has the like
oh who then
well, taking self insert out of the equation cause it's not really worth a spot in a tier list
i guess we complete each other cause that's the one i like the least
dudu fan?
red head who dances
i think i've grown to like hn2 design already
back to genshin
also whooaaa purple griseo is so pretty
did they say what the second valk on bp?
your himeko is in another genshin
oh wow i didn't know that
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
is 7.0 event is the last captainverse event?
he doesn't die <@483689649727078400>
honestly as far as i'm aware you probably know the future plotpoints
maybe he dies then
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
nvm then
oh
i'll take it honestly
<:lewd:959737567119556618>
thanks
or bet that boss sucks haha
now all i can do is damn that booba is big
i could make topical jokes n shit
unironically true
i fell off
and i think i was funnier back then
i back read some of the moriso drama that you link cherry
can't believe 7tv is racist
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
oh you mean the discord server?
does it not have brazil?
i am reaaaally enjoying it, though i'm early on it
i'm blue daba di daba da
perfect blue
blue exorcist
there's a lot of blue anime and manga
blue lock is the soccer one
no it's the painting one
and my headcannon gears are turning so hard
i'm reading blue period
true
you can accompany a valk of your choosing on her hard moment of getting a boob surgery if you want
i think you deeply misunderstand my question but it's okay
cherry
but it would be sick
it would never happen
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
also that sounds not great if what you're doing is trying to clock the trans one
yeah, i didn't mean hrt by boob surgery tho
go on then
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
boob surgery expert logged in
you too alice, the question wasn't only for cherry
do you think boob surgery is like, giving the boob a little fertilisation and then waiting for it to grow and flourish
w-what?
message ghost written by aqua
(boy named future):
what would be your plan
and you had to among us figure out who it was
if one valk got booba increase surgery
i think
since captain from the future is one of the main character of the storyline
i think he's confirmed to not die
sure buddy no tragic ending in sight
<:PepeLaugh:637096187270529035>
lmfao
y'all are mean
man i better not leak my real name
and then i could see starburst hua
we'll prob get our biyearly a-rank stardust valk soon
they don't really release big valk to debut a new type
for some reason i though cny was closer tho
i mean i know that
stardust?
that kinda convince me a lil that garuda won't be ignite then
damn
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh i see
where's VA <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
wait not really actually
changing between awk and non-awk
i'm not saying i'm a leaker i'm just saying that hua will be deez nuts lmfao
<@416445660443967491>
i appreciate the hekate for i assume hitcount tho
sometimes you don't even have to be bio
literally every bio valk has a turn on him
like to this day
so funny that husk still gets passed around like a slut
which is why i didn't piss and cry about it back then
i'm being a shitter tho, they didn't try to pass it off as a bugfix, it was stated as like damage adjustment or smth
they bugfix* HoD
sorry
so the new support matter
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
they just buffed HoD
and they release SI
like when HoD score got like -2
idk they might fight against it for a bit
we've had some disgusting HoD scores before
-0 idk
i wanna @ all the 3head going i like 3s more because it takes longer than 2s
what the fuck
but only one content match the label?
you see how both have orange label
babe that's orange
or did you hear about red fanta in america and went sounds right
are you in america drinking red fanta
after this after what
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>

do fanta
mb my message was insenstive then
wait are you really?
are you in the US?
wdym not an option
water
he's saving up boiled water in the fridge so that he doesn't have to boil more later
<:peepoThanos:874480062940999750>
those are all lie
SW, DPe
just making their own reality over there
that one is the true HoS
asuka was after HoS
no
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
dawei card
it's not a joke
you can get it in one pull if you use the right card
sherlock is onto something
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
maybe in 2 year we'll have dk²
current gimmick is dk
it's what happen to HoV, FS, SR, etc
like old revival mechanic was give them a pri-arm
absolutely they will get revived in a few years, they might have a new gimmick to revive valk by then tho
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
good one mihoyo
need ranked normal s-rank to beat discount s-rank
we should just stop thinking and follow his lead tbh
honestly 5head
prob a pretty good investment for new player/budget player
she's looking pretty flexible actually
it is better than what i imagine tho
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> that looks a little awkward to me
what dist are those test at?
like 7%
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
then yeah i'm sure for a sec there everyone alive knew about kiana
oh ok
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
so yea probably
vita killed everyone else or smth
30 people?
isn't the honkai universe rn like
i'm sure there's a market
and sold feet pic of honkai valk
wait that'd be sick if you did like bottom down cosplay
what about in honkai niche
i didn't think through it
i mean i guess that makes sense, it is a chainsaw
oh ic ic
also what's with the hit count? is lk2 have hitcount on kit?
that HoD transition but with lil bros instead
it's loaded up
look at that transition
but he will
that's gonna suck in MA
LMFAO that transition is funny
<a:KeqingLooking:843861817511247922>
which is about as skippable as any valk can ever get
v1 kinda look like about avg dps valk
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
RL you can go p far even without impair
like if you're fine RL it's prob fine
imo it'll depend on cost, prob
it's like the minecraft of sex
piss piss piss piss
me
the only knowledge of super hell day is when it shows up in my timeline to tell me the news
oh god i don't remember dates like that
but you can't be sure that's what happen
that's probably what happened
i guess i can
!steal <a:NOODANCEBUTFAST:945488488277606442>
idk can i?
<a:NOODANCEBUTFAST:945488488277606442>
<a:NOOO:844609807675162685>
yeah, every food deliver here has some way to know if it's been tampered
to show a lil arm pit
the lengths mihoyo designer will go through
have you seen jean
arm pit
it's not too fancy tho it's just tape
yeah subway is stapled usually
and you're instructed to not accept if that tape is teared
and that paper bag is taped by something
the burger come in a paper bag
like if i get food delivery mcdonalds
huh
but
that doesn't surprise me too much cause the states are fucked up
what???
think a gift box wrap
our pizza is always like
not pizza tho
some even are legitimately vacuum sealed
isn't that normal?
and you're instructed to not accept it if it's unsealed when you get it
yea, all food delivered here is taped
i'd eat it
if it still had the tape seal
yes
an unsealed box
it's about unsealed food left outside for long enough for it to be cold
it's not about the wrongly delivered
wyd
babe it wasn't the apocalypse it was a thursday
i'm a furry and i'm not as much of a rat as y'all are what the fuck
????????
you don't know that for sure
that was probably* wrongly delivered to you
@tet you agree this is insane right
????? it could've been a rat or something
like you don't know what the fuck went in there
but there was a piece missing
i would too if it was still closed and taped up
????????
what the fuck you mean that's not that bad
what's that story
yeah cherry
keep it up buddy
yknow
w-what
you're invicible probably
all my cherry dietary worries have been resolved ever since the street pizza day
jp is カカリア
nope
chill
just an alternative romanisation
it's
kakaria
cocolia has like 5 different spelling
sirin was celine before
that's like translator whims
i mean
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
so
and it sound like it's not
the one thing i wanted to know is how interesting her gameplay are
yeah i'm kinda getting it i think
she doesn't
like i complain before that all other valk feel like they're made for ER nowadays
i see, honestly i kinda vibe with her
like i am anyways
can i even be disappointed anymore
so brainrot
does it auto rotate through the different combo?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> i'm sorry
i kiiinda see it? but i guess the thing i actually wanna know is what the input look like
looks cool!
but uh
gonna be honest, can't quite tell what's going on
taihens trans? <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
surely not right
or does it count as phys too
is it bleed damage that isn't phys
i wonder how this is going to work
<:RemHighFive:752716894544330812>
up top?
gottem
lmfao
lots of mashing huh
bilibili vid patch notes
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
they disable damage number
you have my permission
moriso post a lot but nothing about lk2
unless? 😳
what did you say you would do if there was no answer?
<:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930>
so every time he show up i go
the main villain is called stigma
a manga i'm reading
<:jphPlus2:1062420906720366632>
and i only know it for the song
so
the only reese i know is reeses puff
<:sadge:803115920092430346>
12 seconds i can't even get it up yet
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
but i'm like idfk spit it out
i feel like that only works if you're trying to uphold some societal expectations yk
i mean idk i'm way too comfortable around you guys
maybe it'd work irl on me
oh i see
go on tho i'll laugh
sorry i'm pissy rn
L
yeah
dummy
just farm xtal and pull her
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
i mean she was always farmable
nvm i'm confused
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
oh wait
it's sn btw
what did you just say
qua ice seele
nyx
everything is someones signature set
turg?
you remember that one?
she released right after hb
qua ice seele
nyx
they release boss for the patch valk to deal with
it's honkai
no?
<:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
translate this
like the one before senti dk
last g4 was last patch
probably not
instead of the whole burst mode
it's just like really quick
according to taihen she does have bonk still
<:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
and they remove the bonk
for the squeaky bonk
imagine buying senti beach skin
LMAO
aren't you
that's her gimmick
giving hua battlesuit ult cd is cringe tho
but it's not good lmao
cause i'm used to it
not really disappointed in the design
so they want to let us keep using her whole kit
they're prob removing all her sp issue
i get it tho
kinda boring but ok
no more bonk?
how is she using chain while burst is up?
wait what's going on
i'm also lil bro
ok lil bro
i can call you lil bro
that interface does look sick tho
who cares then
oh no atk
i think we got like +8 atk every few levels
higher lvl dorm is stat buff
LMAO
that's scary
what the fuck
are they adding all valk to dorm? what?
united
is she not playable
well i mean
v1?
is she not out
weird ass patch
ae hot da farmable through witch corridor
bke sn aka farmable
cool
that's sick
she gets 3 new weapons?
yes
supplements
i was fine with most of the silly and memey stuff being confined to events
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987> maybe it's fine, i don't think it's too serious tho
that's a bit too memey for me <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yea like idk
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> that's so memey
maybe it matter now
sns, gc, now hos
they keep giving stun trauma to valk and it not matter <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the animations could still look cool tho
it's funny but i'd feel stolen a cool dk design
idk if i like that
yea star valk will ignore the mechanic so that'll be fine
potentially awful to bald
that sounds
any readers?
tldr?
i don't wanna read all that
:essaying
i'm wondering what the gimmicks gonna be
yeah, that's interesting i guess!
oh that's her leg
but i guess that was prob true for qua when ima release
we could still have an ima ice dps
it doesn't really feel like they pushed ima as far as they could
just feels a lil weird cause like
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it's prob around normal huh
is that normal?
or has it been a lot longer than i'm thinking?
like so soon
that's weird LMAO
you mean people made it the fuck up
i never played that game so i went looking for it, apparently this is not canon
i made it up
are just bottom that don't wanna say they're bottom
i think 80% of switch
wiki ass description of tet's bf
fucking
but i have not been diagnosed no
i mean i think it's p obvious
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987> maybe
i just easily hyperfocus
i mean it's not about rather or not
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and be like huh why can't i form deep connections
and not message anyone
i'll just spend 5 straight 16 day hour days playing runescape
i'm way to autistic
i know it's completely my fault tho
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
i dunno i guess i'm unable
maybe me one day?
<:crying:757445037402619974>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
completely unhinged story
our sense of humour is the same
you should tell tet the piss story she would love it
did you tell tet the piss story?
well there's tons of things i shouldn't
but now i don't feel bad anymore
like i thought a little bad about furry hornyposting in your dms
is it furry
no i was just surprised
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i didn't know lumi was this horny
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
taihen sent hakcer an imagine of like his arm or something and went holy shit taihens penis
like circumference
what's your line if some really rich guy came to hire you for weird stuff
the poop observer at lumis house
that does not count
wdym indirectly
<a:alert:853952040652243004> HAKCER MISINFO ALERT <a:alert:853952040652243004>
you should do one for honkai valk
like that aloy one
you know those like gamer western game girl isn't hot enough
and then you do it if you have the energy
tet, can i give you a joke idea
everyone hates moriso lmfao
stfu moriso
chill
the standard are so low
eli this is a honkai server
please do!
if you come to brazil and meet me irl
you'll only see my face
me neither tbh
rate it? /10
hak not gay cer
yo camera man chill up
well i guess it depend on who's doing it
it really wouldn't
sona?
??????
i only saw tai's face
i missed all of those
what the fuck
my discord pfp is my irl face
i did
keilo meet n greet
i will meet you if you want
genuinely tho if anyone here does show up in brazil for some reason, são paulo area
sick <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
the answer is not yet*
hi carv
if you came would you meet me?
genius
but also as in brazil!
brazillion as in like a lot
LMFAO lumi <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
ooooh my bad
<3
to meet me?
you can stay at my home
yeah?
what has riot done
even my normie irl friends call her the feet girl
i'll look for it
i can't stop thinking about it
tet have you seen that one tumblr post that is like you can hurt me, break me, destroy me, but for the love of god, don't
i'm 180cm
but agree
the way i enjoy tummies is prob different from you
uh
well actually
agree so hard
cool valk
DK just slaps
but i feel like a weirdo using it
and it's so cute
cause that skin gives her shield lil horns
i'm so upset
same
i thought the red line there was something you edited in with a lil scissor and a cut here line
and i thought it was that one
showing a lot of skin
and being caught up on a rita skin
so like i remember going through all skin with some friends
idk
maybe i am
i'm not thinking of a skin being censored
i think i'm maybe just confusing it with a br skin
like it showed a fuckton of skin
i remember it being a lot worse
was this skin censored
okay answer me truthfully
everyone knows i'm a cis girl cause i have the biological vagina bones
<:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930> vagina bones
literally the first thing you see when you make an acc
keep up
the one you play as?
the first frame of this looks like a really fucked up genshin valk with pink hair
eli is like yeah if you look from 30-70º you can see about 7 inches of sideboob, i can send you the research docs if you want
glued
are those
you know it's people like you that make valk in genshin go <a:ppPoof:1072675171405668402> when you look at the ceiling
<:PauseCat:1002644852850298960>
honestly that's fair
oh yeah there's a live action right
you're a boomer for liking ghost in the shell right
normie anime nowadays are like attack on titan
that's not that normie is it
she's siring all over us
siring
apparently siring gear is better for da
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
heki come to tit game chat and see tits
:loooking:
she's very pretty
you can still check her
how does that work
tet going crazy for fish
i think all of them have full boobs
he hates us
literally the only one <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
isn't that a secret
i mean, he is consistent at least
which is p nice
and it's legit like 20-30 bucks cheaper
some laptops have the option for you to buy without windows
yeah, tho not necessarily
like if you buy bulk it's cheaper, if you bought a pc or laptop and it came with windows it's legit
probably
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
lamayo
they don't keep updating it tho right
kinda wish i had it
that's sick
you can look at even today?
an item
wait is the book from 6.4
oh that's neat
wait what
<:Truege:1114141621022375997>
let them look into it further
sherlock just found some clues that are implying the game might have a thing with powercreep
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
i read lmao as lamayo
lol even
chainsaw man more like chainsaw girl amiright
i thought it was real gameplay
oh
?
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
cycle as in
share?
wait do we have gameplay?
it's like 140
he already say he isn't pirating it
so we can buy carv a legit copy of windows
we should do a kickstarter
no, that's the other portuguese, i speak the good one
nt tho
it sounds less passive agressive in english
i mean in portuguese
but sure
hahaha sounds very passive agressive
i do eoheohoehoe
the most popular is kkkkkkk
the huehuehue thing is not really how anyone laughs
no
for every team
so you can run dps hua hua
now they're removing the only run a valk once limitation
they removed the awk/non-awk limitation on team build
true and based
like i'll miss her but i already miss her
but i'm not playing the game so like, it doesn't really change much to me
i do really love her and her gameplay
<:o7:1099354934320840765> HoT
actually i thought about for a bit and i'm over it already
i will cry irl if she replace HoT
Him
god i think
hua hua hua hua hua
i guess it makes sense tho
damn
vita's already getting skins?
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
yeah i'm completely lost
you'll learn to not let it affect you with time
cmon, grab a chair to the boomer club
is this the first time you're out of the loop?
oh poor thing
my honkai survival instincts
cause whore crit stuff doesn't matter for her
my instincts say that HN should always prefer HoS
<a:ppPoof:1072675171405668402>
like in a good way ?
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i have 1k xtal
can't speak for them, still don't know how to play trio and am unwilling to learn <:A_HuClown:795116510636408852>
the rest are all like, follow up from weapon active, only use the shiny one on burst mode
who actually rawdog their NA string
there's like 2 valk in recent history
i don't even know if that's a good or a bad thing
wild looking back, the amount of work mihoyo pours on stuff no one will ever experience is kinda insane
oh god i remember doing that tutorial
following patch, bugfix being able to anicancel fast ult on s0
s2 -> mixed and ult cast faster
that is literally how 2023 AE would play like
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
eden ass valk design
press atk when it flashes to anicancel!
i'm outraged
you don't deserve the hua you yourself made
cowards
kys
These Fu Huas have simplified commands
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
just another seele?
what even is she
what timestop ult can i use with like no sp
you think i could stop abyss timer but she still spawn?
like if i use a timestop ult
i wonder if i could
huh
she spawns at 992
i remember being -2
yeah i got a 990 score i think
i ulted once
it was fun
i did it in abyss
HoD is literally a nightmarish demon that lives in between realms
what do you mean we feel it
cop behaviour
one shot on the core, one shot on the- i could shoot the ceiling
and you just went
and he was really cool
i thought it was a thin sunglass
wait are those eyes and eyebrows?
this one?
<a:mhm:1088510781756276756>
so like you were ulting with LY
okay that only brings more questions
cause you're the only person who went i wonder if i can tell time by how high the sun's up while dodging HoD attacks
yeah i bet you can't find pics of it
what about the roof tho
it goes <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
and it turns
i know it has walls
i've seen that before
like what
i wonder if it has a ceiling
how do you have the time to go eh i'll take a gander around
i'm fighting a boss in there
why would i look up
how do you know that
wtf you mean it has a big roof
i thought that was the hod domain
meanwhile their decision process is like we haven't used this one in any 3s boss right? aight bet
i think you're the only one who thinks about the lore implications of the domain
it could be about me <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
wait my name starts with ke
which, fair
or maybe the hot tiger they have
and y'all really like cereal rn
all i think about with the ke is that it's about kellogs
thanks
i'm old and slow
speaking in code
i leave for like 2 days and you guys are unparsable
oh ok
sirin furry
wait
why scissor furry?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
wild that they get rid of huodou before AKA
2s AKA was always a score pinata
huh ok
and that looks annoying to recover
it was linked to my old phone number
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i lost my acc
o ok
rimestar is back?
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
1500 is a little high for s2 yeah
oh thanks
video without moriso commentary please
can i get an uhhhh
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
isn't that a remix of HoH theme from last chapter of ER?
thats kinda nut
is there an anni every year?
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
my phone sucks
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
shit don't run on mobile
<:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
cause i'm lazy to dl the game
i mean i can make it, i just don't wanna
no
this was my last lobby
like 10 min before it close?
of my lobby
did you see my screenshot
yeah causei  fucking forgot
it's sinful 2
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
wanna do it for me?
<a:pepeMeltdown:933941237021569035>
i don't have honkai installed in the laptop
is abyss close today?
wait shit
before 3s you need to run shit for sp tho
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
2s MA
and by that i mean, for the best gamemode ever made
well, i say best set for HoS dps
yeah
it's kinda busted, yeah
if you were 3s
sirin asc was also best set for HoS dps
<a:TheVoices:1124893972481974342>
surprise me
i'm just letting mihoyo cook honestly
thoughts ?
CN lucia
galo kiana
lio mei
my promare collab plan would be
like i mean maybe
aina doesn't do shit tho
i don't really get what they're cooking waist up on her
yeah it's definitely galo's pants
yeah galo is the one that is closer color-wise
HoF is lio tho that's clear
and she ain't look like either of those to me
this is galo and aina
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm gonna be honest i have no fucking clue who CN is supposed to be in that promo art
that's aina?
really?
????
that's my suggestion
all one word
you should be ashamed
you really did cut off carv as he was laying out important info huh
i was looking for clean erotica
glad they specified
i really like buying games
but i still spent more on steam i think
i whaled a fuckton on gacha
unironically tho
tell her i'm spending
oh bet
i mean maybe they cook something out
ain't no way they're kicking ly or jk from general team
i mean if ice it's definitely dps no?
rookie mistake
you forgot the 12 week long ayaka banner part 2
2.8
can you guess what patch is in september
why are they up?
those go down tho
aw
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
horns?
are those
just like i'm about to
then you watch it 4 times
cause you don't have the budget right?
+2
huh
so it can happen
wendy is venti
maybe
well i mean
based i think
no girls that fight
like, for honkai
promare doesn't really have great character for collab
the 4th was going to be the one with you zei and marchy but we could just watch on the minicord one instead
one here, one in blustorm, one in minicord
i think so
i'm organising like at least 4 i think
since it's required viewing for honkai now
a watchalong of promare then?
are we doing
bronies?
so
you know that right?
that we can't have nice things
it's because of peoplel like you
agree ?
hof adv + lio hof pyramid 6.9
lmao
jaysonpilled
but ok
1 message above yours
we're literally talking about it
no flame tho
they could be saying I AM RETARDED DON'T LISTEN TO ME and you'd go huh some valuable part of the community has noticed some trends
that sounds like a skill issue on your part
what are you, a cop?
nunya business pal
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
so i just thought i had to do it really well for the game to let me out
cause i didn't see the portal to leave
on the last one, where you have to do full team rotation, i remember spending 20 minute on it
and it remind me the first time i ever did valk trial
i'm doing trio trial
who's people
who the fuck is saying that
she has the great sword
is it?
it's lio HoF, the neon fire could look pretty cool
maybe they look better with vfx
if those are the 2 skin i'll be a little disappointed tho
yeah probably
maybe just skin?
unless? <:Shyggers:1113819313145659422>
cause promare doesn't really have big female chara
i'm assuming no valk
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
what does this collab entail, specifically
as in, next patch?
wait huh
that's sick!!!!
holy fuck i'm so hype
that's fucking awesome
oh shit!!!!!!!!
more info please?
<:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
i can't see shit
i'm gonna clear forbidden so hard
i'll have to learn how to play the game again
me too honestly
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
riot games balancing
<a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206>
v3f
wait is it supposed to be out?
rofl even
lmao
they didn't give an estimate to when the book was going to happen either, so all we had was the confirmation that it was going to happen
just very excited
i mean yeah i wasn't mad or anything
i was holding on to the screencap of them promising the artbook like my life depended on it
3 months until we got it
and it took like
when CN got it, they mentioned that we would get it too eventually
we all got it later, how did y'all forget?
not even a real loss
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
are you getting crit dmg or not?
like at all s0 on avg team
it goes either way
like idk how often on normal team and gear
does it also fuck with the inverse?
and i have the same amount of END as you
like look at me, my feathers growing back, my life is so chill
have you guys considered quitting
me neither
agreed
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and i quit after 6.1
cause i have it
obviously it's 6.1
i'm like was it 6.1 or later
oh wait idk why i'm confused about when was our book
i love that meme
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
instead of otherwise
i'd assume it'd be the same way
i'm just saying that given the previous occurence
i mean i'm not saying it's not happening
idr the actual patch
for it
we had like moon ow tasks
we got it like 6.1
CN was 5.9
overseas, fuck no
JP got it same patch
no we didn't
really?
prob like cny next year or smth
we're not getting book on 6.8 right?
just pull 2 set
like HoS had good sp gen but she made all of phys based around on HoS sp gen, anything help a ton
maybe, i wouldn't completely ignore sp/s tho
3s tank
where that sp/s save my life
like HoS there was a fair few strat
well, sp/s definitely can still matter even for high sp cost valk
oh i thought you were talking about spcr
that's not the issue tho, the issue is the sp refill she has like you said
me next?
i think ruby is asking for a bottom surgery
historically, it's also not been day 1
cause all i saw day 1 was the login event
it's definitely not on release
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
5 pull there tho
idk if there's more
7 day login event
<:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
i saw it with my own 2 eyes
yeah
i didn't watch it cause i don't care so idk how accurate it is
i saw this
yeah
there is like a 5% of people who actually read
15%
me not included cause i admit it
literally what 80% of honkai player already does but is too cowardly to admit it
what's FR doing in main story?
the mirror of kia mei ely
so it's like
okay
does seele also like bronya?
that's what i expected
and is bronya hype about this
was it a secret before that there were 2 seele
okay so someone explain me this
you won't
do it pussy
so close
<a:NOOO:844609807675162685>
what can we truly be sure of
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i don't get it yet
so does she or not
wait
L
<a:peepoTrip:755692813320060959>
everyone knows we can't make melt valk
that'd be broken
especially now that they did kiana
they could just go back to 3 elf, but i think 2 elf per year is healthier
that's just a vibe tho
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
and i think this year they'll do 2 elf
but then last year they did 2 elf
yeah, ever since release, they did 3 elf per year
and it rolled badly
yeah a random intern picked it by accident
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i think 2 elf per year is what they're doing from now on
i'm pretty confident no elf tho
it's what they did on hof year
i mean i don't doubt that, i just think cheap -> standard s-rank is more likely <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
peak design
5k word kit so you can qte and leave
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:998328905561804830>
sp -> sp -> sp -> sp
but i mean maybe
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> mihoyo that made FT doesn't feel like 2023 mihoyo
<a:peepoTrip:755692813320060959>
especially when 7.0 is cn anniv
i mean yeah, but 6.9 is cheaper valk, i don't think they're doing cheaper valk -> cheaper valk
unless 7.0 is s + wt
if hua is 7.0 she won't be wt tho
6.9 is guaranteed cheaper valk, wt would work
yeah that's my guess too lowkey
6.9 wt is your guess?
<:Fishinge:1003783201875054732>
that color is more like you
what was it?
do you want the nsfw ones?
is there even any role you want?
there u go
oh yeah eli, you weren't here for it i think, tet made a thread on <#1062434039186870392> for the concept art leaks if you wanna peruse
leak didn't you see the art dumps? they're putting a ton of effort, they're just saving it for the art book
i wonder why they're going that route
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
they're less different, i'm sure they still put a lot of effort
i dunno if i'd use the word quality
oh ok
wait was it the piss one?
was it better than the piss one?
you guys got an FR skin?
hire me mihoyo
people would've paid for both
and then release neon later
they should've made the summer one paid
they kinda troll on releasing it first
summer cat is nice but it's worse than neon
oh wait you specify summer, yeah i giga agree then
yeah i like cat, besides that i think i agree
i did end up getting it tho
everyone was <a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078> over it
yeah back then i think i was the one with the worst opinion of that skin out of everyone here
SI did
genshinpilled
6.0 mini spending was SI beach skin
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
why's everyone so surprised over this spending
yeah that's how mini spending works
the flower is so plump
they can't really wriggle out of it
yeah sea/cn anniv falls on 7.0 <:okk:1058108494995263539>
,qdel 1903477
,qdel 1902659
fuck
this?
<:peepoJail:1044032426516693102>
especially when it's time limited event
i don't think they ever steal those game market, if anything they might help
yeah, and honestly i have no issue with it
one of the big things about hades was the sheer amount of content there is, like conversations you can have with people at your home
not a bad thing tho, hades slaps
in the files, the ER character are all named as RogueGod <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
like how after every run, you go back to one spot and talk with the people there, having a certain number of gods that gives you buffs and there's more the further you go in the story
like everything by itself is very normal for roguelike, but the implimentation is extremely similar to the way hades does it in specific
a lot of it is really similar to hades in specific, though yeah it's prob hard to actually point to hades for plagiarism
it being a battle royale tho weighs heavily in my mind as for fall valks being inherently very different
i guess i don't know too much about fall guys tho, so i can't see if there's some like, really similar stages
that's kinda surprising i think, like lowkey, ER/hades and dice event/dicey dungeons are more similar than fall valks/fall guys
really?
though it doesn't really surprise me that they heavily, heavily base their stuff off of some other games
damn that's kinda insane honestly
which is interesting too, but i'll have to wait and see it
i do think that effect is better than 3 times only, it looks like they're toning down her sp gen so you actually have to play the valk
yeah, i noticed that
i feel like everyone saw it a mile away
why even wait for v2 to do this
yeah weird stuff
excited for very normal reasons
<a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
cool
when are patch?
but iirc it is worded as +100% crit rate
well actually it matters how it's coded, cause we can't really believe in mihoyo wording <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
basically mean she always get capped on cdmg from that passive on ult tho
since it's 1:2, it'd become 160% cdmg, but there's a cap i think
so 80% of that crit rate will be turn into cdmg
so she'll have 180% crit rate on ult
her ult has +100%
so say PE on that team has base 80% crit rate
it'll calculate cr with all buff
so like
<:wokejj:1118547247567745164>
it's time
maybe i have too little to do
<a:KeiloTheBear:1002644779441598585>
the other example was HF -> HoT
and also like what, 4 year ago?
which is, untrue
like how SN replace SP
but they went well that's what mihoyo does to A-rank
yeah that's what i said <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
they also thought she'd be bleed dps, to replace HN
i think they're just too old and aren't used to the way current mihoyo does things
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
someone being smugly wrong online is my kryptonite
because i'm very petty i actually read the kit for once to prove them wrong <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and then they went very smugly like i expect, a dps that doesn't need HoS, she's worse than HoS as a support
i've been saying that HoS was getting replaced soon, and someone was very confident she wasn't, and when her kit reveal, i went hah told you she's in the bin
prob like around 100 or so?
i don't remember how big jizo hitcount shield is
i see yeah, that is pretty nut i think
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
someone was being stupid online so i had to use the text to prove them wrong
guess i'm not illiterate anymore
i did read all of her skill in the end
yeah that
from that ref, it look nut
i saw the skill, but just from reading i couldn't tell how big it was
SI alone definitely doesn't do that much
hore also has a fuckton of hitcount too tho, apparently
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that's true
one of the biggest issue i ever had with 3* dudu was tank cap, just not possible without 4*
yeah that's kinda cringe then
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
oh i see
well, it would be a reasonable assumption, but that's not how it is
that is a common wrong take for some reason
i mean can't blame one too much since they barely run phys boss without shield this patch <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
idk how good prom tf is, maybe worse than SI
maybe it change when hore since prom won't contest buff with HoS, but give that ref, maybe not
prom is when shield
no, SI kept her place as generalist phys support
what the fuck
damn that hitcount is nuts
i saw a 2 second tank with hore too
she has sick TF too
SI just better when no shield
idk about that one
either is fine but i'd prefer going for the newer one
i think i still stand by it tho
<:KianaDumb:909232418052014171>
skill issue on my part
oh i misread
<:Truege:1114141621022375997>
like the fact they skip HRT release to pull END kinda already tell me they don't care about optimise their acc
so they can also just pick whichever they think would be more fun
if they're not looking to be perfectly optimal though, i don't think either of them is a bad pull
maybe they can pull hrt on 6.7 and then afford 1/4 seele on 6.8, and then how much that's worth would depend on seele state
but it can also depend on a lot of other thing
i wanna say as a meta player, i would value seele more than hrt
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
surely there's only 2
yeah 2
that was a fun OW tho
i didn't even get to ch2 of moon arc
yeah i didn't skip the story
nvm
i look it up, it's bronyas mom
oh wait
idk tet is just gaslighting me about new characters and i'm believing it
isn't hare also a child tho
stop!!!!!!
i'm the one who's kissing her!!!
tet hare is mine
is it even a cook off when one of them is cooking meth
lil bro are replying to a message just to talk about something completely unrelated
mihoyo be getting on that chatgpt shit to make their chat look more active
nah there's no way
if it's at most tie cap it's sick
i'm torn between thinking it's sick and not liking it
don't tell me
that ain't cap, right?
hak says you should kill yourself, now and gets scot free
ruby says i love bleed and gets insta muted
i wanna see where he goes with this
let him cook
actually
that look pretty nut
she really is, it's true, look it up
now you're venturing into podcast territory
<:pogg:1060649334489743431>
woah she's the first valk who is bronya but like different and uses gloves instead of cannon!
that's kinda nice though, so innocent, like a small kid learning about all the wonders of the world
can you say they're wrong tho
<:HOPIUM:864973200738877490> she still has a niche
HoS simps coping
+infinite crit damage on ult now
doesn't PE get like
isn't that so wrong though
what?
using impair units?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and that everyone is doing the same
lil bro act like he bald 40 hour every phys abyss for max crit
and it's so common
actual the most braindead take ever
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
if you have 4* dudu i'd be chill with skipping
and there have been a ton of ref which i'd sacrifice damage for the lower cd
like i had only 3* dudu cause my spending decisions aren't smart
if you ahve 3* dudu
lowkey i'd consider 2* punny
i mean yeah
expensive patch
yeah 3* pretty big still
not damage taken tho
you get 4.5% phys and 6% tdm
oh wait i'm stupid, there are 3* team buff
but it's kinda nut her value at 2* rn
not that that's surprising
as it stand, pb probably ties if not beat kiana as the best elf for budget player
like titans titans titans warwick 2 nasty
3* and 4* pb are all personal damage output increase
looking nasty
but from 2* and 3* dudu
she's prob going to be a meh upgrade from 4* dudu
her 2* value is kinda nuts
and the elf cd red
both max damage taken
yeah apparently
if so, pb is like a turbo upgrade from 2 and 3 star dudu, even at 2*i think
so i assume it's by default
moriso has set blank
yeah okay
what's dudu again?
even if just slightly
everything else i have no doubt is just better
so it depend on how low pb cd gets
cause 4* dudu cd is like 3 seconds
the only thing that matter really is her cd
also, i can't tell anything about pb
which are like a bunch of smaller hit
instead of most other elf
cause it's one big hit
they can but for BE is especially bad
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
cause BE has to crit too
yeah lowkey some MA strat run BE and it's even more bald
weird ass pri passive
DMG, CD and SP cost depends on character equipped, all team members restore 10 SP upon exiting field in Herrscher form
yeah
so you can like, spend 5 second on whore, swap valk, you get 21s
but it refresh when you swap valk
long as fuck
isn't that like
wait it's 16s and refresh on valk switch
When Combo chain hits an enemy, or when you use Weapon chain, enemy will be impaired, def reduced by 50%, if the enemy has [Withering Gap], def reduction increased to 75% for 16s, can be refreshed when another character enters the field, this effect can only refresh at most one time.
like ult is +30% crit rate for team for fun
idk, i think she has a fuckton of cr on her kit
if you don't have enough crit rate
she'll int your crit damage
100% critrate no matter what
oh she is literally
When Herrscher of Rebirth hits enemies with [Withering Gap], if the hit reaches 100% Crit Rate, gain additional 2% Crit DMG, for every 1% exceeding Crit Rate, gain 2% Crit DMG, max 60% Crit DMG. If said hit does not reach 100% Crit Rate, convert 1% Crit DMG into 1% Crit Rate instead, until it reaches 100% Crit Rate, max 50% Crit DMG can be converted.
inb4 v2 move everything to stig <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
only v1
well
honestly that's really nice
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
unironically tho every skill of her is like does x y z and 10sp
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
SSS: When Time Fracture is triggered for the first time, gain 50 sp
shitting out sp
my girl is just
When Combo Chain hits an enemy, gain 25sp. If the duration of Ultimate Domain Expansion is less than 16s, it will be extended to 16s. Each Ultimate Domain Expansion can be extended at most one time, and when this effect is triggered, gain 25 sp.
when max HP exceeds 3000, for every 10 exceeding HP , enemies on the field receive +1% Total DMG from Herrscher of Rebirth, max 31%.
yeah on dps mode
and mode 2 to kill MPE
so you pick mode 1 to kill HoS
mode 2 is tdm on mech, hp, just general dps shit
like, mode 1 is the sp one that i share, where she get 120 sp 3 times
if this is your starting mode, do x
but she has skill like
by tap ult
you can
depending on which mode you pick to start as
she has an interesting gimmick, she has basically a toggle on her skills for dps or support
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
for the people who were worried about sp issue
When Herrscher of Rebirth triggers Global Time Fracture, if her SP is below 120, it is then increased to120 SP, CD: 25s, can only be triggered 3 times throughout the entire battle.
also
new valk is just i am everything and also benefit from everything
like just who cares about what multiplier mean
why even bother
man this is so cringe
DMG dealt by summoned entity counts as Herrscher of Rebirth attacks, and Herrscher of Rebirth can get [summoned entity] multiplier effects.
i'll pull big bro hours
as soon as i get home i'm degen tft
for the end of semester
i just finished the presentation
same
like know if she's HoS replacement?
what do we even care about tho?
i'll skim it
uhhh
is turbo stupid <:okk:1058108494995263539>
doing everything right and losing a run cause i deal ice damage instead of lightning
i love balding but not when bald is literal roll of dice
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i might come back
doing what i said? remove phys crit?
wait are they actually
crit rate?
fourth upon a time in shenzhou
like for the 4th time?
once upon a time in shenzhou?
wait a book?
no it's something else
someone's wrong in the internet and i'm very mad about it
i gotta prove someone wrong
when kit?
show this to pgr player
i've seen them
toriel's tits is so huge
undertale absolutely has boobs
so we can figure out the average
measure the boob of every woman of every game
we should
i wonder if that's true
idk why you asking me
yes actually
it's like breath of the wild
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
look at fucking genshin cherry
i can't think of anything else
like there's others but diona is so overwhelmingly powerful
and the only thing i can think of is diona
i think of annoying mihoyo characters
actually maybe that's fair
no one else in hi3 is annoying?
insane
now that's
i'm not here white knighting LY, burn the witch if that's what you want
i mean i guess if she's annoying that's fair, and when i said that you picked her as a witch to burn that's fine too <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
so idk where you draw the line
like she's really mid but y'all love other exactly as mid characters
i mean i'm not offended that y'all hate her i'm just confused
i believe that
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like you hate her so much you're willing to kneecap your ice team for the next half a year
i mean we probably just speak different languages, you need like a LOT of hate for a character for you to skip support sp release banner in my books
she was picked as a scapegoat like a witch in olden times
from now on then i'll take it that LY lost on the hate roulette
???? okay
the persona 4 villain
isn't achi like
like i don't like LY either but my standards are higher than yours, y'all like genshin characters and shit
the problem might be from the inside
y'all are like why doesn't mihoyo make villains playable anymore and then a character shows some dislike towards other character and you go i hate her
that's a stupid reason
wait is that the reason? that the character dislikes the one you like?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i don't get your standards
why do y'all hate LY that much
<a:KeiloTheBear:1002644779441598585>
and had to walk back to shill properly
they tried to do something fun
it's a worse turg for other valk
it's pretty big for kira but rn not for anyone else <:okk:1058108494995263539>
now it just has an extra optional condition for flavor
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> that's so stupid, lowkey v1 would've been more interesting than v2
none of them are even close
cause like i checked my valk
does the stig like by itself give 1k hp for fun per piece or smth?
oh i see
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
MA knowledge is permanent in my brain, i don't think that's a good thing
and the effect is like if you have 6k or your name is light yagami from death note, you get max buff
and no one has 6k hp
but they made it so it requires like 6k hp to get max buffs
v1 it was better turg
i'm pretty sure no, though
on who
<:A_HuClown:795116510636408852>
actually yeah it honk
it honk?
872
most sane honkai player
<:lewd:959737567119556618>
also yeah light yagami
jingwei mostly?
<:RemHighFive:752716894544330812>
i don't see any LY ref
i think everyone ran the 936 with HoT that week <:okk:1058108494995263539>
like there's not a lot of seconds to even save
i mean don't hold your hopes so high
lightning was 936
with ice team
9s cap was 904 with turbo fps scam
ranks?
i'll look around for you
o actually yeah you should be right
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
has tank happened in 6.7 yet?
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
nty
that's just serval
i'd really like 3 but
i like 2 and 4 the most, i love the lighter colors on the hair
lumi petitioned this
if i was dumber i'd argue but no one would call hua fugly
good bait
literally all of them
so naive
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
what else did you think it'd be
<a:peepoTrip:755692813320060959>
i'm also high this week
the name is cute but the abbreviation sucks
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and 2s WE
it's also funny that they run 3s hoh
i think that's full bastet RC
if they pull shit like that, i wonder if they actually expect player to read
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> what the fuck is that
maybe for you
p sure no
the code don't matter if you don't stick around and do 2 weeks of mission
but they give 6 extra even
you only need 4
10 free pull is so nice from mihoyo
that's like tomorrow
<a:PANIC:1069826466889605201>
hope that helps
i have no clue
i can answer you though
that would be so nice
yeah
like a text channel to keep track of all banners
you know what would be a great thing to add to this server?
crazy that you ask that
who are you cheering for?
<:dongerj:1054201011201376306> the t1 in br rn is at 2k lp
not bad
they're 5th, 6th and 8th <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
DobZ, Gvidigal, vclf
there's 3, i dunno any of them though
and i like the ant song
i never actually watched any of his streams, but he's the only one i know the name of
i'm like torn between cheering for setsuko and not <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
true this is important, only twice per year <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
still in the middle of classes but maybe i watch it muted
wait that sounds fun
<:pauseCat:1064950487486582784>
that sounds sick, what's soul link though
that'd be neat
maybe she relies on the support that released on the patch before
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
sounds promising
<:RamHighFive:752716794783072288>
up top
am i right?
the massive cope is pulling LY
rhapsody?
she should remain locked
you're a coward
if you skip the gear but play the valk
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153> easiest skip of my life
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153> pull LY on rerun if she's good
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153> LY dead content on release, don't even bother pulling
kinda slap <:okk:1058108494995263539>
cockroach seele, beast lili, danzai
good skins
hare costs twice as much as HN
no it ain't <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i'll just average it out from the 3 answers
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
<:okk:1058108494995263539> thanks for the hard work
is 3s aponia just called aponia
is there a translated crystallum name
is there a new story ch? does it have a translated name yet?
how CN is AI Hyperion Λ
maybe <:okk:1058108494995263539>
the names as in
wait no
yes
battlesuit name and pri name
i wanna know what hare and prometheus in game names are, for the actual character
can you give me some EN names <:okk:1058108494995263539>
6.8 6.9 7.0 prob
yeah they should be soon then
6.5? 6.4?
and then teri hua seele teaser?
kinda crazy looking back that it was so soon
yes
<:life:1001518241610485781>
the schedule is written in the stars
i made this
```
sp         (SNS, CN) -> 
discount s (SW, HRT) -> 
s + free s (PE + SpA, END + flamescion) ->
sp         (RC, HN) ->
s + sp     (DPe + GD, hare + prometheus) ->
sp         (SI, kira) ->
discount s (v2v, ?) ->
gacha s    (HoH, ?) ->
WT s       (JK, ?)
```
yeah i'll be really surprised if they don't release teri hua seele in 6.8 6.9 7.0
when was the teri hua seele teaser? 6.5?
for how long it take for teaser -> release
i want the precedent
yeah like
<@416445660443967491> are you in the beta?
teaser in 6.1, release in 6.3-6.4?
what patch did they tease trio?
this is like the fastest they moved on from a system
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
she's PC
i've decided on my abbreviation for hare tho
DW is a cool abbreviation
hare and prometheus battlesuit, hare pri
?
for 6.6 stuff
does anyone have EN names
pull 3 sets of kira <a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
it is time
but we got the turg replacement
we thought we got the RC replacement
no real surprises really, she looks like a better RC and that's it <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that looks more about what i'd expect in a rotation
vice president
al haitham expy and it's just teri
i saw the name color and i thought that was nini <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
çlym is <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> ???
this is the first time i talk about fucking honkai character in a few weeks i think <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it was unintended all this time
mihoyo has read your message, they are now bugfixing pardo to reduce her sp gen
why does carv show up when i'm talking about stuff like this
i mean i don't need to find her awooga hot to be down
she's kinda cute
i'd fuck kira i think
maincord ain't brave enough
someone gotta do it
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
like 2 or 3
<:peepoHandsUp:1002644855593381898>
yeah kinda boring patch
is this what maincord is cooking?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:Oldge:1006451665110564905>
HoH tutorial also ran buff out
for cutscene
they should take note from gsr and enable 2x animation speed
i dunno, is it?
but i appreciate you trying
taihen that is so unhelpful you have no idea
but ok
that's fucking boring as hell
so on trio she just get a different ult?
<a:Essayge:1084932331766304829>
BB because when i try to use her my heart stops
kira, dumbass
if it's only in MA then it isn't time stop
kinda nuts
the first non-S rank with time stop
oh whoa i didn't realise that
i try to watch ref to understand, she never does the swipe swipe thing in trio team so i assume she doesn't
i genuinely do not understand how trio works
do you even use that ult in trio?
nvm
why don't you support my team by killing y
you're so smart tet
yes, HN my favorite support
you get to press a button 3 times
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
kira's cutscene is the closest to the most interactable one yet
bamboo
The Bad Part
transition? idk the thing between phases
i already know it's shit from that
<a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206> they cut out the intermission from the vid
it looks very railroaded
from how that look, i wouldn't call it awkward
cool
she does force rotations pretty hard tho, are you forced to switch to her once you qte her in?
<:worrySniperAngry:920552131642142741>
i think having a few punching bags is fun
i kinda vibe with it <:okk:1058108494995263539>
oh that boss looks actually pretty fun
i like the cat ears
is that even a realistic fear
what are they scared of
honestly, i don't get why they don't give nyx the powerboost from new support
good morning <a:Wave:995380866832420994>
<:KeiloSit:1101246919789002752>
i would spend that money if it was like that
but it doesn't matter if the guy you're tilting is not in the game anymore
that shit is turbo tilting
i would be down if it happened before the enemy was dead somehow
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i don't even think those chibi look that good
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
spend 100$ on something that's a sidegrade at best is nuts
but base skin is already so good
like it's not bad
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
yes
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
herrscher skin is downgrade from default
once again
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i changed my mind
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
do i get the free pulls too
you think she has enough hitcount on qte to replace HB on nyx team?
weird that they wanna keep that mechanic alive
<:life:1001518241610485781>
sin mal
<:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
the end score is higher but your suffering is the same
it doesn't get more bearable
take it from me
some are still as awful
not all boss is walk in the park once you have the gear and valk
no i say this because i do understand
that respect your time more
go play better game
then retire <:okk:1058108494995263539>
you're the one who has to do it
i can't quit for you
<:Shrug:616394597211439118> is it going to change anything
that's so paper
what even, you get away with doing 1/3rd of your rotation?
and now i see RL ref and i'm like
you need to ult on everyone to kill the mob? what the fuck is that shit?
when i first saw nirv ref i was like
i think it's funny that i've gone the opposite
but that's true
yeah, i do think the one singular horse was better overall
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
you shouldn't be happy about it even without the changes
sk just kinda sucks ass
that makes sense
s0 who do you think wins out?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> alright nevermind
that's fucking cringe
what really?
just less bald is the result i think
they changed the mob in SK but it wasn't really for shill i'm pretty sure
<:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
DPe top scoring kallen is a bit unexpected but it is honkai 2023
yeah you got it
you're going to regret being happy about it
SK isn't fun even when you're strong
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
you two are so fucking stupid
i hate this subject
i wonder how well i can do on the test if i only study during the commute
entirely skill based, balanced game for all skill levels
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
do good games even exist
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
isn't that what everyone does
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
that makes sense, beta prob just do mech and cdmg so it don't matter
maybe they just did all crit tho
since beta player use max affix
that prob means hare is a good amount stronger than we thought
based
that's a pretty good foca1 i think
criiinge
hotfixing a valk so she works better with new valk
cringe
it's not like it's taking away something better that would be there otherwise
like it's just additional bad option it wasn't there before
but like it's not straight up a scam i guess
yeah it's a huge fucking bait
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
bundle that come with other stuff right
those are like
jesus fuck
<:majj:1067071761142796418>
yeah where is marisa
and said can't have that can we
mihoyo heard me praising them about making a weather with good alternative
still looks awful <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
she's summoned entity weather, right?
okay that makes more sense
why doesn't GC clear shield by herself
what dist is even that
that looks fucking depressing
shui dracula shui (figure it out dipshit)
okay
shui dracula shui, BTM respectively
that'd say ely b dante tm
that would mean you'd be a psycho though
you could
is what bke uses
dante tm ely b
<a:2Dvanish:799535754656612352>
no
moriso never lie
according to my buddy moriso, hare only receive buff
if you have the game dl you could test <:KanaSmug:746141929200418826>
maybe i'm misremembering, i just remember it being a good but not great signet on her
she could is what i remember
so she only get half
but they're not the ones who actually deal damage
i'm pretty sure the king and queen count
TP and BKE
well, the 2 main cope still works
i really doubt it came to a surprise to them that anyone could use some of the buff in the weather
cause everyone could run SI
everyone could already use the weather
i mean
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
that summon weather is now fucking disgusting
that's a nasty b ver
oh
impair support, rip HoS puller
i knew prometheus was powercreeping HoS
punishment for your sins
wdym wrong boss last time? this is just what overseas get
kinda gigachad if they double down and do the fucked up version again
very non elegant
adding impair to support so she can deal damage before big rot is kinda like
they really want GC to deal good damage huh <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
c deez nuts lines?
you gotta pick one
qua valk ain't allowed to be good normal valk is all
oh i'm not talking about community reception
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
you know what would've happened if she was good as qua
does it really
nevermind old valk rank up
when i know they can't cause they don't even afford current release
as if they're suffering from it
people be complaining about it right now <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
like yeah that sucks but only matter for most player like 2 year after release
that barely matters for avg player though
her issue is everything else <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
like on straight performance you can't really fault her
i'm so flabbergasted she's not that bad y'all
everyone hates on nyx so bad for no reason
the most dps right
ice has like
since the last piece can be so expensive
like the value on using one of those cards to 3/4 -> 4/4 a valk you have is SOOO big
and even those i already valued pretty highly
it's a lot better than past card spending
you can say it sucks for you, but the gear it offers is great for people who don't have it yet
it kinda slaps for what it is
it's a mini spending
that sounds right, such a bait
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and in the past you had to buy bundle to get even those
you're right though, aren't you, it's like 1500 for the 2 black card
that's fucking stupid LMFAO
actually?
cause i didn't get free card
is for me!
<a:peepoMoney:853289208809783328>
yeah you're gonna need it
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
like the RC one
you can even get a good outfit
gronya cunny i assume
even if you skip hare you can prob make a dent on the spending just from prometheus supply since your pull get a lot of value there
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
honestly given everything, not a bad patch
that's a good card spending
SN + AE
we had that before
azure balls again?
wait
investment last 1 patch
dupe aladdin puller livin like dupe cez b puller?
oh type SK whole new stage too, not only just mob change
cool
whoa
i don't think that's how using a new engine works
yeah
i prefer the stig over the skin now <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
maybe that's why they don't make more outfit based on stig as much as we ask
the horn really break it for me
yeah
vibe check: do people think hare design is actually a banger
<:teahouse_1:954271429275320330>banger
<:teahouse_2:954271471067332638>pretty good
<:teahouse_3:954271524523769867>average
<:teahouse_4:954271564424183828>below average
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
nah i was just complaining about them writing text and then it not mattering later
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
hare weather look good for alternatives <:okk:1058108494995263539>
don't think anyone is doubting you on that one
i mean
based
it's an honour
i'm talking with the only player in NA to try SI dps
like i gotta
nah i'd believe it
for everything
going to do SI dps
back in 5.8 or w/e it was
weren't you like
only two ways to get full load is perfect block and qte
idk so stupid to make up these mechanics while clearly not intended for anyone to interact with them
it's just like
yeah
but yeah
you're tapping at the right time either way
i mean realistically though
at the right time
no, you just need to release to get the perfect
yeah it's the same
that's exactly like dk
no
oh
lmfao
it's stupid
70 points per second is like 5 seconds just holding dodge for full charge
hold evasion is still really really slow
that's the way i thought it was, from hold evasion
i mean
yeah specially ranked up HoS
is that it?
hmmm
you let her take the shield
yeah i think in situation you run prometheus
shield stonks
like with paga m shield multiplier and actually decent damage
if you run alt strat like mpe or something, and you break shield with dps, you won't have that much issue i think
i think she only has such high shieldbreak% because it's personal shield break + she doesn't do that much damage
don't think it's that bad honestly
ok
and then you get to to qte and ult and it's like apply everything
it's like first 4 sections is really interesting gimmick with various methods to build up, different buffs applied differently and tiers of buffs
it's more of what i say, don't even bother reading the skills, it's useless
just lock it to qte
like why even bother
you need to do unironically 4 attack strings to max charge
yeah that's so little
only realistically usable on qte
when it's literally just
why even have a mechanic
it's kinda dumb
and like of course on qte it comes filled
like on the gameplay, they try filling bar by normal gameplay
yeah i saw the bar, it's kinda stupid at this point
oh i see
oh she has the sns/sw/jk thing
why
<a:ninomaedumb:873903459961823272>
maybe try later?
it says Currently locked only for top tier gamers
yeah, there's a pop up at the top though
design team working over time to come up with those
When Hare's summoned entities are present on field, all enemies take +5% more Total DMG.
Enemies take +14.5% more Physical DMG from Hare (independent effect).
very boring
her independent multipliers are
that kinda thing
but the lower cd on evasion cdr reset, that only matter on niche occasion
like 3s PE is just straight up +20% tdm, that always makes a difference
if you don't need it, it won't make a difference
it's not a straight dps buff, it changes your rot
it either matters or it doesn't
i mean it's the kind of thing where like
about average as far as ranks go from that, if s1 is something like independent multiplier i'd think she'd need at least that to beat ranked BKE on neutral weather
s2 is initial sp, 2s adds a lot of damage to finisher which is probably pretty big
3s look potentially big, unlock new rotation so that always is kinda dangerous
i don't s1, 2s1, 2s2 skills but rank up look meh
book report: hare does damage
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
i'll skim it
uhhhh
imagine reading <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i don't, i'm not a nerd
i don't think we've ever had a beta with playable valk but skill/gear desc unavailable
i assume at least, they're playable
yes but no translation yet
i like it
can't say her animations don't look cool
3 hours is a lot of time
yeah i thought that too but i was letting you cook
one enemy change make the weather 40% less bald
so much better than ninja <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
that's like
oh
big bro it is
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
sriracha or smth
what was the EN name of the new qua boss in MA?
are you trying to tilt me
have fun
bye gresham <a:Wave:995380866832420994>
yeah hare is in an interesting spot for sure
<:crying:757445037402619974>
and it works
days are lies made up by the government to make you feel bad
yeah her burst dudes are summoned entity
i'm only not going through the rant cause i went through it literally yesterday in blustorm <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
L + ratio
i'm right you're wrong
it wouldn't and i'm not expanding on that
i won't be baited into my phys breach rant
kinda disgusting
more than a year in between phys releases
PE, but yea p much
i don't mind them paying more attention to phys
like it's pretty strong but content feels designed like 90% for elemental 10% for physical
physical feels left in the mud
the future of 3s MA
0s kill + annoying as fuck gimmicks
worst of both worlds
that would be so funny
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it's not like it'll be some shit like airborne/ignite
it's 2023, you know that whatever the valk that's supposed to be on the team does works
idk who cares
yeah, maybe they aren't ready to do an actual summoned entity dps yet
but i doubt you'll spend much time if at all on that form
like non-burst hare is what i expected and i think it's really cool
i was hype for an actual summoned entity dps, one that plays as such, but if you spend most of the time on burst mode
LMFAO complete opposite as tet
kinda boring that you just fight as her summon
and then i see shit like that and holy fuck
i like, look at HoT husk strat and go i wanna play that again
yeah keep showing me these
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
god what the fuck
yeah she looks awkward with old HoS
i'd think she'd be a little lower than SI baseline for now
hmmm that's surprising
that's kinda nuts
i'm guessing new HoS ult is going to be like 5 seconds longer or something
damn prometheus buffs are long as fuck
you can see it more clearly here, she is up on the cocoon yea
<@309634550273933314>
summon
hmmm in performance you mean?
you could reset it and annoy him
you know
steal taihen acc, bring him back here and use it here <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
for 7tr
update it
<a:Goose:646989706470490142>
<:honkStonks:794321489292689449>
every time i tell it to someone it gets laughs
there's no equivalent in portuguese, and it always comes off so funny
i love the rent free bit cause
living rent free in my head
those aren't real valks
yeah okay
wdym there's non cop officer
i thought officer was only cop stuff
wait is it actually officer
officer sounds right
what's ceo even mean
isn't that an anime
sex reviewers
yeah from the movies
i used to take omega pills
against bots you see
i've been playing training mode
soloq sex
frame 1 dodged
<a:KeiloTheBear:1002644779441598585>
i have the world record by accident
yeah i only do ranked
some might even say that i'm involuntarily celibate
same
i mean i think i have but i don't remember, sometimes my family buys block of ham and cheese
it's how cheese slices are made too
make like ham paper
wanted to like try the thinnest option on those
i've always
yeah as long as you believe in it
and then half of the stuff don't go anywhere <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
the first 4 chapters of honkai feel like
that's what like
they should've retroactively made LK sp valk
it's cool
and i get it
mihoyo writer just have a boner for repeating story
sure
you know, to fuck with you
just random girl
but she wasn't carole
she used the same model as carole
i think you're thinking of PE girl
or straight up broken at worse
to me, the rule for sp valk was already very messy at best
when they're using the current existing version of her as battlesuit
yeah and i don't think it's a bad thing, but it throw out of the window that cat gets to be sp because she's from past era
no, makes no sense for me
so she is from current timeline
because she has can, and can is from the sim
RC battlesuit is literally from this timeline though, you can't even pull off that it's a battlesuit from the past
but i will never get it
you can try to explain to me how carole and cat are somehow not really part of the main story
the rule was long broken
and as far as i was aware
look my iq is very low
of course removing the price isn't fair, she is cheaper, but i don't think it's right to sell her as like above average valk for lower price, she's average valk for lower price, and that's good enough already
i mean yea i agree with the price stand point, remove the fact that she's cheaper and she's around the same as most other dps though
it's just old player bias to a degree
for like RL player need, at least
like HN is quite versatile but i think most dps also are if you actually look into it
it sure is cheaper, but you underestimate how easy it is to promote RL with a random well invested team
i do agree with that, not necessarily with higher versatility though
but yeah they could
well, actually, i think more like flamescion style timestop
i mean yea they could
or the last valk without timestop on ult is DA
they either make up a new gimmick to give old valk for more dk revival
nah i mean DK revival until now has been p much new weapon so old valk have timestop on ult
like HoF on release, if you have HoF team invested you promote 80% of weather in RL
that's true for most dps valk if you have a well invested team
it's pretty much only DA
there's not many valk left
but i would prefer variety i guess
it didn't really get old to me actually
i don't think i like how literally every 3s boss was HoT boss for like 3 patches
all things considered i do think it improved how fun the gameplay was
yeah by HoT i mean 7tr too
fuck hot
in either case
actually
fuck hot
in that case
about HoT
i'm very conflicted
like yea she top scores it, but not because it's HoT shill, but because v2v blows at MA she can't top score her own shill
like i don't think anyone would call 3s kosma HoT shill
that's not really how most people use shill
honestly i have no clue when they'll decide to allow lv90
BKE every cycle
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
half of the bosses
BKE was unironically
it's because the first few patches of superstring
nah
like, of course we can say that she was a good investment now, with all the info we have after
but she was already around standard s-rank dps with hler and SA + HoS
she got astronomically more broken with AF and then pri
before AF she still had a place in the meta
nah i still disagree
but a good one
a smart investment? no
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
she wasn't good performance, but she was a good investment
fucking immortal valk
she was a good investment
but if you knew the future
i mean yeah with current info you had then, she prob wasn't the best investment
but it was
like, we didn't know that at the time
BKE was a good investment at release
i mean
literally every dps valk ever
i think s2 can 946 but it's one of the most fps scam strat ever
actually i think even 2s is too low
IO need 2s for 946 maru
what's 946 maru? HoT?
read or not read, doesn't matter when the text is wrong
illiterate player just keek winning huh
potentially fun week
i kinda vibe with how it looks actually
that looks nasty
that's interesting
oh really
they're always in the same place, right?
zxcv as each osu button
then you can just setup it up like
if you play on wasd jikl like a normal person
you can setup keybinds yourself tho
i love akane so much too, the way she generally acts is great
karashi just fucking shadowboxing for an entire arc, it's so fucking funny
i read it all from yesterday to today so i gotta think more about it to say for sure
it's def on my top 3 ongoing manga i'm reading
akane banashi
i'm going to simply believe that the author is going to keep the rivalries the way they stand right now <:Clueless:996308692133761094> , they feel like pressure for akane to improve herself rather than opponents for her to beat
i do enjoy how akane's deeply <:Clueless:996308692133761094> when karashi keeps trying to make him out as antagonistic to her
hmm yeah i didn't think about it like that but i think i def agree, i mostly like hikaru cause i feel like she also has a ton to grow too and i would enjoy watching that. i don't think i'd enjoy if it became more alike battle manga either, maybe reintroducting her could be a mistake if that's whats end up happening
i'll keep it spoiled even though it's not big stuff just so if people wanna read it, issa good manga
i really enjoy her character and i was really glad she was going to show up again, even though i felt like it'd be enough for her character in the story to not really show up afterwards
i fucking pogged irl when hikaru showed up in a recent chapter and called herself hikaru arakawa
that's kinda sick
oh wow he has a loooot of manga
i just think it's harder to find media that will reward you for that effort
i mean i'm not arguing with you, i think it's sick if you enjoy it
and some of them change the plot twist last second when they hear the community figured out the original twist
a lot of the time i feel like effort spent trying to figure out mystery can be wasted, some authors purposefully give you not enough info to figure stuff out so it feels like a bigger plot twist
though i usually currently care more about character growth and interaction than like lore mystery
i lvoe talking about stuff i'm reading/watching
i mean if you're reading the same stuff as me you can discuss with me
i think in general tho i've been learning to read slower and give more thought to each chapter recently
it kinda forces you to take the story in slower too, which can be nice
if you have a community to discuss new chapters is also pretty cool
i really like it cause i can read new chapters on commute to college
i think ongoing can be fun
nevermind LMFAO
in general it's not sad though
i only cried a bit on ch1 because i turbo connected with akane
maybe my standards are too low but damn
for manga too it's so mature i feel like
the way it's portrayed it really shows how much love the author has for it
but i'm very much into it, i can't comment for how accurate it is personally but it's really really interesting
though i guess i kinda understand, before reading i was like hmm i won't be too much into it cause i dunno anything about rakugo
yeah honestly i'm very very surprised it isn't waaaaay more popular
go back to that then <:elywhip:1002644839248183306>
yes if you combine a keilo point and an anti keilo point they explode and disappear
award her anti-keilo points
and <@781539392039682058> with stuff like what did i tell you about being nice
name my alt anti-keilo
i should be like
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
in 10 years?
maybe it's gone gone
i guess senti already isn't that though
but because i think fists playstyle is pretty cool and there's no one elese besides hua that does it
not because i think hua needs to use fists <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
that would make sense i guess, i think it would make me sad though
would old kiana be like
aw those youngins are so creative, i'm happy for them even though i don't understand or
i regret saving the world for these people to live in it
live honkai reaction and it's kiana sitting in the moon looking at tiktoks in her phone
do you think they'll do something gameplay wise to make up a theme for it
have we had any ahr valk before?
realistically i'd expect it'd to be more expensive than that
and i don't think mihoyo is going for best case scenario for players
that's like me going what would be best case scenario for players imo
that's not a prediction though
maybe 6.6 hua, WT teri
6.5 -> sp qua bleed
6.6 -> S-rank small spending
6.7 -> sp lightning something
6.8 -> WT valk card spending
6.9 -> discount supply
7.0 -> cn anniv seele, maybe double valk
i think best case scenario for player would be something like
but either way, we had HoH 6.0 cn anniv 6.1 before so who cares LMFAO
oh yeah i guess 2 patch diff is what we usually have for herrscher, she's prob like herrscher level of hype
i would usually say otherwise, she feels like a big character and it would feel weird if they released it a few patch before cn anniv
i should've answered oh there's a dev hour stream going on right now
when nini asked what stream those vids were coming from
oh shit god damn it
she's the only character
but if it's about power then yeah no it sounds right
i was going to ask what about the others
this is a fun one cause not even i know and i'm reading it
who are the main characters of part 2
also the kid's a girl
i won't spoil, though i guess i already did to some degree
the kid's called shizuka
takopii is a small alien octopus
like one of the tatsuki fujimoto's one shot mc is called fujino
i mean not saying that authors don't do self insert
it's ichinose-ke no taizai
taizai
their name is taizan 5
i dunno what that is <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i guess ichinose hasn't really made me cry yet
hmm but you're still hyped for new ichinose chapter?
did you read takopii yet
literally no lessons learned
day 2: what the fuck you mean this only has 50 chapter?
i'm like day 1: i'll only read if it's 50 chapters or less
but then i always choose to read short stuff to begin with
i was also thinking about how i always get upset when i run out of chapters to read
not that this is related about anything, i was just thinking about it
it kinda surprised me how mature some of the parts were
i read akane banashi from yesterday to today and i think it had a good influence on me
one day i'll be a better person so i hope you'll accept me then <:Prayge:909232418463047690>
i hope one day i'll be redeemed from the thing that i did, carv senpai <:Prayge:909232418463047690>
call me right wing cause that's my reactionary alt
oh shit i can use my alt to react
it dms me like youre supposed to follow up <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> 
i guess, it complains that i'm not using it properly though
afterwards
if i'm blocked i still can't react
i mean that's just nqn reacting
congrats ruby :D
sheeesh
not anymore <a:PU_smoge:931100738699005983>
but maybe actually the schizo at the end is carv himself
and we look like schizo
is some people talking to themselves
you know i joked before how all carv sees
by going you aren't supposed to know that yet <:sussge:968897150249484389>
there was the one time where i tried to warn heki off of leaks
oh you know what was probably it
yeah
actually i hope it's not from the old copypasta from 5.4 LMAO
i don't know why but honestly it was probably fair
oh carv blocked me
shut the fuck up she's still useful :copeless:
should i care? i don't think i watched a single pv since 6.2
wait there's a pv?
galaxy type this -> <:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
count time by honkai patches
i'm glad you fucking
this is from 5.4
Due to the vast influx of SP valks I have decided to leak the next few patches of SP valkyries

hork
me when i'm a dog but i'm also coughing
<:PeepoSitBASED:986284656586551366>
deadname the company like the rest of us
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
you're starting to call them hoyoverse
oh no you're spending too much around genshin community
that shit is cringe
stages like 3s parvati, rimestar
when it gets that bad on competitive content tho it makes me wanna not try
it's kinda like genshin exploration new areas run at 20-25 fps here and i don't care
cause like there was no actual competitive content
i honestly don't mind thaaaaat much that apho ran at 15fps here
it's like the wikipedia game but with foundry
i think one time i was stuck on armada screen because the back button was bugged and i gave myself a challenge to get to foundry from there
that's what i remember while game is uninstalled
shop -> foundry
inventory -> foundry
inventory -> select weapon that can become pri -> foundry
collection -> select pri -> foundry
universal mirage -> foundry
open shop -> dorm exchange -> open stig -> sources -> foundry
i think from the top of my head i can list 5
okay, let me grab there <:pantsgrab:959752209061527642> and then there, and then... whoa foundry again
you have 3 different ways to get to foundry
you grab 3 different player
i do think there's a charm for how fucked up the UI is
i mean but that's not related at all to engine upgrade
you gotta have a fucking stacked machine to run shit like rimestar stage on ultra
wdym? i don't think honkai needs much more than that, though making the game run better would be a higher prio to me
i don't think the community would survive double gacha s-rank patch tho
6.4 5.5 and 1.0 are the only patches where more than 1 s-rank released
i would be reeeeeeally surprised if she came before hua
i have no clue tho nini
yeah same for genshin, maybe i'll try to get back into it when fontaine drops
i mean in a way i really just wish i still enjoyed honkai and was still playing it
yeah same <a:PU_smoge:931100738699005983>
i'll start sending mihoyo bills for living in my mind rent free
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982> one could say i care a little too much for honkai for someone who retired
i wouldn't spend 3k usd on a notebook that's slightly better so they can replace it
i mean if my partner already had a great notebook that met all of their needs
mobi skin i would've prob bought if it was bchip
i wouldn't pay 9.6k xtal for what's an essentially sidegrade as far as visuals go
base HoF is so good already though
is it great? yeah
so like, HoF timerunner
but it's for how much you prefer it over base skin
it's pretty
like you gotta understand that that price tag isn't for how pretty the skin is
as a certified hua simp, that is barely an upgrade from base senti
the skin is nice but i wouldn't pay money for it
fixing one probably fixed the other, too
the bug was probably noticed for SW, and because they have the same skill, it would make sense that they would both have the same issue
both SNS and SW have skill that reduce switch cd after you qte them in
it's not that
huh that's kinda nuts
from the wording sounded more like sidegrade than buff or nerf
i was kinda worried i made the wrong call by calling it a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> buff but it look that way indeed, there was some small change on kit that i didn't fully understand
what even she score with 3s HoS?
that's on v3? that's kinda stacked
even if you had unlimited money, just from gacha animation
besides tho dorm gear supply doesn't even exist anymore, honkai would close before you had time to pull a piece of gear you want from normal dorm supply
i thought dorm exchange had all dorm supply gear
i don't think it is
we're not jp server
but like how else are you even supposed to get it if you want it
i prefer if they put it on crafting
i mean i like it
i'm becoming free of the honkai, no longer stuck in my head
i don't remember the augment name LMFAO
vd and bladestrike augment signature
how do you even get those weapons otherwise lmfao
it wasn't before?
feels like they are happy with her current state
they removed the tf from qte so maybe she's less overpowering on MA but honestly you -2 her scores and she still beats a lot of stuff so idk
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> buff
i'll take the hit and be the one to read
strange animal uber eats choccy
that sounds like a nature documentary vid on youtube
uber eats choccy
i mean kinda
i was baiting you out to make this meme but with me and heki
hi cherryyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
if you can't do it in honkai, that's skill issue bud
i can do genshin abyss with only one character
look i dunno what you're talking about
kinda open my eyes about it, bait valk
honestly they're so right
i see one (1) interesting niche stig on the niche stig gamemode and i go <:pogg:1035066559351226388>
it's kinda crazy, i'm like an abused child
you put that on KMB if you didn't have her 3s yet
it was used more often in the olden times
zhuge T, a niche stig
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
oh okay i thought it was sex 2 pay
actually i dunno if i wanna know what that means
s2p?
tbh ruby only enabled me, deep down i always wanted to talk like that
for her price as a 30 pity 10+5 banner she was incredible value
in actual performance tho, she's acceptable, p mid
her main issue was always that she suck to play, felt very bad and slow to do anything with her, and that she was actually really slow and any rot besides the first was just exponentially longer
on certain situation, she's pretty powerful, like if you only need to ult once
she's still not that bad
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
dist
500
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
people notice when it's their own culture
they have been since 1.0 genshin
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
better than dudu for ice
guess it didn't work tho
he was so done with the game i'm pretty sure he actually did cause it was one more reason for him not to come back
who wouldn't
yeah, he's a nice guy
and then whoever he gave his acc went oh didn't you notice, there was a rank up you forgot to activate, i did it for you
he didn't rank up cause he didn't want to rank scam
i remember when it happened, he had s0 HoF with enough frag for s1
he left his acc with someone else
fragile just came back a bit after
he and chy hyped each other to quit and then just did
half a patch
i mean yeah but he did retire for like
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
honkai doesn't deserve him
should've stayed retired
i simp
and he's good at the game
yeah fragile's takes are usually pretty good, and he's a cool dude too
fragile is so chill
that's a dia take
why do you hate fragile so much
but it's hard to compete with valk who doesn't need to bruteforce, especially if they're decent
she's just insane valk
like it goes to show how good HoT is at bruteforcing MA
before 7t, tona was nyx's even for s0
at 9s, nyx is better than 7t HoT
nah, 7t HoT steals from s0 nyx
9s nyx already beat HoT at tona
i mean is it that much?
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
she only look that broken on MA cause she's stealing boss from valk who suck and doing it properly
i don't even know if she needs a big nerf for MA
could go another extra valk in plan for 2023, and bp need to keep up
we went +10% valk from 2021 -> 2022
i think they might be speeding up release
but i also don't want you to get your hope up
i don't want to destroy your dream
no nyx-nya
L
i'm surprised no filler gear
i was kinda right <:pogg:1035066559351226388>
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it's ER
oh wait
i kinda doubt you'd even have duration issue on normal gameplay
16s is such long duration, and it's not like it was difficult to activate it
i wonder why that's even a thing
base kit was hit more heavily
stig look barely touched
yeah the nerfs seem really tame
that sounds awful
in masters i don't think i ran much stuff that was crit bald
actually disgusting
to kill
lightning damage on HoS chains
s0 PE literally needed
i remember the one HoV strat with LE HoS PE
good ol' huodou
rng often made me think why i was still playing the game
free
really doubt it'll be any bald at all
maybe it's a buff from 10% -> 30%, dev just typo it on v1
i guess
from watching the 9s gameplay, some rots she didn't even use it, most of her output look like it come from just bleed damage
how much of her damage output is her combo atk, tho?
i mean i guess the stigs is nice for eli then
what actually?
stig nerf doesn't look that big
than stig nerf
from what i'm seeing, her personal kit nerf look more impactful
is it?
i could be wrong but it's eli with seele
i don't think eli cares about nyx gear, given they already have 4/4 i'm p sure
for stamps
eli wanted nyx to be 6.6 bp
no
when are they adding that to MA
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
yea you got it
can you guess why
turnover rate for competitive player has been getting higher and higher
it's actually kinda recent
and that's kinda sad
still around
the number of NA day 1 nirv players
i think you can count on 2 hands
livin the dream
also don't get me wrong, i also feel like my acc is a baby acc, but i've been called out for being an old player many times by this point <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
dunno how the game has changed for more casual community
i do speak mostly for the competitive community, cause that's the one i was a part of
the turnover rate for new competitive player is kinda worrying
and i'm sure in other armada too
but like we've had ton of competitive whales hang around then leave in blustorm
there's some in blustorm aswell
pro tip: you can do it whenever you want
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
1 year in you quit
a month in you're already in exalted
4 month old acc is old acc nowadays
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
with the turnover rate honkai has nowadays
it is
i mean
i'm just a boomer i guess <:smoge:959781798181736478>
i'm sure stuff like team with HoS is similarly impossible to understand for beginner
and it might just be another step when the game was already thoroughly unparsable for newbies
should they care whether or not someone who isn't playing the game understand the game? <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
maybe it's a worthless criticism tho
it's so much bs
for trio gameplay it's just pretty colors
but idk some older valk even with a lot of stuff going on you can kinda parse it visually
i mean i'm sure when you go and play it you can understand it quite quick
my eyes fucking glaze over, i have no clue what the fuck is going on
cause i don't understand and i'm not a bad player, and i've watched a good amount
i am convinced it's impossible to understand trio gameplay without playing
cause i sure as fuck couldn't see them actually doing the autos with the fuckton of effects and elf ult and shit like that <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
there was a ref where i literally had to go okay so they're not using skill asap here, and they're not a bad player so it's probably not a mistake, so they're probably doing some autos to stall + sp
you can really tell how much of a priority being able to understand what the fuck is going on is for the design team
wow i'm glad they went with the current design, which is famously way less confusing at a first glance
pretty sure it just has some time fracture
<@180679257851166721> you think they'll change bleed weather back to bleed deals +x% more damage?
fuck crit
i'm down actually
oh
that's interesting
huh glut T aladdin MB on HoS
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
she can't even get a pri to solve her issue
for no fucking reason
now that every valk release with pri
and wouldn't you know
:diesofcutscene:
that ult is a fucking movie
yeah she really is lasting 4 patches
what the fuck LMFAO
whenever they're out of idea and need a filler patch
<:momtao:996073360490504292>
what about what happens to part 1
i got that
yeah an epilogue to the arc
or epilogue -> hidden extra part of part 1?
epilogue -> end of part 1?
oh okay
is it the longest arc ever?
wait they're just continuing story? is it a new arc?
new meta: a baby released
so many new valks released in real life version 202.3
no, the one from honkai
eli don't log in to my acc and mute my pings
like honkai tesla
did you know someone actually named their kid tesla and he ended up making electricity?
crazy how many people got inspired by honkai
disney is going to make a movie about it
aladdin from honkai impact
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
but if they didn't fix matching at higher elo then no it ain't
the only competitive game mode that's done properly
i was going to say
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
mine is 3s, 105 frag would do nothing
nice no fomo for me
how many though <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
any info about what if you already have WE?
hmm
on the right it's the evil guy, on the left it's paimon
they fucked up by making it way too stacked
you give it to HoF, her base skin is too good
it's true, you give time runner to literally any other valk and it's easily the best skin for that valk
stig art is cute though
fuck mobbing, all my homies hate mobbing
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
by how out of touch they are
and they still impress me
literally 0 expectations
to make a mobbing MA boss
thought it would be a good idea
i did come here to say: who the fuck
base is just too good
similar case to HoF, her skins aren't bad
base HoS skin still best HoS skin
hot take
you're awesome
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i've been on a break patch for 3 patches now
so true
after this until cn anniv it's going to be all shill
y'all take the break patch while you can
hua is mine
forget about them, continue making new 1 dimensional character like you do for gsr and genshin
you don't deserve those characters
make hua and kiana copyright free
mihoyo jusgt
good
breaking news: next step on honkai becoming genshin is mihoyo just straight up releasing another genshin valk to honkai
i also won't be logging in even if it's free so
it looks cool for a free skin but i wouldn't spend money on it
sheeesh!
sounds wicked! i hope the poor souls who are playing find peace
<a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
2? 3? maybe 4?
how many of those are per week for me to try?
i wanna try that out!
that sounds interesting
what!!!
new gamemode?
what's that
can't go <:pogg:1035066559351226388> a level
<:majj:1035066587331448863>
and bot hasn't updated
i got a level yesterday
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
the only elywhip is the one from my server
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i think that's mine
i have no clue how impactful weapon is for made in abyss, she was so cheap i'm like 99% sure literally everyone who invested in her has her 4/4
raven maybe
is like DPe, carole, senti, PV
i think the only valks you can survive without weapon in the last 3 years
i see, that's cool
i mean if the last one was HoS than we're going 3 years since
oh is DPe not that bad?
carole maybe?
like what even was the last valk that wasn't completely awful without weapon
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it can't get worse than cannot play the valk
END is straight up unplayable without weapon
that one is literally already happening though
if it looks the same then why bother
and stat buff also not really, it has to look cool while being braindead
if the buttons clicked themselves then maybe
not happening
like, making players click more buttons
both of those ideas wouldn't work
nah
that sounds like there'd be legal issues with that
i don't think they're allowed to do that
like pri stigs, needs torus2
or just straight up add new shit to spend money on
we already saw 10 -> 11 valk in a year from 2021 to 2022
so the only way they can make the game more expensive is to like, either ramp up more valk release
and they ain't making the game less expensive from now on
by making every valk expensive and important on the meta
like they've kinda pushed monetisation on what already existed a bunch
i wouldn't be surprised if they start adding more stuff to spend money on soon
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
one of them is the required 2s
elf stigs
it's going to be shit like
idk i'm not a time traveller
you're lucky if you can get away with only all team 4/4 + elf
2030 is going to be 13/19
x valk equip bonus: with this equipped you can use a cool, unique new thing called 'ultimate'
7.0 pri will have a skill like
imagine honkai 2023 not needing weapon
lmfao
HoS sig
and it's a straight upgrade
they just need to figure out a decent way to be able to replay shit
i agree with carv tho open world is better
i just think the writing got a fuckton more dense and they get a boner every time they reference some math concept even when it literally doesn't contribute to anything except how smart it sounds
i don't think that's the open world fault
i'm not gonna keep reading words which i understand about 10% of
look it's not my fault, when dream shit started it went all over my head
i just stopped reading when it lost me <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
p much all of it
and i did read it for the ER arc
i do play the story
hey
i'd have to play for another 3 years to get done with story?
oh god
HoT for abyss
so i wouldn't be too hopeful
which i also really wanted to stay permanently
they removed HoT's
is the question
is it enough to beat HoT in MA
like even if she does get max stacks on normal rot, she still deals a bunch of damage while building to max stacks that don't benefit from all stacks
i'd be careful at looking at only the max stacks
yeah fucking nuts
one stack you get as much as you had before, 2+ is kinda bonkers tho
like enemy takes lightning is worse than independent, sure, but by transforming one to the other, you still lose the first
is just to compensate losing the stat from this skill
the increase on the other skill
it's still pretty big but like
how many stacks is expected from the other skill?
oh i see
jesus christ
literal 3x increase
owo math 22.5 / 7.5
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
jesus that increase
the bar is excruciatingly low
still ain't worth the price tho <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
for the shit we give mihoyo, honkai is still like way better than most gacha on quality
if you look at it that way then i don't think the expectations are fair
so you can't wait for character development to give her a battlesuit cause none's coming
and her arc is done
like for valk like kiana, you gotta accept at some point there's gotta be some new battlesuit
though thinking harder on it those expectations are pretty unrealistic
and my expectations were higher
mihoyo delivered better before
i dunno is just in a way
yeah i can see it
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i think i'm not as pissed about it anymore if you just have different expectations
yeah that's fair
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
does it count as character development
if you don't change but you learn on the most literal way who you are
i guess? i mean it was still she learning a lot
DA prob not
hmmm i feel like PE does a bunch
maybe just take the L
dunno if mihoyo could've done anything about it though
like all past battlesuits were all 3, so the newest are prob all 3 too
but by release a new battlesuit i think it's a fair assumption it's the same, right?
i don't think she needs or should have more character development, her arc is done
she gets new power, and we get new gameplay to play with
new kiana is only 2 of the 3
which is pretty cool
they were character getting new power, character development and new gameplay to play with
like the thing is with battlesuit release in the past, they were like 3 in one
i dunno if it works, maybe my expectations are fucked up though
but just having to sell a battlesuit for that, hmmm
cause yeah i think story wise i don't have as many issues with it if it's something like that
hmmm lemme think about it
that's my issue with the entire game <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
yeah i agree
but with how they need to release a new valk and battlesuit
i guess i don't have that many issues with the story if that's what it is
when it isn't and can't be
it's almost as if they're selling it as her newest evolution, her newest character development
i guess my real issue with this battlesuit is that
yeah i guess
like entire HoF was just continuing forward with my fwens, for then END to be this is me alone now just feels wrong for her character arc
maybe i just misread it but that's how i read that
cause the whole point before was to bear and carry her troubles with everyone else
and to me that just feels pretty bad for her character arc
like your interpretation is that END is an independent kiana battlesuit
i mean even not taking the moon part seriously
i fucking agree
her character arc is like she is baby -> shit happens -> she is isolated and depressed and you should feel bad for her -> she overcomes that -> she is isolated and depressed but it's okay now
now i dislike it more <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
yeah i guess
i guess it is inevitable
in character development
that just feels like a downgrade honestly
does it make sense for her arc to even end like that? alone?
i feel like that's kinda worse
hmmm
mine definitely are
cause like i feel like if END was just a skin of HoF i wouldn't have minded that much
well, maybe it's not the story writer's fault
this is like their biggest mistep
i feel like out of most of the story stuff they've done
HoF2
literally
it's actually
like when you describe it like that
god i kinda hate HoFin
and i'm only half joking
give me my playable rimestar
pussies
they keep the ones they want to sell looking as human as possible
yea that's why i also agree with them being cowards
like HoV was pretty deeply corrupted and still looked like a girl
but that ain't necessarily true, i guess
kinda like how the more corrupted ones like HoD and rimestar look way less like human
then it just would follow that if they weren't trapped in the human body, they'd look sick, you know?
is that i always assumed they were like a honkai being corrupting or residing a human body
i guess the thing with herrschers
well i mean
we have some cooler ones like rimestar and HoD
like 90% of the ones we know are just A Person
idk, like i'm not sure what a herrscher even is supposed to look like tbh
yeah i guess her attitude could be better
you lose braincells every letter you write in there
it's twitter though
yea
so like i could see them pulling it off
previous HoE is macro HoV
previous HoE is literally super duper extra HoV
while that's kinda fair
idk
god damn would i like them if they were in the game
idk like they look like fgo character but like
cloudya's herrscher designs kinda slap
also i'm going to give my hot take of the day
true
like 80% of the roster are clones
cherry
while they put 2 new elemental shield bosses in the game
HoR revival is just like ohohoh look at this a weapon for elemental shields! i wonder what's that for!
there's just so much that feels so fucking artificial
trio is just the latest
is not even only the trio
shit like HoR revival
it's not like they release some cool valks and some cool bosses
like more and more the releases feel extremely artificial
but yeah like i think this is kind of a problem recently with honkai
just spitting on their face and going get fucked we changed it after for shill
imo that's disgustingly disrespectful to player that actually pays attention and plans ahead
then on JK patch, they reduced the freeze trauma needed for cat spin + cat ult to be enough
they changed it and it wasn't even in patch notes
undocumented change, not sure if immediately in v1
cause it'll have some uses right now and at least a niche use in the future
and gone okay so i'm going to invest in cb19 now
a player could've seen in beta, that JK doesn't have any freeze
before JK release
hepha freeze bar was big enough that it needed cb19 + cat spin + cat ult to freeze after inv phase in abyss
think of a more realistic assumption then:
i mean i'm not saying that that player's conclusion would be right <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
is a very unoptimal move
a player waiting until the last week of the banner to pull for a valk
i guess it's better to say
making players wait until the last week of the banner to pull for her
or something like that
and then after that, 1 boss per patch
like a new valk might have 4 bosses in a patch
and 2. honkai pull value diminishes really really quickly
or maybe some foca or w/e in 6.4
yeah
and then they go get fucked, we changed it
1. think of a player who then went okay not my highest prio to invest on this, i'll use those xtals elsewhere that's higher prio
there's multiples points against that
for us it doesn't matter that much, cause we now know the 6.4 changes before 6.3
we went back and changed it
and then 6.4 hits and mihoyo goes get fucked it's higher now
like a player could've reached the conclusion i think HRT supporting capabilities for trio team isn't that high, with my budget i'll prob skip
adding some skills changes the valk
we're changing shit now L
is like we see you players paying attention to the mechanics and figuring out potential niches, and to you i say: get fucked
v similar to how they changed the abyss hepha trauma
to players who are planning ahead
it's like, kinda disrespectful imo to change shit like that out of the blue
but yeah
well, ideally make it clear that the new skills are trio-team related
yeah
just that something's changing, at least
like they don't have to make clear what's changing
they should make it clear when next patch hits they're actively changing how the valk works to fit the new team better
i think it's scummy
i don't like hiding it <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
yeah
the way it is i reeeeeally don't like it
i'd be way more okay with it
or something like that
if the skill was there, with a name and maybe some flavor text like a different way to ult when alongside her fwens
i'd be alright with it
if it was more like that
i really don't like that
changing skills after release for more optimal shill that's
i don't like that
oh yeah
i just go wow
honkai ruined gachas to me, i don't even get excited for s-rank anymore in any game
yeah it's just prices
old foca, no guarantees
yeah that made me a bit upset LMFAO
but is just law of big numbers, even that isn't that unlucky when you're pulling a fuckton per patch
you might have some funny stories, like my 80 pull for no uprate piece on a foca banner
after you whale enough, you don't really go through many gacha hells
is more like this is going to cost about 4-5x max top up
i'm going to try and get lucky
so i looked at a set of gear, or a valk rank, and i wasn't like
there's not many extremes
honkai gacha avgs out p fast
like once you get on a certain level of whale
idc
oh
then yea prob my 2s IO mainly
regret like i should've spent those resources somewhere else
not really
regret like i should've left this at s0
depends on what you mean by regret
i mean
i don't think i regret my s2 HoF too bad
eh maybe
but yeah i def wouldn't be worried over upgrading her to s2, unless you're a really really specific type of MA player
but she's always locked in another 3s boss
nevermind new valks, like i know HoT has a 946
idk if s2 fucks you up as much as it did before
i know cat made the damage thresholds different
though tbh this was before cat
with s2, those actions set him below 2hp bars, then damage reduction sets in and you don't deal enough damage to kill
so the strat is to kill with ult at a lil over 2hp bars
well, he gets a fuckton of resistance when he goes red mode, and he force goes into red mode at 2hp bars
heimdall gets a fuckton of damage resistance at below 2hp bars
is just heimdall which is a really weird boss
but everything else it's an upgrade
to 893
not exactly ruining, but making it way harder
in specific
for 2s heimdall
<:peepoSit:1016193458307862609>
because you're the nicest mod
please
i'll accept american
bring the guns back
jesus fuck you're french?
i thought you weren't american
cherry
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
they just don't use it for playing the game
they do have a hand
holy fucking shit
are awful
those abbreviations
wyv
do you think we'll get more consistent captainverse update after end of part 1?
they're stalling it out to see if they come up with something
not even mihoyo knows
it's mihoyo who has an issue with that <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
oh i am
i'll harass everyone into retiring, in the end i'll be hated but your life will be better without honkai
i'm like a dark hero or w/e they call it
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
by the time everyone retires, everyone will also hate me
it's my villain arc
<:lewd:959737567119556618>
if they:
- look happy suddenly because they're capping sim battle
it is not a sign of improvement! they are nearer retirement!
first signs that a honkai player is asking for help
this is like
LMFAO
fund me
would he really
<a:Blushiekissy:795363746339356702>
what will you do to me carv senpai
i just sit down and watch it all
yeah i watch them all the time, every time i see you on tv
but jerma sir your streams are so funny
i was about to say how i tried watching some streams and i didn't get it
huh
oh
how did this happen
when did you become a jerma stan cherry
you gotta wait until carv says what's going on to understand it
trio gameplay literally just looks like throwing shit and spamming buttons
even if you hadn't you wouldn't have understood it
yeah don't worry
it's perfect
flamescion literally has the FS attack circles
like herrscher of flame sakitama, cherry
herrscher of flamescion -> HoF
new mei -> flamescion/HoFS
new kiana -> END
no what
even if it got leaked i wouldn't have read it cause i'm not a nerd
cause i didn't know her kit
i mean i guess i couldn't have come up with it before
that's so fucking smart
maybe i should call flamescion that instead
like similar tier of flamescion
that's
holy shit
why would you do that
it's longer
it looks worse
similar to people calling HoF HoFS, it's like
some people call her SNyx and that's turbo stupid, actively make the abbreviation worst both aesthetically and as an abbreviation
Nyx is a fucking S-tier abbreviation, it's so fucking cool
they're like hehe sex but the abbreviation is so much cooler when it's just a full word
it's similar to the argument people use to call nyx SNx
yes
yeah i got that
literally never seen this art before
as genshin valk
and DA is like about as braindead
to when mihoyo started treating honkai like genshin
i've always said that like DA release is tipping point
i can see it honestly
yeah
she used to be GB, genshin bianca, but now she's genshin kiana
iriya actually calls another valk GK tho, and it's DA
whos that
from a time where people actually compared both
cause it's not AE i think
PX is keep fucking copium
PX is also KFC i think
HoF is KFC
it's actually my favorite thing ever it's so fucking funny
because HoV was GK, so it only makes sense that the next herrscher would have same naming scheme
bronya kiana
he calls BKE BKE and HoR BK
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i wanna hear you talk with iriya for 10 minutes and try to figure his shit out
carv you don't know bad abbreviations
see!!!
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
so i'm doing it myself
no one appreciates me baban
oh no the math
ty keilo
good abbreviation keilo
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
END really is the last kiana suit
so i was right
i don't think we're slowing down, bud
i mean yea but year 7 is prob going to be similar
but most of the cost increase from game is making all valks less and less skippable + break up ranking making shit like s1 and s2 very powerful
well, 10 -> 11 is actual 10% increase if you think about it
yeah we did go slightly higher from 2021 -> 2022 <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
like when i talk with people still on honeymoon from genshin and i'm like this game sucks and they're like wdym this game sucks they let me play for more than 5 mins <:PogU:1058107777295331491>
that doesn't surprise me but that does enlighten me, like when i ask for better and your standards are so low because you play shit like that
okay see
i was flabbergasted, it's kinda like from FT release when her base skin was laggy as fuck for no reason
so skin meta, unironically
that make you attack unironically faster
and apparently there are some cosmetic overrides
you know i started playing runescape
not that kind of meta <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yea i mean like, idk how to explain it, like when looking at why they made it the way they made it
i'm just memeing most of the time but idk from a meta perspective her designs do feel like a little too much
might be because i can just forget about timido
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm way more pissed about aponia than timido
and it worked on me
idk they release aponia just after timido so people direct their rage towards another character
timido is just CE aponia
o i could really see that one tho
so just add a few more double valk patch, some S+sp on the side
they'll keep making the game more expensive
but i feel like once they make everything not skippable, they're not gonna stop there
like the main source of how much more expensive this game is is because we have less and less skippable shit
idk if this is true, i think we have gone slightly higher from 2021 -> 2022
and the other being S+sp
like 1/2 of them being double S-rank with one of them being cheaper
i wouldn't be surprised if we see 2/3 double valk release per year now
is this your predictions to how shill honkai will be moving forward?
no one could've seen this coming :/
meanwhile release sched team is like oh no guess we're forced to do another ice dps :/
like writing team is planning 20 chapter in advance
honkai release sched team feels like they just grabbed a bunch of randos out of street
i guess i could see it
standard team dps + CN + HRT?
yeah how long is she lasting <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
isn't it funny that mihoyo couldn't figure out how to make a good fire support so they just made it canon that you're supposed to use ice valk
all ice
yeah if they run with timido it might end up being ice -> ice
and apho mei not s-rank would be weirdge
the way they did apho2 felt really good
i really don't think prologue valk is gonna be S-rank
though idk
o yea mei
cause like the thing is there's not many options for 6.6 valk if it's old apho valk, it's p much only timido right
6.6 an old one, 6.7 and 6.8 can be new ones
and then 6.6-6.8 all apho
6.5 is like susannah/jackal/hare or some shit like that
hmm i mean maybe, what chara we thinking even
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
yeah time to kill her
i would guess maybe lightning sp -> phys sp -> ice bio S -> qua phys S
hmm i guess if you tally HRT up as a fire/lightning valk
you think they don't wanna contest trio team with fire or lightning at all for a while? <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
also why double ice no lightning?
that sounds the least possible one to me
hmm ice quantum S
the valk, i assume
like any off field valk dealing damage to enemy on the right element gains the effect too
i mean the way it works right now is p much team buff
how much is the universal ele taken then? that can end up as a nuts elf
didn't i end up with same interpretation?
also wdym you won <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
o is she out now?
she is v pretty
nice to meet you miss crane
oh sheeesh
like that's laughably bad design
nuts stupid tho
actively punishing shieldbreak is fucking
i guess that's sorta interesting
i understand what they want to do but that's a fucking disgusting way to do it
i actually hate that
like awful design
that's
if you deal more damage with the shill team that'll just get rid of shield faster, which will make the boss feel worse
cause like it'd feel like shit no matter what then, right?
or just damage? that sounds weird
hitcount?
what is it even then
kinda shit but ok
that's uh
unironically?
oh i see
like they're optimising the rot to deal all their damage while shield is up
they're swapping off from dps every time shield is down
is there some mechanic i don't understand
am i missing something
that's kinda funny
wait the wall has 2 hp bars? LMFAO
cause that's how they balance boss currently
tho i'm guessing normal trio team at s0 prob scores around 800
like a 600 score in old BKE would be a sick score
cause like i don't even know how much a normal team score there <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
that doesn't say much tho
i mean
oh that's beta
wait kevin's out?
yeah that sounds right
or 6.5 end of story stream
maybe they announce it on cny stream?
cause i think if apho3 is in 6.7, then they should be announcing it somewhat soon
between apho2 announcement and release
how long was it
that sounds about right tho
and the or there was like for the order or something
i thought you were coping for timido and seele squad member + teri and seele
oh
i could see it tho
then having a random apho valk in 6.5 would be kinda weird
yea that makes sense tho
idk if they'd release big new apho patch without S-rank to go along with it
6.7?
when do you think apho3 is being released then?
that feels weird
hmm really?
being non hyperbolic tho, veliona dying is kind of a meme for me but from a story telling perspective there's no fucking way hua doesn't die
and senti and seele will have to carry the torch
everyone knows hua and veliona die
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
cause she'll die in main story
like there's no veliona in apho already
if new seele is apho seele i could see she not being quantum
that kinda sucks
you think no mainstory seele?
but flamescion's look really really unfinished
END look kinda alright
i don't think those are finished yet
who cares at this point
of maybe fuck it just steal it from HoR
so she doesn't steal anything from HoR
or maybe they make her mech but they make her suck really really bad at shields
so it only really leaves bio for timido
and if 2023 herrscher is seele, then it also has to be qua of the year
like there's no way seele ain't qua
yeah ice bio sounds right
o wait i see what you mean
6.6 is elf already?
a lot of SW boss are way more ranged shill than ice shill i think
well, i could see her being bio melee ice
i guess for timido there's no way it isn't ice
does it even have to be ice
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
who can do that
3 players in global
but there's like
like yeah MPE can almost match s0 v2v on kosma
the only issue is that they fucking blow to play against LMFAO
balance wise i think current qua boss, especially kosma, are in a really good place
LMFAO i mean yea it feels awful for sure
just a matter of time until they get a playable suit
like jackal, tesla, einstein, susannah, hare
is not a matter of if, is a matter of when
then you just need to wait until they run out of idea
if they have a model already
my take is
if you do it well enough, at least
you prob lose a similar amount of points from both, if that makes sense
yeah from player perspective one feels a lot worse than the other but like from a balancing perspective idt it's that different
though i guess that's alr kinda true for current qua boss
if you give it to valk, then anything not that valk on new boss is just depressing
cause like if you give it to elf, then old team can bring new elf and have 2 collapse and still make new boss not awful
o hm i think giving an extra collapse to the valk is worse
like realistically speaking how much different is it even between having to collapse one more time or having to do some stupid shit on JK to fill that last hair of para to deal damage
like JK para bar just being ass to fill without klein
there's alr a bunch of bosses which are kinda bs on elf requirement
i mean i think it'd be shit from a player standpoint but realistically idk if it be like specially impactful
hmmm
eh idk
like if they make a team with 2 pocket collapse, then they're just making the shill bosses need those 2 collapses, which will make any team we have right now awful to play against it
yeah idk i could see them doing quantum collapse elf, but all it would do is make older qua boss have more budget option for team that can't bring a quantum, and make boss balanced around that unbearable for any other team
so you get to skip that? i guess?
like a boss like tona alr does it's one collapse attack so early
like the thing about bringing another collapse on older bosses wouldn't even do much
yeah hmm i'm thinking about it
idk about that
actually hmmm
even if they make a new boss balanced around 2 collapse, the new team would retroactively break a bunch of older bosses
like all bosses are balanced around you having one collapse per team
i don't think we can have any more quantum collapse
and then we could go <:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930> it's the elf when it releases
it'd be neater if we had the kaslana bat as an event item, like a katana
that'd be pretty neat
i guess actually it'd be KoRa cause i don't think the domains exist in lore
that'd be so cool, it'd make some sense lorewise cause she doesn't need that anymore since she gets a new one from becoming third herrscher
like imagine if it was just DoI living form
i would really enjoy if they gave actual explanation in lore about kiana elf
just a shame they throw it away, like even for some recent one like WE we don't actually have the base piece of equipment in game to point it out
is really fun
like having a piece of equipment in inventory that you can point out and say that that's the base form of the ELF
really really like the concept from ELF
i actually like
but like what i meant is that dudu elf you can still cope about it like it doesn't make sense for it to be an ELF but it's at least still the E
for the first nonsense elf
yea i guess you're right, it should be bella actually i think
colors look like it's from maincord
yea that's what i said <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
is also the pipeline to how they're slowly not caring anymore about the lore
well this isn't an ELF in lore but it's a piece of equipment so ->
i mean it isn't an equipment but it shows up in the story! ->
who cares
if they're doing spending + ER stamps, then they'd put the big rank to 2s
what i'm guessing is prob spending event shop for s2, if ER stamps then that + event shop is 2s
then i'd guess no ER stamps
if s2 is the big rank up
though also no mention about the other DA stamps, so still hope
if she does then beta should reveal it but afaik no mention of it yet
so she's going to need actual shill boss realistically speaking to have any boss
but yea like carv said she can't really abuse any of the mechanics that make HoT busted on her bosses
she actually looks around standard S-rank strength from pure dps numbers
is that cope or?
ely elf gather is so dogshit
honestly i'm scared
if she ends up having no place as dps and only useful on trio team that'd be sad
in a way just a little harder to play HoT, which i think i enjoy a bunch
because she looks interesting gameplay wise
i would hope flamescion end up as a niche lightning dps
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
the way i'd expect mihoyo to do is fire/lightning taken on enemies
the way i'd interpret it is just team fire/lightning%
hmmm i see
oh or do you mean lead in specific?
valk on field? i guess that's slightly different because of off field effects, that is even smaller though
like if the universal buff are big enough it'll be prob be a fire/lightning/ice elf good enough for majority of competitive player base to invest into and still get away with
and if they're big enough, that's kind of a sick elf for budget player
that means the universal ones need to be pretty big to compensate
cause like if the fire/lightning specific buffs are small enough
so it's +fire/lightning% for team?
minefield of bait mechanics
genshin is a fucking
very true <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that's actually
or elf deal more fire/lightning damage on enemies?
+fire/lightning taken on enemies?
what's that mean
- Hitting enemies increases fire/lighting elemental damage
trio team feel like 50/40/10 fire/lightning/ice damage distribution
lightning+fire?
o is she double type? i guess that makes sense actually
they play, deal no damage guess i need to pull for rank up <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
actually maybe it is
like idk if baiting people into playing worse is good design
i mean sure i'm not saying they shouldn't. i guess if it enables that playstyle for them and they enjoy it it's fine, is just that it actively baits people into doing longer rots, even those who want to play competitively but are just starting out
i don't think HRT buffs hold enough for you to go END -> flamescion -> back to END
i think it's prob gonna be something more small and big rot, with small rot HRT -> END and big rot HRT -> flamescion -> END
and i think as principle i don't think they should be designing stuff for ER, that feels weird too to me
i see it so often causal player just like hang around on like PE way after HoS ult is already done and i'm like you're literally dealing 10 damage
cause like in reality they still deal same amount of damage both in and outside of buff, it just bait player into way overstaying on dps valk past buff uptime
idk it feels like turbo bait
now you can just like... stay... on the valk, and keep cycling shit waaaay past all your support shit runs out
old valk at one point just forced you out of field cause there was just nothing left to do, which is prob a better influence on casual or beginner player
because of ER
designed to be able to stay on field 100% of the time
is like
is how all current valk design
also another thing which idk if i like or not
we've been on a long break patch streak
mihoyo so kind
are the standard S-rank <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like the break patches we get in 2022
what even are break patches nowadays
me on absolute time stop
like there's no way, write it down and literally anyone can figure it out that it'll feel awful if they continue down that path
schizo signet
like write it down
ice S-rank
ice free S-rank + ice dk revival
fire sp
ice S-rank
so it's either like SO much incompetence, or they just don't care to address it
like there's no way they couldn't
right?
and it's like, they should be able to foresee that it would be an issue
it's just too much all at once
would feel so much better if it was spaced out
like all of what we're having right now
<:Shrug:616394597211439118>
but then 6.1 would've been too cheap
and it would've made ice feel so much less bad
not released the divine key
they could've just
but just how they do it is pretty awful
even with HRT i think it's fine if HoR still has space in meta
i mean in a vacuum i don't think it's a bad idea
it's so bad
it's just too much ice all stepping on each other toes
like i'm not against reviving HoR, but like holy shit man
yeah i agree with that so hard
<:JEAN_WHAT:708170054319210547>
is like if they put a lil more thought into it it would feel so much better, yk?
and this streak of absurdly expensive patches
shit like HoH -> JK
a lot of current patches just feel like mihoyo had 0 foresight tho
i do think both of them are really pretty, especially kiana, i do like her design a lot
:D
for new years
yea i'm preparing my sleep sched
and it'll auto remove the embeds
like <link>
just add <> on the link
for END
s1 is independent multiplier, s2 is breach
so the pins are easier to navigate
can you remove the embeds
i just think they fucked up looking back with making HoF and time runner and stealing so much of the punch END could have had
to me it isn't even a problem with END, i think she's pretty great
i mean i'm not even saying quality wise, just concept wise aswell, is just stepping too much on each other concept to me
o 75? still no handel <:smoke:808652033007157258>
flamescion has like 50 cost ult too, so no handel <:smoge:959781798181736478>
time runner just feels like beta testing for END
yeah the skin teases the new valk for onyx but it still stands as a thing on its own outside of it, it doesn't feel nearly as similar
nah i kinda disagree, like onyx and HoS are way more different than time runner and END
just for them to release time runner: the valk <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
honestly i'd feel a little ripped off if i spent money on time runner
i've already complained about why i don't like it
at first glance not nearly as universal as HRT, which i guess makes sense since she's so cheap
switch into kiana/bronya only
a bunch of flamescion buffs look like
even if they buff END a bit to overcome s0 HoF, for a lot of player she isn't competing against s0 HoF
yea absolutely, especially for like player on mid-lower end of spending prob have s1+ HoF rn cause of adv
flamescion rn looks kinda meh outside of trio team
actually 5head
they really remove pause just to release valk that pause for you
she yelans
LMFAO okay
that sounds actually so annoying LMFAO
and i actually hate that
is to reposition yourself
like the one other use for it
i've actually thought about it
s0 on both
on normal rot with HRT + CN team by aka, HoF and END did around same amount of damage
you put sound over it and then all mistakes go away
it's cause you're missing the sound
i think this is the first valk which just branch out entire attack string depending on what button you press
i guess yea probably
hmmm is NS the closest one for that?
and after the follow up, you can either press dodge or weapon active to do different attack string
then you'll have a follow up with paused timer like carv said
yeah on her normal attack string, some attacks will have the white circle to time next attack
you're prob whale enough to not need those offrate in the first place
but like if you're whale enough to be pulling on banner for offrate
then you can get a piece of gear for 5 pull
unless you're like a real special type of player where you need multiple or maybe only most off rate
even then tho prob not worth it
eh i guess
so realistically no one is going up to all 80
and you get free box
avg is 76 for 4/4
so you can get up to 40 card back
for up to 80 pull
you get 5 card back
every 10 pull
it's 80+40
but then there's more milestones over 100 pulls
up to 100 pulls it's same as adv
it's better than adv
before s0 isn't good enough
it's only a matter of time
fucking CN at 492d too
yea it unironically just becomes a cat boss LMFAO
for s0 player
yeah i think she might lose HoD
aka is fighting kevin rn on stream
oh yeah carv
yeah that makes sense, though with how high non-PE team can score, even without insta kill p1 core, i wouldn't be surprised if trio team still put up a fight
it can't when it's not out yet
i'm gonna be honest back when i played i alr only skipped to the gameplay sections
lmao i didn't watch that
i mean animation wise
i tried paying attention, i heard aka saying that but i watch HRT sp after the part where it's supposed to skip ult animation and it doesn't go down so idk
based on whether you have the rest of trio on team
actually change
does her ult
cause you get like one attack string with absolute time stop which is just a playable cutscene + ult
at the end of END rot
of cutscene
actual 10 seconds
it's actually insane tho
everything outside of that is very high skill ceiling
when you're in ult then it's braindead
like small anicancel
and even then actually ulting had a bunch of ways to do it faster
well sure but it was from a time where you didn't ult for free, so her ult is not her only gameplay
good times when valk had actual insane skill ceiling
yeah like actual NS good player is fucking nuts
i know what her buttons do, know how to play is like a different beast
well
i know how to play NS tho
i just @th3o and send him the ref and ask him to tell me what buttons i need to press
so every time i need to use PX
and th3o is in blustorm
made by th3o
like there's the one PX guide everyone talks about
unfortunately i talk shit but to this day i still don't know how to use PX
drink some water
talk to chat
and then just pause
absolute time stop
LMFAO you can actually
SA also had animation cancel on her attack string
too hard for avg player
but can't have it
yeah i mean i love it
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
one of main GD ult effect is not having to time her timed attack
those are also kept to a minimum
timed attack? like SA and GD?
just string together flashy button and cutscene for 2023 valk
everything gotta be easier and more braindead
unironically too confusing for player
nah can't have that
at least imo
but anything less just feels awful, like doing 1 attack string and 2 attacks is so weird
and that's such like an insane buff it's insane
cause like the only way it can be higher and feel good is if it goes to 2 attack string instead of 1
tho idk if it will be any higher
yeah the actual counter is the thing that matters
just to fuck with people following it
i would use up all 30 second of absolute time stop
literally every ref i make
if i was still playing
i mean honestly they really should've
and the 100 count is only enough to do one attack string
so like the 30 second max is only for style, the actual limiter is the counter
and when the counter is finished, then time stop is done
and every action you take decreases that counter by set amount
no, the kiana full time stop has a 30 second time count but it has a 100 counter
but realistically speaking it would never happen cause they'd then have to give it to every new S-rank
they prob on design camp discussed a bunch about doing actual time reversal shit
yeah i mean absolutely, they can't break it too much
like the concept is really cool but how it actually end up working mechanically is disappointingly straightforward and simple
it doesn't live up to my expectations basically
it's just
yea i think it's fine too, not nearly as broken as i thought it would be
kiana is all fire
you get to look cool doing cool stuff but  you don't have to actually play well and you still get all rewards
it's a player made cutscene is all it is
you can get up take a piss and then come back and finish it off and not lose score
like a 30 second long windows for you to do a 5 seconds long attack string
so basically you get one attack string for free where you can fuck up as much as you want and you don't lose score or time
but they give you a counter which only lets you do one attack string
i mean yea it looks cool
i'll clip it from aka stream
but in practice is just going to be a 5-second cutscene where how well you play doesn't actually matter
like concept wise it's cool and it looks really cool
idk if i like it
yeah honestly the way absolute time stop works right now just kinda lowers skill ceiling a bunch
absolute time stop lasts 30 seconds but there's a limited amount of actions you can take
but it is really funny
okay absolute time stop is not that busted
fire + ice + lightning + overload + melt + superconduct + physical
like to get through this section you need to deal all 7 types of damage <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i mean yea i'm sure she will prob be a great pick as fire dps on fire boss, but like on END boss i'm 100% sure they'll put 3s bella transition on all of them
so i expect nothing
threw it all out of the window
and then HRT just fucking
like i thought each of them would be standard S-rank dps power with addition trio team if you had all 3
and then if you invest and only end up getting one of them, then you're fucked
i'd wait until more testing, there is a chance where like an END without the rest of her team won't do much
for HRT + END + flamescion is kinda scary tho
it's safe to say any upcoming unit will be the most busted unit yet, just as a general rule
no one to this day knows why the fuck he calls aponia RS
for iriya you need to solve my riddles three to figure out
no, i explain what mine mean
the flame from flamescion is flamechasers
yeah
herrscher of flamescion -> HoF
new kiana -> END
new mei -> flamescion
okay so if i heard it right END has normal absolute time fracture on one mode and super absolute time fracture on the other mode
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
kinda stupid
and HRT having execute
but with flamescion + END having core pen
instead of 150% PE has
END apparently only has 100%
what that's kinda nuts
oh they both have core pen instead?
both 3s skill for flamescion and END buff each other
when how i'd say it is use HRT/flamescion to execute
then use HRT to execute
everyone talking about you're supposed to play with END to damage transfer
idk that's why i'm asking
now END also has damage transfer, HRT has execute, does flamescion have nothing at all?
cause all img valk has some bs, all but PE before was execute
any img core bs?
does mei not have
holy fuck she's so op
give me no regrets from quitting
no balls
do it mihoyo
me too
they should've done HoF as a new concept off shoot from previous and then do ultimate kiana as END incorporating all previous + HoF
HoF is just too good, they shouldn't have done it for her non-final battlesuit
yeah she's kinda stacked
surprisingly honestly
both are non-awk
like quality wise sure END is better, flashier and shit
trying to do it again just feels like another HoF
HoF is culmination of her entire character, her entire arc, everything about her is ultimate kiana
is more like from concept standpoint
and i'm not even talking about quality
HoF2
like END just feels like another HoF
that they can't out do it anymore
HoF design is so fucking good
they fucked up with HoF
okay so hot take:

honestly gimme any mobius boss i'll log in to do it and then log out

i'd log in to do the 946 aka
oh

it was built with the purpose to be our capital, so they purposefully put it in the middle of the country
yeah kinda
our capital was são paulo once, which is kinda close to rio de janeiro, so maybe close
LMFAO well now you know
i guess rio de janeiro is kinda like new york? i guess some people would guess US capital is new york
cause that's our biggest state
i'd think most people would guess it'd be são paulo instead
that's weird
they actually think it's rio de janeiro?
yeah brasilia is the capital, not the country LMFAO
that's kinda like calling france paris LMFAO
that's so weird
what the fuck
wait brazil in your languages is brasiilia and brezilya?

LMFAO

all your other ones are like s-3
your first s0 valk
woah
<:lookUp:1048431538511020063>
herrscher of math
so he'd still be wrong
which to be fair, would mean jayson would still get 2s after the 6.4 stamps
jayson thought s3 -> 2s was 50 for some reason
you can literally check from that screen
<:lookUp:1048431538511020063>
5 + 25
wdym it's exactly enough for 2s
yeah pretty good

and i'll have retired by then
cause the rest of the stamps for me to 2s1 her are coming in 6.4
well, not really
sheesh 2s1 DA for me too
30s rots instead of 20s
maybe they just want to force longer rots
GD pri changes just sounds like a buff
not timing

frontload her damages sounds like a sidegrade
doesn't sound necessarily like a nerf

SNS release they moved some sp gen from kit to stigs, turns out she's so not sp starved it's impressive, even without her stig set, so
gotta see how she plays to know how important that sp gen is

it's only cool when other people call it

almost all of them are maxed too
i only have TTMBBB for zhenyi actually
<:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
more useful in MA
i'd personally prefer HoS i think
hmmm
i'm pretty sure you can 2s both with BP
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
you can only choose one?
it's a pretty big buff but there's no way to answer that in a vaccuum

i mean
can finally have my TTTTMMBBBB
sheeesh zhenyi on bp
she doesn't
it's pretty simple
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
and i dislike a bunch of the bosses from the current wave

i feel like they go through waves
old abyss bosses

you think they're ever going to make that a battlesuit?
she's so pretty
whoa wtf
you hallucinated earlier with the 6s stuff too
real tet hours
wtf you talking about
that's HoD, tet

why does mihomo keep doing this
just wait 10 seconds on transition
that fight looks awful LMFAO
apparently the emblem is situationally better than nirv
i'm getting the BoL set next patch too, i'm gladge
weirdge
yeah no exclamation point or anything
i had forgotten
oh damn we can claim this and they don't even tell us
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
everything else i rolled had uses
but yea i've never used this welt B and i never will
i don't 100% regret it cause back then i didn't know 2s MA would die and welt TM was still nice to save a sec on some strats
was welt
i think the only stig i rolled for purposefully which was a bad investment
but i can't think of a valk in recent times that i pulled 4/4 and then proceeded to not use one of the pieces at all
i think there's plenty of valk which are good enough at 3/4 to even up to nirv retain
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
actually you use bastet B in 3s hepha, so in the best gamemode
bastet?
it's inevitable
but if they do i'm also sure they're just gonna start doing 3 pri patch
i mean idk i feel like at one point they better give us more mat income
you fit right in with mihomo design team carv
honestly i was thinking they should tax my water next, it was the only base necessity left without taxes
LETS FUCKING GOOOO THIS MONTHS CHEQUE IS SO PRETTY
gotta pay your 520 metal to keep using the valk you already pulled weap for
yeah fucking paying mihomo taxes over here
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
are you also hype when you pay your bills?
are you excited to waste more mats?
like what
any time anyone gets happy over GD getting a pri
unreasonably mad
it makes me
i'm on bingo camp
yeah it looks sick
<a:PeepoLeave:622861118355931186>
priority is getting the fuck away from here as soon as possible
ice elf used to be the most important elf cause ice team used to have no ice% taken
how stuff changes huh
AE has enemy tdm taken and good elemental buffs too
only higher breach and timestop ain't enough
i just don't think they would do it
i mean yea ofc mihomo can do it, mihomo can do whatever the fuck they want
i really don't see HRT being strong enough as a support to replace fire, or god forbid lightning support on general situation
or on trio team
you'll only use her on fire/lightning team when boss forces you to deal mixed damage
HRT probably won't replace any support on general team
probably not, that is to say
no
are they going to do it? idk
new valk that does everything HoS does but harder
i mean the answer is simple
there's no escape
she impairs every enemy on field during burst
she impairs those too
no
there's actually no gimmick you can one up her on, to replace her you need to do everything she does but just do it harder
consistent and longlasting impair
good team buffs
she has team sp gen
she has good tf and good time slow for MA
yeah like, she literally has everything you want on a phys support
isn't replacing HoS
that a valk who only offers slightly higher impair
so much
like HoS just does
higher impair doesn't do as much as y'all think it would either
so <:Shrug:616394597211439118>
it's effectively already phys breach
but because of how HoS works, impairing repeatedly every enemy around her during burst
but instead of being a debuff on enemy, it's a buff on self
phys breach works the exact same as impair
HoS is literally phys breach already
you know
they're prob putting fragments of her in ER eventually
just spending events, top up events, and shit like that
like look at BKE, i never spent a single xtal pulling for her and i have 2s3
if you're certain you're never getting 3s then don't bother past 2s but you should still invest assuming you'll reach 3s eventually
up to mihomo whims
besides 3s ofc
but past 2s i think all rank ups are kinda small
i would sink all possible into HoS so you get 3s eventually faster
layla deez nuts
and doesn't enable you to get 2s early unless you get real lucky
it gives you some extra frags past 2s but not enough for 2s1
also yea new adv doesn't change anything for player who already have s0
different transition and HoC vfx during transition
oh it's definitely HoC
jesus i can't see shit
<a:alert:739695407101378660> GENDER ALERT <a:alert:739695407101378660>
yeah we're all undercover there
it's the same stuff
just look at the seed of sumeru channel on minicord
why not
damn it looks kinda sick
mostly
yeah
do whatever the fuck honestly
this channel looks like it has rules but it has none
yes please
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
i'd fucking pull
LMFAO
good
discord knows i blind people
LMFAO
moriso
HOMU replacement
so no one joins
we need to make this game about 20x more confusing
just call husk husk and the other husk bull
the husk we call husk is actually nihilus
yeah husk is the title i think
pretty simple
HoF = kiana
flamescion = mei
we'll have HoF and flamescion
the flame is from flamechaser
oh, the new mei
END is much stronger
what you gonna call her HoF2? HoFin? weak.
kiana, duh
so who cares
people be calling DPe DiP
they are HRT, END and flamescion
accept the HRT
HRT
keilious, even
we never joke
pic of the therapy?
uh
HRT is way better than HTR/NTR
trans jokes >>>> cuck jokes
no it's HRT
it makes the most sense
?
pretty simple
HerrscheR of Truth
holy fuck miyobo is so smart
to go with the HRT!!!!
yeah 8tr
i guess last hurrah before flamescion
HoT really didn't need another dk butr
yeah i'm so upset, another fucking pri on this patch
nunya
keilo end now is just taihen asking for new kiana battlesuit don't worry
mihomo so smart
LMFAO
so we wouldn't quit
with cny
timed the book
they fucking
oh shit
it's a good amount above average at this point
no but it's above average on how expensive it is
since masters, dearly keilo
fuck abyss
LMFAO
no
hidden third option: quit the game
or skip HRT and then can't play trio team
either skip CN and use made in abyss with END
yea that's the awful thing right now
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
me and ruby in the same page
time to retire
HoS is another BKE boss LMFAO
bull is prob temporary for HRT and then trio or kiana when they release
melee HoC is probably for HRT
my loggers is also blurry
<:Loggers:1002644846449791137>
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
and idk why but i kinda like it now
a good amount of mine are very blurry
yeah, abySS
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
at least it's better than the other gamemode
and then there's like 4 new abyss boss
yeah bull is new 3s boss
yeah there's the new abyss and MA bosses
from event
no, carole is confirmed free
it has vfx so very likely yea
o wow i see, didn't know that
it's moon knight peam
like even as s0 player
yeah, but you don't run mkp on FGO, do you?
hey guys there's something wrong with my game
FGO already a boss you kinda overfill a bunch on sp
but eh maybe
cause you get way less sp
even for FGO i think it's not going to be that useful
but i don't think they expected cf to be this broken
well, weaker than cf
it's in line with the other 2
it's clearly event reward but i don't think it's that bad
nothing more than that
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah to me it feels like they just don't want us using mkp on HoS anymore
like so so ugly
so ugly
the gauntlets are
but it is funny
i do think they should make every old bad stig craftable
i like it actually
LMFAO actually?
what the fuck mihoyo
who cares
just rename memorial arena to HoT stress test at this point
idk wtf they're on about
v1 is turbo busted
and i'm reading them righjt
like if the numbers are right
LMFAO
fuck no this is insane
it's so HoT can t1 jizo too
honestly same this is so bad
and it got into beta
intern typo'd raven into eden on design phase
they forgot raven exists dw
nah at least 6.2 is single pri
it never stops
no way this is right
idk i'm eating right now
but masters player gets it too so who cares at this point
least they can do is make it differ enough so we can be better than masters player
i was going to say
it better
pri vs non pri comparison
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
WHAT THE FUCK MIHOMO
IT DOESN'T EVEN CHANGE THE ACTIVE VFX
and on HoD, you never ran drac M, it's holmes TM newt B
and this is just a better mkp for HoS for HoD
just when you need the damage to one shot so you can get decent score is when you run to cursed shit like mkp HoS
on traditional boss, having actual sp gen is better
new weapon should only be used on HoD
i don't think this changes anything about dracula M
i guess it is satisfying but it makes sense it was so low prio
honkai you just press the equip plan 3 times and you're done
i see it for genshin ig
does it matter?
i mean
HoT time
where she was there but locked, still could check skills at lv1
i thought it was like the last beta with DPe
oh the rentry is just placeholder stuff
not the numbers but the skills
?
ain't her kit already up
like hello? its not like its even for simp reasons, edens 5ft deep, everyone forgot about all of the flamechasers already
im going mental
yeah right now we only use her in HoT and DPe bosses, waaaay too weak truly
when everything is HoT-only
kinda funny how they made 3s BKE as an HoT-only boss
in MA? wouldnt be surprised
im glad HoT is getting some attention
yeah she really needed the buff
always turg
no clue how much the extra passive is going to matter on turg eden
seeing how low those  buff upgrades are, could end up as a base pri worse than base weapon deal
we are unhappy with HoT current state, we think she should take 3s jizo too
like whyyyy
im so upset over eden pri
its really annoying but workable
thete were already kmp strats for s0, so it only makes those better
you have to run it on HoS
oh thats nice i guess?
besides draining us of everything for 6 4
why even make this a 2 pri patch? literally 0 reason
i mean its so bad, cherry
hi cherry!!!!!
like holy shit
im actually surprised over how greedy they are
thats so stupid
lmfao
it would be really funny if it actually took 2 weeks for beta LMAO
i'm skipping
sss-tier
unless the vfx are
next one should be bingo i think
latest paid skin was spending boobnia, bchip eden, pyramid PE
right? or did something release in 6.2 and idr
most recent just was
next one isn't bchip
punishment for us
mihomo is upset
too many leaks
2 weeks
so <:Shrug:616394597211439118>
even like a lot of 9s whales didn't bother to go further than that
look at SpA, everyone stopped at 2s
i think it'll be S-rank too but like
i mean it barely matters tbh
and between mei and kiana, it's clear who's gonna be the gacha one
they ain't doing double gacha S-rank in a patch
either A-rank or free S-rank
i mean absolutely she'll be free
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
and everyone will cum and pull for her
for elysia! on her ult
she's gonna say some shit like
yeah
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
everyone will have 2s+ of that
like herrscher of ego mei
jesus people are gonna pull so bad aren't they
also yea griseo skin is the paid one, it has vfx
190 is way more expensive than that, though ofc it'll net you more rank ups, but the issue is there's no cheaper option if you're s0 player, which blows
it's around ~152 pulls avg s0 4/4 on expa, 150 guaranteed on discount s1 4/4 and often s2+
like, discount supply is around a sidegrade for s0 player, if you care nothing about rank ups
that's actually more expensive
that's exactly my take too
but not open the event?
open the event
did they
best team
HRT, END and flamescion
yeah
that's p much all we know of her
and team fire and lightning output
yea she boosts self ice output
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
idk scroll and backread everything
new herrscher
if she were to join lightning, the team would be [dps] PV HRT
she ain't replacing PV
also
maybe give her 2 boss but steal 1 of them later for END
so they're prob shilling her a bit further to make her seem worth it
but HRT doesn't have trio team yet
like i think kiamei individual shill will be 1 boss and that'll be okay, they also have trio team as value
prob 2 abyss boss for her
p much agree, just think her shill for individual boss will be a bit stronger
she prob won't have high enough numbers to justify running her on a general team
LMAO
i just really don't think they will
they could make HRT main support for every team
yeah like mihomo can do whatever the fuck they want
....no
she could but i really doubt she will
and she maybe steals bella
new HoD for HRT?
idk
and then for HRT in specific
for abyss
and bull will be trio boss
and that will be trio boss
bella will come to abyss
i'm honestly guessing that
i mean does it matter, they'll just add 2 boss for her in 6.3 and run each 3 times
not yet
END
because she's the herrscher of the end, is going to be the end of her battlesuits, and is going to be the end of my time in honkai
no, END
new kiana
yea
END team will prob be END AE CN
imo hell no
you can clear with 1 element with like 46k score
top score is 3 element
require is too much
yeah idk how i feel about which to skip
cherry said break family trauma and left
LMFAO see, can you guess where i got it from?
i missed you every day
the nights you put me to sleep
i still remember your face though
that's okay
smh
roasted for not knowing you're my dad
whoa
yes, father
you bet dad
uh
OwO
owo 8ball will me and tet unblock eachother?
you're stuck here forever mommy
you heard it mommy
yeah what a fucking surprise
yeah what a fucking surprise
jesus fuck
never?????w
owo 8ball is the game ending in 6.4?
owo leaking mihomo's plans
see
ask if it's the last hi3 kiana battlesuit
yeah owo is turbo dumb, they're counting genshin kiana battlesuit
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
yeah she's about to give us 3
and useless
yeah i'm a herrscher kinda like how elysia is a herrscher
actually i guess i can be a dom
i dunno if i'm a dom
that's true
actually based
hakcer so brave
wow
transgirl seele?
and pin it into someone else
and do a nqn message
you know, you could change pfp and name
:blal
:kianasuckingcock:
like
and people will fill it in with their mind
you can just make up emote on the spot
is great
if you don't have them
using emotes without nqn
honestly
they can't ban their main audience
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
so yes
as a bird, mihomo has fucked me thoroughly before
yeah
i mean fuck and reproduce is different, i'm sure they can fuck but reproducing probably not
well to give my take on it
worst answer
dante
tet L
she's a coward!
tet blocked everyone but she can't stop herself from reading the messages
i knew it
no it's not
the rest are dog shit
i have 1590 MPE, 1560 HoT
almost softlocked himself too
he skipped getting the robot, got a health upgrade, and then when he got the robot he found out he lost permanently the health upgrade
it's double funny cause this is the only star wars media i've ever watched so i'm very confused
yeah it's really funny, it's very broken
i high doubt HRT is going to replace AE on general fire team
she's not leaving yet
dw about the vid
my highest atk valk
like just picking the highest atk TMB with 23/23 affix
1700 with stupid stigma, without prob around 1650
nah that's with stupid stigma
actually stupid
HoT can get 1700 atk
with +10 atk from SoE
stat queen
she just has crazy base atk and crazy atk on pri
HoT is the highest atk valk
i think to this day
interesting
DPe and v2v tied at 3rd tho
and now only 7t beats it
it was highest atk before
also idk if tai was just memeing but DoS has insane high atk
cause they can just keep squeezing resources out of us
they'll never do that tho
as long as they make base weapon strong enough
new character absolutely can compete without pri arm
they did it for echo, and it's strong enough
they did it for AF, and it was strong enough
it's not that hard
literally just make the weapon strong enough as base
just like
i mean it's sooooo stupid to give pri on release, especially for support
they just don't want to
i mean yes they can
actually turbo stupid
???????????
like
people complain
and then when they release support without pri
even to supports, actually turbo stupid
it makes me so mad
giving pri-arms to new valks on release
yeah i actually hate it
HoT was the first valk at all to have pri on release
4.3
yea literally just HoR
HoR AKA 6s and meme
the ice dps options you had were
like you understand that before 4.8
4.6
ice was in a fucking rough spot
when i joined
honestly
ima is the new psy
you gotta do a lot to beat HoT
END HRT HoT
cause if she's weak she's getting the fucking boot
honestly that will depend on flamescion
outside of when they force you to use multiple element
also yea that's what i'm thinking too, i really doubt HRT is going to be good enough to replace anyone in another elemental team
while both teams get better
so the gap stays pretty close
but as JK ranks go higher, both teams performance increase
the thing about JK and HoH is that s0 JK dps and s0 HoH with s0 JK support gap is pretty close
self buff while ice, team buff for lightning fire
it's okay to talk about this, they confirmed on bbs post about her release
i mean not even 3s JK
what a deal
just for her to be a slightly better JK
and i still regret
i even got lucky!
like what even the fuck
is HoH
that the investment i regret the most of this year
it's actually disgusting
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
and now where the fuck is she
i pulled for her
i was promised one
i don't fucking know either
and then go for stamps to get her 2s
and her gear
and pull kiana
and pull elf
still gotta pull for gear with refund banner
i mean mei is gonna be free
what a schedule
herrscher -> support -> support -> herrscher -> herrscher x2 -> support
unless something changes
<:peepoexit:966048314808209438>
so i'm prob buying CN, going all in on bronya and taking my leave
i prob can't afford CN + bronya + kiana + mei
or i stop having fun
i'll keep playing until i'm forced to skip an important valk
but my stance always was
i've said it a bunch as hyperbole
i don't keep saying that
reached retirement age
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
i'm skipping everything after bronya
who would've thought
and i'm skipping her
last kiana
last kiana has to be awk of the best kiana
it makes too much sense imo
yea probably
so kiana simps prepare yourselves
awk is more expensive btw
END is def going to be awk
also
i'm not gonna argue with that
SI kinda has good tf
i mean i understand they not wanting to give that to player, they're fucking cowards, that's all
PE and DA lead skill are also very different, still share
like 6s is DP awk
and they still share
tons of awk valks have v different lead
it doesn't matter
<:Shrug:616394597211439118>
DB and LE are farmable
eh
VC awaken <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh there's VC actually
and HB
besides SW
i don't think there's any bronyas to awaken
for the price of 4/4 s0
discount banner is good because you get 4/4 and s2
for standard s-rank
it's something like 65 + 92
quick maths
9k
what the fuck mihoyo
like
owo math 190 * 280
like there's nooooo way
like they just haven't announced it yet
right?
there isn't a free stig box
there's no way
is CN complaining yet
why do they do this
i'm so mad
this game is fucking bullshit
dante
hmm
standard valk like aponia, HoH? fucked over
only herrscher gets good tf nowadays, like PE and 7t
nice joke
good tf in 2023
lmao
tf she judgin
simple acronym
HoBotFSIKF
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
herrscher of kalpas
like log in twice a month, read story, and pull skins
idk what do casual players do in this game?
yeah you guys have fun with
smh wanting more powercreep
we got one in 5.3
this blows LMFAO
cause like END team will still be END AE CN
prob right
do we even pull for CN gear
retirement angle
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
and each will have individual shill
and then each valk will just be standard S-rank strength on their own
and the bull
the 3s bella
2 bosses as shill
i'm guessing trio team will only have like
yeah like
6.4 END flamescion HRT
cringe
HoF HoT HRT
oh i guess she is going to take 3s bella even right now
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
i mean i guessed that but
okay
god fucking
sounds like skill issue
that sounds like fun
that auto purges
can we make a channel
literally 1984
1984
they upgraded her engrish too
are we on lie mode right now
truth mode
LMFAO is the version fucking called
idk if they usually do actually, i think they do? so yea i also think it's sus
of just aponia booba
i'm surprised there are no emotes
you know
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOO
she's fucking alone here
tet just unlocked single player <#973924771727290399>
and not get annoyed over it
i can say that aponia design blows
okay now that i'm blocked
<@309634550273933314> free ayaka ar42
<@309634550273933314> tet you won't fucking believe there's a new valk in this game
<@309634550273933314> come see the new valk she just got revealed
new valk reveal
yo <@309634550273933314>
RRRR
heRRscheR of tRuth
HRT
pretty simple
HerrscheR of Truth
the HRT is real
she's HRT
HRT
idk
if it's a support then....
if it's a dps i can skip it
i hate it here
this schedule blows
i just wanna retire
idk man
hopefully, not? i think?
yea hard to know
yea i fucking wish
but my BKE also deals ice damage
and on the trailer it looked like she dealt ice damage
she's confirmed img
i think so yea
okay
so you were wrong
oh
didn't look like it in the trailer
is she even mixed damage
i think rn she prob doesn't steal it still
but that's clearly for new trio team
prob not yet
like bella? that'd be kinda fucked
i mean what else can she even steal
probably
she's pretty but i wish she didn't exist
whoa sheeesh
<:MichiLook:694715448708694036>
am lookin
hmm?
keep up
we got HRT, END and flamescion
HRT
i'm not even getting myself bronya for free
i'm skipping
lookin great, lookin great
sheeesh
v2v would've had a higher than avg lifespan for current s-rank
that would mean
if mihoyo released a hitcount qua valk that stole all of v2v boss
actually it'd be stupid if one of the 3 new valks were qua with high hitcount, is just literally straight stealing what v2v is
actually that does make me wonder
oh is that a new qua hitcount mob?
keepin the v2v alive are they
lmfao
surely adding a cooldown to pausing will fix all of honkai's issues
can ask anyone else here, i suck
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
yea all credit card no skill
<a:PeepoLeave:622861118355931186>
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
why am i getting worrymad'd
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
i also dunno what i'm doing
well
more time with 2s boss
actually i think i'm glad
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
same
that's kinda baby still i think
o ic
levelling is so fast now
5 months old? LMAO
so that means you are like
some of the other people in this server tho.....
you have excuse for that
you're baby right
<:OKo7:996159198318571560>
make good use of the asterite until then warriors
we have 4 weeks left of no sp farming
<:pepeW:996346590086303805>
or is there an important date i'm missing
is there one every patch and i didn't notice?
why y'all think we getting a time capsule anw
so i can buy more event stig
cause it gives more homu coins
kinda like double valk patch
i lowkey
i keep mixing cioara with cecilia
the tastiest cope
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
i am bringing everyone to the lightning mei that is a fire support
my brain too small
more than that too far for me to predict
up to 6.5 i hard agree
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
i guess that doesn't matter we still go for her 3s anyways
is 3s CN even that big
back to sp valk mine i go
nvm i guess
this <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> close to being catch up and able to throw away asterite at every skin i see
spending it on metal ig
finished like in the middle of last patch, gonna feel good to have a whole patch of idk
i finally have them all <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i see
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
how can you both have no asterite and no sp valk
like you're supposed to be poor on asterite cause you're spending it all on sp valk
???? wdym
a lot of metal?
like ik i whaled a bunch so i have the upperhand but i feel like you should be higher than that
only 2 3s sp valk
whoa where you spending that asterite tho
normal i think
yea?
so you're telling me you aren't allowed to complain
i see
hm
means i'm dry
but next patch new sp valk and new pri
since i only have 2 pri 60/65 i wanna max
i'm this <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> close to having asterite start piling up
and i don't have asterite to throw away like that
i literally have all sp valk 3s
how y'all bitches have so much asterite
when 2 stamps
i'll be at 136
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
70 frags
yes the fall guys event is lasting the entire fall guys event
...yes?
baban retirement = spring break
baban retirement = leaving for a few days
you may come back but i will make fun of you
it's this patch
what's that, old man? slow ult? fast ult?
oops slow ult, gotta reset
i'll be like streaming my runs to newbies
even though it makes no difference
i'll keep resetting over it
yea that's the issue tho
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
getting rid of tech <:smoke:808652033007157258>
would make fast ult useless
timestop lowkey kinda fucked tho
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
give her timestop and make her buffs compatible with JK's
and bronya doesn't get a new suit
is prometheus S-rank
the bronya from the kiameibro teaser
would it be funny if
o shit time to complete my event set
and it looks so good too
kinda crazy that CN is actually a chakram user that uses the chakram as a chakram
only better than bingo is like bp/free from event
it's paid, so if it's bingo that's best case scenario
i mean there's no <:Dead:998259390605971496> there
like often in RL you still used raven cause she's alright if you only need to ult once
for RL yea absolutely actually
ty
damn moriso heard my question
i thought i typod LMFAO
you got me
just keeping my spreadsheet up to date
alright thank you <a:catgib:564829264466149378>
wait is it chrono navi or chrono navigator?
isn't there a triangle looking character in there
yea
she's like AI/\ or some shit
<@218762069338619906> do you have ai chan name
i wanna bet on 6.5/6.6 valk
do we have cyan ball name already
it's like we're doing this cause we know you're about to get fucked
i mean unironically tho
LMFAO
6.4 cny all in
guess i'm skippin
probably SW type banner then?
that's just maincord
recommended for investment
mihoyo said so
should i pull for her? i really love rita
another gacha for me to bait maincord over
LMFAO
LMFAO okay that's p cute
<:peepo:871587355948101643> <a:cumTime:1004274798823739474>
just because the number is lower doesn't mean anything
with 18 cum cubes to max, we'll prob be able farm about 4 or 5 per day
right now it takes 60 nanos to max, and we farm 15 per day
it'll be less time to farm them
i really really doubt
v simple, v straightforward
and then just MPE tank HoT BKE
the 786 HoH kasumi again
ooo i wanna play that week
i use her like 2-3 times per patch
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
same actually
i'm pretty sure in practice it's just very spicy fps scam
yeah it gets pretty bad
like making the cd 3 times as short would still fix stuff like that and i think that's fine
did you see the shit you can pull off now?
well, not being facetious now, it's really not
ty
yes
then i don't mind
if they make the cd twice or 3 times as short
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
i unironically feel like i could go double or triple the patch length before a new release before getting bored of not having anything new
no one will mind
slide in some 7 week patches
<:GWsetmyxPeepoEvil:405337570952740864>
just make it 8 patches per year instead
2021 cny -> 4.6
2022 cny -> 5.5
i'm pretty sure 1 year is 9 patches
carv destroyed me with facts and logic <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482> sorry carv-senpai
we were having a big string of 5 week patches
like around HoF release
i mean i guess i shouldn't be surprised
cool cool cool
cool
i think
yea i asked if that was an important date and you ignored me LMFAO
did... i?
me next?
my latest illiterate escapade
my latest illiterate escapade
do you wanna see
.
literally didn't read
cringe!!!!!
<a:PeepoLeave:622861118355931186>
fuck off 5 week patch
is that a funny schro T reference
i can't believe that tet... wait oh shit is this a budget tesla band T? nvm ty tet
i'm gonna have as stig to remember you, according to you
but it doesn't work like it sound like
like after exit on stig effect sound pretty straight forward
i mean, lots of shit is common sense but still worth it to try it out
apparently it is
yea that's what i wanted to check
it's the epic games thing
try using this code
HBPAZNPMV6RT
yo anyone global logged in right now?
that one i ask myself every day though
literally didn't read my next message
keeping up the streak
cherry with the 2 days in a row roast
damn!!!!
not in lore
no i mean, the irl people
i think all the stigma are of dead people
i miss using shui
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
unironically worth it in 4.6
i agree
not an option to use any of them, all of them
yes, diy senti
still useful info even for f2p player
or card + stamps on spending
i mean it's only a matter of time until she's made craftable
yeah sorry for giving you more info than you asked for
are the good rank ups
s1 -> 2s -> 3s
almost 3 3s jk
holy fuck
why the checker pattern
yeah that's ugly as hell LMFAO
just cope with griseo even on shield boss
i mean if you have cez but not any paga, then you ain't using shui SNS in any boss
there's a 946 with HoS dps using shui
like this week
yea i'd still do it eventually, there's still use for it on ss MA
if you have cez you prob ain't using shui soon
just weaker than paga/cez
shui still p strong
depends on how much phys support gear you already have
did they fix abyss heimdall
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
I'M SO FUCKING SMART
HOLY FUCK
Thank you carv for your honest work
i'd still not fuck him up
like if a dog from a video game showed up in front of me
that's still fucked up i think
i think
for no reason
we just fuck him up
but in honkai lore
i know in genshin lore we are just like sparring
yea i think we're the villain here
a dead guy's pet
so we're beating up
you have no image
that doesn't sound right
really?
wait
ooooooooh
good take bruh
that's a good deal
2 in one
i dunno genshin lore
that's just his wolf form or smth
andrius is a guy no?
those fuckers have 20 hp bars
i dunno if it's the easiest difficulty
you can really tell she's an MA boss
oh the transition looks kinda sick tho
*spawns genshin mob*
🕴️
now i've been hit enough
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
it's obviously unfinished but looks kinda boring
jesus hare bossfight looks bad LMFAO
<a:PU_peepoRiot:778676108152274974>
fuck genshin, fuck andrius
it's a matter of principle
doesn't make me any happier
i mean i bet
maybe it's a bug related to bella in forge
it is a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> worrying that new player might craft it tho
maybe not like newt/ppm cause it's too iconic but like old shit? might aswell make it craftable
tons of shit on dorm exchange too
lowkey i think like close to everything should be craftable
rather it be there
i would actually
that's so funny
it really is
LMFAO
i don't like this
no one told me about this
f17 who
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
come back HoF
same actually
lowkey ice kinda blows if HoF steals back <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
issa shield boss, i'd think JK would make her keep it for longer
with CN
is it going back to HoF?
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
bus in 2 hours
i'll grab the bingo when i get home
<:tsuncat:960584739914412042>
don't wanna
3. new ER stamps
2. they change all the words in CN kit but her gameplay and performance stay basically the same
1. fhd costs more than 12 balls for no reason
i'll make v2 predictions
right here right now
isn't it right now
isn't it today
when v2
breathing
she livin
wdym barely
just livin in the future, they are
<a:SakuraLaughing:774340838976651265>
i get it now
oh LMFAO
similar to the HoH datamines
those were datamines cause PE was playable in story
LMFAO that was different
if this was genshin we'd have models + kit + release date all leaked at this point
better security than genshin
gotta give it to them
can't wait
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
9s
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
after so many months
to use lightning on wolf
are we finally able
holy fuck
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
this is like them fixing yae's shit in genshin
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
they just choose to care about it now
i mean i really doubt it's been running under the radar
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
this 9s damage
and now they care to fix it by putting bandaid fix instead of working on w/e the fuck is causing it
since fucking forever
but it's been this way
i mean yea
and it is going to affect MA players
is a dumb change if they keep it
and most of the times you do it by just pausing a few times to get the timing properly
like on most FT strats
there's plenty of strats that you need to pause as soon as sp drops so you can pick it up asap
even without strats that abuse pausing breaking the game
it still matters in MA
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
or else i'll
it fucking better
it used to be an AE skill test to fill it efficiently <:PepeHands:909232418211364957>
also i'm upset that CN does all the ignite trauma
i swear to fucking god
i'll fucking kill a person if turg cat is still around for fire
SpA skin pwetty....
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
you make it sound like they care
i pulled 2s PE and then i skip every abyss of hers because it's too annoying <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
literally 0 thoughts in my mind
i put 200 days of welkin to buy keqing skin and fucking quit the next day
i'm too stupid to calculate value
sunk cost fallacy my ass, you think i fall for that shit?
<@468680026162724864> wdy think
remove me from the game
<:meisad:985200605133946901> <:Moon:655491828035878912>
has more hp bars than actual heimdall
that abyss heimdall mob
is it weird
L-nya
bingo time <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
holy fuck you're so right!!!!!
damn that 3pc on the stig is broken
too op to have another 12% tdm on the team? <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
....why LMFAO
from CN chakram
Team Total DMG +12% (unstackable).
like hepha sucks but it's also kinda following 2s design, where there was an attack where he literally went immune if you didn't have freeze on the team
idk if it's sus af, that's like following with 2s design of bella
really doubt they'll last second fuck all that work up by forcing one option
with like different mechanics and shit
prob has different forms depending on which xtal you break on transition
boss looks designed to be beatable with any elemental team
it looks like the opposite
i mean the way it looks right now
for like an ok score
i think it's fair to assume that you'll want more than one element for top score though, but i think you can get away with mono element team
and then for p2, damage didn't look that bad after streamer broke ice xtal and tried dealing ice damage
so you either need to deal enough damage to kill her through high resistances or wait until bar regens
i don't think you can kill her p1 in just one res bar
i don't think so, necessarily
gj mihomo
interesting challenge to bring more than one type of damage, kept the interesting part from 2s fight
kinda like this 3s boss ngl
transition is sorta long but the attacks look at least interesting to dodge as opposed to pig
sorry
prob gets res based on which one you destroy
and then depending on which one you destroy, i assume she gets a different form
one for each type of damage
transition looks pretty simple, it spawns 3 xtals
actually interesting boss tho, if the transition isn't fucked up i'm up for it
yeah the damage is laughable, i dunno what the plan is there
yeah not actually 0 damage but like, it looks like actual insane damage resistance
that's what it looks like to me
i thiiiink
while bar is empty, you deal way less damage with that damage type
and then when it's empty, it goes on cd and slowly regens
it starts with 3 full bars, everytime you deal [type of damage], that bar empties up
if you empty up the bar
do you actually do 0 damage
not that bad
shield stregth
i think it's like around same level as otto prob
445 yeah
yea that's not thaaaaat bad
is that NA RL dist or CN RL dist LMFAO
i mean i wanna know how much are we fucked
unironically 3 phases? LMFAO
what the fuck 3 phases?
actually i think it's p similar to
i don't like what i'm seeing with this kallen shield
beta dist again
what's
stupid valk LMFAO
i'm watching JK gameplay and i thought whoa she's kinda having sp issues rn and then she farted and went from 145 -> 185
LMFAOOOO
and +10 atk
and you get a valk that is 2x better
to pull 7tr
literally use 1/3rd of the xtal you'd use on boobnia
why do i even bother
kinda stupid but ok
i see why 3s JK has hitcount now
oh damn
kinda nuts
until now
nothing
and after that just
like 5.0 we had the BR in ER and himeko on HoF stigs
this is the first time since 5.0 that mihoyo acknowledged himeko exists
wait this is lowkey kinda big isn't it
those are just pretty colors to me
LMFAO
never fucking mind what she's doing there
i don't even know what the fuck she does by default
LMFAO
those unironically just are using favonius greatswords
that's not haha how funny they look similar
what the fuck
that's so bad
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
not by removing how we deal with it
but they should fix it by removing the time you can't pick sp pack up
it's really really stupid
so you can pick it up asap
you pause the game cause that animation plays while paused
where you can't pick it up
sp pack has like 1s drop animation
it's the time it takes to drop
it's not the range that's the issue
honkai is so fucking bad
like pause scam is stupid but it's a solution to an even stupider problem, which is sp pack bald
???????????????? that's so fucking bad
what the fuck
might make me quit
that actually
??????????????????????????????????????
mihoyo forgot about main feature of the game
imagine having good tf in 2022 LMFAO
i dunno doesn't look like it
a lot of these were memes, i'll do better next time
it's just turg cat again, dumbasses
yea right
that feels wrong LMFAO
no space
????
yea i don't like 3s bella design
p sure we were talking about abyss one but that's also pretty good info ty carv <:Prayge:909232418463047690>
LMFAO that's a great one
prob typeless
so she ain't mech/psy/bio
bella is neutral to AE and CN
give a sec, when streamer starts fighting again i'll confirm
battle arsenal
it's nunya
okay so we all in agreement, for the v1 bingo card i should mark fire team still suck
yeah i knew about that all along
this is v1 bingo card
do i mark fire team still sucks on my bingo card LMFAO
that looks awful to play, fits fire team so well, i'm so proud
very satisfying
i like the sfx from CN already, even though it's only v1
also power's back, i'm watching the stream
rip
raven skin looks good amount worse in valk select screen
yeyeye
the fire thing there is just kalpas himself having medium fire resistance
the weather isn't ranged up fire down, it's prob like standard ranged weather
i mean yea i'm saying that
kalpas just has medium fire res, makes sense ig
this is just boss stats, not weather, no?
excited? i had my pitchforks up already
crisis averted
phew
that is insane
god another 3s day 1 for the lead alone what the actual fuck
WHAT?????????????
WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT LEAD
?????????
nice work mihomo
good, the better of the 2 is free both times
4 skin patch?
i like the skins <:peepoSit:1016193458307862609>
honestly ill take that, 3s fire boss sounds fun, double points if its HoF food
yeah everythings alright, just a kusasmol of rain makes power go out deadge
70 i would still be 20 off
would be enough for me to 2s2
so i wouldnt be surprised...
last free herrscher we got, we got more than 70 frags if you already had valk im p sure
fucking power went out LMFAO, keep me updated on the beta news guys
<:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
<a:aworryPopcorn:470253910750396417>
<:tsuncat:960584739914412042>
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384> treat the newbies to this discord server better
LMFAO that's very cute
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
she sleeps anywhere she can lie down on LMFAO
she chillin
she didn't answer, very rude
my cat is sleeping right next to me and when i typed that i startled her awake LMFAO
beta doko
i can help with that
with nya cause i'm a catgirl
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
L-nya is just
L-nya
L-nya moment
the one guy and the vtuber
of every beta
i should bookmark them, they're the same 2 right
thank you
<:scaramouch_lurk:925161879322624110>
beta streams
do we have
yeah but we'll have more stuff to spend it on, p sure we won't be any better or worse on asterite situation
but it's nice QoL nonetheless
dunno if this direct purchase is a better or worse deal than that
you buy honkai pieces -> craft basic stigs -> get rid of them
you could already buy ncc with coin tho, to be clear
30 purchases per day
140k for 100 ncc
everyone about to be poor like me LMFAO
directly
you'll be able to buy affix mat for coin
oh shit
the <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> ones are useless
ok that was pretty outdated too
or are they removing some coin boxes only
no more coin boxes?
yea i turbo agree
weird currencies? cause i agree i think
what were you talking about?
i swear
that's my only dirty joke for today
i'll play nice
LMFAO sorry
lack of cum?
they don't specify right
for the free HoT
i wonder if we're getting more than 70 frags if we already have valk
am i free
<:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
actually?
LMFAO
battle arsenal is gone
help
where are y'all getting this info
what the fuck
is it a bbs post
what?
what is this patch?
source????
????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????
??????????????????????????????
what the fuck
??????????????
:D
for me
2s2
oh shit
me snorting up he/hims in the school bathroom
look i can stop anytime i want alright
that's not a gendered word wtf
n-no! i'd never! how could i??
is also damage for HoH tho
CN is a new fire sp valk, *** can help the team by....
extra 30 mins for moriso to post, our lord and saviour <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
1 hour-nya
you should lie about that in the future
that's kinda sad
wait you have an acc?
genshin has 2 skins twice per year <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
genshin wish it was us
kinda insane
we actually got so many skins last patch
wasn't griseo patch summer patch?
yeah it was, wasn't it?
and now prob 3 patch long egyptian theme
we had like 3 patch long summer with swimsuits
they're enjoying doing multiple patch event/skin theme huh
the french?
hire fans lol
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it actually makes me cackle so bad, the edit is so awful too
hire fans
the tweets fixing the horizon zero down mc are so fucking funny
agree it's at least kinda entertaining stupid
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
look i'm not against black people, but, it is just historically innacurate
like there's youtube channels that only do content like that
it does happen very often if you're on the wrong circles tho
tell them to get fucked, L-nya
i mean sure but why would you care about those types of people opinions
normal people don't ask that, review your friend circles
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that just begs the question what kinda people you hanging around with
i mean
i'm glad we get this instead of actual halloween skins <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
racist halloween <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
the mobius and SpA are also halloween
let him catch up rq
bruh living a few hours in the past
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
instead of culture appropriation skins <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i wish we got actual halloween skins tho
i like both
and now that other character get same theme skin now you're horny
everyone was hating on the hot mobi skin
L-nya
another downgrade skin from pink HB
yikes
but both of them could be paid
SpA has yellow particles = vfx change on idle
i'm guessing it's raven's
if one of them is free
they're hot
oh fuck
is it later today v1?
i mean yea like i said i really don't doubt they'll just make her fix all raven issues
she's just exponentially worse the longer a fight goes on, which is how nirv fights been trending towards, while AE has decent sp farm
i just think that if they didn't, raven wouldn't be able to hold her ground
and i dont doubt that they will
i mean again, they def can just minmax the new support to work with raven specifically and shill her out through yhat + boss design
that just makes AE even faster
tet wants me to call her MiA
if AE is getting sp while i'm doing other shit then it doesnt really matter does it
the problem is field time
i mean of course
if you dont have to farm sp shes def prob better, i guess, so if new fire sp just gens that much sp
trying to ult twice is just painpeko
if the boss aint made for her and doesnt drop a fuckton of sp on transition
i dunno, i feel like often made in abyss is just way slower, like
HoF still my favorite valk of last year and a lot better than a lot of this years valks
none of those felt bad compatibility wise, only felt bad cause the supports suck
and now with turg cat
on release with SoS SR, then with made in abyss when that came out
i feel like HoF is a sick valk, shes been working well with plenty of different support
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
HoF/SpA can easily live without raven if the boss doesnt force it
imo
i think v2v will want to keep raven more than HoF
unless they hepha tank we optimised the need for a bow user on tank <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
at worse a niche support
also raven aint gonna be dead yet, the one HoF boss in abyss needs a bow user
by messing with sp gen and buff timers enough
but they could always force the new support to work better specifically with raven
i do think between the 2, AE wins out if the new support is neutral
i only hate her less than turg cat
i know how to play her and i still hate her
why fix old boss when you can just retire them
heimdall found dead on a ditch
but nowadays all tf you get are from skills and shit, barely if at all dodge boss attacks
the reason stun sucked is because it stopped the boss from attacking you = no way to dodge = no tf
and you don't interact and play around boss moveset to get tf nowadays
no because like 90% of bosses are immune to stun
nowadays it barely matters tbh
easy answer, boss that takes 30% more damage when stunned
i hear you saying isn't stun bad
LK reborn, stun support
new phys sp <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>

<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
LMFAO
cause lookin like i'll use her until 6.2
i'm glad i'm getting my HB next week
... cool
not that'd i'd spend the xtal on it anyways
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
why'd they fuck up the other half
like horse skin PE is very pretty and very sick
it's just don't make a skin that's a downgrade tyvm
it's not the trick of concept art for me
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
it's just downgrade from default on-horse
why
with the worst non-horse outfit
i hate how they picked the one
<a:KianaSpin2Win:509211247120482306>
glb gets what we call shafted
i think they got it reset on cny too
but not for us plebeians
for CN/SEA it should be reset
hmm
jesus mihoyo doing last second patch notes hours before maintenance?

and pull for gear dumbass
need 2s to function, here's adv supply
it's going to be some shit like
i mean even if they are augment
yeah
doesn't really get me much hype
like it's cool but it just makes me think of how expensive this game is LMFAO
but like that's kinda w/e to me
yeah i saw the 3 new s-rank teaser
that fucking blows actually <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
just the 6.1 pv?
story teaser
wait is the
what did i miss
aw ok
oh did i miss it?
when is stream again?
but i'd like to have more time to save up metal
yeah
<a:NOOO:996348845803966524>
my asterite
wtf you mean saved
yeah i think so
pretty stigs
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
uneventful
that was
yeah the base base one
i think either, just something was fucked with optimisation of the model
literally just any not base one
for a while, base roza skin was awful cause for some reason it just caused insane fps drops
over others
competitive advantage to some skins
i wonder if there's still
LMFAO that's pretty funny
and outside the horse it's not that good
she's so pretty on the horse, and the horse looks kinda bad
i still don't know how i feel about the skin
o i see people were talking about SK because of PE pyramid skin
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
ayy i have been saying it right
background: we did this for the booba
last longer and don't blind as much
yeah HoR's look way more intentional
HoH's was seizure bait LMFAO
it lasts way longer than 3 frames
i mean HoF is very different
just flash bangs you for 0.02 seconds
feels like a bug to me in v1
i mean it'd look cooler if it lasted a bit longer
it's like literally 3 or 4 frames tho
o yea i see it
we're talking about cocks n shit
i mean i don't blame jayson
was kinda crazy
on v1
a huge cock
<:DogKek:665979913332981812>
then yea they removed it
cause if it was a thing and is not anymore
was it even a thing?
idk
on HoH?
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
was on HoF release
just to look at a valk
i think the last time i stayed on valk select screen
HoH so pretty
but because i'm ptsd
not cause i can't rn
i'm fine
0s HoV and maru
as long as she still
o i see
she got nerfed?
oh
wait who
it just feels kinda bad
so
if that makes sense
2 weapon 4 stigs in 60 pulls -> 4 weapons 4 stigs in 60 pulls
like it's not bad if you get like
apparently it is higher weapon rate, but still as good for stigs
i've come around to skemsal
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
and if we assume that's the case, i'm pretty sure it'll be on SoE
where they don't put it on banner
yea there's no world
so 420 in total
140 per piece
if they don't do a banner
in less than 5 weeks
to get the set
yea that's the only way
star of eden
that'll be the only way to get liu qi
there's no way
it still would take 5 weeks to craft liu qi
like 3p ana, all the fuel
coffee did the math, even if you had all the mats saved up
liu qi is going to be on SoE banner
it's kinda obvious
i mean
no i know what i said
pull all 3
bruh after going through everything in nhentai:
but i'm never horny to use it LMAO
it's so funny
i love that emote
i wish i was more horny
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
sin?
<:peepoRiot:598608041990029313>
i don't trust robots
i got fucked over plenty already in python
and their math
robots
i never trust
Owo math (500 * 280) + (60 * 280) + (200 * 150)
does owo do order of operations
eli's not going to care
unless it's mini seele
just skip elf tho
then it's a lot more expensive
i mean yea if you're going for elf and support gear
<a:NODDERS:832470682721583175>
i'm very good at typoing
same
that's days
o was about to ask if that was new slang
so <:shrug:877047647511384064>
like simp in the way that i'd want to save for 3s
i don't thin i'm anyones simp
thing is
with what i have
for the rest of my life
and retain at least RL
save from now on
i mean i could probably
sheeesh
o wow
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
right on time?
so
a year is 9 patches
just get lucky
prob achievable tho
owo math 500 * 280
sorry
about 500 for 3s 4/4
no, it's 400 for only 3s
o wait
112k
owo math 400 * 280
for 4/4 3s
gotta save about 400 pulls
if we're assuming non-awk
as f2p
to 3s on release
a whole year
are you saving
just interesting cause i'd think they wouldn't need to touch that anymore LMAO
it's beta they're allowed to have bugs
not shitting on them this time
wonder how that even happens
weird bug tho
and ig now fixed
but then they announced that that was a bug
where it turned into nyx
yea there was a bug a bit back
they'd had announced it already
i feel like if there's any other good deals
the free 10 pull from sushang banner
like they already announced
probably not
<a:PingChomp:1002644813985890304>
1.37 sp/s
i'm at...
no like 3 sp/s lines
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
holy shit i got 3 sp/s
MA <:Woke:759887282042830889>
2 sp/s 4 atk? 2 spcr 4 atk? 6 atk?
2 sp/s?
so what's HoH affix
yea idk
god her rank ups suck though
then i'll just get 2s nyx through bp
like if nyx is in next bp season
maybe i'll change my mind by then tho
but nyx is gacha only
i'm getting 3s JK eventually
eh i'm broken in the head
poor nyx
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it's so bad
jesus
i guess i'm getting s2 nyx
hey i was waiting for anniv, finally it's here and i'm ready to pull for ely!
found my next bait
When equipped by Bronya:
they can hit them with the
i mean
yeah it's going to be the best budget
first official honkai porn <:HYPERS:813514718093508618>
is it?
JK reveal -> beta v1 -> DK gameplay reveal -> event info reveal
kinda stacked few days of beta info
i think we're getting event stuff, prob including spending event stuff, info today
put that dev time on anti cheat system mihomo
ofc i'd like better fuel income, but that doesn't need a system rework
this one is very easy to follow
rng fiesta, so overly complicated and obtuse
last system was thorough bs
it's pretty good right now
...why
another?
yeah that works, thanks
yeah i remember seeing it but i don't remember where
like selected in the inventory
for me to share
a pic of the weapon
does anyone have
maybe they change it
yeah but i think it's at 2s rn
what the actual fuck is this shield lmfao
i could see that
oh, in that case
cause that sounds boring
we have like an OW that's just very similar to this one
but would that just mean
this OW really looks and feels like the last one to me
but also
unless they do an extra long arc, but i dunno if people would enjoy spending the rest of main story in this OW
cause i think we have time for 2 new arcs?
well actually actually i have no clue
it actually probably isn't the last
good send off
looks sick
yeah this last OW
whoa
same amount as my acc after the patch
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
PE has less bosses
i guess between PE and BKE
o ok
isn't v2v qua
<:E_think:793918036787986453>
BKE?
<@180679257851166721> who's bleed v2v even for
if you don't, then it's cheaper to direct craft
then it's cheaper to use it
if you have peary
you just cheese it out by killing her before she can use it
2s HoV also has that mechanic
that's just normal tho
you'd still not run bastet B
i doubt she will have sp issue but even if she does
and manage your rots better to deal with the sp issue
is just better to run outright damage
you still don't run bastet B
like nyx and HoH
even valks with high sp need
literally from the most braindead comp to the longest rot comp with one change in valk <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
on non-cat dps
you'd still not run bastet B
to a 1/3rd of what it is rn
even if they nerf her sp gen
i'd go for it if it was me
that's going to be a lot of fun to play in abyss
HoR's own eden
maybe? interesting design if so
not sure about that one though
nini is using us like an ouija
just spend all sp and the more you spend the more damage you do or w/e
yeah i dunno maybe they do some SN bs
op valk
no it's WC batterying her
did you watch the video by chance
it's so excessive, idgi either tbh
to farm sp
and it still wouldn't be an issue
like they could cut it in half
yeah
look at fucking that lmfao
i mean even with 150sp cost ult
it looks very excessive
i mean i don't really know either
LMFAO
press 2 buttons, sometimes hold one, if you're feeling spicy hold the other
you don't get more complicated than
i mean it's honkai 2022
just self regen, just a fuckton
yeah
eden2: the valk
that's one way to not make cat as good LMFAO
what the actual fuck
you're like well this doesn't look as bad and then sp just goes fucking <:stonks:803115797140078602>
no only to self on entry
holy fuck
watch and you'll know
what the fuck
the sp on this girl
jesus fuck
the design isn't that good otherwise LMFAO
but i'm gonna be honest vfx from morbmaid carries the skin
i mean yea vfx is SSS tier
you usually have good skin opinions
tet you're not like this
knight is horsey
and skin guardian form is downgrade from default knight form LMFAO
is that skin knight form is SSS tier
the issue with the skin
eden got the water sfx too waow
i'm always a sucker for those
fucking sick
into blueish teal
the small color change
her hair is <a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
at least mobi skin looks nice
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
to standard S-rank patch cost
yeah this patch just went from kinda cheap
lmfao what's that
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i really don't know
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and pull what i want (nothing)
i'm going to retire from the game
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
prob just go 3/4* ely + 4/4 JK + SoE
i'll have to do xtal calc later to figure out how much i can afford
too much hope on mihomo
yeah LMFAO
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
this is more like the dread i'm used to whenever a new patch drops, i was weirdly hyped and hopeful yesterday
<:MeiHue_lum:694766566046171166>
to reaffix my bastet
guess it's time
dunno about nirv retain without HoH but who the fuck cares
instead of as high as possible on t100
i can easily skip HoH
if i lower my standards to only t100
i guess i can't afford to think like that though LMFAO
i mean sure but how competitive is that
wtf you mean then
JK gear + SoE i'm already broke as hell
huodou and hepha is prob death
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
sushang support gear higher prio and SoE better bang for the buck, +10 atk and cheaper
i could see that though
i dunno feels wrong to skip herrscher
but yeah i guess HoH would be a better skip maybe?
oh by both i was thinking JK and SoE
yeah it's bs on top of bs
he's also quitting soon
fragile thinking on skipping HoH
can't afford both lmfao
guess just suck to suck
both look unskippable to me
<a:peepoLeave:646986909381558273>
yeah this
76 if 30 pity
for normal 50 pity banner
92.9
<:MeiHue_lum:694766566046171166>
this is pretty expensive
this is not cheaper
yeah i thought this was cheaper
lucky for me i think i really don't like this skin LMFAO
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
i swear to fucking god
i'm gonna fucking morb
like not a lot of damage
didn't look important though
yeah i noticed that too
<:MeiHue_lum:694766566046171166>
this is kinda sad dunno if i can afford 4/4 equipment on 6.1
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
that's one way to not make PE the best valk at your boss
yeah i guess
lmfao
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
downgrade on non-horse form
gets upgrade on horse form on skin
poor PE
this skin is lowkey p hot, nice
3 am for me
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
and come back to news
i think i'm taking nappies
like 2 n a half hours rn right
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
jesus
zzzz
me sleepy
until beta
how much time
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
even more hua?
you can get
my dreams come true
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
6 hua?
wtf is wrong with a person
and then KEEP SPOUTING THE SAME WROGN STUFF
but i don't run away when i am
i am constantly wrong
i am too
like being a dumbass is fine
that's prob the thing that annoys me the most about him
5.4
like wtf is wrong with him lmfao
yea see
lmfao
i don't think SW does that
babbling stuff out of his own mind
is he just
<:yippee:1002596802656223274>
cute icon
waow
don't get her banned though
i think
she'd prob not mind
waste of time
is just worthless
so sending more messages trying to reignite the argument
that's why he runs away LMFAO
like i think he knows he can't win cause he's wrong and just coping
i just don't think it'll work
i mean i want to reignite the argument
i think he knows he's in deep bullshit LMFAO
dia stopped answering
nah yeah don't worry
dia
and now he just stops answering
i'm fucking losing my mind
and we got that
that's like a worse deal than the 30+5 banner that first happened during last cn/sea anniv
i think global will get it
get rid of trash fight 2s HoV pls
but i feel like it's huodou
i hope it's HoV
which is not nothing but it's not a lot
but besides that i'm like missing 4% on every dorm bonus and 2% on every dk
my affixes kinda suck
i'm like almost completely catch up now if you think about it
so now i'm catching up
and keeb said well if you think like that you will
darius was like yeah i just do cope refs cause i'm always and will always be behind
keeb once said to darius
i dunno
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
i just don't wanna be behind anymore
which i can get by the middle of 6.0
the 112 is what 3s ely + 3s fr still cost
<:SucroseGlasses_yuduki_nh:781266154218979368>
i wanna have sushang day 1 and also start farming her frags early
it's prob possible right
i need 112 + 480 by the start of 6.1
how did that happen
:O
wait i'm at 47!
:)
20
i'm at
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
thank you for the help
so HF was for HotF before HoF existed
certain wave of boomers wanted all valks to have 2 letter abbreviation
is boomer abbr though
than HoF
HF is actually way more often HotF
just adding more now
KR
for valk
doing this order
that's why it's taking a while
in release order
i'm putting them
i forgot about HoR
why is it like that
lmfao
so aggressive
sw name
<>
with the spreadsheet
come help
no
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
no i'm making one myself
a new valk abbreviation list
okay i'm making
from getting into this hellhole
you get to save people
but i see that as a pro
the main argument against doing that is that it makes the discussion less approachable to new players, the confusion might make them quit
we just need to use her abbreviation more often so people know
yeah as long as people know that MA is a valk name there won't be confusion on whether you're talking about valk or gamemode
context fixes the issue dw
no one cares about SP being SP
who cares
no it's not, MA's dying anyways
yea cause she causes you cancer when you play her
midnight asbestos
and then we got MA and PV for the other 2 people don't use abbreviations for
i'll be kinder
sorry
HC is nice
which is a good abbreviation actually
v2v is helical contraption
stfu ruby
miss pink elf
good fucking luck
yeah and i'm going to start using them so you can start remembering
i thought it was anti herrscher bias
yeah idk wtf is up with fire
true
it's okay when it's only one of those but when all the valks are Like That, it's really tiring
like so is mobius, raven, fischl, sushang
my issue is not that it's confusing, my issue is that some of these names are too long, aponia is already too long of a name on some contexts
for all valks
new standardised abbreviation
on putting forth
i'm going to lead the new imy crusade
i'll call her dis or apo for now on
lmfao
yeah she also fucking has an i there
oh we put an i there so you know it's not divine prayer
DiP is also such a fucking bad abbreviation
aponia is annoying
cat is fine
v2v is fine
i dunno, i don't think so
i'll just start using them for all valks okay? get used to it y'all
i mean i know they have abbreviations but no one uses them
i hate it actually
SO fucking long
and it's
but now team names are like HoH sushang pardofelis
when like fischl ely mobi were the only ones
like it was fine back on fischl
that all new characters don't have well known abbreviations
i kinda hate
do you want me to link you some
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
read discord while you watch then, and sane discord servers at that
ty carl
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
it's a bad one
from reading comments
like what can you possibly gain
would you read comments
why
just prune your circles better <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
and like there's no HoH bait talk except for nini and ruby
i spend my time on competitive armadas and here
you're living in the wrong fucking circles then
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
she was available on multiple spending event and bp
no downsides unless you just hate HoR for some reason
HoT is already quite cheap
which is nuts
than HoT
cause she's even cheaper
HoR running the game would be SO nice
like actually
i for one welcome our new bronya overlords
they weren't broken op, very situational
if they kept them in
but imo valk would be more interesting and higher skill cap
that they fixed
she had some anicancels
tbf HoT wasn't that broken
LMFAO
that was last patch
that assumes it's been fixed since
game will break again like last patch is clearly wrong
yeah for once in my fucking life i'm not that upset over new patch
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
is that not cool?
new cheap meta ice dps?
i thought we were happy about that
aren't we happy with HoR dk
very useful surely
2s1 SN
i'll be getting
oh shit
but for MA kosma, yeah no, ever since it actually released anyone with eyes that looked at scores knows
she prob does
i think for abyss kosma
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
she... already was like ever since 3s kosma release
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
skill issue
i love you too baby
esp on a week like this
thats a really low bar tho
oh if the bar is t2% then yeah
nyx fucking sucks at kosma
nyx + HoT is not an option :ohnojuic
so shit like this is <:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
mihomo boss designs only has 1-2 answers per boss
i mean its piss easy week if you have v2v
so i can rage about it
waiting until ruby posts cn ma week
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
that makes sense
that's why she's hot
🦇
yeah i guess the people here who care about the meta already know the truth
tet is very impressionable
yeah see
i think some of us are starting to unironically believe those
hey we need to have a talk over those ironic x is bait memes
with just different weather
they would never put 2 of the same boss in the same patch
yeah
elf is lowest prio def
but yeah maybe
they already tuned it down a good amount
she matched SW score before the buffs
dunno if husk even is meant to be aponia's
i mean
gotta make sure they don't break the few fair 3s bosses i guess
that's fair
so who cares <:ohno:959752132905566261>
no one is stealing sss hepha
and every SSS boss is mega specialised for a few valks
SS MA is going to be fucking dead
cause like
why they bother touching her tf
honestly i don't even know
i didn't even need to open it to know
i'm so proud
i think
CN had it for a bit
yeah we didn't
instead of QTE doing 3s TF, QTE now activates evade skill
can't be having MA valks in current year can we
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
they nerfed her tf a good amount
oh
whatever carv says happens but slightly differently
99% chance it's not the translators at fault, but the work environment probably
i wish honkai in general wasn't so inconsistent
i wish they kept the same on EN
yeah
ty
ayyy nice, +1 for the of past motif
yo <@218762069338619906> what's EN name for villv pri?
into retirement schro T only meme player
join me carv
pls
my pfp
nqn
that is about expected lmao
mihoyo taking care of that one
i'm surprised so many people still skip sp gear
so many weird ass tricks for sim battle, it's actually kinda fun
and i also don't think you can 917 if you need to ult
i don't think you can 917 with trial valk
trick for tona tho is switching into KMB asap after it dies and dodging
my brain is fried i spent 30 seconds thinking wtf nyx in sim battle
i'm doing the math i don't even know if i'll afford 3* elf lmao
no
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
yes but the last one was HoS
cause like what would that even mean? next elf after ely elf isn't going to be ice, would ice team use off-element elf? i don't think mihoyo would want that
i wouldn't take ely having high sp cost being signal that new gen of elf is sp gen related
i mean, actually, i don't doubt but
i kinda doubt
ely elf? or you mean new gen of elf?
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
and cat's too
wasn't the HB skin around same price
i could get zhenyi T for 3rd TB
the only things i don't have are
dark star, eos gloria
columbus MB, dickens T, dante B, lee TM, goemon TMB
i think i'll be forced into getting the skin lmao
worries of a whale, i don't even know what i'm getting there
i think it's something something cost increases the more you use it?
i think
yeah her ult cost went from 100 -> 125
but i'll stay coping
actually from a storytelling perspective it wouldn't fit at all
start of new story arc, hua dies, we get new senti battlesuit which is like void drifter
where's my copium
HoS?
DA?
who even was the start of new generation of valk
i see the reasoning but i still think it'd be weird
hmmmm
i don't think they're going to this anniv though
i mean they're gonna eventually
mihoyo on 7.0: what's this memorial arena you tell me? a different gamemode that requires alternate skillset? wow player that sounds awesome, but no we never had anything like that, only abyss 1 and abyss 2
also lmfao with removing sim battle
anniv lv90 new systems?
i mean we're knocking on lv90 already
than just mihoyo kindness/more pris
a new use for pri resource would be more likely
it those changes are true, i'd prob say that
so there's a limited amount of old stuff they can go back and upgrade
no one fucking cares about lmao
but some old gacha weapons just
cause like, i can see some of them, like judah and stuff being pri'd
unless you mean just like straight up releasing dlc weapon for old valks
that they'd want to pri to make old valk useful
old weapons
like how many weapons are even there
but eh i dunno
-> doing 2 pri per patch, sometimes 3
doing 1 pri per patch, sometimes 2
they could go from like
that could be true
since a lot of pris are becoming straight up useless or extremely niche with the death of SS MA
arguably there's been a decrease
but pri stuff? that hasn't been an increase of how much pris people need to craft
so that makes sense
it's insane how much from nice to just good stuff there is now
there's SO MUCH to craft now
is overdo
like adding more UM rewards
that's because they're about to make more pri resource sink
like, if they're giving mroe pri resources
that they wanna make the game better, that is
LMAO
i don't believe it
i mean the thing is
the rest of the changes are lowkey scary
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
soo
and husk moveset isn't even that bad of rng
the rest aren't actual rng, just bullshit
husk moveset and andrius tornados
2 bosses
then that's like
cause if it's just fixing actual rng
i mean i wanna know what those changes are
from memory the only actual rng boss is husk
DA is just an fps gacha valk
and small positioning and timing changes let you magically clear BKE shield twice as fast
like mobius micro positioning on qte making her sometimes deal insanely more damage
most of the current rng is just pseudo rng with how valk interact with boss
do wonder though, there's not that much rng on 3s bosses
hmmm
wtf are problems where you can't kill yourself
so i'm a subsection of citrine
is just a specific kind of murder
which i guess
my solutions are ignore or suicide
local child becomes president by drawing porn their way up the power tree
LMFAO okay lets say for the sake of argument, i'm also a minor
i dunno if they'd let you know the answer
the porn lives in the tet's brain
of drawing porn
what are the repercussions
can they even do anything
<a:chad:969329762206093372> yes, wanna join me? <a:chad:969329762206093372>
<a:chad:969329762206093372> yes

oh wait i understood the including me wrongly
racist arc?
oh that's sick
what's my uid? no, just check me on ma t100
i'll just go yea you can add me, i'm keilo
i think there's some people that play honkai in my college class actually
that's going to be me in a few years
must be crazy to have a nirvana retainer professor
they said they once helped a student with abyss comp lmao
magery from blustorm is actually a teacher
like +10-15 atk is not even going to be 1/10th of a 1/3rd of an hp bar
atk affix matters but not that much
yeah no
f
but missing like 1/6th of hp bar or something
i can aaaaalmost do it in 2 bs
with the bug
with my mobius
maru
almost have enough damage to 0s
i lowkey
then giga slacc on my part
minimum
if i don't score double 893
and multiple s2+ gacha valk
i have literally every piece of equipment in the game
i have different standards
i mean you see
that sounds about right for ss MA
going woggers thats a 413 or whatever the fuck i thought was a good score in masters
i've been excited over like one hitting shit in MA
yeah i dunno i've never been excited over big numbers
it's for their own good
if they quit because of this
you know
eh
not untrue
cause i'll feel bad if they're just dumb new player lmao
is yae miko enjoyer a troll on wfp
it's crazy lmfao
are so fucking horny
like 70% of the designs
i dunno what went over with mihoyo for zzz
most often isn't sexual
yeah doesn't have to be sexual
if you like anthropomorphic animals you're furry
hei and char are furries?
and that's it i think
i mean we have heki
wooo
yeah
we have good people here
i think citrine is already on the team too
welcome to the team eli
freudian slip
LMFAO
bout to be really hard to t100 when 2 people play
lmao
especially since no one cares about MA
abyss is already baldier than MA
<@503044914016419840> <:duduL:963697489179975710>
yeah you can give me the makoto shinkai 2 title
it's a tragic story of fate
you run away together, and then scared of the future you both decide to make the hardest decision, retire (suicide)
genshin isekai
I Was Isekai'd Into Genshin And I Met This Really Cool Guy But Now He Got An Anemo Vision Overnight So I Have To Do Anything I Can To Not Die
you have to do your commissions (taking baths) daily or else you won't get your primos (nuggies)
my buds on the tet retiring (funeral) party: friends and family of tet, i'm so sad that tet has decided to quit (commit suicide). for all the t100s (doing well on school) and raid completions (making friends), she will be remembered nicely. may she touch grass (reach heaven) peacefully
that's the hidden strats
ruby you make it hard to defend you
as opposed to honkai, we actually recommend rolling for older valks, or else you'll go to prison (pedophilia)
don't go for nyx (becoming a teacher)
there's a small amount of powercreep
yeah gotta go for the newest valk (course) too
i appreciate that you go along with my lies
we're teaching life lessons to honkai player
monthly - rent
knight - life insurance
paladin - crack cocaine
rent and crack
rent
gj tet
i snort laughed when you used that quote
LMFAO
no variance either
it is still a great deal
so it's not that insane of a deal
that valk is 48 on avg
i've learned
i'm too busy quitting
what's that
the shill these days smh
mobius time
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
nothing
and what do i get
i might already be 21
wtf will i get when i get to 21
like right now
you have something to look forward to
yeah i mean exactly
by 70 you get to commit treason
30 you can use wheelies
like 25 you get a gun
i think they should stagger unlocks later into ages
we need some life patch notes
i stopped counting when i got to 18 cause i don't unlock anything new
around that i think
i dunno
aren't you exactly my age just uncultured
it is so pretty
cringe.
one of the first big ones
fred is an actual youtuber
the plot of that episode is that he made some fake drama with icarly and icarly thought it was real but when they went to talk about it it was just for views
and it's like a crossover with the actual youtuber
it's one of the episodes with fred
no i think you're misremembering lmao
have you watched icarly
you should know who fred is tet
wdym who's fred
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
oh god fred is old old, now i'm showing my age
fred did it
isn't that what big youtubers do
isn't markiplier on tv nowadays probably
+1
good bait
and those games
i like house flipper
sounds potentially fun
?
like take care of dead people
embalmer?
okay i got that through context
what's that even
cause i was trembling and shit LMAO
like physically, i couldn't complete the levels
but i couldn't get to it cause i was too scared
and i knew the jumpscare
i remember opening it when i was little
yeah that one
the one game
of those i only remember
lmfao
it's not even that like degen stuff, it's like reaaaaaaally normie
no it's you uncultured bunch
am i out of touch?
nah shut up everyone knows leetspeak
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
it's just standard internet knowledge
wtf you mean meme
i'm ancient i think
in discord terms
i'm past 21
she's siiiiiick
moth vtuber
it's fucking siiiick
have you seen the moth vtuber?
oh yeah there is that one moth vtuber
i guess they have fur
are moths furry?
no i lie for fun
it's anatomically accurate to moths
this is eden trying to play the piano
yeah and rationally thinking eden wouldn't want watermelon sized breasts, isn't she supposed to be a musician? how the fuck do you play a guitar with those? how do you see piano keys?
is it my fault it randomly showed up in my recommended? btw i bookmarked it here it is
oh i see you're fucking schrodinger booba critic now
or some shit like that
i think at that time hua mostly thought damn i wish i could go to school
i'm glad i can't read cause i was zoning out when he sent that message
yeah apparently aponia uses her extra hands to hold up her booba
yeah clearly not her clothes
of mantis surgeries
i guess that's on the more useful side
are you implying she uses her mantis form to hold up her booba
and still garfield on the place of garfield
its the garfield meme but with aponia instead of the woman
yeah? did she die of overbooba
aponia is better with a fucking breast reduction surgery, your back is going to be fucked up in a few years babe
it's but only what the hua deserves
well she can have a boring end of story where nothing interesting happens anymore, she can be just a great character
i would much rather she have an interesting ending, passing down the torch to another great character, and have a great arc and be the best character
which i guess is fucked up if you think about it
i mean you can want that, it'd just make for a boring story you see
if hua was a person i'd agree, unfortunately she's a character in a story, and i want her to be interesting more than i want her to be happy
anyway i'm right, you're wrong, you're too blinded by her beauty to understand that the most interesting way the story can go is hua sacrificing herself at the end of her duties after asking for help repeatedly from senti, asking one last thing please remember me, and then senti has to go through an arc about losing the most important person to her and having to live in her body and learn who she truly is, eventually maturing into her own person, no longer intrinsically tied to hua and with some sick skate tricks in apho3
issok ruby, everyone has to have some bad opinions
lmfao
my favorite character in honkai
hua is literally
cause i love senti and i wanna see her have character development and this is the easiest most straightforward way to have it
tet's upset cause i'm right
ah that makes sense
kill hua, give senti new battlesuit as she has to deal with her death and mature
LMFAO
i don't read cn lmao i thought it was taixuan related
yeah
on your stream
i only saw the image
maybe senti/sushang coming back
they teased out taixuan on ch31 right
sushang maybe
wouldn't surprise me
she's going to kill fr but we have to make sacrifices
qua valk 2023 hodeath lightning seele trust
one dps valk per year
i do think qua and ima will be similar standpoint
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
it'll sell so they'll make
lmao
no way they won't make more of ima
qua is awful and they still make more of them
that's stupid
yeah i have no clue how they're making another ima dps
kill her already mihoyo no one likes playing her
the based reason to hate dudu is because bke fucking sucks
the cringe reason to hate dudu is because you don't read story
it'd just be crazy
i mean yeah that's why i don't doubt it
and powercreeping it further would be like insane
it's so ahead of everything else
phys is already so fucking strong
like
i don't really doubt it but
it'd be crazy if they powercrept HoS
i think we will get fire content after HoH
what's that, crit rate? sorry i heard holmes TB dracula M
lmfao
yeah we just bald
<:2woggers:658553078420602901>
you'll just run new ice support and turg cat lmfao
lmfao that's true
like it's mind boggling if you think about it
for everyone
that they're giving turg tb for free
it's fucking insane
yeah
stonks
use card on cb19
grab turg TB for free
pull there
save for HoH
i mean yeah but think on f2p standpoint
since, at this point, like 4.4
that's the goal
i mean
<a:Whale_luma:458386265776193536>
you can if you spend
dawei lite card is very nice
free turg/zhenyi/HoF piece is very good
but it's good
it's not good for me
i think it's good
i could easily get like 1500, maybe 1510/1520 once i get the dks
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
i'm missing like 35 from affixes
half of them are ~10
and my affixes lowkey suck
and you have no excuse to not having all dkeys if you have ss gacha valk
and i'm easily -20 from cap since missing 2 dkeys
lmfao
to have 1340 at ss0
very wrong
you have to do something
my ss0 mobius is 1474
yeah they really need that 1sp/s tradeoff from 160 atk
because she really is that sp starved lmao
BiS for abyss
1 sp line is unironically
though actually
and they took it personally
i see they heard that she's sp starved
the patch pv quiz
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
almost 1500
ss0 affixed is like
no affix?
how do you even do that
1343 for ss0 is fucking
jesus
atk issued like me
and you are like
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
gamer
look at past week MA
yes this is also about me
dw
with ss gacha valk
they wouldn't be on rl
if they had skill
like 60 atk is a lot for player who is good at the game
i mean yeah but like 60 atk
especially with cerulean flare
no sp farming needed
she kills with like 2 rots anyways
but in RL
and she's sp starved as fuck in nirv
is better sp gen
the biggest thing mobius get from ranks
eh ss mobius isn't that big in RL
hmmm
i think you can do it
really? like run HoF ae cat and use cat for hitcount
isn't making bad choices and complaining playing the game
nini would nut
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
on husk
with HoF
i'm pretty sure you can retain rl
HoF?
and that's it
husk is not that bad
rpc is maybe pretty bad
like sushang is pretty bad
is lightning shill even that bad this patch <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
i see
so
- has other options than aponia
- has other options than aponia
- has other options than aponia
- has other options than aponia
we have like 1 that requires aponia
do we have that many aponia weathers
w-what
that's what i do in real life
yeah lorewise it doesn't make sense, welt is gay
sorry that one was only to cause psychic damage to citrine
a h0nk
heki is honkai monk
it's too easy right now yeah
like a small challenge
for fun
so he wants a small nerf in abyss
he has enough
heki just doesn't like crystals you see
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
ooo that's soon
winter?
when the fuck is that coming out again
oh shit new chainsaw man trailer
can anyone help
heki in a few weeks wow for some reason my HoR is dealing way less damage
lmfao
and then grab welt if you don't
try for HoH stigs
in case you don't get HoH stigs
go for welt now
yeah don't fucking
to get her generally worse but better sometimes, and extremely more expensive stigs
so you're getting rid of her best stigs
????
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
that'd be fucking crazy
sswords on 6.2 with hos bp
columbus or filler is my guess
and turg M from bp if you can afford it
and then like, grab cb19 from spending event
i think it is a good line to go all in HoH
no dps?
turg tb hb
4/4 cat
so i'm assuming your ice team needs dps is
from the ost
it's guess the pv
for the gamers
i don't think carnival is pv ost
which one?
she hums cyberangel
hb is cute actually
old patch pv was boring as fuck
oh okay
she's 1.8
old old
sakitama is like
probably DA?
that sounds like SA
probably SA?
people like hb's that much?
i like fischl's too a bunch
oh yeah SW also bops
my favorite part of the patch lmao
you somehow don't know what they are
<@385655541248163840> all the patch pv

where you can see all patch pv
oh you know
i dunno the track names
to fuck with tet
i was lying
yeah it's not
lmfao
maybe it's something like that?
the patch name was rosemary's nocturne
sorry
fallen rosemary
it's so fucking good
FR is prob top 1
for me, my favorite are mobius, FR and probably senti
yeah same, citrine gets me
it fucking slaps
i am legitimately excited for the cg pv
sorry i think i was too mean
yeah the patch name as inherit the flame so it's probably that
these
patch pv
pay attention
we are talking about a different thing here nini
i'm hyped about that
the animation pv yeah for sure
yeah the patch name was inherit the flame
if they do the same for HoH i'll be eh
like i get it but not for me
for HoF they did like the epic song and it was like eh
i like the high energy ones
i dunno if i'll enjoy the patch pv
not patch pv
nini is talking about animation pv
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
and fgo
like bke
i fucking hate some of the 3s bosses we have currently
like i can tell you right now
if i hate it i'll quit
i'll play during 5.9
i'm quitting if i don't find the game fun
to be clear though, i only say i'm quitting on 5.9 for the meme
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816>
<:theliterate:959737715564359740>
you think i think before i speak
i mean
of my wallet
it's going to be the screams
but i like the visuals from new/taixuan
i love it so much
please let me play normal ship ost
is jukebox
the thing i want the most
i think overall small nerf from what i read
taixuan free from event, arc city was always paid
yeah
it's hard to say what they'll do going forward
with taixuan + arc city lmao
we've literally had 1 bridge release before
i mean given precedent, sure...?
but not necessary
ofc if you can afford it its good power increase
i don't think turg m is too important
if you wanna make a good ice team you can get away with turg tb + weapon
then just turg tb is good enough
if you don't have good ice team
depends on how your account is
it's really big
2 years ago
if they gave 3 newts for free
this is like
the best stig set in the game
which is probably
cause f2p will be able to get turg TB
this is kinda nuts actually
you can get cb19 with just the f2p balls though
for free/knight/paladin
it's 5/14/16
you get 5 per patch if you're f2p
HoS/nyx
HoS/new farmable
HoS/repeat someone (AE?)
the 3 choices are like
HoS/nyx?
that might be too soon
and the 6.2 season is HoS/new WT valk
maybe 6.1 we get WT valk
HoS/something old
6.2 new season
6.1 columbus or something filler
i'm betting on
eh i dunno if 6.1 is elemental support
none on HoT/Ely bp though, so not once per season
and SA + HoR on 5.3
we got HoR + HoV equip on 4.6
double equipment is not too rare
that's kinda stacked
is it dante turg?
dante isn't on bp yet
wait waht
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
trying to will it into existence huh
smh
imagine not having rozascout
<:RozaScout:928714351534309386>
burn my eyes ely
coward
but ely better
i mean taixuan good yes
we just got free upgrade
f for everyone who spent xtal on taixuan steps
i guess if the effects are sick somehow
i just don't think it'll be worth it lmao
i don't doubt it would be pyramid
morbmaid or summer senti cute
like the skin is cute but it's not like
wouldn't be worth it at all
aponia pyramid
yikes
i want it spinning
trust
for handel
it's
the amount is about the same i'm pretty sure
we get them in march
you get those extra pulls on october
sea just gets it on different timing
not really
we know since that was the thing we missed
a bunch more rewards then, anniv-specific about 10 cards
same thing then though
yeah p much
was about 10
but anniv-specific
including xtal/card rewards
there was a bunch more rewards in the patch
about 10
now idk, prob 100 still
it was 100
now it's not having it -> ss
cause before it was s0->ss
for people who have s0 already
also how does adv even work
i guess her rank ups are pretty nice
HoS adv is weird
and then they got griseo
cause physical was also too powerful
not that it matters, i guess
fire is just too powerful to get an sp valk lmao
even without sp fire valk
HoF will keep kasumi
which i think is somewhat likely
though if they do nerf HoH on v2/v3
that's good enough to be match by my standards
for kasumi in specific
i wouldn't be surprised if HoF matched with HoH on release
i mean i'm more surprised that HoF matches with v1 HoH
aren't v1 HoH numbers busted or smth
and weird
that's nice
really?
oh
yeah same
lmfao
god fuck
HoH and ely elf not being in 6.1, which will likely be anniv
at another 5-week patch
i'm already pretty mad
gonna have to wait until 6.1 announcement to see how mad i'm at it
i dunno how i feel about it yet
yeah
in mandarin, vill-v is pronounced like v2v
i'm faster
vill-v
love you <:BARBARA_LOVE:708170069548597248>
i didn't get a gift or anything
oh i didn't know
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
they don't have to fill the gap
it's event banner
i mean
closer to completing the set
and now no regrets
but then i looked at liliya
i used 6k xtal on there
also i was feeling big regret over buying the summer skins
so pretty
0 regrets even though i've never used SN
was the first skin i bought
i bought that one
i oooh yeah the sn qipao one
it is also really nice
the summer sp one
does make my decision way easier though
i thought it was the other one
also damn that's the ns skin i have
i also couldn't afford it
i support the choice for cockroach seele
it's the prettiest seele skin
i don't like that one
~~summer sn is ugly too~~
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
i don't have those
cause i have the summer one
that's woggers tho
cute LMAO
yeah
still a good amount actually
which is
so max is 45%
so 75 points of 0.4 -> 30
0.4% tdm for every point over 225
15% if above 0
90%??
weird
yeah
but i dunno if that makes the most sense
where team charged/combo filled up her bar
i assumed it was like FR
ty
70?
how much is an awakened card worth again
like no that's just fucking making the gamemode worse lmfao
it'd be like if they 6.1 said FT too strong, we're removing griseo signets for this patch
and then to nerf her, they just destroy one of the core mechanics of ER
making a valk who abuses one form of core design of ER gameplay
it's so bad design
so fucking stupid i'm still kinda salty over it
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
that is true
was better
kevin griseo for +2
but yeah
i mean i guess +2 on lip poison is nice
well she does care about lip poison
and neither of them get the +2
since the powerboost she gets is from core + dead [x]
it's kinda insignificant
even on mobius
tet
is as good as you think it is
+2 infinity
i don't think
20 extra weekly xtal, great tradeoff for <a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
but still fun
i doubt it'll deliver here lmao
sheeesh sick! can't wait!
i don't remember that
o i see
what?
what are we getting?
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
i'm global
no
must be skill diff
it only dmd me once
turg was on the last patch before it died
o yeah that's true
lmfao
like irene, jst and glut ppm newt
wtf was even support gear back then
also
skill issue
more fun than UM imo
it was fun
but doing the stages
that sucked
not the craftable system
i liked bounty
jesus christ tet
ｉｔ‘ｓ　ａｃｔｕａｌｌｙ　ｑｕｉｔｅ　ａｃｃｅｓｓｉｂｌｅ
ｓｅｅ？
that's just jp keyboard full size alphanumeric
i know how to do that!
oh
o
nice
need a space
for nqn
it's !react
idk i've never used mobile
you also need less skill issue
not nqn
it's native discord functionality
obviously
you have to have the emote
ty carl
you can send +<a:peepoBonk:755849746668584990>  and it reacts to last message sent
i know how to react with emotes with just typing
kinda based kinda based
is balls?
but i see what you figured out
no that was me failing at figuring out what to say LMAO
i can't think of anything cool tet
fuck
alright
or can i choose what cool thing i can say
do you have anything in specific in mind
okay
i'm not mad at much besides possible 3 3s boss in MA
lmfao fair
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
and i don't remember when we had new boss immune to half our damage types and high resistances to the third
but i do feel like we'll have spending event
HoF release was small spending event
i guess it's not guaranteed we'll have big spending event
just not support
cause it was same price
i mean still counts as sp gear
oh shit
i mean last time we got cheap patch with cheaper S-rank was because immediately after we got expensive patch with S-rank + elf + sp gear
nah
to only give us one spending event
do you think mihoyo would be so kind
will have spending event
both 6.0 and 6.1
lmfao
<a:worryramen:967581731395870770>
<a:Y_PepegaCredit:792811182364819477>
and ss is interesting
as always
s1/s2 look pretty good
her rankups look avg
scary
oh god sp gen on s2
good coverage, comfortably top score in her bosses
and in abyss she's certainly good enough
it's a mechanical issue, with bad TF on her and supports
would make her good in MA
like number buffs
i mean yeah but no amount of buffs for v2v personally
were they trying to make her good in MA? cause they did a bad job lmao
cause like for her niche she's def good enough
i wonder why tbh
just balancing
is normal
i'm pretty sure v2v got nerfs during the beta duration
is awful for us
much more than that
i feel like is fine
around 10-10.5m
i think she'll be like avg raw power level, or maybe slightly above average, just with heavy shill bosses that make her score gap a lot bigger
feel like she'll go through the avg new valk lifecycle in beta
HoH?
like just flexible limit for what you need to 4*
yeah that's a good solution
or they could make it so after being made farmable, you can't turn dupe frags into witch orb, but that could fuck over player who has it
they could maybe make it so you can't buy frags past 4* but there could still be loopholes (buy a bunch of frags before upgrading to 4* and get rid of the extras)
so like i'm fucking 99% sure they're not making old elfs farmable without changing that
and then elf witch orb shop has like rotating shop with even recent elfs like dudu and klein
you can get rid of frags for elf witch orb
if you grab them past 4*
all the current gacha elfs, even the really old ones like selune, fuxi
i dunno, there's an issue currently
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
beating WE by 1%
nvm then i guess
lmfao
can't find it <a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
we just never knew
and she's also always in herrscher form
imagine if you test MPE out
for bke
so speeding the animation up wouldn't do much
otherwise you're at mercy of evasion cd already
yeah i guess if you have good enough evasion cd i could be nice
yeah i noticed that too
the only valk that currently uses it in ER is nyx, because she's the only one whose source of damage in ER is affected by attack speed
in fact, it mostly doesn't affect anything you care about in ER
the reason why atk speed is generally not good is because it doesn't affect everything
i mean it absolutely stacks, there's no reason why it wouldn't
interesting
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
is that affected by atk speed?
o wait
scientists at mihoyo working hard on making every fun gameplay valk boring as fuck in ER
lmao where's my meme
she gets +1 on every signet
every run
free 2k coin worth of buffs
that's like
i'm guessing it's deceptively good
that free +1 is
i wonder how good
the one i feel like i saw mostly used in bleed weather is HoS spear
yeah tbh i can't quite say i've felt any big gather on griseo QTE, maybe a small one
istg
every time i use that valk i lose 5 years off of my life
bke ptsd
is giving me
god that fucking bleed ref
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
instead of just pressing buttons
imagine paying attention to what your character does
or dudu
then you either wait
i'd say like ely, dudu and klein are on same tier and you just pick the one that matches your best invested team for first elf
like dudu might be more flexible because of tdm but if you have a good ice team setup then you go for ely elf
value of dudu vs ely elf now i would say is based on what team you have invested
yeah the switch cd for all valks is definitely the most important thing about the 2 of them
nvm then
o wait is it for all valks
D:
dudu elf has switch cd reset for all valks, not only phys
and it has tdm buffs so is still small buff for other teams
lmao
HoH does rime trauma just on fucking existing
the one with the <:sex:998637653585055835> emote
in your server?
p much only for HoH/ice teams
it's like
switch cd reset is mostly for SS MA which is dying, and there you barely use ice valks either so
rn ely elf is the worst
like for general flexibility
i mean even then
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
i almost typo'd that without an H LMFAO
selune is mini chunnie
like all of them are fucking s-tier cuteness
<a:PatPat:814547161878364190>
look at klein waddling with the syringe
i mean i really like ely but look at sirin
i think all elfs are extremely cute already
well i mean honestly
true <:Deadge:958122498019434496>
weird
if they force a necessity on switch cd reset, it'll prob be a sizeable gap, if they don't it'll prob be not that big imo
just how much the gap will be between ely and WE is the question
like personally i'm 100% sure ely elf will be BiS, if not for all ice teams then at the very least for HoH tteam
and if the gap will be big enough to justify buying a new elf
i just dunno how big the gap is from overall dps accounting with the higher team dps buffs of WE
i'm almost sure ely elf will deal more damage than WE
cause ely got ely for ely and ely for ely
who even was original sirin for lmfao
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
but like i have no proof for that and it's definitely more than possible that WE will be good enough for even nirv
and mihoyo doesn't do bad releases anymore <a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
from vibe alone i feel like she's going to be pretty good for ely team, since they can just force the switch cd reset to be necessary
yeah idk how i feel about ely elf rn
it's like you want to feel bad
y'all set the weirdest expectations
tank
my fps going to fucking
mobius on crack
yeah i dunno i'm scared more than anything
no she's human-shaped
<:peepoHappy:500219466190290947>
the manta is just a friend
HoV gets post release nerfs
aponia gets post release bug fixes and buffs
lmfao
but i don't think so
if i took 5 seconds to think about sirin asc i'd realise
old valk, herrscher mode wasn't even a thing back then <:Clueless:996308692133761094>
i'd believe it
HoV doesn't have herrscher mode
if you told me
i mean
jesus christ mihoyo
lmfao
bronya?
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
if you don't read
gameplay is lore
and it's HoT
damn hepha got hands
i'll beat hepha up
is this that meme
because they earlier decided to make a valk whose playstyle is based on abusing it
just killing one of the core mechanics of the gamemode
jesus fuck
cause
regressing in design huh
mihoyo devs are fucking
what the fuck
oh you're a masochist too?
let them suffer
they're a bunch of masochists
and honestly it should be very bald for HoV simps to clear
the question is how bald is it to clear
you don't need to be a good valk to clear
even fucking RI can clear
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
also yea i do agree if they give choice between HoT or AE, AE is the pick if you don't have AE
for free
and then getting HoT
i think it's 30k, but it's 30k you're spending on something worth it
wouldn't pull for card though, definitely not
great value
stigs are farmable
only need to pull for 7tr
it's basically 14k xtal for good meta valk
she's absolutely worth it still imo
or bp
but if you get her for cheap like spending event
i wouldn't roll for her
depends on what you mean by investing
eh i mean
also don't need it
and like retain RL
absolutely not
like t2%
but like to clear MA and stuff for rewards
i mean to compete with other HoTs sure
if only for HoT leader skill
SSS LE is still worth it yes
thank u mihoyo for giving us more currency to buy SS MA valks
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
kosma kirby
if you're past s2 and don't have 4* elf something has gone wrong (don't look at my acc)
s0 -> 3* elf -> s2 -> 4* elf -> more rankups
i would prob put general pull prio as like
good way to count
lmfao 3-4 pages of paypal
look at the bright side, non awakened is slightly cheaper i think
i meeeean
aw rip
impressive
preparing the down payment already
i know non-awakened is 50 i think
from awakened valk frag
do you know how many gold witch orbs you get
yo <@180679257851166721> or anyone else
sorry lmao
idfk then
oh
so 4% less than WE
it's 15% 2*, another 5% 3\*
from wyverein note
oh, 20% i think
24% damage taken
3* WE is fucking
<:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
like we just said
yeah the damage boost is worse than WE
yeah LMAO
elfs are more flexible and stronger
rank ups are always the least valuable performance increase
it's always like this though
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i'm always right
see worse buffs than WE
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
cause it doesn't matter if her supports were better, she still bleeds infinite time by just existing
the only way to fix v2v problems is a dp-like support for MA
it's definitely both
yeah but <a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
selune return to the meta
it looks like a random 3* one lmfao
key of ego looks like one of those genshin bows lmao
would be great if MA was still a gamemode
lmfao i see why imy strat worked now
i mean yeah but you're just giving me hope that they won't announce it later
so the bug must've been crazy
that one is a fucking huge buff too
another bug fix?
yeah i was going to ask lmfao
don't give me hope carv
god
not that it matters since SS MA is fully going away
oh sheeesh so she really does have starting sp
but it's anything but
yeah ER tries to pass off as roguelike
weird
wait on v1?
oh sheeesh g3 irene
yeah what the hell
oh ok
this is awful lmfao
have people complained about this yet
wait this is fucked up
still shit but less shit
oh ok
LMAO
it really does
that's funny
lmfao
is also immune to lightning and fire?
sss hepha on ER
wait
oh sheesh HoV is in ER
me also looking for ely ranks translation LMAO
sick name
you'll call her corruptie or some shit
hmu in 6.5 when everyone's all loving cute HoC
yeah cause i'm always right
doesn't she just use ana
they're doing the BKE way of designing bosses huh
also what the fuck
fucking mecha hepha
jesus fuck LMFAO
like you
i gotta learn how to efficiently die
the way this game is changing
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
yeah i saw that, guess we wait now
like mathematically optimised to be the worst one
is the absolute worst one
this one to wake up to
i saw some beta news while waking up
you know
on eden aponia v2v booba
yeah they spent all their budget
yes, my cock in game is also smaller than in lore
it's smaller than in-lore
but because of limitations + it's the first area so they have to be kinder and still getting used to developing it
are supposed to be way bigger
like i feel like mondstadt in-game size, of both the continent and city
this kinda stuff i chalk it up as non-canon
eh
will be back to mondstadt
the last step of our adventure in teyvat before celestia
i'm like close to 100% certain
i mean yeah
into going the sibling's path
if venti was in it and manipulated traveller
i wouldn't be mad at it
idr did venti tell traveller that they should go to liyue to know about the unknown god
genshin ends in 1.1
the good ending
yes, of course
like they were already going for that, they just did a shit job at it by going to liyue of all places instead of going to the archon that has shit to deal with celestia
do you think they wouldn't go straight there
if venti told traveller like yeah i know where she is just hit her up here
is my point
that's already what traveller was doing
but like
i mean i agree with that, sure
and even same elemnt
we can actually have both travellers on the same team, on like coop
eventually
we'll get sibling as playable chara
i mean i'm 99% sure
yeah
well i guess kinda
now if they met another time now that the traveller knows what happened and they didn't do anything to sibling then i'd be kinda mad for stupidness too lmao
so like at that point they were just happy surprised + confused that they're around
as far as they knew, sibling could be like unconscious still, maybe imprisioned or even dead
cause like, by that point the traveller didn't know sibling was avoiding them
i don't blame traveller not doing anything with sibling when they first met
have they even met again?
also i haven't kept up with the story past final inazuma archon quest
like i agree that it's prob not the best plan, and it prob wouldn't work (traveller would get beat up by unknown god), but it's both the only plan and the plan the traveller was already going for, just badly lmao
so
and they're looking for the unknown god, they've asked all the archons about her
and looking for the sibling, ofc
i mean sure but at the beginning they had no other option besides going looking for the unknown god
and i think the traveller trusts the sibling enough to just go through it
cause the sibling already told the traveller the plan
it's kind of already done
i guess at this point now
they can speedrun that shit, meet tsaritsa who has some shit to deal with celestia and find a way to go there and check up with the unknown god
what i don't get is why the traveller is going with it for the first place
i mean yeah it makes sense from the view of the sibling, given that they expect us to reach the same conclusion by taking the same path
i'll tell you for 500 robux
we're never getting more info
holy fuck
she's not going to know it either
god fucking damn it sumeru archon is a fucking new one too
instead of i can't tell you
so she can say i literally don't know
they even put us to talk with yae
with inazuma
i mean i think they already have
lmfao
traveller really does save a whole nation 3 times just to go ask the archon hey you know about x and they go yes but i can't tell you and then traveller goes okay! i'm sure the next one will tell me
yes
they suck at making progress on that
in fact even with you
without you they wouldn't have done any progress on that either
i mean
but never completes it
your traveler keeps picking comms daily
when you quit
do you know how food works
i think in lore you're supposed to take them voluntarily
over commissions you took voluntarily
meanwhile you're purposely food poisoning civilians
jesus y'all having a meltdown over HoC killing sims
you wouldn't believe it
and also all commissions
actually i found a way to skip all cutscenes
same but for all dialogue
<:yatur:865688778965516348>
lmfao
<a:chadn:977032787087482962>
i am
i def read that wrong
yup
also true and based ice very f2p friendly
i'm still on carvs good side <a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
but it's honkai 2022 they wouldn't do that
got killed and then forgotten
also herrscher of ice/stars/rimestar
ty for coming
that's the joke
idk wtf is going on with the kids
i mean me and taihen are legal age
we never got a herrscher and then story forgets about them <:Clueless:996308692133761094>
from the truth
don't run
i'm right btw carv
i'm gonna call taihen cub
cub is cute
aw
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
ty for the blessing
i'll take it
100 for HoH + gear?
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
i'm already at 61 pity
mark my words i'll either be right or it'll be really funny
you're just blind
it's perfect
HoC, who love HoH
HoH, who loves all humanity, but has no one to love her
lmfao purgartory
HoH will go i don't only love all of humanity, i also love the honkai, which is inseparable from humanity
HoC, HoT, please, go forth into the world. bring my wish true. i give you two my signet/herrscher/key gift
but i'm already there
and you'll feel bad and like her
cause she's going to have her redemption
i'm just one step ahead of ya
you see i agree with that
and people will go woggers kuru kuru
kuru kuru
and she'll go
herta or something
HoC is going to fucking
keilo was right
wow
and you'll look back and say
both babies that everyone loves
HoC and HoS
honkai 2023
mark my words
but
which i guess is based
don't change topic just because you're pro child murder
and they killed her in ow
she went ow and er
she tried
no they're fucking killing her
and not her
are happy endings to everyone else
yeah cause the happy endings
scared of coming clean
scared of dying
HoC is a scared baby
too
and to everyone else
she's done all
like checklist
what senti did
literally
isn't that
yeah that's all things children is
and now you're the bad one
can't even commit a few murders
and she'll grow up fine
and acceptance
we treat her with love
she's a fucking child carv
we can't have no HoC
i'm guessing unless she turns good at the end somehow
just testing the waters to see if we might get HoC
i see so she was technically not an antagonist by then
lmfao
or was she already dealt with
was she still antagonist on story
when senti released
<@218762069338619906> lorelao
also
lmfao based
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
luxury valk needs 12/12 and they can make her suck cause qua and people still pull
seele is prob one of their best sells
you think mihoyo hates money?
i mean
but no way they don't happen at all
might be cope this soon
they'll happen eventually
is cope
i think anything other than that
1. HoT powerup with signets and HoH
2. HoC
3. seele herrscher
4. teri herrscher
for options we p much only have
what are your copium for lightning herrscher
but now
same actually
because of the new set
next herrscher is lightning(?)
do you think that means
hmm
o you're smort
s2 HoT = s0 HoF?
would you say
hmm
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
and give her lottery bosses
they make ice valks the most braindead possible
that is true
too easy
i don't like HB
hard to live
and i saw the take HB is shit without her weapon, most important part of her setup
to post my gif and flirt with ruby
god i stopped by maincord for 5 mins
it all makes sense
and mar7th woke up in a crystal
elysia has the crystal where she dies and revives
it's confirmed
it is mar7th
no
mar7th is an AU ely
i'm pretty sure now
<@218762069338619906>
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
hi3 ely -> ely
gsr ely -> mar7th
gi ely -> alice
so we have
based
ayyy i knew she was mar7th!
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
if it is
i mean it's still good for you
hopefully
<:mirioThink:997517555138826362>
just make ice ima bosses
we don't need to powercreep PE
i mean
the description is like you get the icon when you get the outfit
it is a skin
^
please protect the baby
literally senti 2
is what i mean
like if she dies does ER go kaboom
wait can she even die
she was with kalpas going <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
this chapter
aponia died didn't she
i mean
<:quantumwoggers:855085607398277200>
they either datamine or just share stuff from actual leakers
it'd be dumb if they were
i don't think any of the well known leakers are actually leakers
also means that it doesn't matter what he wants to leak or not, if he has no sources for honkai leaks/datamines then he won't be able to leak anything
1 step removed for no consequences <:mirioThink:997517555138826362>
and he shares the stuff with the community
he's just trusted by a lot of leakers and dataminers and they share stuff with him
like he doesn't leak or datamine anything
i mean he's just like a beacon isn't he
oh no
coming to honkai
all genshin dataminers/leakers
i'd love to but i need sleep bad
<a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
too busy studying
that explains why he isn't here complaining about leaks/correcting lore
the link -> #general
lmao
but we don't know if that would be ely herrscher either
if elf elysia is ice and is coming 6.0, then there's a bicc chance 6.0 valk is ice too
we don't have neither confirmation that elf elysia is ice nor that ely herrscher will be playable at all, nvm next patch
and she died by becoming who she really is
her signet is the signet of ego, of sincerity, of herself
well, ely's actually fit really well
i'm sleep deprived lmao
i guess that makes no sense
oh sheesh imagine if all the er valks died by their signet name
it's how she'd want to go
you know she's living with the stars
if you think she's alive you're high on copium
yeah officially we know she went on ark and we got no answer
<:GarnetThumbsUp:451775228973154317>
crystal gems?
she's always been dead lmao
i have news to you
of all of ch31
biggest plot twist
wth su has eyes
jesus christ lmfao
lmaoo
cause she's dead
more like was/were
to will it into existance
i'll go sheeeesh i'm in
i'll just fake getting in
next time
good one
ayyyyy
her bones are in another plane of existance
bitch she's dead since like 5k years ago
deserved for killing pardo
she's fine
<:worrynirvanajail2_hh:828444826822508554>
<:ganyuConfused:997517548448927885>
it looks right to me
ty eli
okay please i need to know, who's pulling for v2v here

<:Number1:923734909787471882>skipping fuck that
<:Number2:923736199024230411>pulling for valk and going no gear/trying luck at foca
<:Number3:923736316120809522>going for 110/150 and 4/4 from expa
<:Number4:923736383619760248>going for ranks (s2+)
that would be sp if they had the concept before
definitely the go to valk
LK is like
though i guess in that case px and ae would be sp aswell
like apho is not our current main story
i always thought it was a matter of like, timeline, and not like meta mechanics like a different gamemode
hmm i can kinda buy the separate gamemode one <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
<:PepeHands:909232418211364957>
but that also confirms to me that we won't have PE hua
she's not actually SK
but it's not meant to be canon
i do think they put SK in ER story
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
lmfao
cause fu hua is from fucking PE as well
well actually would i
i would take that excuse
wait is ER also from PE?
i mean but she's explicitly not PE, she's the CE version of pardofelis that's in ER
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
wouldn't that just mean she's main story?
since she has can
she's the ER version of pardofelis
is it weird that cat is sp?
hmmm
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
too slow
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
so it also wouldn't surprise me if they just went eh fuck it and spoiled the new valk LMAO
they did fucking spoil sss kosma
well
yeah same
to ss AE
another 30 frags
i'd need
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
never rolled for one
i dunno
for non awakened/awakened
30/70?
how many frags is a dupe again
if it was FR
i'd consider going for it too
oh god
and 2% fire damage from ss AE
ss is niche but when it matters it's usually a good amount of points saved too
s2 for nirv player yeah a good amount
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
if it has AE....
oh shit
<a:ratJAM:996347369329262613>
sheeeesh
<:BARBARA_LOVE:708170069548597248>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
you can't enjoy designs without wanting to fuck it?
how the fuck does that work lmao
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
i'm both
ganyu dies??
and a pool noodle as a lance
she gets a floater as a shield
still on summer pe copium
while i'll be quitting this game in 4 weeks LMAO
the artbook is a real physical thing
i mean i would buy the artbook for 90k asterite but it's also interesting question to ask about the other stuff on sale
game is basically giving you asterite -> would you buy the artbook for 90k asterite?
if each event currency is 50 asterite
i guess it's interesting to think about
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
if you decide to not buy anything
still 233k
well i mean
jesus
since we won't have the book on sale
i wonder if we'll get less currency
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
cherry gets me
yeah 4.6 was 7 week
i need the xtal
give me my 7 week patches
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
are people happy about 5 week patch
the fuck
why
sheeeesh
like i get the reasoning behind it but she just doesn't look that young lmao
and people acting like she's a loli
yeah i honestly don't quite understand the thing in lore with she looking like a child
do we know if we'll get another 6?
did we get an announcement?
what do i do with that info
god fucking damn it
sheeesh
honestly i kinda feel that, i kinda want all hua skins
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
that i'm sure of
it wouldn't have HoS skin
like a salmon sweater
for some reason i always thought she was using a normal tshirt lmao
she's not wearing clothes
oh shit
:D
?av
wait
yeah look at me, i'm stupid as shit and imature
literally toddlers
can't blame them if they don't understand how the world works
i'm just sure they're like just 12 or 13
i mean
no they forgot about stigs having chibis
affix gaming yeah
tbh even in masters i saw some 6-8 newts
yeah back then there were legit 9 newt weeks
i think her red reso was being taken by like 13 newts or w/e you had to run back then
she's built differently
i have no clue, gotta ask her
so she could have sirin dorm chibi
celine from blustorm was t1 MA and she rolled on dorm gear supply for a sirin stig
things take time, and for it to take less time we use money we got by using time to spend less time so we can spend more time
everything is time
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
skins are the only good use of money
therefore
like skins
the only thing that isn't bypassing time restraints is like b-chip only purchases
since xtal is also timegated resource
100% of the way you spend money is for that
well if you think about it
<a:NOTED:915100038915571714>
so you're the type of player seeing the fast powecreep and goes more please
i see
even if i'm skipping villv
kinda hoping it isn't 5 week long still
so even then not confirmed
like they did in HoF patch
they can modify it last second
even if bp is 6 week long
though tbf
the way we find out patch length usually is though bp length i think
i don't think we can know yet
but it's nirvana mob clearing
that's only mob clearing though
prob not
in CN? dunno
in global? yeah lmao
close enough
does this help
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
time to use it
o i see
fucking up 3 abyss bosses LMAO
ssg mihoyo
wasn't andrius buggy too?
but unless they changed from before, heimdall being ignited doesn't matter
the mob is like annoying as hell, gotta ignite with AE + bombs
isn't this just for the first mech?
🚣
issok thank u
this feels like day 1 webcam recordings of movie theater LMAO
best part of the patch
patch pv
when can i see
android among FC = too complicated, reader won't get
child among FC = that's okay
:woekaf
she would be even more perfect
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
<a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
catgirl elysia
i'll wait until it becomes buyable
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
i mean ofc but still
i'm not taking yours
what no, don't you get only one?
<:Sadge:715448677162024980>
i want it os bad
god damn
that's the book they're giving for free right
oh shit this looks SO cool
ice damage increases by 80% yeah i think that's event LMAO
don't do this to me
i don't have the xtals
oh thank god
please
come translate
<@482139585355448333>
don't do this to me
what?
i'm sorry what
but not on AE
on the 893? rime strat
i've seen the HoS one
i've never seen it
since both of those are interrupting normal attacks
well, interrupt combo atk doesn't sound like neither fast combo or fast ult
hopefully
yeah
since official mihoyo guide teaches fast ult
i doubt they will
but i will be mad if they fix it
i mean it probably is
but like valk release + main event of the patch being genshin related
nah i doubt it'd be more than one valk
so we have like 6.2 bicc collab
genshin is reaching sumeru
think bigger finnix
instead of big event + valk
would prob be only a medium-small event
if genshin collab is just jammed on v3 of a patch
wouldn't that be bad?
patch notes: no new valk
lmao
isn't it just more balance stuff
what are people expecting from v3?
i am sharing your anger
<:Madge:945137877837307954>
yeah but i have bad memory
there's the DP one now too
idt last time they left any behind
i mean it should
are there more?
?
BB MC VG PI HoV SP SN
so i'm thinking the skins will be
oh okay that makes sense
how was it last year again
or did CN get it and i missed it
so CN is getting it at the same time, not at the same patch?
oh that makes sense
the outfit supply could be special for that
are we getting near seele birthday or smth
hmm
<:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
oh shit we only have 1 HoT and 1 LE
not that bad of a week is it
that's
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
without feeling bad about it
and then i get ss1 DA ss1 BKE
3 shui cycles lmao
please do like
yeah that's what i said too lmao
jesus christ
they aren't that incompetent right
there's no fucking way it was a bug
okay i'm not taking it
everywhere i'm assuming
can you imagine?
you know these mechs were once an MA boss?
i mean i'm glad but holy christ
fucking 58 patch long bug
jesus christ mihoyo
LMAO
yeah there's no way it's a fucking bug
how can you fuck it up that badly for so long
theres no fucking way
fixed???????????????
abnormally???
wtf???????????
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
i still need 2-3 newts and 1 newt T
tyvm
so i don't have to make my crafting list longer
please only add farmable stuff of what i already have
farmable newt i don't want
make zhenyi farmable
yeah make turg farmable
actually i guess i don't care about making something i already have farmable

mihoyo doing their best for us to not skip her, meanwhile everyone but heki yeah is skip patch for me LMAO
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
i stayed up for this
just bp additions
so is that it by interesting stuff for v2?
calm down jesus

i mean HoC using ely's form doesn't mean that ely's losing
new mobs are psy types (source: trust me)
<a:huggies:865273755152678972>

<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
heki is gone

<:deadge:933767520085770341>
i might take a break and like stack up my acc and learn how to enjoy abyss
i think i'll have an awful last patch of ma lmao
and only ss eden for bke
cause i suck at fgo and hod
yeah i'll have to learn those sss bosses to get maximum enjoyment from last patch
LMAO
over MA changes still
so fucking tilted
i'm actually
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
for me it'll be every 2.1 patches will be zero pulls
good trade imo
yeah 20 crystal for ruining the game for me
like more AL or some shit
second sss boss will give a bit more rewards
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
they already said that they did
same
my baban shrine is just for better baban ma score
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
baban shrine?
2 pulls obviously
brave

transphobia

i can't read jp
i think
based
my motives are very complex
you wouldn't understand
it's very funny i swear
sorry that's a trans joke
such brave move
wow congrats
and it's going to be like the fucking bullshit ones too
i don't want to only have one per week
i love ss boss
i'm unironically very sad LMAO
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
i'm so sad at 1 ss boss
i hate it here
but no
i'll stay here forever
4 ss boss
i've said this so much before AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
that's legit so depressing
i'm only going to do one per week?
i love ss bosses
aw man i'm so sad
i do also think it's 2 sss 1 ss
i mean can we be sure this proves it
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
i don't want to reward such acts
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
should've died instead of ely
kosma actually stayed alive for too long
okay i changed my name
i like catastp
glad it's just catastp tho
at the start
for double ely signet
meme
i was like god no i don't wanna hear what diavoros has to say
i saw catastp typing as diavoros is typing and my heart fucking dropped
god i see what you mean now <@309634550273933314>
i don't think she does
does she count as flamechaser
casual player
actually have i shown y'all my time spent in runescape
time to unretire from that
did you see the new runescape update
based
smh my head
don't ask about it
i hate every er character but the children one
can't wait for griseo
yeah dudu trash

yeah i got turned into dia too
bring the sukokomon out

unironically genshin
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
wdym buffed aponia
at least not recently
idt we do
do we
i doubt villv will beat her too much
at 712
nyx s0 cap on tona is already pretty high
even if she does it won't be by much
maybe but
fuck you
weather: no changes, nyx deals -20% damage
LMAO
quantum mobs?
nyx shill?
unironic
we're already at 5 LMAO
how many ER bosses are we going to have
jesus christ
skin collector
i am now
2 sss boss 1 ss boss i quit
i am deep into retirement now
wdym fuck keilo i'm crafting it too LMAO
she's ayaka
meme permafreeze
who?
even aponia got forgotten
lmao
is pe
only valk that gets more than 1 patch of shill
honkai 2022
could be other thing
we don't even know if it's s-rank selector
i like neo pronouns
that's cute
yikes
sss tona on abyss
that's a based from tet
based moment from tet
true
it wasn't me
i mean not sorry
LMAO sorry
yeah
they definitely are LMAO
oh wait
they putting quantum boss now?
what the hell why
SN support?
i need to gear her you see
but ice epi isn't
meme's skin is free
i can pull for skin i can play dumb shit
retirement's looking sick
god damn
meme main
i am fucking
am i meme main
OH MY FUCKING GOD
SHE HAS A TAIL
OH MY GOD
TAIL
that's so funny
LMAO
am i not retiring anymore
oh my god
so fucking pretty
those vfx
jesus
goddamn
so fucking cute
that's
i can't understand cn
OH MY GOD
i guess
like me
and uh non-boys
we're in boys
yup they are
i think streamers are opening beta rn
no apho content = no apho valk
timido will only show up when apho3
based
past ss
should i farm HoR
idk what i'm saying
would she really
leave her alone
please
don't kill HoR
check it again
every valk with skin is in ER
skins absolutely mean ER added
are people downloading it now?
when's beta again
<:TeriKMS_lum:585627694256095242>
who else coming to my beach house
we retirees now
it's not a run 2 phys
as it is with current double phys boss
you'll just run the least phys locked boss as non phys
you're not running 2 sss phys
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
impair doko
that's just HoT FGO
like if they put jizo fgo
i mean depends on what the physical bosses are
they might
oh
kill me
per week
now
we're only seeing one
but does it matter now
if you have sss also cap heimdall
-1 on kallen
she caps rimestar, doom, sk, dxy, heph, HoV
and has plenty of cap
PE is giga useful too
but for ss
i mean sss yeah
not only 2
kill me already
to force spa into the meta
fucking run wolf bke
i mean we all know what they'll do
like for me who only knows how to do 3 sss bosses lmao
more diversity means less dead patches
hopefully i think
yeah that patch was fun LMAO
since bke is 5.8
so by 5.9 we'll have 10
got 1 new sss boss
and then every other patch after that
2 sss bosses in 5.1
they were introduced on 5.1
tank jizo wolf clock hod tank otto pig tona
we have 8 sss boss rn
i don't give me back my 3 ss boss
it's laughable
and 893 the other half
s0 literally 946 half of the bosses
powercreep is so high
we really need it LMAO
i mean
god fucking damn it mihoyo
that is surely the best move
just do more of the thing literally everyone hates
but god, fuck that i guess
MA is alive again
4 bosses
ss boss more tanky
just do exalted²
everyone is asking for it
absolutely it would
kill me
very different you see
and abyss 1 cycle of 3 boss per week
abyss 2 cycles of 1 boss per week
when we can just have abyss and abyss 2
why think about 2 different game modes
yeah
god fucking damn it
i'm that but for MA
you know these terrorists for bunny fuhua
i am going to commit a crim
god fucking damn it i hate it here
depends on the boss
sounds cbt
idk
maybe
4 boss
honestly
i'm kinda up for that
i think you're wrong but hey
wait actually?
most of them are awful tho
i like some sss boss
i wanna quit
it's actually 2 sss 1 ss boss per week
is it not 2 new sss bosses
wait
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
if there's any
<@218762069338619906> can you gimme stream link
oh yeah
i see
another diavoros
GOD FUCK
WAIT ANOTHER EXTRA ONE
<:pepeW:770030202548912179>
what happened
diavoros
am i
why
it's pinned over at the <#963273616852652095>
you're late + leak + l + ratio
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
maybe some of the select banners caught your attention
you need 50 somewhere else
so if you did 60 on raven gear
for 30k
you need to pull like 110 times
still counts
you get pulls back but it doesn't matter for spending event
avg at 76 pulls, that's 21k xtal
ravens gear is already a good amount of xtal spent
fair fair
LMAO
i don't even know who neb is lmao
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
neb posted leaked stuff by accident?
instead of only skin
but you get actual rolls for it
spending is more expensive, 30k
but it goes all on skin
because pyramid is cheaper, 9.6k
depends on how you measure it
since we had bingo and different spending recently
imo
it's either spending or pyramid
that fucking sucks
unless they do 2 elf directly in a row
i doubt they would release herrscher without elf
and also, unless they break elf release pattern
but the others have 1 patch in between
i guess that's fair for HoR, i def didn't know TP was anniv
wait am i being dumb
not on patch immediately before anniv
2 patches before the anniv
but on summer
though it would make sense timing wise with the story
herrscher one patch before anniv just sounds very awkward
yeah
unless you think 6.0 is anniv
that seems backwards to me
hmm why do you think herrscher will be on 6.0 and farmable valk on anniv?
i mean i would be glad but mihoyo wouldn't be so kind
tet showed me that, looks kinda sick ngl
i see, 3am for me
<:SenkoStare:759859271650902097>
when's beta
hi what did i miss
wish.com PE
she got the time stop ult
also need to account to the fact we're getting those before getting s-rank too
so we just need to know how new numbers compare to that
on 150%, it's 0.669 and 0.293 respectively
on non awakened valk
and 0.233 frags per pull
on awakaned valk
we get 0.506 frags per pull
at 100% essentine
right now
to do math
i need actual rates
gotta do math to it
might be a net neutral change then
and also removed the frags/souls
hmm
oh they removed the 150% essentine gain
not vill-v only
and apparently that's universal
and they're making essentine rates also higher
instead of dropping 20-50 essentine, it's dropping 50 guaranteed
goes from 270 -> 210 per frag for non awakened valk
like, essentine stuff
<@180679257851166721> prob the only one that cares about this lmao
oh yeah apparently they are buffing frag stuff
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
and apparently her banner will have buffed frag drop rate
so you pull for valk get 4/4 at the same time
that's on expa
+1 free stig from event
60 draws = Stigmata Box 
110 draws = Weapon
150 pulls = Stigmata
190 pulls = Stigmata
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
she was bad for budget players, had very small coverage and awful rank up
i'm not joking
yes
<:pepeW:770030202548912179>
= means everyone will have SS
with cheaper expa supply
oh apparently she's like SW
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
PE, FT and ely all 946
for hepha we'll either run mobius or phys
and yeah
nqn is dead
that's not that bad
so they have it in time for sss bke
maybe 7t banner this friday
it'd be pretty boring if it was just a combo attack on field
i was going to say
yeah
i guess
and she'd also need to be on field for quite long
that'd be kinda boring combo attack
oh yeah that's an off field ult alright
yeah it does have it's pro of making it easier to backread on lore stuff if you want to
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
ssg eli modlao
thank you lorelao <:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
if that makes sense
we don't have both going on at the same time
since like
eh i think it's fine to keep them together, personally
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
then
nvm
oooh
for proof LMAO
that's about it
and
past era HoE was kiana look alike, so it would make sense this HoE would also be kiana look alike (literally kiana)
dudu has insane resistance to honkai, so it only makes sense that if she'd turn to a herrscher it'd be an insanely strong one to match
it makes too much sense imo to not be that
my theory is that we will have HoE dudu
oh shit woke up just in time
or not yet
do we already have new chapter
wait
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
hmm yeah that's fair
better rates and pity
so we get best of both worlds
oh wait they're actually getting rid of expa equipment?
it's just a genshin artifact
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
true
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
not every valk has combo
just force it in there
not with that attitude
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
one team
6 newt
we would have
MA
but if you forget about that LMAO
it'd be the newt slot
well
that would be kinda sick tbh
no fair only seele gets it
yeah maybe all valks get a booba stig
or only for new ones
do they just go back and release 4th stig for past sets
i wonder how that'd even work
what do you think
that's why we get 4 stigs on the set
it's new stig slot
lv90 unlocked
patch 6.2
okay so
they can make the playable version w/e they want to conform to what they want to shill
bronya is phys in apho2 and ice in game
i mean it literally doesn't matter
it was always shit
this is very wrong
<:RaidenSheesh:880900512084541533>
cope second sleepri
for uh
i guess utu pri has it's uses still
even if they buff that damage a fuck ton
just like mechanically impossible to get damage off on time to compete with new valks
with no tf
long ass animation
i mean tbh it was expected
saddest dk revival
yeah VKE was like
2 patches
like
is the original dk valk revival weapon active nuke
that btw
but you don't need longer duration in MA
for shorter time ofc
jst newt buffs way more
margrave doesn't buff much if you're not ulting
just MA setup
that's not budget AE lmao
lmao
yeah
but in sim battle you only need one weapon skill
ult - weapon skill - weapon skill
which is that
yeah like i know MA playstyle
lmao
what VKE does
no clue
i have
and that's prob about it for valks people care about
meme and 6s
HoV
AE, VKE
like valks that people care about i mean
are we
we're not missing that many valks
i-it's inevitable right
trust
gonna be useful when AE ER
s1 for suicide strats
<:sus:866768426478862366>
i prefer ss AE
wait actually
i'll take ss1 SN too
<:sus:866768426478862366>
and them changing names won't stop me from calling mihoyo mihoyo
i mean i don't really care about the company like as an entity
<a:Pepejam:792504287049547796>
and then griseo beat fucking dropped
ost disappointed me
i was about to say
oh really?
weird
instead of hoyoverse
5.8 pv has mihoyo
huh
cunny pv
i have peepoleavetiddy
<a:PeepoLeaveTiddy:663441402276872193>
<a:PU_PeepoLeaveExit:855157057887535164>
boomer only
game is fucking
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
who cares
S-rank SP, cost xtal and asterite to roll on banner
every valks SP valk
at this point, fuck it
eh prob not
maybe i'll consider skipping?
or only her mechanics
her gear too?
hmmm
<:safe_hh:710968174887305311>
not mad anymore
i only saw her at v1
okay
oh
cause jesus
i mean yeah they better
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
she already was unskippable for me
with great gear and sp bank with no restriction
she already was MA character tho
that's cool
... bruhmeta
honkai 2022
3 support teamcomp
every type of damage
kithaira is from my armada
whoa
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
instead of pulling on the first thing you see
you talk like you're actually going to save up
yeah
because DoS in MA will still have the nuke
i wonder if it'll be better than DoS on MA
same
if you mean compete = retain
with good enough support
can compete in RL
literally anything
i mean
since her dorm bonus is shit
AKA not being there is kinda okay
she has good dorm bonus
yeah vke not being there is fucked up
rn i have too much to farm
i will agree as soon as i catch up on war treasury valks
and HoR
6s and meme are the ice damage ones
yeah
trust
was worth it
dorm bonus
LMAO pretty cute
HB was fun
so much for boomer player huh
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
this is like official announcement stuff
i think tomorrow we get v2 beta
for now
minty balls
i'm calling it
don't worry he's a degen
why do you know this
mihoyo generally has this stuff figured out
i'm assuming it's similar amount of xtal
that's nice
at least TB
def worth the investment
great budget set for future valk
FT in MA
still good to have
not for elysia
i mean
<:bonkiana:876542176279007242>
none, go craft elysia
sorry
does it? <:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
deal?
i'll fight you for top spot as least horny for loli
hmm
wait you're fucking gay
are your horny for lolis
but she'll be on release/later in the beta
she's not right now in the beta
ye
20s iirc
we don't have EN name of griseo battlesuit yeah
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
more like welcome new era of MA
LE on one team
griseo in another team
HoF/HoT in the third team
and somehow griseo is perfectly catered to me lmao
the least horny for lolis in this server
i'm like
<:lfgCatgirlEdition:803114454187114506>
is fucking busted
v1 griseo
what the fuck
is it entire team sp bank
oh wait
SS LE
what the fuck
60???? no restriction?
lets fucking go
MA content
sick!!!!
double pri patch
god fucking dammit
<a:NOOO:827382402548236339>
that's cute
<:sus:866768426478862366>
it's that one jizo attack
we already have AF weapon active as an attack
only what valk was about to be shilled
not like any previous sss boss had any tie with stuff that was going on before
yeah it was a pretty dumb thought process looking back
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
i'm worried about
but plane
SSS BKE looked pretty fine from what i saw tbh
2 bosses designed for her? <a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
calls out her mom
that'd be cute
when they release AF 2
we're gonna get that too
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
it was a palpable difference
back when i was young you see
now pri is just better version of non pri
they stopped doing that a while ago
probably not
true nvm
7 different things LMAO
but each passive does like
i think it's amusing how the weapon has 2 passives
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
making klein less useful
that's strangely
huh
that enables you to charge herrscher bar by attacking them
yeah i think it's just the mark she can apply on enemies
free 5% phys damage
that's pretty nuts value
and likely even more xtal
that's a hell of a deal
at least 2.4k xtal + HoR for 880 bchip
like you can see on the screenshot
and it looks like it's not even the only reward
preeetty cheap for a valk tbh
yeah 880 bchip
<:KianaDumb:909232418052014171>
i read HoT for some reason
nvm
oh wait HoS
fucking cursed
that's
mihoyo has so many dumb shit with rng not being true random and layers of rng
it's like keeby said i doubt it's true but if you proved it i wouldn't be surprised
hard to say with confidence without intense testing but
i've seen it happen way too many times for it to be only coincidence
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
ez 3 ely signets
restart until ely first door no resets -> confirmed ely door second floor
just do ely seeding
just get lucky
<:A_HuTaoHeart:803337674819764254>
ty carv
oh we already got twitter announcement? i'm giga dumdum then
wtf you can bet
y!dice 2
y!dice
y!commands gambling
do we have bot for that
hmm which one shall i believe
<:sus:866768426478862366>

<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>

ao3
i kinda respect that they want to make their songs optimally unsearchable online
phi squared?
otto fucking rolling in his grave rn
like i know she's dead but you know
i hope senti is fine tho
i think i'm too stupid to follow the story
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
when did that happen?
what?
or did senti also get a body
like is hua just sleepin
what's up with senti then
<a:HUHH:999402772866805770>
senti's dead?
like what's the bad stuff she's done
how bad is she anyways
same
the slowest burn you've ever read
130k words of seele handholding smut
for comparison
do you know word count for other chapters?
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
v3h
aight you know where to find me later
no one told me that????
????????????
is that on beta?
is she happy about that?
oh
wait so what happen to red seele?
but that's unironically what happened
and then a 4th seele showed up with a steel chair
i was going to make a joke
LMFAO
i don't know why it works though
oh god
it's also probably inaccurate
does this help
```ansi
[2;34mSeele[0m becomes god so the other god [2;37m[2;40m[0m[2;37m[0m[2;47m[2;30mSeele[0m[2;47m[0m makes the 2 [2;34mSee[0m[2;31mle[0m go through a boss rush where in the end the 2 [2;34mSee[0m[2;31mles[0m fight [2;40m[2;37m[2;47m[2;30mSeele[0m[2;37m[2;47m[0m[2;37m[2;40m[0m[2;40m[0m.

leaks: me next?
captainverse kinda stacked <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that's a cool turn of event actually tho
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
she's better at puyo puyo than i am
oh wait i forgot that that was the event
i thought she was like acquiring a teri army or something
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
oh
eli's heaven right there
that's
fuck sirin up
teri beat her ass
<a:peepoBlushSHAKE:827795801065127949>
blueberry cookie
usually there's also an epilogue and patch breaks, 4-6 patches is prob more accurate
hmmm calling a story arc 3-4 patches is prob not right
and a story arc is like 3-4 patches
i'm guessing 1 or 2 arcs
i don't think honkai would've gone this far on overseas market without a JP dub
i do agree tho jp kiana doesn't fit the character to me
they care about the masses of casuals, and they think jp is the original
it's right, mihoyo doesn't care about how core player that put a lot of effort think
for once she's right tho
and how stupid they are
they know how their audience thinks
they're all otakus
it was so fucking funny
no fun allowed
<:smoge:959781798181736478>
i tried over at the bot channel i think it's fixed
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
no more flag?
what
owo translate caralho!
yeah i didn't notice at the time though
i was enjoying it until this just happened
i'm kinda 50/50 on it
bandwagon of shitting on it, it's so stupid
people are so fucking upset over a story they only know superficially or only some of the plot points
it actually made me pretty upset
that's a fucked up typo too that i only noticed now
why are you like this
discord
it's actually doomed
there was someone in wfp using carv as a shield for they awful take about the story too
i predicted it
sure but have you considered this:
who cares
they didn't justify the trio teaser
like they didn't need to
i'm surprised they even bothered to try and justify it lore-wise
i mean as far as i knew, i thought all of them were some bullshit like that
that's so funny
senti ain't gonna be very happy go lucky
after hua dies
i mean
okay thank you
LMFAO
like how does that work
how is mei herrscher of origin
hey carv
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
is who made it
and the literal first word on the image
made by someone idk i'll credit it later
i like that that one person went
<a:kokomishot_hh:913802704705433620>
1. retire and uninstall
2. look at the booba as it's released
3. listen to carv describe what happened in the new story chapter
and let carv tell us the story
guys just retire
LMAO kiana and mei at the background like when do we get our power up
maybe ex chapter after for epilogue of part 1
god it hurts my back to be right so often
this is what made sora leave
tet, show me tero3
good mihomo
chapter desc literally spoiling it away
this makes sense tho LMFAO
aww honestly i'm kinda down for a bronya arc where she needs to get strong without a herrscher core
vore
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
shit is just inconsistent all the time LMAO
it's honkai
for no reason
physical and elemental breach just work differently
yea impair is different from elemental breach, but impair is the same as physical breach
also yea y'all pointing out that this aligns with leaks is giga stupid, i'm just keeping consistent with my past takes, and i'm doing that even when it aligns with leaks so that carv stays on the dark, y'all then going oh no leaks! is what actually reveals shit to him <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like if
impair = physical breach
then
elemental impair = elemental breach
yes, impair and elemental breach work differently, impair and physical breach work p much the same
funnily enough people were talking about how we might have physical breach, we already do LMAO
which is why HoS impair is functionally physical breach
meanwhile a buff stays around
you have to reapply debuff on every enemy if there's many
the only reason it's worse is on waves of enemies
besides the one way i said it does
it doesn't
but as a debuff on the enemy, instead of a buff on valk
so if they made elemental impair, it'd be the same as elemental breach
except that impair is a debuff on enemy, and phys breach is a buff on valk
i mean impair is the exact same as physical breach
elemental breach but worse LMAO
elemental impair is just
well
it's been my copium since a month ago
leave me alone LMFAO
that it's coming out in 6.3
similar to how it's my copium
it's my copium
i'm saying that i think it will be
i'm not saying the new bronya suit is going to be herrscher
ok?
ever since 6.1 was in CN
well, i mean
ever since 6.1
he knows i'm the herrscher bronya 6.3 kiana mei 6.4 suit copium
yeah?
i think kiana should be the bait suit for once
bronya got rukkhadevata'd
the original trio
it's kiana mei and elysia
true
the one that all 3 of them are getting
LMFAO
ain't even a herrscher?
so her new herrscher suit
wait a second
L
best scene honestly
flamechasing moths
aren't we some kind of
i loved the part when kevin got up and said
like literally running towards their deaths
who chase flames
they're moths
they're literally called suicide squad
have you thought about how
the flame in HoT2 flamescion is from flamechaser
herrscher of flamescion = HoF
HoT2 = flamescion
HoT2 is flamescion
okay fuck it
HOE
what are we thinking of HoT2?
HoR2 -> HRT
HoT2 -> ?
HoF2 -> END
okay so
no one cares about her
oh
we have 3?
as a name
thunderscion doesn't make sense imo
i think her suit needs to be carrying the torch from fc/ely in specifc
-scion is like, second in line i think
egoscion
yeah i want mei to be something ego
<a:MirioThinking:1002644787490459790>
that's why they're from teyvat, they've been here since the start
maybe the twin was sent to teyvat on the past cycle
do you think genshin is being samsara'd too?
2. really like samsara
and they
1. are making shit happen
they just got a new writing director
yeah i guess something happened over at mihobo hq
finlamescion
but it's not flamescion, it's finality
HoF2
oh sheeesh
this is the first time i'm hearing of it
why you talking like i'm supposed to know this LMAO
is that new info
i mean that makes sense but
so we've had 6 kianas?
what kinda homestuck shit is this?
what?
w
is she alive? is she the corpse? do you mean CE HoE is herrscher of time or was PE HoE herrscher of time?
she's another HoT
ah god fucking dammit
wait a sec then
i thought it was another (trademarked) carv cope take
oh wait she's actually?
paimon
ok
LMAO
teach me
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
i've been daily cappin
isn't there a daily cap?
how do i mine
help
poor as hell
i'm fucking
sick ty
does it even reward anything after you full clear it once
should i be doing the OW abyss thing every day?
yeah that makes sense
i'm guessing not very, windows prob takes care of the most obvious approaches
i wonder how easy it is to do that
honestly
LMFAO
<:elywhip:1002644839248183306>
i use this one
no
imagine trying to do that in maincord
took me a while to whip people here into carv rules
honestly not surprised
ruby i think we're the minority
what happened tho
yeah fuck the community
it's where she was left off
yeah the corpse should be on the moon
those are concepts but
i like that she's way bigger
yea i agree then, the newer design is cooler
i see
okay
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
orange = old
purple = new
the purple or the orange
so which one do you like
<a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753>
i can't follow you
cherry
i think the second is more interesting
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
empty of life
though i do guess it's a potentially telling placeholder date if it's a possible date of 6.3 beginning
they've had placeholder dates before right
2 patches?
isn't that a weird timing tho
ooo i see
i do have a calculator for patch dates if you want
is that an important date
need to change that before apho <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
cause veliona is still alive <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
she hasn't seen all the shit yet
are you playing like 5.5 story or smth <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
<a:KianaShake:848934595814752286>
i haven't watched yet actually
oh can you link the pv?
so like combo a giant fucking hand will come from the sky and smash the enemies
is just gonna be her with HotE help
and then her herrscher power up
cause it's just her from PE ofc
kiana will make friends with HotE
thank you <:Prayge:909232418463047690>
oh it's the beginning of the end huh
nvm it's out
with jp dub
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but i can watch it
i think it's not supposed to be out
can someone try to play the cg in game
hey peeps
<:Sucrose_Glasses:845784727935909898>
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
just fucking spam pinged hei
calm down
i mean i actually meant any kind of like
theresa is the only loli you can have
she's like aight to me, pretty neutral
like, really like theresa
do people like theresa
so really i'm not to blame for not remembering story
and i think back and i remember fucking nothing
like i went through an entire college week
i think i might have legit memory problem
i've said it before
i like twin aesthetics
cause roza and lili were there
also i read some of HoR arc
i played ch30 too
i mean can just be another kind of dog then
she's pretty lively
she'd prob be like a dog
keep coping nini
hmmm
yeah
that's actually pretty true LMFAO
lets keep talking about furries, i know wtf is going on
LMFAO
this i actually understand
nah i'm fine with this topic
everyone agrees tighnari is a furry
you don't have to be covered in fur to be furry
i mean she's still kinda furry
that's sad
oh the ears are from the mask?
raven not very
jackal is
she's called rabbit, how is she not a furry
yeah i'll take kiana the 3rd
another kiana clone? <:2woggers:658553078420602901>
weird situation, the new furry character is not my type
hm
she's like nagamitsu?
oh
you can guess if i'm pulling for the character named animal or not
i mean i'm pretty predictable
okay
do we have pics of her
yeah tet, it's really simple to understand what's going on if you just ignore everything that you don't understand
i don't judge
i mean i have multiple fursonas
is that a different person from jackal
i'm going back to skipping the story, lemme know whos the new booba i have to roll for
is my main character trait
i mean i know i'm stupid LMFAO
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
carv is like: here is the simple, straightforward answer that everyone knows from the story and says some shit that is completely new to me
oh shit
people be dreaming and becoming imaginary, there's 2 kevins and teri's inside his mind and i'm like hey this is a wendys
it's that it's so far removed from any honkai stuff i knew about i'm like wtf is going on
i mean it's not that i think i can't understand it
i didn't know you had an account
wait you play the game?
that's a good one
ayyyy
🙍 -> <a:sleephic:897367201668010044>  -> <:duduhoryshet:963981058905341963>
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
not honkai
is from genshin story
the only dream shit i heard from
no i meant like
and i didn't skip it this time i swear
well, not on the honkai story at least
i don't remember any dream spaces in the story
what
i skipped those
was it during the raven sections?
i'll just keep living in the past
this is too confusing can we go back to ER
by the time she release, ch2 was over and that was when she was mainly doing the antagonising
but i wouldn't call her an antagonist or villain
yeah i can see mobius being like an agent of chaos
cause at this point she's def not anymore
if she was still a villain then or not
rita i dunno when she released
eh i dunno if i'd count either raven or mobius
as if we don't eat that shit up
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
off'd signora too
we can't have villains playable apparently
after HoV they just decided
mihoyo hates money apparently
that looks like c, yeah
i want the music though
god i got hyped
oh
12 hours?
until the animation
how much time
it's really well made
it does look like official art
couldn't hurt right
just a lil 100k xtal
i'll let her know
ay same
i have any power
do we think
do you see how we're having 2 sss boss
yeah
i talked with my mom who works at mihoyo and she said wtf you on, that's too much copium, she's dead
griseo is dead
lmfao
and this is what mihoyo does
one of my clanmates is avoiding ch31 spoilers
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
still HoH
we could have her CE counterpart be the herrscher of honkai
instead of just the possibility
that's kinda fucked up for ely, she deserved her sacrifice to be the guarantee of all future herrschers to be HoH
and not guaranteeing that future herrschers will also be HoH
i see so ely's sacrifice was more over enabling the possibility of people overcoming WoH's influence
cause like even our good herrschers certainly got to the tipping point of being consumed by honkai
is it a fate kinda deal?
that's weird
but no one cares about abyss
i can easily see it being both
who enjoys 3s boss design
but i don't know of anyone
and same gear reqs as abyss
which is slaccer score necessities to t100
i think there are some people that like what sss bosses caused
so bad
like fgo? pig? bke?
lmfao
in certain weeks
1 sss boss is too much for 90% of the playerbase
i mean lets be fair
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
down to the annoying ass transition phase
a 3s boss
ely bossfight is just
we really are getting 3 3s bosses aren't we
god fuck
yeah the pv
<:Madge:909232418379153418>
fuck them!!!
yeah they don't deserve the sora!!
we were here since the beginning, kinda
remember the little us, sora
yeah that's what i said!!
moriso retweed your tweet though that's nice <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
it looks great but it surely takes a lot of work
you're even fitting text font to image now
oh yeah i can imagine
to talk about it
one day i'll know enough about lore
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
impossible for both
i mean i guess for me it's true
yeah i really dunno about that
yeahh i dunno about that
and you translating content for the community
and it's very different me playing well the game
and that i at least try while still sucking
the thing people think i'm good at is MA
i suck balls at abyss
i'm not good abyss gamer
just remember us little guys when you go big will you
for the translation
waiting for when sora becomes famous on honkai community
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
~~i'll have quit by then~~
be it it 6.0, 6.1, 7.0, idc
like they've hyped up herrscher ely so much in the story that she's coming either way
idc honestly
he's eating petroleum
plastic or some shit lmao
i always thought those honkai monsters are made of like
it's cursed imo
senti 2
a baby
she's like
i kinda like HoC
good job sakura
based
also
i just feel like that's going to happen in main story too
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
this is event story?
don't do this to me
oh wait
hoyl fuck
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
yet
to my slander
you haven't listened
but it's pretty nice
yeah, i'm not crazy over it
i like the new neon one
or any HoT skin
any of the drafts
but <:shrug:877047647511384064>
cause purple is my fav color
it's weird
i don't really like barney skin
just don't need it asap
but yeah i like collectibles too, i'm def getting it
oh i guess if you're just getting rid of it then it's prob worth it to do it first
like i'm not using it either way, so i can leave it for last
yeah idc about the stig
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
<a:petthecarv:927662678929997905>
right now it's a skill test for AE

you give us a support that can easily fill AKA trauma
AE test
good designed boss

like leak, datamine and stuff
it's for spoilers that carv can't talk about
it's anti carv spoiler realm
i am taking answers right now
does anyone know
i swear to fucking god you know why we have a leak channel right
i am going to kill a person
more tanky than sss hod
couatl already feels like sss boss lmao
and ignite support would also buff DA
DA also has type counter on her bosses
i kinda really doubt it
really?
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
i guess qua weather changes wasn't for couatl and nyx huh
or do people actually think an ignite support would make non ignite valk top score in ignite weather
do people want fire ignite support just because fire needs support and mihoyo is doing trauma support
s-rank support? i don't think so
i meant like
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
s-rank support i don't think so
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
that's how it's going to be
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816>
i am becoming minecraft player
so like 16 hours or something like that
and rn is 8 am
it's like 1 am for me when beta opens
and fire elf would make sense since this is summer patch
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
outside <#963273616852652095>
no leak talk
y'all kids
taihen i'll murder you
there should be one
i will commit a crime
cause s0 is not enough for anything basically
giga regrets it
skypelao got 4/4 s0 and like
you have SS
you could easily have regret going for SW tho
nirv player can't skip LMAO
but the issue is
i mean it's very clear what they're doing
to know for sure how useful she'll be
we can only wait until beta/v3/release
if she deals enough damage no amount of anti-MA design will make her bad at MA
taihen, it's not as straightforward as this, unfortunately
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
but even non-MA valk get shilled nowadays through sss boss
i mean i sure do hope so
190 without
so 150 with free stig from event
we get free stig from event
shit like this makes me want to leave LMAO
i wanna retire
yeah
yeah
it's 90 for weapon + stig
alt art
sheeesh
tomorrow?
when is story again
they'll be dead in a few patches LMAO
why they're rushing out all flamechaser valk releases
it makes sense now
as far as my sources tell me dendro archon will DN LMAO
didn't kalpas die
that sounds about right
who we have left if those die
hmm i was very wrong then
cat snake?
wait so who died
LMAO
i saw this
is story going on right now
wait
not kalpas LMAO
while ely just <a:ppPoof:933892036296343552>
that's kinda fucked up that he gets to go out like that
which is next
so 2 - 1 - 6
don't make me count <:Cryge:953999086506377306>
please explain to me like i'm a little child
um
oh
could be wrong tho
but story chapter is after kolosten
i think ER is same time as kolosten
but the fact is
it's so easy
are you sure you don't want to ativar o windows?
okay i see <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that's coding done by marketing department
what even is that? like from the event?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that's reasonable
what age
yeah?
like you'd let me smoke weed if it was in the safety of our home yk
like a cool mom maybe
that's my oc
i'm not saying this part though
that's what i'm saying
but between run you still need to get get it again
what neko means is that during that run, it's permanent unless it has usage count
yeah i'm pretty sure you need to get them every run
don't ask what you'll regret later
yeah they absolutely are
why not both
look at seele
but the shine yeah
i don't think it's only the butt
i did a double take and thought we were on <#999758950687842354>
yeah same
i don't have any su emotes
there's 4 su?
i mean we joke but i feel like gsr actually give more stuff for free than genshin <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
isn't after luocha = 1.2?
isn't it sw -> luocha?
kinda smart of mihoyo to make 2 game the same and then put player to compare, pick a side and suck their cock
woah they're launching the game again?
woah they're launching the game again?
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
it only makes sense
10 min of stream = 10 min of ads
:persona3:
no that's lewd
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
maybe i should do yukong's paw job instead
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
delay by 3 hours, still better than genshin 1.1 stream <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
they really are doing it like genshin huh
reveal these -> <:PantsGrab:857300121699614720>
Female (Defined by Cherry)
i'm both
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
?
do i get to pick
wtf what about me
nini about to play 8 gachas at once
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
i'll cover for your seele if you're actually 178 in
yeah that's what i'm saying
wdym
i'll whale for how much is left for seele if you actually are 178 in <:okk:1058108494995263539>
show when updated then
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
dumbass
that's 154
actual 1 in 500m
i calced it
0.0000003%
chance of being this unlucky is
yeah i need proof <:okk:1058108494995263539>
that bad luck is fucking insane
i can calc the chance of that happening but i'm 99% sure you're miscounting somewhere
that's either 90 -> 88 or 89 -> 89
if you're 178 in without uprate
i don't think that's right
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
<:whale_childe:802458427347173406>
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
<a:ripBozo:1015579412432961566>
you tell them good morning and they say what do you mean by that
you come up to your mc and they go i swear it wasn't me
cLara
L
me neither
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
soft pity is 75 up
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> sushang
why do they get smaller
danheng sounds like such a nerd in en va
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
<:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
i'm keeping the outlook even though i know nothing of gsr
are these leak/datamine?
i would be reeeeally surprised if some shit like that worked on gsr
mihoyo uses basically the same system for gacha in honkai and genshin
that sounds like thorough bullshit
schrodingers america
i may or may not depending on what you mean by america
i'm so sleepy
it's 5pm
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
?
in a way i'm glad this is the general chat and not <#966951945103347794> anymore
you can hate me if you want to
LMFAO that's so mean
poor guy was just doing the rational thing and building pity, you see
me too
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
it's very slight increase i think
interesting
ER rewards get better <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
notably, yae even gets outperformed by a nothing
a lot of c0 valk get outperformed by high cons 4*
true about everyone in genshin
isn't that like
yanqing has the lowest standard 5* ownage because people reroll to get away from him
otto kills hua, you go <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153> there was actually a really in depth reason
yanqing kills hua, you go kill yourself
it's like the double standards meme
you always learn something new huh
what the hell
the game has a story?
he's very useful i hear
you're going to get a yanqing eventually
congrats!
sheeesh
<@385655541248163840>
they should've made (leak) deez nuts wind
this feels nsfw
me too
so i'm chilling it down now
like i've been overly negative on stuff before like over at <#966951945103347794>
i mean i agree too and i would've felt like a shitty person if i was overly negative when he was enjoying it, i just didn't think i was overly negative
do i come out way more aggressive than i intend to?
i get it if i went no it sucks i hate it i hate it i hate it but to me i thought it was so tame
that's how i work
here's one thing i'm meh about, what do you think about it? what do you enjoy?
i dunno, i'd think i didn't do it in a bad way though, to me it was such a small thing, like a light criticism that i was just starting conversation about it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> maybe
i didn't earn to talk to you that way
i thought you would understand my intentions better than you actually could
obviously but still, you wouldn't have thought that i was trying to make you unhappy about the game
you'd understand that when i said those things were just 2 small nitpicks i had with the game
and my style of actual criticism
like, if you knew that i've been having a good time in gsr beforehand
though this is a good example of earning it
from my pov i just pointed out 2 nitpicks
i dunno, like it is my fault i think if i come off that way
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
have you heard me complain about honkai
absolutely
like i'm being so cordial and using such light words
this is extremely light criticism
you haven't heard me talk about honkai
is me being a downer
if you think the way i'm talking about gsr
but i'm gonna be clear
i mean i'm sorry if i made you feel like i was being a downer to your enjoyment
so then i explained why i didn't
and that's fine!
like i went and i also kinda am eh about the jokes, they haven't earned it for me and you went well but i like it
for the joke thing, it was the complete opposite though
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that's literally not what i did
i'm explaining why i don't
i'm not saying that you're wrong to enjoy the jokes
i come here to say what i feel about stuff and put it into words
that's what i do though
what? i mean, sorry, i guess?
like, if you make a new acquaintance, there's certain types of jokes you don't make with them
i don't think i am?
it's very neutral
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i think that for some reason you think of earning it as something very evil
i mean it's 101 story telling stuff, you know about suspension of disbelief, no?
like, suspense of disbelief
it's the basis of story telling
they offer you enough for you to accept it, every action they do they have to earn it
every interaction you have with media, it's a trade
every joke has to earn it
how is it not?
because they do, to me
games that i play, they don't do that early
so i wouldn't know
i mean i haven't played much jrpg
it's one where the in-universe it's extremely unfunny, and it's funny only for us, out of universe
like it's a very specific kind of joke
that kind of joke tho?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
2 hours in
they're making those jokes like
like, actually?
really?
then yes, it very much has
like i said, if you're bringing baggage from genshin/honkai
i think that's very important
but it doesn't until it's earned it
it goes meta and it's funny and also emotional
one of my favorite games is undertale
you have to earn being meta like that to me
i'm like chill
like when they go metaverse? like facebook in real life?
the meta jokes are what make me weird
it's a different type of joke
i'm just not for reasons
i would be way more okay with the jokes early on
like if i was willing to bring my baggage from genshin
if it was like hey this is a side project smaller game for people who are already invested into honkai/genshin i would agree with you
that's kinda mean to gsr
i don't get from the like advertisement of the game that it's supposed to be like cool off from genshin at this sub game
calling it a spin off gives it less credit than it deserves
i think that's disrespectful
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it just feels way too early for that
my problem ain't even that they're bad
they haven't earned like 80% of the jokes
like someone you just met treating you like you're long time friends, it feels off
is that there's very little heart and too much joking around
another problem i feel with the story, but i think this is only for me
there's like 2 songs <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> music
<:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
meanwhile bronya is also looking like a clown
like there's one scene where you go how can't you believe i'm from outside this world, look at my clothes at bronya
it's v much design
maybe, i wouldn't put it in the color first tho
all clown from different circus
that actually looked like sumeru
the combo of fucking mc + mar7 + danheng + seele + bronya on story though
himeko welt also don't look off
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like asta herta arlan all look right there
i think it's maybe the point? it's probably on purpose
i'm not saying there's anything wrong with that feeling, it's just weird when it's the main cast of a non-crossover game <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i mean yeah, i'm saying that like logically star rail designs shouldn't feel like that
it's like, in the back of my mind i have the thought that i'm supposed to be going <:BatChest:1021180786650648608> i can't believe they're in the same place
sumeru are bad
liyue character all look like they're from liyue
especially like same continent
i mean there's some, generally they're very cohesive
really?
maybe
like i'm looking at goku and naruto
it feels like it's a crossover game
any time there's like 3/4/5 character on screen in gsr
i'm not saying like same series or anything, i dunno
hmmm i disagree i think, wc ci vc look right
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
i dunno <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
no combination of character actually look like they belong together
there's something wrong with the designs
personality wise they're nice
i'm not sold on it yet
cool
overwatch?
gravey yard
god i wish i was kept in a graveyard
not safe
he should be kept in a zoo
stop defending him
<:fricc:1047970291571245086>
fuck sampo
cause it's sus
did you get to the part where dan heng star rails you?
<:smajj:1095723300581294110>
<:fricc:1047970291571245086>
done aster
<:crying:757445037402619974>
ok
<:fricc:1047970291571245086>
<:Sitt:1025219070905290792>
25
i don't think abyss has that many floors in this game
you guys wait until 10 pull?
and then kicked clara
i took all of the painkillers
keep the white background
i have no AoE on my teams
they're so annoying
i hate those
if you had luck you'd be using a five star instead
he isn't that cool
i think the idea of svarog is hotter than svarog himself
i won't be able to keep up i think
yeah i guess just resin diff
i'm 21, i have a good amount of quests to do but not thaaaat many
i mean maybe
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i'm like 3 days late but i'm not sure if that's 10 levels
how do you even level up that fast, spam world quest?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
most guys in genshin/honkai are pretty fucking slim tet
i'm 10000 years old
youthful is subjective
realistically speaking everyone in mihoyo game are twink
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
cause i have like actually no characters that i want
gsr and zzz for me is so weird
<a:socujj:1082719419404390623>
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
fuck no
no
you have no clue
my gepard is so strong you guys
so only arlan and i don't like him
like i'm missing natasha qingce but i'll get them eventually
also happened to me in genshin
kinda crazy that i'm missing only 1 4*
<@964806731471405086> hi!
look
you can
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
gepard is the only story boss i beat first try
i wish i could remove sampo
i'm gonna leave him at lv1
also my 5* was gepard <a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206>
same for genshin
bye eli
but i could be wrong
like it feels like they want us to have way more resources than genshin
hi!!!
game feels way more generous
i wonder if gsr meta will be more rough
you could reenact the hit film up
post divorce depression
do they make them go through like
throw him in the wall
yeah see tet gets it
that's what i'm talking about
like you know when you see a cute hamster and you want to HoS ult it
yeah you get it
punt in a friend way
no
that's a show of affection as far as i'm aware
i think i could punt them
i can be there
kinda proud
and they're almost as cute as me
me too
i get it
extremely cute
okay it is
:jignyuan
:jingyuan:
i can count the pixels
cmon tet
i'm interested
do it
now
everything they ever do feel so conservative
i wish league got actual big game changer patch like that
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i saw people on the dota reddit going like next game i wanna explore south east!
looking at dota now, it looks even more like so
back then i already thought it was so stupid for how meaningless it was
kinda jealous, the biggest game changer league got was the alcove bs
it looks crazy
i actually got swept up on that
that's why you enjoy this server so much?
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
idr how to remove it
i set nickname for everyone on genshin
i have no clue then
L
it resets it
i think if you set blank nickname
set worse ones
🚮
i didn't have to come today
test is next week
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
and i'm not ready
i have a test in a few hours
hi taihen
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
i'm also a role model to aster
you're the one assuming it just started
aster villain arc
<@416445660443967491> what level are you
lumi hates kids
wouldn't be the first time <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
isn't she an orphan
4 sushangs
i forgot to send the message <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
the single only player rerolling for gepard
baban literally
i see
do the other letters mean
what
cursed /piece of shit account?
<:childewhale:787558905533693982>
all around me
surrounded by whales
i appreciate it but you shouldn't compare it with the one word that's used in probably the most amount of ways
lmfao
i have no fucking clue
it does throw me in a loop to figure out the emotion it's trying to portray
when it's just lucario scream
how much i use the emote name to figure out what you mean by it
you know, emote like that really make me realise
that's best in slot actually
genshin sidequest often can be exponentially better than mainquest
if they wanna be like genshin, i'd take that as a good thing
they love us
they would throw us a bone
mihoyo is so kind
nah no way
like it sounds small but it can be really big actually
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
do you keep the sub stat?
i don't mind lies
would you really
<:Woah:765639006218092554>
i don't know what i'm supposed to read there
can i have some red circles
those are my standards
if it's ears + skinny cat tail then no
that's enough for me
if you have ears + fluffy tail
she has a tail actually
most people would count her though
tingyun i'm meh about
i would definitely count bailu
tingyun
bailu
my laptop would run it a like 5-10fps
so i'll play on a pc that can run properly
on the very beginning
i don't want to have a bad experience
or rather
but i don't think i can play on laptop
i did that so i could do daily check in
i haven't even picked mc yet
i just opened the game enough to generate an UID
yeah i haven't logged in yet
<:2D_O2FlyingKiss:759144102771163207>
a good 80% of turn base rpgs are the same <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
they're aiming for the degens
mihoyo understands target audience
or i'll whip your ass
spoiler stuff please for carv
that's datamine, right?
ingame download like 1gb or so on pc
for now it's like that
glad to be of service
<a:AA_Gab_Bow:914213000594980964>
the only spoiler that we know that we can tell you is DEEZ NUT LMFAOOOOO which should happen still in 1.0
i think it's very offensive to kevin that you'd even call gepard that
<a:ripbozo:1010573479852126239>
like in genshin, i had plenty of fun before just shitting around with fwens
you don't need a lot of effort into content to have fun with friends
it can be fun <:okk:1058108494995263539>
even if it's really small
eh we give mihoyo shit but i doubt they won't do something eventually
oh it can KO me too
just try, but i wouldn't be surprised if you get it on all acc
the pre reg stuff?
but the event stuff might
i assume like redemption code, no
what code?
no clue
<a:AA_Gab_Bow:914213000594980964>
so we can play together
come to NA before you go too far in the EU acc
the only person on this server playing on EU is <@482139585355448333>
look at the list of people playing
reroll angle
not for kevin, i just think i could use the money
me too
i can dm you too
go over the leak channel, do you have access to it?
leak there's already a big list of upcoming s-rank for gsr
permanent banner is lacking on hot dudes
oh
blade?
lmfao
are there any chara that are your type?
who would you even whale for, nini
f2p nini arc
i'm so proud
everything else is just messing with the numbers to try and confuse the player
they have the math down exactly on how many s-rank per patch they want f2p to have on avg
when the free pulls from levelling started drying up, they added free pulls on bp
it's all they care about, you can see in genshin how no matter how different the events are stack up, you get about the same amount of pulls per patch
it doesn't matter if it's 10x as likely if you get 10x less pulls
it's only a combination of those + resource income/price of pull
neither of those is what matters by itself
would
i'm interested
wdym i have so many seele + bronya combos there
those are the juiciest playerbase
turning away player that are ready to spend 100+ dollar to start playing
it'd be awful for them
they'd never
you can have my hi3 acc
you got your sights on properly then <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i think that's the best starter acc possible
that's fair
or are you just keeping up with the meta from the sidelines
are you playing ruby
that makes sense
i don't remember if i pre-registred or not <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
pre-release event - <> (daily warps for max 2 rewards)
daily check-in - <>
can i claim like the pre reg stuff?
i did the daily check in
what else can i do online
i'll try when i get home on pc
can't play this shit
actual 5fps
it sucks on my laptop
sorry i meant
the players need you
@marisa it's time
i don't actually really like yanqing either
homophobe
sheeeesh
it sucks on laptop
i can't play the game
nevermind then
oh
and then got seele
yeah, boo lost for yanqing
maybe she's turbo broken
maybe you should be happy about 5 asta
and i was really mad
i got like 5 xiangling
when genshin released
you know
no i thought about the consequences of my actions
nevermind
me when i
idk i don't feel it
but asta is so pretty
serval is cringe which is fun
asta obviously
LMFAO
to getting more pulls
there's one simple trick
try again <:okk:1058108494995263539>
works now apparently
that didn't work
one of the code
natasha
the first three are from release stream right?
where is it from? those 2
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
the last 2
i'm being told these codes don't work
sounds good
AS? AI? AA? <:KianaDumb:909232418052014171>
what's asia abbreviation?
<@803575968374849536> you're EU right

unironically SO true
TRUE
8ball did i break you
it is just your list
if you dm me them i can keep it a secret from everyone else
you can also add more potential answer
<@483689649727078400> you too
awww
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
beat the allegations
8ball is <@309634550273933314> a cute and funny person
sounds good
8ball am i lovely?
it would be slightly more code but i could even do rarer answer too
however many you want
i mean
but like don't worry about it if you don't want to
you could add special one for underarc like heki would do that
and i can code it very quickly
also if you wanna make an 8ball, just send me a list of possible answer
if you wanna pick feel free but if not then i'll do that way later
i'm not gonna do that any time soon
and i upload it
just send me her pfp
yes
while i figure this out
do you wanna do an 8ball
don't see why not
you should
can you please give her a cute name and a role color
it's okay
she can hear you she just can't speak back
nice one
okay tell her hi for the last time cause i'm about to kill her ability to answer
motetrly instinct
sorry just doing some testing
$extract 123
i love you tet
i literally did nothing you already love arcy
this shit is so easy
skill issue
aw you got a boring one
such a good girl
i gave her new tricks
try doing hello again
thoughts ?
and gave her skin to arcy
so it's like you ravaged her dead body
she was the minecraft server bot
i mean we can take apart the old ely elf for parts
<:wholetcook:1151659795531710534>
we already have an ely elf
so formal
similar concept right, tet yes, cherma
but it just read like
i know it's like the name of the person who sent the message
yes
do you want to pick her a pfp
i saw it happen in real time
$hello
it says hello if you do this
i'll start programming it now <:Okk:1101008973412438106>
is the message generator one i said i would do like months ago
the bot that just joined
SOOOOO true
i thought you made them
wdym you wanna know too
how do you make those
<:dogkek:664517636524343344> <:jphPlus2:1062420906720366632>
that's a pretty good one, the punchline to the screenshot clearly stating the amount of tweets and that no it didn't
lmfao
to survive
i need halloween
tet is right
have fun
DT952HQVTZJ5
it's a code
discord genshin thing
hey i have an uh
new people
<a:PANIC:1069826466889605201>
and then when playing steins gate later he went huh this is giving me danganronpa vibes
the first anime game he played was danganronpa
the streamer i watched had an actual ,.. bossbaby moment
also is similar
but that one line they screencap
idk anything about the story
that one lowkey could be true tho
let's fucking go
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
but i do know what the other 2 are, i just don't know the flags <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i can recognise 7/9 flags
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
yeah probably
i don't have one
i'm here to welcome anyone back
🚮
unironically just ganyu
happy birthday!!
birthdate: unknown
i thought that was happy birthday to charlotte va <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
i can barely read it
can we make the bot role a better color
i guess that makes sense
<@1053015370115588147> what's the date of your info cutoff? do you know stuff from current times?
<@1053015370115588147> what's your info cutoff?
LMFAO
<:crying:757445037402619974>
i don't like mousse, so the other for me <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i'll be the sister
we are right here, on the one that we did?
that from all the universes that we never met
isn't that so nice
did it get cancelled?
is it good? what's it about?
the art is kinda pretty
<a:pepeMeltdown:933941237021569035>
i had some shit lore takes and no one was there to scold me
<:crying:757445037402619974>
we missed you so much
zach, do you remember the 1989 film field of dreams?
teticularCancer is a valid persterchum handle! [TC]
you guys are kinda weird
you're like sherlocking over those screenshots
damn
i thought you sent screenshot of you wishing well TT for M and then getting an M on supply <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
oh ok
if you're going to pull more, then don't wishing well yet
but you only wishing well after you're done pulling
i mean yeah
wishing well and continue pulling?
why would you do that
or do they actually do that a bunch already
like do these channels just go around the street and grab trash to restore for yt and tiktok
i wonder how often people do these restorations irl
he really is
from jojolion?
i hate twitter search engine with  a passion
maybe i should commission, i'll look on tumblr though
i'm lookin
<a:aPeepoDetective:421054275561586698>
i wanna look for asa/yoru wallpaper
where do i look for art stuff
can you only predict dumbasses
it's really hard to make good irony nowadays huh
but for stuff like this <:shrug:877047647511384064>
like the one for DPe was a little worse cause it actually made some teams stronger in an unintended way, the HoT DPe PV teams
that's the kind of mistake that mihoyo makes that i don't really blame them for
even if they found out day 1, the earliest they can fix it is 6.5
i didn't say it was fast but it's about as fast as it matters
it surprises me that people even figure that stuff out
i see, that's interesting
i don't have END and not even honkai installed to do any testing of my own
sorry for not answering for when you spoke about it earlier, i just didn't have much to say LMFAO
oh that's actually pretty cool, i wonder if you were partly the cause of the fix
<:Cluelessge:1010405580613095514>
it's good, you can cancel it and swap to a better valk

but pavlov dogging cherry into laughing at my jokes
maybe the true social pressure was not social pressure
you get a few keilo points
i can appreciate a good reverse card
don't rush me
i'm gonna
i already said i will
cherry
ch
but i will
sometimes i send a message before thinking about it thoroughly and when i read it back it sounds way funnier than the first time
i cackle at my own jokes
i'm just joking too, i do like how funny i am but i don't measure myself by how funny i am to other people, i measure myself by how funny i am to myself
cherry goes to the person who put a lot of value on herself that she is funny oh you're not, i have very low standards
i appreciate the effort but i prefer the social pressure theory
cherry -> i socially pressure her to find dumb shit funny
tet -> mental illness
chrom -> homestuck
my jokes are like a venn diagram for what each person finds funny

wait how many automod words did we figure out?
brazilian is brasileiro, it's not even close
that's wrong
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035> can you say that, tet?
no it looks fine
owo translate you really suck at this
thanks for the fact cherry!
if they wanted to go at acceptable speed they'd be playing another valk
dehya player
she's takin her time
actual reverse powercreep
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
like a bite
but not eaten
i've licked soap before
eaten?
you're unironically eating the packets that have do not eat
that's so fucking funny
LMFAO
fucking soap
wait it's actually
everything is just longer ways to die
though i guess
sure, to some people moving would just be an longer way to die
it's not even like they had the idea for that and made it, it was a joke in the middle of a bigger thing
one scene of a weird series
it's like
like do you think they actively thought about it when they made it or was it an accident
the way they build tension slowly it's incredible
like the comedic timing works SO well
do you think they knew how masterfully made it was when they made it
i think that video is a modern day masterpiece
why are you buying fries at the soap store
wait i got a funnier joke than they switched my soap and tet's fries
y'all the soap in my meal taste like fries
like me, unless i get a sick deal i can't afford to do college overseas
i mean obviously but to some people they can't just choose to move <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
everyone getting keilo'd recently
yeah i mean unironically though, some places will pay for you to fly over and do college as long as you stay around and work there, cause they need the workforce
that's the aussie version of the emote
:aintnorway:
there's some countries that literally pay you to go to college
you can look for college in other place
i mean if you're alr leaving your country
thank god
wait you're british?
same thing
uh
is try to look for courses outside of the us
yeah i dunno, the most i can say for shit like that
yeah cringe
to some degree, everyone at my college want to be here of their own accord
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
at that point then idk
join a group that's actually doing stuff
can't you change group then?
just talk to the professor about it
i mean but actually
like hey i'm doing this shit alone, can you grade me as such?
that kinda shit you can prob figure out with your professor i think
if you don't care, they don't care either
most professor care deeply if you care
no professor is going to give a shit
like if you don't do your lists and don't put the effort in
no ones going to hold their hand much either
you do need it
college is when that isn't true anymore <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
like in high school i'd say the same thing, that i know that i'm supposed to do it to learn, i just don't cause i don't need it
like even if they say they realise it, they're saying just like they said in high school
i don't think it's like an ideology thing for them
but they don't realise it
there's a purpose for it, you need to do it to learn, you need a lot of repetition for programming
and yeah it's true, but those exercise lists aren't for your prof to make you occupied
and they act like it's the same in college
they look at exercise list and go eh i can get away without doing them
like a lot of people coming from high school
i mean sure but i don't think it's their personal value
i think it's more about that they either don't care about practicing or haven't realised that they're supposed to practice a lot
i don't think it's about a different core philosophy of what they want to learn
mostly because they don't practice enough though
for 1st semester peeps here, i wouldn't go as far as 80%, but like about 30-40% don't go well at it
yeah i mean i think that's normal
so if you wanna know only knowledge you use in jobs then you can get away with that
but there is certainly a divide between knowledge you use in normal jobs and knowledge you use in mainly academic environment
like i mean sure, if they know nothing then of course they're not going to achieve much
you can get away without a lot of academic knowledge
i dunno, if you're going to do programming stuff
so if you only have one, and are confident enough to not run shield or healer, then you can run aloy for better damage
going ganyu + ayaka would be better, but that's 2 5*s
it's a diona replacement for a [ganyu/ayaka] [venti/kazuha] mona diona team
like aloy has a place in the meta right now
aloy is unironically better
so you can do it yourself kinda deal
you should get like 4 punches
i do think it's stupid that it's one input
i don't mind that her burst is short, i kinda vibe with it
which for genshin is probably fine
and she'll become a meh character
you double her personal dps
any outside buff will just end up buffing other characters just as much
she would def benefit with some qol but the only way to save her is to change the character
so the difference between performance of her and other character will stay the same
whatever it does, will also just be a power increase to other characters
like unless the artifact is somehow equip bonus: dehya deals +200% fire damage
is that it's really hard to buff her with an artifact set too
the issue with her
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
so during her field time, she doesn't benefit from her own damage mitigation
during burst, she disables her E
i'm sure some environments would reward it
i don't think the first approach is an inherently worse one, but it is an inherently shallower one
like if it's go the academic route, the second way of thinking would get you farther
hmmm i dunno, it'd probably depend on the course
but it's like that
and like it doesn't make very much sense if you think about it
like i think it'd be so much happier if my body was like this but i was transmasc
it's probably something like that, to be comfortable with the way you are by just changing the frame of reference
i know one transmasc person who wants to be a femboy
yeah i dunno i've heard some enby people also feel that way
i mean maybe, i don't fully understand it either
<:crying:757445037402619974>
to bind boobs i'd die for it
not to be masc, but transmasc
one of the weird things about gender to me is the wish to be transmasc
L
i would unironically give body parts to be able to bind boobs
god i wish that was me
i can answer whatever you want but it's not gonna be unbiased
opinion is bias, you can't have unbiased opinion <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
do you know what an opinion is
which is why, keilo points
and i don't like it
like even if you wanna send the same kinda idea when you say kys or shut up, the vibe of both is waaaay different
yeah, changing small things in your vocabulary can actually change a bunch about how you feel/think
i'll kill a person
which is why i recommend going like i'm going to commit a crime instead or something like that
it's actually a thing tho, like if you go i'll kill myself often for small things it'll actually taint your thought process
yes that sounds right
thEn -> timE
thAn -> compArison
oh look
same brain
tet is faster
then is for time, than is for comparison
it's not like wfp staff, i'm asking you to be kind, you can still be an asshole if you want, you just get no keilo points
anyone try word for me
yeah absolutely, i wouldn't call him bad though, just meh
actually yeah i can be <:dogkek:664517636524343344> but it doesn't surprise me
i'd like to be but i dunno if i even can at this point
i'll be nice this time and won't take away points
i can tell what you mean
i'm not wfp automod
i make up the rules, heki
cmon heki, i know you're better than this
do you not want the keilo points
heki
but before thoma it was actually hu tao's best team, just harder than normal team cause no shield
i think thoma stole that spot now
for hu tao amber xingqiu kazuha
like for a sec there she actually had a best team spot
amber had her uses
for like literal free valk
yeah he's kinda sick
kaeya kinda broken imo
i'm still a kaeya believer
we're fixing that with dehya
so mihoyo went
xinyan found a few team where she's useful
hiding from carv channel
leak channel
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
of course it's a gacha machine
i'm ascending
<a:PU_peepoAngel:762442059956617226>
like <:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
they could've just made abyss2 a different gamemode
i'll never get over it
god it makes me so upset still
huh?????????
huh????
what a wild idea, huh?
so they could keep the same design while just making the enemies stronger!
when in the past they wanted to buff MA, they made a new bracket
the only thing 1s -> 2s changes is hp amount
i'm pretty sure it's always been 2s actually
i think it's always been 2s
i don't actually know
they removing my gamemode is only one of the shit things they be doin
maybe for a little while, probably not for long though
i do wonder if 2s MA stayed around if i'd still be playing the game
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
you think we still have 2s MA here
oh shit
that's sick
oh you kept the screenshot from before the time jump
best girl from gsr
me and cherry we came from the alpha timeline
i'm not misremembering, i just switched timelines
actually i think i just got george mandella effect'd
yeah why isn't it astra
what the fuck
wait her name is asta?
sorry chrom you need a phd to understand what i'm saying
wh <:OMEGALUL:995381052958838905>
so i vibe w it
astra is my fav character from gsr
i dunno i just follow what everyone else is doing
i was like yea? how else am i supposed to find the lines?
i read that message twice to figure out what's wrong with it
i'm not gonna lie
i'm such a good va
so true
from when i did the albedo voice lines
on the va channel
oh i do have voice clips around
make me nerdy
just commit you coward
<a:Nerdge:960240242114318416>
i don't have different voices for reading messages sorry
yeah you should be happy about that
and if you don't, you should be happy, cause i'm pretty sure under nowaday's geneva conventions it's a war crime
and you can make your own themes too, if you know css
and themes
there's like tons of plugins
betterdiscord
it's an option on default discord, under appearance, just called compact
jesus fuck don't say that
all chatting platforms looked like that
like early 2000s internet
it's not even that old tho
irc used to be like that
it's for old people
yeah absolutely
like alice and neko
it kinda sucks with some people in specific
yeah i like it
yeah it looks kinda ugly, i vibe w it tho
i use a plugin that makes people's message the same color as their role
if i do i'd have to play it
to make a genshin tcg web based simulator
i've actually have a thing in the plans
idk maybe
i've never played the genshin tcg but that's how i understood it
then it'll keep the buff
like if you buff it above maximum
yeah that's how i understood it
like, if it's at 2, it doesn't go +2 to 4, it only stays at 4 if it's already at 4
i think it just keeps the amount of usages if it's above the initial amount
i don't think it adds to the currently existing usages
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
and i guess they really can <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it actually really gets on my nerves, they act like as long as they call every change bugfix they can get away with it
for everything
god i kinda hate that they call it optimization
oh try word
it's 8, right?
oh sheeesh i got one
i guess the better term would be submissive
i dunno what else
can you try furry, MA, agony 1, moriso, genshin, gsr, chatgpt, ai
sorry, it's just my spell to get bottoms to do what i want
<@781539392039682058> be a good girl to me, wouldn't you?
is furry one
it's pretty hard to me to guess actually
lightning lightning lightning mei lightning empress
yeah, i wouldn't say it if i didn't think it
dan schnider moment
you can't hack a system that i don't even know how works
i control that market
you lose a keilo point
i mean you asked
LMFAO
<:ToeSuck:625117477025611796>
i have a toesuck emote
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
<:RemSniff:592446857100394506>
i respect it
they really know what they're about
LMFAO i mean if someone else does, when you come back then you can just remake them
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
responsibilities in a discord server are fucking meaningless
it's a discord server
not if you don't want to, you can just tell them that you will when you feel comfortable and if that doesn't happen then <:TeriTeehee:476615023343697921>
cherry call the police
i dunno, can you tell the truth? i was overwhelmed and left a few servers for a while or something like that
hey heki <:elywhip:1002644839248183306>
honestly i would take some of you out for a dinner [i pay]
i dunno, from past experience just giving people funny points is enough to make them happy
like unironically
i'm actually worried about how many death threats this server been going through
i'm gonna make a keilo market, you get keilo points every time you don't say kys
oh kys is one now
wog
i don't get warned for some reason
i don't think i can, can i?
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> 10 mystic enhancement ore
but it's mihoyo
you expect them to do something sensical
that's where they get you
is it a gacha?
not a lot of info huh
there's
the designs look nice yea
don't make fun of me
nvm i can read
what game is that
the problem with anime
i beat tet to the punch
that's cool, i'd still not fuck her though
move clara to C, herta to B and that's a tier list of how willing i'd be to fuck them
oh the cons are like the boku no hero gacha

php public discord server?
there's a
<@516591030326525983>
watcha need
i know a good amount of php
but that's the idea
you ideally shouldn't do exactly that, with arguments on the url
something like 
the way to do it is just to make the js send a requisition to a different page and that page you program to take the inputs and send it to the database
yeah
mihoyo is known for their ability to plan ahead
open the event on a friday, so people can get their keys late sunday

:(
that's mean
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
yeah i'll fix it
it's always heki
outstandingly so
himeno is a mess, she deserves jail as long as that jail is my bedroom
i was reading an analysis that said
that could cause a bunch of friction
if you are the himeno is a groomer camp and they're a i wish i was denji so i could be groomed camp
there's tons of different types of csm fans
you gotta be careful
i mean maybe
<:TeriWoke:646539680996786186>
until then we
chapter 97 is the end of the part 1
buckle up next stop is at ch97
this is chainsaw man
but it ain't chainsaw man
first 7 episodes is like a really good shonen anime
chainsaw man pacing is a meme for a reason
how op can it even be if it shaves off actual years of lifespan when you use it
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
that's like 3/4ths
makima's gone, himeno's gone, denji's fucked, kobeni/arai are in heavy danger
half is generous
it's a nail
.
LMFAO
i'm on waiting room for you reaction of ep 8
like 2/3rds of the way there
should be kinda close tho i think
idts
are you sure you haven't watched it already
it isn't like other anime where they go oh no i tripped and fell in your booba
like when sexual stuff happens in csm, it forwards the plot, basically
that's the guy
yeah LMFAO
that's not really what happens at all in csm
show sexual stuff just for the reader to get off or smth
i mean when someone says fanservice it implies scenes where they like
i wouldn't call it fanservice but it doesn't shy away from sexual themes
yea
yea
i wouldn't call it 18+, but uhhh
though hmm idk about age stuff
i'm up for hosting a watchalong of it
i wasn't memeing
see
<a:CSMBongoPochita:756752095654182962>
chainsaw man
is not gonna be the entire story tho, it's prob gonna be either 3 seasons of 12 episodes or 2 seasons + a movie
yesterday we got ep8, this season has 12, so you can binge that next month
but you can wait until the rest releases
csm is one of those anime/manga i'd prob recommend for literally anyone cause it's just that good
i'm having a blast
it's really fun reading the reactions from anime onlies though
reading comprehension devil
all of them can't keep their mouths shut and half of them don't even spoiler properly cause they read the entire manga in 40 mins and understood approx. 15% of it
csm manga readers are fucking mental
send help
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
i'm officially obsessed with chainsaw man
<:feliscryhic:952156584010735656>
yay
objectively best color
which is based
a lot of nb people i know also have purple as fav color
but yeah i mean i don't mean it as to stick non binary people into a box that purple should be their color, just that
and i was like buddy i have some news
and they went woah i really like purple too! i wish i was non binary
one time i told my friend that purple is my favorite color and that i had a theory that it was like the color for non binary people
<:yippee:1002596802656223274>
truly
purple s-rank color
<a:aworryFlashbang:897712369843716126>

everyone messing with highlights
i guess
oh dyno doesn't count as a bot
it only pings you if you haven't been active in the last 5 mins
gotta wait a bit
cause you're active
won't work
but i think i can't block people
see dyno offers soft ping even for non-mods
?highlight block
yea smart
that's how you add highlights
LMFAO
wdym no
highlight add bonya
it only soft pings like once every 5 mins or so
for carl tho
it doesn't ping me if i've been active in the last 5 minutes on the chat
?highlight
for dyno i don't think it is
he missed a lot of pings from me
carl is kinda weirdge
oh i'm doing dyno now, tai
<:wavekawaii:590500669119660053>
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
cause you keep talking about fucking furries
cause of mudae
but i did turn off ma as a softping
or else i'd have blocked heki already
at least i don't know how to
i can't block from soft pinging
i'm retiring end on 6.3
if so arc city still has like 3 months
is this chronological order?
everything will be okay
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
wow kinda professional
Hey guys, just wanted to wish you all Happy Thanksgiving. Our friendship, from the deepest to virtual, is very important to me and I want to take this opportunity to write from my heart. These feelings couldn't possibly be represented by a cookie-cutter message like a simple Happy Thanksgiving. So, I'd like to thank you all, you're the best Israeli-funded paramilitary server I've ever interacted with.
Hey guys, just wanted to wish you all happy thanksgiving. Discord is filled with ready-made messages that you don't even read, you just copy and paste to every server, I don't like that, I like writing from my heart. Our friendship, from the deepest to virtual, is very important to me and couldn't ever be represented by a cookie-cutter message from anywhere. So, I'd like to thank you all, you're the best Punishing: Gray Raven server I've ever interacted with.

LMFAO
<:PopcornTime:749134519487037461>
a big event like a world cup
just one big event that gets everyone tweeting and overheat a server for it to go down and have no one to fix it
twitter is this <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> fucking close to stop working entirely
like the people who are on standby most of the time and work to keep things running if they fail
elon got rid of the staff who fix issues like this
oh yeah this is the start of the end
L-nya
i think they're the same character
you know, kusanali and theresa both have a in their name
lfg i'm not toxic confirmed
do i have a toxic quote
what eve nis the background to that
yeah it's not bad
at the end of a run when you need a last signet?
like what
i use home lost
then the only thing you can do is reinstall i think
but like if you set it up and forgot
maybe look up for what the default ones are
i mean try the default stuff like root, password
oh god you forgot your root password?
i can try but i slept through my sql classes
pretty funny honestly, keep it up
carv i didn't know you were getting into the deadpan ironic stuff from zoomers
oh and you have mental health issues? you're made for this server
lumi you fit in so fast
i kinda wanna play tank
so 7 spaces open for retain

s0 can't do shit without like holmes TM newt B HoS

<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the last line i misread as Could these two be retarded?
LMFAO i missed this somehow
cause i know CN audience says mihomo only listens to overseas audience <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i still don't buy the mihomo only listens to CN audience
yeah honestly i can really see it
sheeesh
<@218762069338619906> this max?
but even still i'm surprised by the slacc
cause there's literally not enough people with enough currency to buy out the stock before then
yea we already knew it would last until monday
but that's fine right
and my pta is unpri
i mean my poe is lv1
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>

had acc prediction
i wonder if mihomo

even than i was expecting
waaaaay more slacc
honestly
that tryhard lv81 player gets it
i wouldn't mind it either
with how slacc shit's going rn
honestly wouldn't be surprised if they got a chance
sheesh

<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>

nice to meet y'all
i'm so glad to be here
hi
it's me
finish dn
wonder why
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
usually when it's MA questions
yeah i only show up there once in a while to answer questions or when i'm pinged
often
he pisses me the fuck off
also yeah i'm very serious about disliking dia
coffee and zei tried to get the horny roles but they had to ask me to get them
yeah i think the roles are broken
i did all trials for fun
or 9 valks?
9 trials?
nice tet!
<:lfgCatgirlEdition:803114454187114506>
only missing 1 valk i think
a lot of it actually
i did do your dorm
yea gresham is right tho depends on your acc state
you should quit the game
@atmoer
LMFAO
<:worrynirvanajail2_hh:828444826822508554>
i'm not very relaxed
yeah? how's your vacation going gresham?
<:lfgCatgirlEdition:803114454187114506>
<a:AA_Gab_Bow:914213000594980964>
do my abyss lumi
oh shit nirvana retainer
get me out
<:worrynirvanajail2_hh:828444826822508554>
yeah i haven't left nirvana since the bracket changes
i don't want to be here
please help
i'm actually stuck here
jesus christ
Im RL retainer too, i used to bounce between agony 3 before but the HoH shill helped
you brought this onto yourself
smh
imagine not revolving your life around the honkai
L-nya
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
and i play a lot
2 or 3 good scores
i think in my entire time playing i got like
yeah i'm skill issue incarnate
i'm 24/7 <a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
i just wanna chill about the book
actually same
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
oh shit
i like them
are we inviting lumi in?
you use active it just pauses frame 1 and soft locks your game
if the animation timer is stopped? the animation stop?
yeah but what the fuck does that mean LMFAO
like i have an idea maybe
i actually have no clue
so she give phys on dorm out of spite
yeah she was jealous that she was the first elemental valk to not deal phys damage
so they gave her fire
patch notes said she wanted to support kiana
fire
yea
missing like 3 2s valk for max dorm bonus
i got 3s FR, 3s MPE
i'm caught up almost
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
yeah but now look at me
people just get caught up in mindset that they'll never be caught up
spending, bundle, bp, maybe ER soon
they're shitting out JK frags everywhere too
yeah that's really not that bad honestly
she deserves it
HoF is the only valk which will stay gacha only forever
then a valk takes long to farm and they go ooooooh noooooo it's soooooo loooooong
bitches be playing 2 years without missing a day and go just normal
this mindset literally doesn't enter my head
shit game
oh i guess in that case you can only 2s3 comfortably before next al+aw valk releases
you can comfortably 3s JK even if you're pure f2p before next al+aw valk releases
i mean if you don't slacc you will
the question is what's my prio
and then the question isn't is it worth it to x
just assume you'll 3s everyone eventually
i mean for WT valk
yeah probably
and now i'm done and she's still useful
took a year for me to accept that i should start farming her
yeah that's what i thought about FR when i started
insane mindset
literally paying irl money to get ahead on farming just to go well is it fine if i then get behind
like what???????????
and asking if it's okay to stop farming at 2s
who are buying JK stamps
like there's some people i know
you fucking pull card and stop farming midway
this is the most insane shit i ever read
only slaccers left behind
people who care are done with her for a while now
you see so many people complaining they don't have 3s and full stig yet?
well it is kinda only for the real ely appreciators
it's actually nuts
so they just give 3s valk for free for everyone
is not even damage type, MPE is standard S-rank power at s0
willing to bet MPE can retain >50% of boss in RL
which isn't that special cause MPE competes in every boss
PE's main competition is actually MPE i think
and we're getting a new one, bronya
the BKEs we have are BKE, SNS and TP
PE is a whole different beast
just watch
forcing everyone to pull for s2+ to outdo farmable character
and she's like same strength as 3s TP at s0
can't wait for 6.3 release another BKE
and 3 of those are different BKEs
lowkey mech has like only 4 characters
which i wasn't using by choice
i am going to use CN, the character that we all have available
thank you for the advice, taihen
is my team good? i keep one of psy mech bio so i can counter any enemy i see!
and it's pv hb spa
calling ice cryo is L-nya tho
i mean electro is less letters than lightning
i'm going to move back to genshin just so i can push dumb abbreviations for everyone
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i'll keep using valk then
i mean like how we say lightning valk
what do genshin player even call their valks which isn't like 10 letter long
keep coping
yeah that's double the letters
i think yae can do it better probably
cause she sucked LMFAO
yeah that's fucked up too
like the electrocharged one, when my best lightning valk was lisa, that was pretty fun
yeah
but back in the day they were p annoying
maybe they are nowadays with new valk
also the old ones weren't that easy
i fixed it
sit on sidewalk next to miyobo servers so you don't get fucked out of a star
yea i think that's the move honestly
oh you're talking about the coin and spotlight ones again
so good
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
small movement optimisations can make you steal the win
those are truly skill based
yea see
so i could do my dailies in less than 2 hours LMFAO
yeah i wish i could join you
cause if you both just know the optimal path, then if you get unlucky you don't play at slight disadvantage, you play on insane disadvantage
i mean the real issue is that for these 2 the skill ceiling is a lot lower
that's cope
if you're both doing optimal path, whoever gets lucky just wins by default
yeah so if you get someone who's playing well, it's all up to where you spawn and ping
cause it's all luck
but i still stole wins in coin and spotlight
and they destroyed me on these ones
like i matched with t1 a bunch early on
you know how i know if something is actually skill based or not
yeah, that one is truly skill based
oh is that the hammer one?
i think my favorite is the pipe one
they sure as hell are doing that, no way on earth you can get that high in less than the heat death of the universe
EU had some people with 60k on day 3
you can see on t100, there's like a bunch of people at low 20ks because it's just awful to get matches
if you're not boosting it's just hell to get any higher
it might aswell be hardcapped at 20k
you don't feel it right now cause you get games fast, so even the bs ones feel alright
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
i
and that's the one i get
but when i'm waiting 10 minutes for a match
they're an okay 1 minute time waste where you just prayge you get lucky and that's alright
like coin and spotlight
like i don't mind the luck ones
i've waited like 15 minutes for a match
matchmaking system just breaks once you hit high points
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah if you're at 4k points it takes 2 seconds
i'm tilted because it takes 10 minutes to match
<:TeriPoint:1033130036284370984>
just don't act like it's skill
it's fine
i mean it's okay if you prefer the ones that are just luck based
keep coping
<a:DuckSmh:1006448360200347699>
you just lose
and you get unlucky and don't get star
if you're playing with people who know what they're doing
it's actually just luck diff
spotlight is luck to get the star at the middle
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
so the lower skill you have, the more you win those cause it's all up to luck
cause they're all luck no skill
the actual skill issue is enjoying those ones, coin and spotlight
i mean the reason why his excuses are bad are because he uses it improperly
luck issue
i banned that one on the tourney
psycopath moment
so i can retire
yeah
preach
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
can i blacklist hakcer from soft pinging me
heheheh
owo wag
LMFAO
owo bot fucking told you to get lost
whoa!!!
+affection
<:peepoBlush:620449739070111763>
hakcer are you trying to summon me
wait you have an account?
but i appreciate the excitement
it's not actually
very good performances
denji and power on this early eps are mvp of va
i just think she sounds nice
no clue
it's insane
such a good job at voicing power
she's doing
LMFAO L-nya
it's pretty simple actually, just annoying
yea it's possible
884
i think i'm close
without 3s kmb
i'm trying to make up a 917 bella
but p much that
well, ely M
yeah i was running that
o sheeesh ty <a:AA_Gab_Bow:914213000594980964>
nvm KMB evade cd is so fucking long
with evade cd red
do we have any b stig
look at these builds, sheesh
and i don't really have a phone plan cause my phone sucks
at home it's unlimited
2 days to download one anime episode
even per day that's like
what??
per month????
that's nothing
what the fuck
he gets 5/6ths less hot, volume wise
it's next year!
leave me the fuck alone
i take 3 steps in any direction and i start a new quest
game's a fucking minefield
god fucking damn it, i'm doing some genshin shit rn
there's a 3% chance of losing 5 50/50s in a row
owo math 0.5 ^ 5
brains broken
wait why did i do 7
owo math 0.5 ^ 7
L-nya
<:scaramouch_lurk:925161879322624110>
i'm not a robot
it's not a game
can't read ggz anymore
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
venti is wendy if the writers bothered with her character
similar to like captainverse events, lots of events share too
it's like they take another lens into the same story and same character
i feel like character themes follow through p consistently
yeah miko is if yae didn't die at 16 y/o
i feel like having similar name and that's it is a dumb way of looking at expy, very 1 dimensional <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
ei's character development is sorta similar to mei, no?
<a:NOOO:996348845803966524>
very similar
whoa the spoiler size
how is it any different, v2v partition her mind and each of her personality is a facet of herself, dottor partition himself through time and each of his clone is a facet of himself
yes
no but i know spoilers
they clearly do have different personality tho
that makes sense
isn't that just xingqiu clan?
and v2v and dottore both has multiple personality and both destroy most of other personality for a sus goal
i mean hua and zhongli character development is pretty similar, hua p much was also dealing with erosion in the same way zhongli does
in the way that i feel like it
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
then zhongli is welt + hua expy and dottore is v2v expy
if haitham is su expy and nahida is teri expy
i'm blue dabadeedaba da
same age
<:cry:944955259636285481>
i'm so proud
no v2v fontaine archon <:smoke:808652033007157258>
dottore is v2v expy isn't he
i'm a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> upset
spicy message
like there's >99.9% chance of getting valk before hard pity
which is like p high but not as close to as high other pities work
there's like only a 70-80% chance of getting it before pity iirc
it's actually not that unlucky to get SoE on pity
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
use some proper php
that's fucking cursed
don't do echo like that
speedrun deez nuts
yea that's what i told them, they still didn't account for it
people kept getting spoiled
around these parts
someone was tagging spoilers very badly
oh yeah i had a similar problem
just take your time
you know there isn't going to be any more archon quest for like half a year after this is done
why do you need to rush it
they're all When equipped by CN: ofc
LMFAO
there would be no story if they let you skip the useless parts
technically i one upped you <a:Nerdge:960240242114318416>
see it worked for tet
try getting lucky
welt -> brad
<a:aWoggies:771343090081726494>
that makes sense actually
oh
i just did all 3 with ft, didn't know HoT scores
which boss is there even a 917 with HoT this cycle
<:woggy:652741122963275786>
yeah LMFAO
they made nahida a herrscher and HoH an archon
they got confused
i see, miboho fucked up
do i just log off now that i got the valk?
okay so what do i even do in genshin again
c6 of my very first main
also finally completed
tyty
god fuck i keep pressing q to turn the camrea
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
back to sleep i go
guess i don't have to do abyss
i got lucky
assigned milf at cherry
it's meant to be
AYYYYYYYYYYYYY
i remember why i don't spend a lot of time here
<a:ShyBlush:741636455289323521>
i guess i can be angry
i don't think i'm very angry
pibling
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
i don't like that
i mind being an uncle
i don't mind being old
how am i an uncle
i call dibs on it
i'm the gay one
yeah? how well's that going for you?
you go oh no surely it's okay
i warn you of what you fucking need to do
and you still complain
you're like exactly like all of us
warn before the pic
tet i fucking told you
the way you were breathing doesn't sound you were doing it calmly
i mean it was foreshadowed that signora and traveller would make out eventually, but yeah the way it happened was surprising
really gory death too, i'm surprised
wait what the fuck i can't believe they killed nahida off
they didn't know what the plan was when they wrote that part of the story
baizhu moment
oh
what
alhaitham's in the game?
tons of people haven't cleared the shop yet
i mean ofc, people are stupid/lazy tho
bunch of people don't do that
for the task
you need to do 3 runs every week
especially this week since you can max coin just by doing JK shallow
oh i bet a lot of people are going to miss the ER tasks for the book
cute!!!!!
i think it's unironically 50/50
<:pepeW:996346590086303805>
now only need to max 9 valks
finally finished all shallow
LMFAO she's so cute
yes please
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
so SN was release, SF not
oh ty
striker fulminata
SF
o
right
HoF HoT HoR PV VG RI LK SD
it was like
the 8 ER valk that released with the gamemode
anyone remember
sheeeesh a new one to my collection
ok
should i start keeping track of what are the valks added to ER each patch
whoa
sac?
yeah that's a week 1 take
feels good to be proven right fucking 2 years later
a c6 bennett believer
i was already
back in 2020
that was annoying
the release event hid some chests
yeah i remember on inazuma release
fucking crazy
people kept on copium for respawn chest for like 2+ patches
and i went yea that's bs
second day, nothing respawned at all
like i did the chest route 2 days
it was actually insane
god i remember people were on copium that chests respawned for SO long
i did the daily chest routes too
lots of early genshin memories
that's fucking broken
i was like wtf they give us lv80 valk to play with
and i did a trial
i remember when i started genshin
so you can perma ult
morbillion sp
yeah every enemy in trial gives like
the apple(goldvariant) archipelago
the aolden archipelago?
but irl time, yea
my guess is that in game time, no
found the damage guys <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
LMFAO
this is so fucking stupid
WHAT THE FUCK
LMFAO
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
so ely signet, great blade?
fair <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
so she's just  SW
oh ok
what ely signet you go for
so just spam A and ult on cd?
skill issue is if you know what you're supposed to do and aren't able to do it
this is knowledge issue
not even skill issue
what???
what
i ult, go to sword state and then do the BBBA thingy
wdym
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
in ER
like actual 0 damage
deals no damage
my JK
<a:WorryHug:1032765989399572643>
on top left, it plays the seele cg on repeat
look at my new wallpaper
i'm balding t1 fall guys
can i blacklist heki from softpinging me
oh is it still not fucking out
def shenhe here tho
like shenhe hip window is so dumb
LMFAO
are fuckin stupid
a lot of genshin character design/clothes
eh i mean
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
your current drawings, that is
i also disagree, i think they're pretty
cause there's nothing to do <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
you do spend more time looking at your character than playing the game
maybe for other game, but for genshin
i disagree actually
<a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
agreege
ngl those look very stupid
and i think it's less explicit than the hip windows she got
seeing her tummy is actually like so pretty to me
they ironed it out
LMFAO
smoothed up her tummy
they fucking
but it's still supposed to be transparent i'm p sure
fucking cowards
they patched the navel out
we could see her navel
didn't shenhe have one of those too
exclusive?
what the hell
really?
damn
hi neko <a:Pat:914638151069356062>
how ahead is EU? it's still in like 4 1/2 hour before it opens here
can you? ain't it closed at this time of day
<a:Blushiekissy:795363746339356702>
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
you already have
w-what? words that change the world? you having isekai classes?
honkai-style
so that faruzan can fix it
just fucking make up some new issue for him then
doesn't he?
i dunno i don't play
yea imagine good 4s character in 2022
she's going to solve xiao ER issues <:TeriCopium:969281688414875728>
i think it's p funny
that's still one of my fav copypastas
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816>
they know their market LMFAO
i guess that's fair
so for no one to read
and expect us to know what the fuck they are
just fucking list off words
give up with giving the character a description
did they
what's this shit
comes on with recolor by default
released scara with bp skin?
they fucking
faruzan is pretty but why are all those pics fucking 144p
i got pinged over furry LMFAO
<:scaramouch_lurk:925161879322624110>
keilor is just an australian person trying to say keilo
a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> of a pyramid scheme if you will
we actually call it a scam in the insider talk
it's like bitcoin
it's gonna skyrocket
if you hold on to it for a few years
no but you see
nice work
300, almost 400 monopoly money
that's like
sheeeesh!
i have ptsd from those gifs
oh god
yea that sounds dangerous
more time needed to say for sure how bald it'll be but rn i'm p confident it won't be that bald in EU NA
it's so big
yes
LMFAO
this, in the weird font
no like
here
discord
can you name yourself that
agreege
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
fuck abyss
i dunno
LMFAO
like i'm telling you there's no way i'm not getting it
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
and great art
it looks like actual high quality
you fucking morbed
LMFAO
it looks sick
but from the previews and unboxings i've seen of the book
even if it's something small and dumb
is really cool to me
cause like having something physical to show for the amount of time i spent on this game
for it
i'd still be balding
honestly even if i cared nothing about the book
at day 1
then the amount of people that can even buy might be <12.5k
if they slacc enough that they don't even get these early tasks
a lot of those are time based
i mean the thing is
depending on how slacc, i could see it going for even more than a day
yea that's what i'm betting on right now, given current rankings it looks pretty slacc
i don't think we have that many people trying hard
we'll have like at least 2 hours before it runs out
but i'm guessing for GLB
if it's like that then it might aswell be up to luck
i mean yea
then you wanted more than them
if you get it and they don't
then they are getting it
if they want it more than you
i mean
in global
like, it's not going to be up to luck, if you're doing shit timely you'll get it
in global, at least
can get it
i think anyone who cares enough
i can get the book
SEA player gotta bald, seeing current numbers for global i'm pretty confident
like for us, t12.5k is still at 50
that's rough
damn, SEA does have like 4x as many players
wait so SEA t25k is already at 95?
did you only grab the 50 from loggin in?
how
<a:Monka:465018118608125953>
like ofc i'm nirvana player so i'm biased but even if i wasn't i'd be okay i think
they gave nirvana player prio
i would actually be alright if
don't run it down too much
wait until next week for more info
so prob rl the highest tier to give additional reward?
this is what event notice says
i think there's tasks related to how high you are
y'all shouldn't run it down in abyss
actually, i'm pretty sure
so that ain't matter
don't think there's MA tasks
to plan MA ahead
so i have 2-3 hours
i woke up at 3-4am normally
daily reset here is 6am
how close is that to daily reset
i unironically think
it's easy to get it if you're good at waking up early
i unironically think
i went to sleep 1 hour before it opened and did it just now
yea that number right now is just how fast you did abyss, basically
like only 4.4k people did abyss before me
we'll know how many people actually play
then if you have 95 and keep it up, you're guaranteed the book
if by reset of sunday, the top 12500 has less than 95
actually if you think about it
only grabbed the 50 from login
the top 12500 only in NA
but like in global
if you're below 12500 you're slaccing
should be total, even if you're below 12500
so i'm rank 4471 of books
theres a ranking
o wait
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
i guess i can take that
keilo the big red dog?
ty carl
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
now you have to honour it
everyone agreed
i asked before inviting carv in, that if carv's getting in then leak/datamine stuff is off limits outside of spoiler channel
i like the one we got for once, actually
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
is off limits for carv
even old leak/datamine
yea, delete it
<a:darksideslap:786450895378317342>
this is datamine stuff, dumbass
just make a copy and edit the values under how much you're buying
Autumn Book Event Resource Management spreadsheet
<>
time swirl passes
do people want this?
with the book buying everything out would cost 2558
to spend
we'll get 1210
and from my (optimistic) calculation
would cost 2058
buying out the shop without the book
i don't think you can buy out the shop even if you don't buy the book
still wait for next week so i know for sure how often shit resets tho
does change total to 1210
doesn't change the date, still 21st
i put weekly er as 30 books instead of 45
wait i already fucked up <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
same <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
but like you can
me neither LMFAO
and the book only costs 500
since you need 660 to unlock the purchase
you can spend up to 160 and be safe
it's qtty per purchase x purchase limit
this for sale
honkai shard 1x2
torus 5x6
metal 5x12
wafer 100x3
red lens 10x6
tsp 10x18
fuel 10x18
shifter 2x10
asterite 125x60
cause i'm making a lot of assumptions of what will reset weekly or not
next week tho i'll be able to give a more confident number
we'll have 1120 artbook mats to spend
if my calculations are correct <a:Nerdge:960240242114318416>
almost everything really
o yea that's true for everything that miboyo does for
it kinda creeps me out
i still don't get that gif
and i think the colors work surprisingly well for her
her hair is v pretty
i actually like it a lot
LMFAO
yea only one
google is so smart
i should figure that out
yea i wonder
depending on if those reset or not
could be a few days later
so this is the earliest estimation
but i don't think they'll straight up add more tasks
and for the abyss one, if they do reset, i dunno if we'll have one per week or 2 per week
so i dunno if they'll reset next week or not
there's the abyss, login and bp ones which are labeled launch week
cause there's some tasks that i'm counting that i dunno if they reset or not
before taking the day off
wait a bit longer tho
the day of the book should be 21st of november, monday
according to my calculations right now
and it's also piss easy
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
still 721 cap
that's boring
needs to be global cause BB uses BD on rot
so every s3+ HoF, every 3s griseo, every 2s+ LE
i used literally every 55+ sp lead
i bet there's some fun stuff with SoE
time to do huodou for now
okay i ran out
this is a non-KMB cycle
yea i used yours already
i'll tell you if i don't run out of LE lead friends
i'm gonna kill the person who made bella death animation 12 seconds long
we help people efficiently retire
for the 2nd one if anyone asks you just say it builds character
yae is very similar to her genshin counterpart, they really took a lot of inspiration, even her meta strength is comparable
dyno spoils it
go from ground up, experience each stage of the game
yeah you should actually craft higokumaru first
that's too toxic actually LMFAO
next time i'll just brick their acc
tell me what to do
fucking
to not answer this set of balls when they asked which set?
SO much willpower
it took me
jst you have to time shit around the uptime
margrave is just ult every rot, braindead
i'm bullying for you saying that it's easier than margrave
i'm not bullying for using jst
i fucking give up i'm about to morb
quickswap honkai <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
LMFAO they playing on 2x
when i came from genshin i also didn't think about much
i can relate tho
am i being intercepted
LMFAO
if i keep doing this
from honkai help
i'm gonna get banned
LMFAO i'll think about it
depends on deez nuts
to not answer
help me god

it doesn't change. anything?
in this case
i get the sooner the better but like
how close are you to 3s
in the time between those 2 dates

a week late doesn't even change much
why do you even want the box so bad
skill issue

25k stock
apparently SEA has artbook on event shop

but make sure to check before pulling
lately they've been doing immediately
we hold hands <:peepoSit:1016193458307862609>

<a:kree:809653433455214632>
always wanted poe cause shes kinda hot
based tho
has been useful for me for long enough that it's worth the investment
giga lucky and didn't know
i don't regret since that got me gustav TM
look i was a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> dumb
i pulled for 11th on foca <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
since a while ago
has already been powercrept
very first thing i whaled for
that's getting powercrept?
is this your first pull
whoa
and like standard foca rotation
to spend on
but only mobius + raven + firepower
idr if we had elf rotation
basically the exact same thing actually
it was like
1 1/2 banner to spend xtal on
and then there's like
it's like big spending event!!!! wow!!
last cn anniv patch also was
2/3rds of the characters are already clones
more like they don't know basic honkai lore
it's whoever they feel like it only
and i don't have it
i'm paying for bicc nitro
wtf
this close to getting 750 screenshot
oh no it's not, it's really cute though
is that the furry one
more hua always good
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
then i'm glad cause i think i prefer if the anime has a different take on the world
oh ok
that's interesting
and keeping it the same
so they're taking all the game locations/proportions n stuff
they actually shine??? wtf
on the trailer
those shines on the fruits
wait
okay i finalised my bingo
still my favorite valk i think
HoF <a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
yea i agree
even with HoF comparing the actual teams was pretty sad
we get one MA valk every 3 patches <:TeriCopium:969281688414875728>
yea i guess griseo is pretty good
kinda sad honestly
like what MA valk did we even get recently? PE in 5.5 was the newest?
i could actually see HoT just keep dominating MA until we get to a tipping point where damage powercreep is so bad she doesn't keep up
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
mihomo just doesn't make MA valk anymore
i don't even know if not for long
and HoF is like about 5 or so seconds behind that
tank t1 is tied between ely and HoT
tank isn't being contested by ely and even HoT
keep her in chief
if it's HoF top score tho i'm chillin
been a while
yea i think last rime was like 5.1 or 5.2 or smth
right now it's PE i think?
top score is like passed around like a lot
in MA she's a slut
is it really? in abyss
yea can remove the one from abyss <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
oh no one cares about abyss
keep it pls
i like 2s rime
optimised the need for a bow user in fire tank <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
jaded honkai player
LMFAO
half of it is all me complaining
yeah reading back the bingo
as long as they don't fuck it up i'm fine with it
honkai has waaaaaay too many systems and currencies currently
i mean i actually think it's a great move
i think actual cubes are staying
cube fragments will be gone
or if we'll just effectively have 2 asterite shops, which imo would be even more confusing but ok
we don't know if they're removing battle arsenal as well
and that's all we know
well, gold pins are being removed
and they're removing sakura wills and nanos and making a new mat that can be used as both, i assume
gold pins, resonators and smelted cores will all be just asterite
yea they're consolidating mats
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the place you spend gold pins, which are being removed
battle arsenal
yes very shortlived
for the v1 beta in a few hours
that's 6.1 bingo
this is how it looks rn
LMFAO
2023?
like skip patch?
what's that?
ok good one
help me
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>

<:Woke:759887282042830889>
ohhhh holy shit
oh
i'm at least only sometimes weird
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
i've always understood them, carv
<:cry:944955259636285481>
cryo more like cry-o
kalpas likes pain i think
okay i cleaned up the pins a bit so it can be a bit more useful
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
ty carl
periods? call that bleed trauma
my gooch now needs 1 less bar of ice trauma, similar to honkai actually
my gooch went through QA, better than honkai already
scary
that's
you should really look into seeing one if you haven't your whole life
even if you're not sexually active that just sounds like a good idea
i mean yea that's what i mean, sorta often = once a year or so
i wouldn't know <:cry:944955259636285481>
oh i see
just to like be safe
isn't that like one doctor you should make like visits to sorta often?
think you should see one anyways
i
did you read? it's literally specified that they do it there because it's a good spot regardless of how thicc you are
<#967641366869995631> <#1003723962758475786>
we do, dumbass
but yea other wise
maybe when i was a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> baby and don't remember
i don't think i've ever had a needle shot in my butt
i thought that was like a cartoon thing
what
i think
don't worry you'll prob get baizhu before the end of teyvat storyline
1000 days on honkai changed my bank account
probably yea
mhm yea wrong image for sure
a quote you need to ping someone to say it
i love that
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
so fucking stupid
you're all
<:pepeold:746089014087647393>
sheeesh!!!
i swear it wasn't that bad
does that gif quality just get worse and worse the more you use it
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i just make my own quotes so i can repeat shit i've said in the past without needing to retype it
nah i'm the same, you're just not really quotable if you just say the stuff you mean, all the quotes are people saying stuff they wouldn't otherwise by accident
i love that quote so much
LMFAO I FUCKING KNOW RIGHT
tehre's 8 different tet, what
all of those happened today, damn
oh shit that was today?
minmax convo? you ain't minmaxing convos, you're minminning convos
i'm not a racist
ayyyyy
don't talk like it's an adult way of acting because it's way more mature and takes a lot of work to get there and shit, it's just not, it's way easier <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like
cons:
- you suffer way more
pros:
- ????????
for no fucking reason
you're making it harder on yourself
it's the fucking easy way of doing things
is it that hard
or, you could, you know, not play games. you could not send passive aggressive messages or hidden messages and could, you know, say what you mean. like a normal person. communicate how you feel and shit
yeah if you keep quiet it'll just get worse
i'm fucking lost, what even are teenagers, is it really that hard to be open about how you feel?
????
and that's it
you're way too young for me
i feel like that's even easier to reject her if she does have feelings for you
w-what? how is age an issue when i'm telling you to just communicate
yeah i don't get it
how is that hard????
what???
no, if she isn't then you say oh alright, i think i was taking some signals wrong then
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
jfc
hey, do you have feelings for me?
ask... her....
say the stuff that's in your mind <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
what are you, 12
yeah just communicate to them that you aren't interested, it's not that hard
i guess i can see it though
skill diff
yeah <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i mean sure i still find it weird <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
cause like to me, they didn't really change, they just accepted something about themselves they always were, my mind on them wouldn't really change
i mean i'll believe ya, that's fucking insane to my mind tho
hmmm i see
like, do you get less lesbian if you date a transmen before they figure out they're trans? if you stay with them after, do you lose your lesbian rights, even though your experiences been the same?
and also to keep the labels as strict
i mean of course, it just makes it harder to explain is what i mean <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i feel like so
when you throw trans people in the mix
waaaaay more complicated
i mean this is pretty straightforward stuff tho, it gets
i mean sure but like i feel like that's just semantics though
for funsies
like while they're figuring stuff out, you get a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> lesbian
yeah, and they get to have the bi label even if it's temporary
i mean i can actually think of a very easy one, which is bi people in denial, and i for one don't think it's very productive to force them out in the open, i think they deserve the lesbian label even if it's temporary while they grow out of it
i think i disagree, i think there are good faith reasons to do that, but it's not a heavy disagreement and definitely not one that comes from thorough knowledge of that community in specific
i guess that's fair, that's a stance to take
i mean but i think you can and still do, is the thing. i think that like trying to box people off, the people who are known to actively not fit in boxes, as long as they're coming in good faith, is just unproductive
and if that is a strict label even if you're not using it strictly, i think that's valid
i mean sure but like, you're a demigirl, a lot of times labels aren't what is most logical, it's what it feels right for you
but it's similar to the transrace thing, if it's a label that only comes from people trying to grift themselves into a community they know they don't belong for fucked up reasons like transphobic ones then i think that's pretty fair
in a vacuum, i don't think we should corner people off just because they don't fit a label, even if the label is meant to be strict
then i agree with your take
if that's how it's overwhelmingly used
i mean so,
yikes
i mean then that's stupid <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yea i'm pan, i'm too much of a coward to lock myself out of genders
i mean you do know that i, am, too, a demigirl, right LMFAO
so the label gets to be fluid in all ways except that one specific way
that will also change from lesbian to lesbian
are they into demigirls?
are lesbians into nonbinary people?
all labels are fluid, citrine, it's all subjective
i feel like you're pointing and blaming the wrong people here
and not the lesbians using the labels they want
isn't the issue then the people using that on lesbians
cause that's fucked <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i mean if it is go ahead and blame that and i'll agree with you
yes, and that's an issue, and that's not what's happening here. it's someone willingly choosing that label for themselves, it's not men forcing themselves into that label
and i would say that no, lesbians have not, historically, been strictly separated from bisexual woman. real life movements and understanding of people shift constantly, they've been working together for a while
you also get lesbian? like you don't lose anything, is my point. you still get the label and what it means to you
i'm not going to drop it just because you're not interested on it and would rather talk about boys, but i will drop it if citrine/other people are uncomfortable
this kind of thing just feels like very similar to not acknowledging nb people because they're not the right kind of trans
it just sounds very gatekeepey to keep labels from people just because it doesn't align with your definitions with it. i understand that that's what the lesbian label means to you, and no one's taking that away from you, i'm pretty sure, but you also don't get to take that label away from other people and what that means to them. like sure there's certainly a lot of issues that lesbian people who strictly only like girls have that bi people don't, but you do realise that there's a loooot of issues that are shared, right?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that just sounds like bad faith actors though
what if they want to, though
i mean... i dunno if that's what's happening and if it has the consequences you think it does. like a lot of queer people's identity and labels are lot more messy and have been for a while, like transmen calling themselves lesbians, too
lv90 weapon gang
good didn't send it for you
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
eh i mean i understand how bi erasure is a problem and it's a big systemic issue, but it's a systemic one, not an individual one. you shouldn't blame or guilt people into using labels you find more accurate, it's their label and they get to choose it, even if it doesn't make the most logical sense. like, similar to how i sometimes want to be a femboy even though i'm really not masc-aligned so if you think about it logically it doesn't make much sense, but it's not supposed to make sense logically, it's just about what labels feel best for you
don't all people just shove equipment around as you're using characters?
honestly i respect that
isn't all genshin players casual

hello?
nadeko?
you're the only responsible person here
oh sheeesh 100 bucks
i am upset that mihomo doesn't let me in the beta but it is absolutely the better option for them, i wouldn't let me in either
keep the client to datamine it later
i'd record, track it all
oh hell no, i'd share like absolutely every single tiny thing about the beta
carv is, unsurprisingly, the only responsible person in this server
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
i'll say that it won't matter if mihoyo doesn't find out
you should spend like 6 hours buying everything and maxing your collection
wait a second

you actually did 3s her <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like not unfun, just not fun
boring and not fun
yea i mean i'm not offended by it, just
this is just genshin weapon xp mat crafting in the event
yeah but i know what you mean, you need to collect those resources purposefully to use them there
i mean mechanically it works out as basically the same thing, right?
hmmm i see
dunno if it makes sense, just feels a lil starved of love in the mechanics
straight up expeditions like that just feel like one of those mechanics you add cause you're supposed to but no one really cares about it
like i really liked the cabbage ones even though they involve a lot of waiting because they're cute and the concept is a little more fun and interesting
i don't even have much issues with the waiting part, just with the presentation
hmmm i dunno what i think about it, i'm not offended by it but it does feel a lil not interesting as a mechanic
i guess i could've said just expeditions since we have those still
what even is that anyways, gensh expeditions?
nqn said fuck spoilers
LMFAO
like an outside lifeform trying to copy our patterns
something that looks right at first glance but is only more and more uncanny the more you stare at it
horror art n stuff
i think it looks cool as like
do people actually find AI art hot
i think they've been doing good stuff? but i dunno i'd rather not raise my expectations too much
yea i haven't been watching a lot of anime, everyone has pretty high expectations
which is why i'm really worried LMFAO
it's prob one of the best if not the best manga of recent times
if they don't drop the ball prob going to end up really well
the manga is also really good
first episode is really good

but they have late stuff in the teasers and the opening....

that's especially true on like phys runs on SS MA
LMFAO yeah
<:Wokege:996346539364601876>
you doing it at like 10 minutes in, i'm like warming up still
but in the other hand, i usually do that after like 6+ hours of bald and i'm out of options
well for one i kinda relate to doing stupid shit to see what works
live your best life
i dunno what that is but i can answer that it's not
i see
are you spending 3.4 minutes per attempt
how
owo math 45 / 13
what the hell, 45 mins on 13 resets?
isn't real bald if you haven't spent like at least 2 hours on it
yeah, less than 30 i consider it one-and-done territory
yeah some PE stuff is very annoying
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
stay innocent
yeah sure, you balded a lot
that's uh
oh wait i did see, you said 13 resets
how much did you score
no
it's so annoying
yeah i was balding abyss but i hate this abyss
and there's no reason to bring paper LMFAO
only brought laptop cause i knew this class is Like This
i left all paper and stuff at home
like another hour
i brought my laptop so i can at least do other dumb stuff
it's so bad, i'd rather die
someone please help
i'm gonna fall asleep in this class
one step closer to promised land (c6)
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
keeb pulled 2s HoS
hmm
fucking 6 more years of honkai main story
do you think part 2 will be as long as part 1
if you keep praying for it
we'll get epi to take actual screenshots
one day
obviously
found in the desert ruins of sumeru
those are scarabs
oh ok
that's normal for s0
<a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753>
isn't 1.4k atk good
i forgot how genshin works
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
imagine not having a shinobu
from last patch
did i miss the events
oh
my 3s boss tier list thing
stop pinging hei
you're telling me a shrimp fried this rice?
(i also prefer en dub on most anime)
fake weeb
is pretty good
but everything else
that blows
except darling in the franxx
everything that trigger does is really good
i should watch that
oh yeah that's trigger right
what's that
it's more fun
maybe i should just pick mobius sigil on every valk
go all the run without pressing the button
never use it
and then
i pick griseo sigil
on other valks
on mobius i use mobius sigil
LMFAO
i don't use any sigils
ngl
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816>
oh
isn't aponia2 p broken
yelan is xingqiu but less cute
<:GWsetmyxPeepoEvil:405337570952740864>
where's my genshin fu hua
now
yeah same reason as why unknown god -> kiana isn't in the list
pyro archon himeko is too confirmed to go on cope list
that's a cope list
eh
based
fucking
cryo archon -> bronya
who else
hydro archon -> v2v
alice -> elysia
i don't like lisa much
the translation is actually sexual harassment
why mihoyo
god i still love phyllis
like i'm still keeping phyllis
no we keep fella
even if he doesn't know the best translation
taihen knows what's gender neutral or not in CN
but like
yeah
hydro archon my fella
that's funny
fella!!
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
not bad like bad because it makes you deal less damage
like overload is pretty bad but it's still like bad because it helps you very little
like actually just awful
straight trash though
isn't burn like
that's funny as fuck
oh lmfao
i'm dumbass
oh overload
what's gma
and some other name
oh that's quicken
electro hydro?
sounds like he's brain issue'd

i mean there's plenty of dumb people online
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>

like all recent 4* dps
she's a dps
do you really wish
wish she was in a good game instead
yea she pretty
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
and save for the booba
where we stop using AL
today's the day
i got 3s FR today
sheeeesh
but i won't accept that
which i guess means i'm -0 from 3s dudu ref
and i'm -2 on tank cause no 4s dudu
god forsaken reason
i'm -3 on hepha cause i deal 7% less damage than ref for some
i'm t15 rn i think
nah this week i blow
sheesh
but thank you
i'm not trying though
oh thank you
you can't post that shit

<:pat_hh:710693620776304650>
i also like being mean to diavoros
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
sora's too nice
i didn't expect for him to accept the invite actually
looking back i'm surprised he stayed that long
just don't mention the sus stuff
we've got leaks, datamines, lorelaos and keilo balding
right now apparently it's
that doesn't sound like a pro
that's unusual
yeah quiet chat
yeah....
very overwhelming
chat was really really active when kith joined
x
hey <@453263261467410442> <a:pat:969402615538520064>

we don't have those here, wish we had tho
20% saving from points
some people have reported stuff as like
which like, the more you top up, the more points you get, and then you can use those points to get discounts in stuff
i think a lot of countries also have the point system?
if i can top up through pc client with google play (assume it's the same price) then it's p nice
in brazil, mobile prices are cheaper than pc
wait why am i the whale on call
oh that's kinda sick

it's pardo dps
i like 6s gameplay
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
1 mini bar

one small rot
she's pretty
HoH

please fire support who isn't awful to play
LMFAO

turg cat
fuck no

i don't wanna play raven
i don't want to do side stage
i just press buttons and things don't work out
gresham is better coach
and also awful
is prob right
DoI
unironically
run slug on 6s
i heard ely is coming out today and i think she's here, should i pull
based i think
LMFAO
to scare people
to honkai delivery
i should change my name
but the abyss one's still there
they actually removed hackers from MA t100 i think
devs slacking off
better content than mihomo smh
<:Woke:759887282042830889>

you're about to next patch
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
helping it out
cause like i feel like ice is just
wouldn't more fire be what's good against it
if it's overheating
dm me if you wanna talk
but it sounds more fun
it's prob harder
instead of the 856 with eden
with FR
i should've done the 840 this week
yeah me too
forgot FR existed
but no me dumb
cause like the only S-rank support with rank ups is AE, and she's combo
i didn't read anything else i was just thinking what valk with rank ups even has team bonuses like that
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that makes sense
oh
oh probably aponia?
who's that
5 mins
shit's been out for what
already
lmfao
it'd be sinful 9 actually
andrius shield just make andrius invulnerable
let's fucking go
agony 6?
is at
that's what all my attention
the nirvana on the corner
yeah that's all i'm looking
hits an all time low
gacha gamer literacy
did you do the bastet tm
what the fuck is his point
even mean
what does that
for the place of truest dia
let them fight it out
bring them to wfp
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
don't have to tell me that
LMFAO
i'm not
trust me
and i hate that
them doing that
i can really see
oh no
and without shitting
see he prob spent 1.5k years without eating either
cause maybe they don't
do you think mantis post-op shit
better question
yeah
it's an ARG
surely you wouldn't make the same mistake
yeah okay mister 280 pulls for HoS
heki and them will bond
get them here
no self awareness
i mean i try
it is getting quicker right
like i swear
for the fans?
make it even lower res
okay can you
for the tweet
thank you childecock
propraising you
it's one of those things that are very scary for people who don't understand how stuff works but isn't actually that scary
it doesn't tell much <:shrug:877047647511384064>
ip address isn't that big of a doxx actually
LMFAO
cherry and me have complete opposite expectations
preparing for the worse
i'm brainstorming your tinder profile
keep me updated
no
unironically
someone actually asked the question
also literal minutes after i made my bait
clock and ball torture
i call that
husk and kosma
imagine abyss week
you wanna hear a joke i stole?
that's a pretty good one
do it pussy
i got called out real quick
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
people don't fall for my baits anymore
i know one of them you can duo this week
or was it pri raid?
can be duo'd though
this week's dk raid
ive imagined this person and now that i think about them i'm very mad
people be shadowboxing huh
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
i don't have stam sorry
carv famous
<:Wow:759857863848886303>
please don't bully me i'd hate that hahah
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
whoa
he's always up to some bullshit
i always assume it's bruh
wait it's inukai?

okay i'm in the new bandwagon
1 hour

20 business days
<:lfgCatgirlEdition:803114454187114506>
carv understood me
my skills in communication levelled up
i mean these btw
so be careful with your choices
and i don't think you can catch up at this point
you have to do a lot of dailies to buy it out
it's similar for ch31 shop
but you have to do all of them to clear the shop
they stop at 12 days
i mean the daily quests
by dailies
to not get locked out of something you really want
so pick and choose stuff properly
you need to do all days of dailies to buy the shop out, and you don't have enough time to do that right by now
<:MeiHue_lum:694766566046171166>
to buy her skin
and i had to do 12 days of dailies
i bought everything before ely skin
be careful
just hmu
yeah if anyone wants me to make calcs based on current pity
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
she's already perfect
so 50 pulls would be a bit above average
that's the avg, that's what avg means
there's 50% chance at getting valk on 48.1 pulls
to get valk from 50 pulls from 0 pity
chance
i think it's like about 52%
well actually
to alter the code and run simulations
okay gimme some time
cause i can
do you want me to actually answer that
please
baban i am going to morb
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
do they got MA
tfs that game LMAO
and only because sushang ult is said to give team buffs doesn't mean she's a support cause SW also gives team buffs on ult
his most recent one is that HoH is bait because sushang will be better
yeah, he's got some room temperature iq takes
and most people changed it
i think bruh went around and forced the nickname into everyone
it's a very arrogant and annoying person from wfp
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
it was for me to tell you that you're cute
ER quality is insane
if they plan ahead properly
like it really shows the heights mihomo storytelling can go
ssg mihomo
it's been in the game this whole time
it's the cg
<:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930>
also pretty stupid because i'm very sure they didn't promote SW as look at this cool ult that buffs teammates
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
apparently she did in v1 and doesn't in release
and he's also wrong about the sw thing
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
he ran away
i would've kept on going
i absolutely did not give up
damn
y'all thristy for toxicity huh
i can dm, it's actually way too toxic i think LMFAO
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
so vod is saved
on yt
stream
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
trust me i got lucky once
heki that's stupid
LMFAO
i was about to say something real toxic
yeah i'm losing my mind over the fucking temperature iq takes
<a:ShyBlush:741636455289323521>
<:WhalePat:607373633056407605>
gresham taking out the wallet already
i was talking about being kicked to the curb and stomped on
oh <:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
cause i have opinions
post that over on <#963273616852652095>
me next?
that's kinda hot
<:WhalePat:607373633056407605>
kiss kiss <a:nosekiss_hh:758188498191908864>
honestly i'd do the same
and offed herself
she saw 2 psy ice b2b
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
he's immune to ice
i forgot
o shit
it's potentially a good amount
okay so this is what she can try to have:
freeze huodou
type huodou
HoS
i think there's a bio mob boss
bella
maru
<a:crabdance:825419645972381707> queens dead <a:crabdance:825419645972381707>
jk we rave
cool, we're talking about honkai meta here though, it's more important
queen's dead?
maybe she gets HoS back
which was biggest change to ice meta still
i guess we had cat already
last time was 5.6 tho
is it still hers
is maru bio or typeless?
maru is another she can steal back maybe
huodou is the easiest answer
ping me when i'm right
i also think new SSS boss is either assaka bella dxy couatl doom heimdall maru homu hov huodou kasumi kallen rimestar or sk
kinda based honestly
and say see i told you
he can come back, print
so when we get announcement
naming every boss
inukai is just
actually quite nice
oh it gives her ult tf
i thought that was clear
for... sn?
<:stonks:803115797140078602>
free s2
though i don't care if they stall on that cause i'm not getting the stamps from witch orb any time soon <:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
last cn anniv
yeah we got free FR
sheesh
if i buy some of the stamps with witch orb
o i'll be able to get 2s2 SN
keep the interesting ones as long as possible pls
get rid of one of the punching bag ones
do 3s assaka, aka, dxy, maru
stfu
cause i feel cool doing it
if it looks cool i'm baldin
can be thorough cbt
is how cool it looks
1 main thing for me to enjoy something
i've said it before
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
30 second long 0s kill
it's true though!!!! it looks so cool
so damn cool
it just looks
the tf train one
prob one of my favorite refs of all time
to this day
wtf you mean garbage
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
there's so few
one of the fun 2s bosses left
2s doom is like
please don't be doom
announcement?
we got new 3s boss
wait
wth
the new one's hot
y'all so fucking wrong
wow
her dark attire
but i grown to like
idk i think i agreed on release
bait skin
in that case
unless it's pyramid
i want to like it too
but yeah watch her in action is prob way better
it's just not great for me rn
the bright red hooves too
skill issue
i just don't like how her horse looks <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
it looks awesome
is fucking based as hell
like the way she looks
mihoyo finally figured out how to string summer with halloween together LMFAO
halloween?
maybe i'll change my mind with more gameplay
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
i really don't like it
idk
the red on the horse
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
it just looks like playable dxy
but her horse just looks like dxy
and she looks hot on the image on the side of the teaser
her new skin i mean
i like PE aesthetics
<a:nosekiss_hh:758188498191908864>
it would've made more sense
ok
i want another place to spend them
i don't need dupe handel since i don't play FR dps and i don't have boobnia
so i'm gucci for now
yeah i think i gave up on dupe handel
watch the only piece i gacha being B <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
time to go back to g4 mines
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
i have tmbb ana
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
for ice
and i dunno if they're going to repeat that
for how good it was on all lightning valks
think handel was a mistake
i lowkey
g4? ana? welt?
with new dk
what do we coping that HoR will use
it's not going to be LMFAO
so HoR dk might change how good those rank ups are
made it pretty good
and then 7t retroactively
was dogshit
before 7t
like HoT 2s2
well that's currently her rank ups
3s is pretty nice but also very far
2s2 and 2s3 are not very big
2s1 is great stopping point
istg
just start farming
stop coping
she's prob burst mode
it's probably finisher
it's not worth it
just start farming her man
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
cause i was on denial that she wasn't useful
took me like double the time to get her up
and now i'm like farming her on disadvantage because i was fucking stupid as fuck
i was like why even farm FR, she'll be useless by the time i'm done
like 1 year ago
i thought the exact same way as you
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
cause i'll be done with FR when sushang releases!
and i'll also keep up with a valk farm for once
lfg
i'm still hype that i can afford 6.1
i mean of fucking course she does, you don't even need to read to know that
0 scores on abyss cause she'll just lose 40 points every time you press ult lmfao
she'll be like new HoT if it doesn't
i mean that ult absolutely time stops
yeah nekosexslave is from caféquanta, i think they're pretty nice?
but her animations look cool so i enjoy
and rng weapon active outside of horse
on her inputs
she has no buffer
like PE is one valk that like, is objectively pretty bad to play
like, those answers are me trying to be unbiased towards my preference of a valk looking cool, if you ask me what valks look coolest from this year (and so i enjoy playing them) it's:
7t HoT, PE, v2v, SpA
i mean yeah probably but like
it's so much
she goes pew pew pew pew pew pew
LMFAO
look a this shit
it's kinda insane
it just looks like way too much all of the time
and also, i'm not saying sushang gameplay is bad
i mean i'm not the best person to ask this, cause i way overvalue how cool a valk looks than how fun or smooth she is to play, but
SpA, cat, eden and griseo feel pretty good to play
lmfao
they just play it on 2x speed
on live
i like the aesthetic but i dunno if i like the execution
yeah! i dunno how i feel about it
legit can take a nappy
i mean yeah but like you see how long that is?
o it's HoR dk?
annoying
that's
she's zhongli-type
oh god her ult is like 10 seconds long
just get lucky
well i mean maybe
damn
can't afford both of those
wait fuck new dk though
so i'm still in the meta for another patch
i'm hype actually, i'll afford sushang
hi
and not in a necessarily good way
fucking nuts
her gameplay looks
or is that just spicy greatsword/katana
yall on sword user bs, are you on new weapon copium
means more maths lmfao
cope
go on with the cope then
ooo ic ic
we got official info?
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
if those are leaks you can imagine what i'm about to do
i'm confused
leaks? official info? cope?
are those
yeah i'm sleeping LMFAO
okay
jesus fuck
i wanna sleep
until 7pm
how long
have a good day at school
yeah i can understand that, you have it in the bag <a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
aster <:2woggers:658553078420602901>
which is bicc pro
see, youd think having bad memory is a bad thing but i get to rediscover evns beauty multiple times
yeah truly, i was right
o wait no yeah i remember your face actually! dunno why  i didnt from the first pic
oh hmm thats an interesting situation, hope things advance? or not? take your time? i dunno
sure!!
acts
true, not flirting when its f
wait i said i wasnt flirting, fuck
damn evn really is cute!!
i  dunno which of the 2 is you but cute
even hackers be balding goddman, check doom t1 for abother hacker
thats bad advice actually i think
yeah thats nice, also things can always change, relationships start with friendships i think
this dis happen to me though, were nice friends still
woo!!
fuck i failed alread
i can be your dad
i mean for today LMFAO
in general, im flirt slut
jade slaps go on
ill stop myself from flirting
evn: help me decide, the choices are jade green
jade green for sushang 6.1
wth im sorry actual built in torture
that sounds awful tho
like i love people and i love loving people and telling them i love them
i think im just a simp actually
like  thats not to say you shouldnt fix the  stuff youre unhappy about yourself, i cant wait to see the citrine on her full form but she is already great at this stage of evolution
probably not i wanna say
like we had to use sciebtific notation cause holy
hmm see, its easy to fall for that, but i took a peek on the variables and thats actually not taken into account! the main variable there is how much i like and find you hot, and lemme tell you that is off the charts
sheeesh! id prob run FR tho if you dont have eden gun
oh um sorry i ran the numbers and youre actually overwhelmingly attractive and like insurmountably pretty, just thought id update you on the data so you dont spread misinfo
is just straight upgrade
yeah  it looks so good tbh, i think on p much everyone
whats your argument then
what if i tell you i find that unironically hot
just accept it, out of your control
sorry eli, you have a lot pf power here but you dont get to decide how pretty i think you are, and the answer is lots
boo diagnosed me  with enby hysteria
i'm a flirt slut sorry cant help it
you're hot and i can tell you i'm not a gay man
actual greek curse
everyone will be sexually attracted to you and youll want none of it
just another curse put on me by god
LMFAO yeah okay
really? thats kinda surprising, am i horny magnet somehow
which is based i think
girls ive met tho are horny as fuck LMFAO
im pretty pan but i think im generally more into girls
not me clearly
like you gotta understand i cant cut my dating pool by 90%, im already trans ugly and annoying, you know how many people are left LMFAO
just sucks to suck
eh i mean i get what youre saying but like to a lot of people moving on to a more serious or longlasting relationship requires them to meet their emotional and sexual needs, which is really fair imo
LMFAO im glad but my flirting is very direct, you have to do some acrobatics to miss it
me sad*
but makes
which is fair
yeah they usually distance themselves cause i cant meet their needs
that sounds like masochism
i mean yea sure, like im not conning people into relationships, its what hapoens afterwards thats the issue
i mean i do it cause i like it, it makes me feel good, so i dunno if thats a pro. if anything its a con cause it often sends the wrong messages lmfao
well its probably harder on a lot of other aspects
that sounds easier
i dunno like its not like i wanna be horny, i just wanna be normal LMFAO
yeah maybe
and i dont blame them, im clearly the weird one LMFAO
i mean its easy to say that, its hard to not meet expectations and baseline that like 90% of people look for in relationships
L-desu
yeah probably
<a:ppPoof:933892036296343552>
sorry i fucked the vibe of the chat
rigged
unfair
that i have to deal with and others not really generally
just a bunch of bs
so <:A_HuTaoShrug:792525248779517972>
and i also have my issue with opening up and like trauma to actually feel emotions
like its probably trans related stuff, maybe compounded with confidence stuff?
oh no boo, it goes so much deeper than that
word
i wish the answer was yes LMAO
no, and thats the issue
i mean have you read what i said?
i dunno, theyre enjoying it
maybe one day
so yeah i wish i was able to quench the thirst those people have LMFAO
and then they distance themselves often
but then people wanna do the next step and im like eh iunno
i do it a lot
also i really like flirting
not really,youre left out of a lot
i am like anti horny incarnate
but actually it does bum me out that im just chronically not horny
is not working LMFAO
no issok im just trying to bait a reaction out of heki
<a:SataniaCry:736324214818340986>
boo gets to be there just cause hes gay and i'm left out
<:dogcry:887832443980230656>
its just like high school
<:KLEE_CRYING:708170080583811093>
is for science, im clearly not either so what would he put me up as?
<:KianaCry_lum:646460917609005082>
<:cry:944955259636285481>
hua?
who are you again?
<:CryoAmber:914211455123992616>
no i don't like being left out
couldn't be me
imagine being part of stuff
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
scientists a mihoyo working hard to create a system no one will notice and will make 0 difference to gameplay:
LMFAO
HoDeez nuts
check <#966951945103347794>
did you see my score
not yet i'm doing MA
sounds harsh, i'll keep playing my f2p friendly honkai impact
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
ic
that makes sense
that doesn't change my question
i mean
o ok
swear the game is like 2 weeks old and i've seen people talk about like 5 new chara
do ToF chara release
how often
you got this
snowy should be easy
nice, i'm proud of ya
yeah whos hen
not biased btw
i think i deserve it
let's go
i'm a mod??
yeah that's what i said
mihomo balancing hq
random fucking mob on f7 just bricked your run
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
it was kallen
it wasn't even bella actually
you got past bella and the rest was just cruising
yeah that was kinda crazy when you think back huh
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
and middle boss is back to being hardest boss of the run
i think they fucked up balancing again somehow
challenge run
before i found dead [x]
i had to get like 7 mobius signets
but i also got giga unlucky
yeah took me so long to kill hepha
is ult damage
i think only the last hit of fischl ult
mihomo is stupid
i got her and a chakram person
oh sheeesh
i didn't like her
she was my first ssr in ToF
is she good
skill issue
yeah LMFAO
i dunno what i'm on
onyx iron looks nothing alike
o shit no they don't
just recolor
they both look the same
LMFAO
cause i was taking screenshots
onyx iron SpA flamed me for taking too long to start
i found heki's v2v
timing button presses? in my ER? don't think so
and then if i am to collapse i have to press buttons which honestly
if i don't collapse
feels a lot more tanky to me
i just run griseo1 -> husk
i prefer husk but i think people say that tona is better
no but i'm serious that ost fucking slaps i want it
<:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
that and DN LMAOOO really got me hype
the song that plays during the story and the HoH boss fight
i mean like the actual game ost, not the cg
wait actually?
ely fight song is too good
ch31 ost
when are we getting
she's cuter
i'd go for eden i think
<:shrug:877047647511384064>
i wouldn't go for pardo 1 if you don't get it early
just fucking buy her 3s already jfc
i'm mid
BN imo
HoD on release had KMB as cap score
there's potential for her to be useful in the future
p much
yeah just go for the 3s
and personally i'd spend the AL too
yeah i'd just spend the AW
they don't answer afterwards
yeah! they're very busy though
and then i do!
yes pleeease go on, i love when you talk more
people love when i talk, they always say this to me in a funny way
lemme talk more to make it harder for you
thank you?
uh
50 points is like 5 seconds
i mean like -12 seconds
when i say -12 score
o
that's like when my grandma sends me messages thinking it's google
-12 score
and it's like
it isn't until 6 hour mark where i'm finally getting score
i'm still learning the ref
yeah in 4 hours
that's a great quote LMFAO
oh
and i went
and then i got fast shield for the first time
i went wow i dunno why people say it's inconsistent
i remember after 4 hours of doing 3s BKE
it's very straight forward
but besides that
bullshit
fast shield is still
i wouldn't call it easy
masochists
i dunno
probably
but maybe
cause everyone and their parents tries during 3s BKE
i don't think i'll be able to
t10
i wanna try for
parvati is still raven right
imagine not spending 200 bucks for top up event to get 2s HoR just so she becomes farmable
LMFAO
l l
l
yes
this is the best one i have
i think i barely have quotes
safe
lfg
do i have a pedo quote
baban do you want to pilot my acc for a simbattle week
what
owo avatar
yeah is pretty
i'm fucked already
i thought you were tet and went wait tet didn't have purple username
LMFAO
that i didn't recognise
and it was just my message
the other day i sent a message, looked away and went ooh someone answered
i dunno i already can't tell who's who
i just have good affixes
already only 2 sp valk left
whoa how old is cata's acc
heki:
it's ely season and heki's a coward
like it looks like nothing how it's pronounced
aether is such a bad word imo
aether easy
thank you thank you, now i need to come up with a new excuse whenever i fail to cap
collei easy
<a:peepoLeave:646986909381558273>
i'm going back to my hiding place
ty carl
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
no more excuses
i got my crit rate
<a:peepoLeave:646986909381558273>
my acc state to deactivated
yeah i'm also changing
i'd rather not i think
are we?
<a:PU_peepoRiot:778676108152274974>
yeah it really do be fucking gays cause right now i'm thoroughly abused
on literally any small thing
and i just rant
you say anything about it
mihomo is actually like an abusive partner to me LMFAO
istg mihomo
yeah no we're giving players stuff to do, change that back
and fucked it up
and then they went back
they solved that by adding ER
early morning monday there is literally nothing to do
not like fucking 12 hours
or only do like 30 mins close time
i mean sure but they could just auto close all scores on week reset
they added that on like 5.4 or smth
like it wasn't on release
i literally have no fucking clue why it's like that
lfg neb
yeah that would make more sense
oh
lfg schro band
what are we happy over there
you're welcome!
and there's tutorials!
just look up gorou furry knot pics on google
if you are a cosplayer and want to know how to do these
shut up
yeah cause he can't deal with all the fucking knots
gorou's tail must be a mess LMFAO
but it only makes me think
it must be a lot of work
LMFAO i mean it makes sense
LMFAO
3 hours to do
god a genshin sorter must take like
paid f5 and f7 are like very minimally worse than f6
if you want numbers
if you're not spending tsp, then floor 5 6 and 7 are all equal
not a lot
which is uh
so you're missing on 0.003 fuel/tsp if you're doing floor 5 or 7 instead
and floor 6 are 67 fuel/100 tsp
floor 5 and 7 are 66.7 fuel/100 tsp
but i wouldn't say much more efficient
then floor 6 is more efficient
if you're spending tsp
prob only one month at most
what you're quite close
not enough clout
<a:2DKyaruPat:761395347858784267>
ooo rest then!
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
you deserve to live a life without all of those issues
yeah, you should really try different stuff until one sticks
maybe one of them works on you with little to no side effects
they have different side effects no
have you tried many of them yet?
hmmm
just ping everyone who'd be interested there so they know it exists
i think thread works well
<a:NervousSweat:765639934555324486>
every job, huh?
which i guess is
whole deadline thing
not be good at that
i would
hmm yeah that sounds hard
i love spending money in art
<a:Whale_luma:458386265776193536>
i'd buy comms from you once i start getting me money again
yeah i'm sure you're up to the task i think
if that's what you want, you can prob easily get away with that
those are very difficult problems methinks
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
cause after you know there's no coming back
in a way it's nice to not know
yeah need no rush
not that i know, right now
but then i dunno what i'd do with my life
sometimes i wonder if i'd rather just not came back at all
but a lot of stuff is a lot worse
i can tell you like a lot of stuff is better
coming back to like irl college this semester
yeah i can understand that
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
i'm sure you did your best
no need dwelling in the past though
you can try later in life if you want
i figured out the music from that tiktok <>
that's so nice LMAO
like no joke it's prob 2-3 hours walking from the city
going the entire way is like impossible, my college is in the middle of nowhere
dunno if it'd work though, where'd i leave my bike
and still get it
so now i can wake up like 10 minutes before the bus time
i went polar opposite though, now i'm living like literally on the road of a bus stop
cause i have nowhere to stay LMAO
i was staying over at a friend
it was a temporary place though
that i had to do every day
like 30min walk
had such a fucking long walk to the nearest bus
the place i was staying over for college
yeah i can relate to that a bit
oh god
oo i see, that sounds potentially awful
here's another thing to cheer you up
i'm glad to hear i think!
so you're inside the apartment?
hope you feel better!
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
aw
<:Wow:759857863848886303>
can just do screenshots/photos if that's easier for you
o yea i guess streaming it is potentially a hassle
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
i don't even have a switch
you're talking about acnh yeah?
ac
i don't have
<a:ppPoof:933892036296343552>
o shit
ik how much work it is
actually i'd be up to seeing like progress updates
that sounds hella fun
oh hell yes!
yeah their stuff is great!
oh sheeeesh!!
i'm gonna tag <@309634550273933314> cause it's up her alley too
finally
found it
i'm,,, doing my best
lemme see if i can find them
which i really love
there's like on series of comics of him
he's also cute
oh yeah i remember him!
cute
o he a penguin
who that
that last one i think is just called a slut though
1. i'm a furry
2. i love bandwagons
3. i'm everyone's simp
i'm finally accepting some stuff about me
i love bandwagons
i'm just joining the bandwagon
it's from my wallpaper
it's not a good pfp LMAO
you can barely see it
i got my ely transformation
okay
jesus that 144p fanart
i'm really easily convinced into bandwagons
fine i'll become ely too
okay so are we all just becoming ely
so it only makes sense
was also white bg
old crab sticker
i mean
yeah i like the white bg
no
this is cool too though
the birb one
so i keep it
but i think it's cute as fuck
i don't think people like mine generally
you're the judge
i mean is your pfp
fanart is where it's at
is too bland
i feel like using official stuff
i mean you have to go for fanart, right
it'll be just way too confusing
yeah LMAO
25% of this server is already ely
i swear
but like
i lowkey wanted to change my pfp into ely too
more like play better
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
beggars can't be choosers right
i mean me too but
yeah metal biggest gate
but lv60 on release is fine
i don't think i'll have enough for max on release
for 520
i'm missing 190 rn
than a normal abyss-only player would
3x as much pris
just by being MA-only, i'm pretty sure i had to max like
yeah
LMFAO
in the game
subsection of player
the most niche
which is
i'm also MA-only bicc whale
not only am i bicc whale
cause i do realise how fucking insane my situation often is
i mean i'd like to think my advice is still good for budget/f2p player
<a:ppPoof:933892036296343552>
my coin and nano issues just went
cause like immediately after i skipped 2 patches
extremely off curve
yeah i realise now that my experience was like
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
for like 5 patches
my biggest bottleneck
they were unironically
i mean you say that
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
lmao
you're at 0?
also you do be needing some nanos huh
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
o
and you have time to farm back up to 150
on a 2* elf
i wanna say like if you have about 150 you can max all the important skills
prob can get away with getting rid of about 50 adv skill mats
and what rank
are you going for elf ely
1.2 free ayaka ar 42
no her hidden sister leaked on 1.0 <:tericopiumhic:893828235954102293>
where's mimi
LMFAO
no
whos that
i'll even top up like 5 bucks
dw
on your funeral
i'll pull for you
send me your acc details
<#963280001900376064>
sorry
i need to actually play it out to know
is you
the only thing attractie here
yeah i skimmed around
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
no i haven't watched a 45 minutes in 5 minutes
what the fuck <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
you need to measure damage and stuff differently
since like
how to 0s
sounds like actual hell to figure out
like s-rank kasumi
i dunno, that's the thing
who sucks at the game
awful for player like me
like this is just
i can let you buy it for me if i enjoy it
on a game i might not enjoy
don't waste your money
i'll pirate it and try it out
no <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
nah i'm good with gachas i think
SO bad
that sounds like
every try counts
isn't pgr MA like
like bugs can be fun
i mean yeah just have to try out the speedrun to see if i'll find it fun ig
i mean not necessarily
i think i prefer rather bug-free ones
very bug heavy speedruns
i dunno how i feel about
i can try it out for sure
fuck no
of minecraft
72 hours
do you think i'd recordd
no what
i'm what people call gamer
3 days
it took i think
i actually did one
hmm
or the open world one
the like first game
but do you mean
you've showed me before
lowkey doubt
involve?
bald
does that
yeah?
i'd enjoy that
i feel like
oh i could get into speedrunning
<a:peepoLeave:646986909381558273>
is it a gacha
i can cooperate and make the best quote if you want
what did you want to crop
i've suffered enough
i mean i believe you and that's why i don't want to
yeah
this is the first gacha i bald and it'll be the last
done with gachas
no i'm fucking
need bald factor to keep me around
i don't play
if i can't bald
you don't understand me taihen
i can play with you
street fighter 3 or some old shit
if not like
guilty gear strive if it runs on my pc
is what everyone does
i'll prob play some fighting game
i think if i quit honkai
i don't think it runs on my pc though
LMFAO
yeah, there's ranked in that game
it looks fun to play like with friends every now and then
that games looks cbt to bald
and then you won't have to budget
my recommendation is to quit the game before new AL valk release
+ event rewards and more bs
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
we have a whole patch to save up after she's announced
yeah, whole patch you can get enough to buy the valk
it's fiiine
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
we got like 200 for free on ely release
so you can easily have enough
they do hella AL rewards
yeah, + with new valk release
that's legacy, still enough i think
yeah it does
can start saving when they announce her and have enough resources
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
we have global foresight
is my lpan
BN -> TP -> quit the game
BN -> TP -> ?
for dorm bonus
she's the next i'll go for 2s i think
she's like s1 tho
mine's still s LMFAO
2 patches at this point
in like
haven't topped up
i'm f2p wdym
kinda close hto
so yea no
i have 26 ss
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
it's all lined up
FR in 3 weeks
ely in 2 weeks
i'll get griseo next week
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
okay 6 more and then i can beat taihen on everything
i dunno how to count
oh wait
one of the pics had like
yeah why did you only show 20
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
i mean, yes
3s valks
taihen has 20, i have 23
whoa i've got more than taihen
it's true but you shouldn't say it
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
but every other i farmed from like card to 3s
i did pull for 3s cat
the rest i pulled for a single card max
can't even say that i'm whale cause i've only pulled for cat
i see
are yall spending asterite
where tf
most people had 3s eden at start of last patch
most people i think had 3s griseo at start of patch
wdym so fast i'm slaccing as fuck LMFAO
it's 104 rn
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
slacc taihen
o shit!
and i'm 200 fuel off the last dk
then i'll only be missing HB
tomorrow i'll get griseo
on sp valk farming and dk atk
i'm about to pass you
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
lfg tet has hands
tet hand reveal
still nice to craft but it's for copium stuff
you can prob live without fhm methinks
if you have jst
so <:Shrug:616394597211439118>
p useless
they're like
prob just get it from events every now and then
but there's no like recurring source
i think early game stuff gives you a bunch
idk either
or else <:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
so i need to clear the shop
i left the skin for last
then you can finish it in like 2 days
if you don't care about clearing the shop
but like
you should prob start doing it rn if you wanna clear the shop
yeah, you need to do 12 days of the dailies to clear the shop
so worse/worse
and braindead gameplay, which is boring
she has complicated rules, which is annoying
no, i'm saying that complicated gameplay is fun, but most complicated gameplay comes from complicated rules
like worst of both worlds
yeah
but how braindead she is to play after you figure it out
for how like complicated her gimmick is
mobius is prob one of my least favorite
my favorite and what's strongest are def different
kevin is prob the strongest actually
he, sakura and ely are prob the 3 worst ones methinks
i suck at kalpas
it's crazy, i think he's prob easy too
SO hard
kevin scales
she's kinda op
i also morbed for the last one
keep running, if you want
it is to deny yourself of growth
to run from the cringe, isn't that to run from who you truly are
is my lil crime cinnamon bun
pathetic.
it's a part of who we are
just accept the cringe heki
<:Sucrose_Glasses:845784727935909898>
that is true
those count as furry
breaking news, heki
yeah
fight for what? second place?
so there's no reason to make gorou and tighnari fight
we all know the superior furry in genshin is razor
i mean
you know this last act of story would've hit a lot harder if they properly translated ER as elysia's paradise
let them be
why must you make two pretty boys fight
heki that's kinda pathetic
i'm not complaining
i mean
tet that might aswell be +18
LMFAO i love him
oh blade dudu
whats BD
they're playing the game nini
fanart friend
a tighnari
i made
that's what he is
permanent on my heart
yeah
i think he's low spender
on tighnari
to spend all my money
i am going
i'm f2p
yes!!!
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
we be whel buddies
<:2woggers:658553078420602901>
<:WhalePat:607373633056407605>
i don't know why it's like this but i think it's cute
yeah!!! that's the answer
issok i'll forget about it in a bit
you think i fucking read
you're talking to me
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
okay you get to grief more
oh this soon?
no one's ever asked me why my name is this
you know what's weird
and move the fuck on
you need to learn from it
the ely cg
did you watch
sorry i just like to cause drama, haikyuu is aight
streak of good anime
i said
keep the streak of good anime
watch mob psycho next
you're so unique tet
unhinged sentences
those are like
LMFAO
and you're like this is sad actually
where the last scene everyones fucking naked
the only anime
it's like
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
god i should rewatch it
it's so fucking good isn't it
and you also don't get to choose a character cause fuck you i guess
aram is a special gamemode where instead of playing the fun parts of the game they just throw you in a basically pit to fight it out
that it's balancing is often fucking stupid
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
literally everything else
the issues are just
say what you want about league at least it controls well after you get used to it
eh it gets better
so
and i'm too occupied with balding honkai
and i'm awful at shooters
they're all playing valo nowadays though
so i just join whenever they're missing 1
i dunno how anyone does it
it's like awful
playing with randos
i can't stand
whenever my friend group gets a full team
nowadays i play like one match every 3 months or so
i haven't touched it in a while though
back in like 2017/18
yeah i mean i used to play a bunch
oooh
yeah, i'll just come here and go i'm cis (better)
what
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
and it's just cis
hey hello r/trans so my egg cracked and there's just another fucking egg in there
yeah we try some stuff out
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
did u see my bio update
sora leaving
my thoughts on what
like oh so this is the discussion that made sora leave? i have opinions on that
so you asked why he left, got the reason, and immediately started the reason back up
yeah it was just created
for hak and taihen giving birth i think
don't
pro tip tet
that sounds like abuse
is that how it works
i think he's choking right now
hak taihen mpreg
why do i even come back
i hate it here
snort smoke
is that like
i love you too baby
heki you need therapy
yeah this is the tero3 experience i fucking guess
yeah i can fucking see that
everything all the time so much
and it's like
to welcome new person
i come back for like 5 mins
how do yall keep up with this
what the fuck is going on
<a:Hugs:598593305898385418>
you get hug though
good bye
i'm having a fucking stroke
this chat is a fucking romcom skit
heki wtf are you on about
makes no fucking sense
that still
heki hears the adults making adult jokes and goes yeah i can just put words together and people will find it funny
what
i like my gender hard or smth
taihen you're scaring the new person
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
me and tet are the same person, only difference is that my egg's cracked
isn't that the band
there's no helping him, but it's nice to having him around if you ever feel bad over your own gacha choices
oh yeah i forgot about that one
and he wants HoH
and now he's using all of his xtal on v2v
he ran slug SpA for a while
heki is like the most copium person you'll ever meet, he's insanely good at making the worst possible decisions on gacha
tet's fine just be careful
stay away from heki
yeah so <@291907279291285506> this is where the weird people hang out, you can come hang out over at <#966951945103347794> and the leak and datamine stuff is usually posted at <#963273616852652095>
nvm
oh i see you're fucking stupid

i don't think i dream actually
i mean it's called tero for a reason
submit it to the hi3 fanart contest
couldn't you make counterfeit tero3
isn't tet an artist
that one would work
your honour look at my client
*crying on the floor while mumbling about finding tero3*
do you think they are clinically sane
you have to admit it was very funny
your honour i was doing it for the memes
yeah that's going to hold up in court
yeah i hope you enjoy 30 satirical years on irony jail
<:peepoBlushy:751806255730917436>
you dream of me?
why are you like this ruby
why are you like this bruh
tet sometimes i wish i could violate the geneva conventions over the internet
can i trade
do i have insurance
this shit's broken
that fucking sucks
can i get a brain one day
stfu
or else...
can't unleash all their power
aster playing hard mode
blustorm doesn't
not every one does
i've never seen an armada as horny as solstice
have you seen solstice?
besides, the worst we have is phi licking
we just lick phi
we don't lick phi's feet
yeah proof of the feeling
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
neither of you have disappointed me in blustorm cause you barely talk there
you're playing with higher goals than mine
no you're not, but that's okay
but he only listens to about 30% of my advice
i've tried adopting heki
<a:peepoLeave:646986909381558273>
i'll stream husk bald
is what you mean to say
so you're taking the secret to the grave
original riven
<:woggerswhale:653576160231424040>
riven?
<:2woggers:658553078420602901>
styx?
who
i really like moles
gj
that's cute as fuck actually
i guess i could've guessed that
got too close to the truth
when you get backroom'd back into reality
very cool area
that's behind the ruin guard i think
oh yeah
coward
have you not played story yet
that does not answer my question
have you not played story yet
tighnari drug pouch
anyone wanna rewatch the concert
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
you don't want to make me competitve
<a:ppPoof:933892036296343552>
<@180679257851166721>
so goodbye LMAO
and boy am i sleepy
the sleepier i get the more insufferable i get
i'm very annoying <:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
yeah i have that effect on others
it's both worse and not as bad as you're thinking
i didn't find it though
so i just looked through the message history
like i couldn't go hey who has the yae armpit emote
but i couldn't ask cause it'd be weird
and i don't remember why but i wanted to point it out for some reason
yeah there was this one time someone used it in blustorm
oh i was looking for that emote
would she hide diapers
how the fuck
aponia is barely wearing clothes
it's way more funny
and say that they didn't post it earlier
can i spread misinfo
they're fucking with me then
oh i see
yeah, today!
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i was fucking watching the concert!!!!
like wtf do you mean it's a raffle that starts with the concert and ends with the concert
also isn't this fucking mean as hell
this is for a different thing
calm down
no the ticket thing is until tomorrow
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
LMAO
so it's done already
until the end of the concert?
i feel like any day now i'll get blocked by carv LMAO
am i blocked
oh ok
what did blank edit
go on bruh
well i guess necessary evil
oh is he?
he doesn't even play the game
cause i think mihoyo can't do anything about bruh
what, bruh being a lolicon or the leaker stuff?
that makes more sense
oh waow
i have no clue what a tero even is actually LMAO
is this a riddle for tero3
dim is doing some honkai stuff
memory issue then
huh
i guess i barely show up here lately
are you new here <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
oh yeah i remember the 2.1 drama that was funny
so much info
we hated uba during 2.1?
what
wait blank edited a character
beforei  sleep
i want drama
link?
i can see that
actually
how did uba get cancelled
<a:PU_peepoRiot:778676108152274974>
it's a fucking scam LMAO
coin asterite and stamina
it's like
:skullge:
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i'm still shit at the game
where's my dalao title
wait you get to be dalao in rl
from where you're at
about 37 pulls for 50%
so i'm assuming it'll take like
you're at a similar value than i am
i'd need another 39 pulls to have 50% chance of getting the valk
and from 39 pity
so i'm at 39
oh
i can simulate how many pulls from where you're at
that's the point where you have 50% chance at getting the valk from 0 pity
yes
fuck it i'll skip too
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
it works on heki
was this posted already
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
and you are complaining
saving you
game is actually
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
with less cdmg than that
i have fully built characters
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
then i have 70 atk
if that's the case
just give me it!!!!
ffs
they literally have hooded felis model
me when genshin update
he's a himbo
the kalpas one is in character
am i having a stroke
i mean with how easy the game is i unironically would <:ohno:959752132905566261>
i'm running her with tighnari and i get to ult twice an hour
it's insane
she needs so much energy
collei needs like full ER
i'll build all my characters full EM
a lot of times in inazuma i just spammed T to get through what the game wanted me to
the inazuma ones tbh felt like an event gimmick they for some reason decided to use on the entire continent
the range is so much bigger
it's insane
they're so much better than the inazuma ones
are so good
yeah the flying thingies
and stopped farming
i just farmed artifacts until i got enough damage to 36* abyss
so it's still pretty easy for me to get upgrades
my artifacts are kinda shit
but also
so i have plenty to try
and i have a lot of those artifacts that if it rolls all in one stat
at least for me
is still good if it rolls all on crit
like a feather with crit/crit/def/flat atk
i mean i have plenty of potential good artifacts
i guess the longer you go the more you need to minmax the artifacts and your standards get higher
like that's the thing you need the most, not potential good artifacts, just xp to level up the potential ones you have
i do mean that
yeah
isn't xp the bottleneck
i mean is it even minmaxing
still sounds like a waste of xp
it
when did that change
do people like strongbox now
wait
i hate it here
who uses the new ruin fleshlights
for tighnari mats
i'm killing mushrooms
wanna join
<@309634550273933314>
the dust thingies
i guess i could just buy
yeah
like the dust thingies tighnari uses
anyone wanna farm new character mats
hey so
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
700+ achievements now??
there's
great for dendritto
LMAO
just for the memes
do we know why kusanali did that
so uh
i see
if i start playing actively i don't mind paying 20 bucks for a skin i like
i mean i might
also missed another farmable skin LMAO
but i didn't do it cause i was lazy
i just know she showed up
with kusanali
also can anyone give me a rundown of what happened in the GAA2
it's SO cute
i'm glad you're feeling better though
that's so far from anything i thought it was about LMAO
i couldn't even though i talked with sumeru katherine
idk maybe quest locked
what happened?
sometimes in inazuma it felt like they were cramming everything they could on the small space they had
it's a very good change of pace, it feels like an actual forest
it feels very empty when compared to like enka and inazuma
i actually am really liking sumeru
and for yae, i'm very lazy to go unlock the enka boss
well for tighnari, i haven't figured out good places for his plants
yeah
when your tighnari and yae both have 2k hp
is really hard
trying to play a tighnari fischl yae team
you know
sorry gotta keep you on your toes
for my cyno funds
<:Wokege:996346539364601876>
sorry, ty for the info, i'll prob get c2 collei then <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
asked LMAOAOAOAOAOAO
oh yeah i also noticed!
who
me next me next
yeah i'll pick highkey
whichever is the non-british way to say it
or math
for learning maths
not the ideal environment
yeah that does sound like
is this a feet thing?
aren't you global? you have 4 hours
i've tried
it's not an awful move
but this isn't bad either
yeah i'd prob go for a second newt before going for craftable stuff
it's not like you'll need more with the death of SS MA
if you have like 2 newt 1 ppm already
i mean honestly probably
according to leaks DN LMAOOOOOOOO
but it wouldn't surprise me
to make the same mistake twice
yeah mihoyo'd have to be extra dumb
they had the same thing too
i'm actually pretty confident it's just the artbook event
is that just the artbook event reskinned?
was that event around in cn?
looks interesting though
but they hotfixed it
oh yeah i think that happened in one of the cn events
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
she deserves the best
i'm so proud
that's very heki
lmfao
is it rng
<:HUH:996349004646453350>
what
i can look for refs if you want me to
i dunno how HoH works
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
why are you using that weapon on HB
teifunari?
i wonder if other language va is better
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
i enjoyed that
okay the invite event is actually pretty cool
linn has it too i think
Are you done? with a picture of dead himeko
Fu Hua is never a loser!
some of those quotes are so fucking funny
share -> download image
of the 3 slice one
i'm too much of a simp
and the lyrics make no sense <:ohno:959752132905566261>
is just dead himeko
i like how 3 of the possible images for nightglow
i dunno how to do much further than that, sorry
like a pleb
yeah i just looked for the sprite sheet png
it does sound like an interesting thing to look into! i might do that later today instead of the college stuff i have to do
oh yeah i dunno either, but the motion files must be loaded through the front-end as well somehow, right?
i might just be stupid
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
is that not what it is
oh hmm i thought l2d ani script was what they used to animate those sprites for the web events
it's even funnier the second time (i haven't gotten up yet)
<a:meonglaugh:860649995858477076>
to try to do that
it sounds fun actually
to answer your question
you wish you were bad<:th_flower:891578677618413589>boy
based
honestly?
be careful
oh damn the honkai god is there
<a:rozahaha_hh:799827750986186772>
oh LMFAO
i'm sat down now can you repeat it
yeah i didn't get the joke, i think it was because i was standing up
i need to find a place to sit down
wait gimme a sec
dismembered ely
and also i got to apho2 like 4 months later
so i don't press those anymore
like the go button sent you to apho2 during apho2 events and i was like right now i'm going though the event tabs, i'll get to apho2 when i get to apho2
you know?
and i'm like i'll get to it when i get to it when i'm running through the events n stuff
cause it usually sends to another menu or w/e
i dunno i think i just tuned that button out
oh wait that's what the go button does?
yikes
cause it gave me a reward
i can't click the button again
sheeesh ty
the consequences of my actions
help
and now i don't know how to make one
i insta alt f4d
the event sent me to the site to make my own ticket
i'll elect to ignore it
that's a weird ass defence
that's cute, good nickname
but we do, get the fuck out
i hope you're not a baby
aren't you allowed at <#975572314198511626>?
but... you're not a baby
that's a sick nickname
mine sucks, i had to get store bought
lucky
you got a name from birth?
i also trust nini's screenshot more than the wiki
a lot more efficient see
i can just ping nini
yeah but that's way too much work
like the tutorial thingies?
what character trial
so only one more level for me
thank you <a:Love:534242801131454516>

oh that's my favorite anime!
i'm adv skill mat poor
what's max value for this skill?
owo pat <@309634550273933314>
i think i sucked at the game tho
i wasn't able to clear it on my first time seeing it on nirv
yeah the quantum mob stage is kinda bad
i'm just that talented
what can i say
god i'm so good at honkai
thank you cherry
let's fucking go
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
owo kill <@148145559897636865>

kinda lewd
huh
owo kiss <@482139585355448333>
<:Deadge:958122498019434496>
i dunno how the bot works
&kiss <@482139585355448333>
+kiss <@482139585355448333>
the gif bot
do we have
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
you ask me where something is, i have no clue, i just check everything every time i need to find something
tbh i know nothing on this game still
yeah that's what i always do
the concert one
too many tabs LMAO
this event is kinda confusing
am i getting old
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
i'm going all-in theer
damn i really want an elysia headset
<:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930>
back when it was on beta everyone was pogging over it
i remember kosma2 being broken
i always use shallows to unlock new signets too
and it's like floor 7 before i go wait
i think every run i've used sirin
and there is nothing i can do to change it
in my mind griseo is an elemental valk
i think it is supposed to be good on her no?
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
v2v2
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
i'm still 2s griseo
i mean tbh i wasn't going to bald much either way
yeah
like 3-4 i think
oh
but i could've just run mobius
i think you can still 0s
i was just trying to have fun on the last ss hepha
tyty
and now i'm fucked <:ohno:959752132905566261>
and i locked tp pri there
i did ft bb ch for the 0s on hepha
oh yeah did i tell y'all
i love my cdmg affixed bastet
dw
that's cat's stig
yeah?
i think i would enjoy ice team more if it was AE-RC
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
death of HB
with only 0,99 a day you can help her
was she too powerful in SS MA by killing in 0s instead of 0s
why the fuck were they nerfing her tf then? <:ohno:959752132905566261>
i'm guessing not either
can you freeze MA tank?
oh yeah that makes sense, you can't freeze tank right?
think like that
i wish i was able to
i'd think nyx would've prefer ely over WE
i mean sure but that still isn't related to what i was talking about
<:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
i... guess?
why would nyx want WE over ely
i guess i'd prefer if not so my WE still has some uses
ely elf is going to be better than WE even for non-HoH team right
mihoyo desperate
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
yeah ice is kind of a scam, elf is so fucking big
that one wouldn't even be a lie!
nah doomposting is the main course in maincord
HoH + 4/4 + elf is more expensive than SSS SW with 4/4 on release banner
you can probably lie and people would believe you in maincord
but you can cope for it
no
i mean
i mean but still
LMFAO
this is too easy
go for harder targets
cmon ruby
than a few levels on fr pri can make bicc difference
and that's making you need to do an entire new rot
like if you're only missing a bit of damage
depends
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
that's skill issue
but if you have a good setup team, it doesn't matter that v2v sp gen sucks, everyone else's does too, you can just copy what they're doing to not suffer
but that's true of all valks
like you gotta make different rotations if you're using weird setups and can't copy a ref
not... really...
i mean
lmfao
they fucking suck
if v2v users are scoring 300
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
it's expensive
yeah
mean!!
waow
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
it's very pretty actually
cause <a:Monka:465018118608125953>
start buying the armada ones
that's fischl skin right?
o wait no you're i think
yeah am i crazy?? who the fuck is that? <:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
same for maxing a weapon
23
so proud
getting closer to not atk diffd!!
<:lfg:803114423430545418>

<:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930>
it works if you have seen that image before
yeah that one
the vuln one
there's only one useful i think
does she get much from max lvl
good luck <:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
<:Wokege:996346539364601876>
i was asking if you needed snowy sniper for this abyss

<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
sure thing~
i'm fucking proud as fuck, that placement? good job
what do we even get for tier 3
i dunno if tank is better than heimdall
i think
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
lmfao
i'm about to 3s eden and not have enough adv skill mats to max her broken skill
<:whalepat_hh:710738275845013576>
yeah i'm at 0 adv skill mats rn i think
interesting strategy
i see
oh
tf else do you do with it
wdym are we spending asterite
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
so far
my griseo and hb though
and i'm completing eden in a bit
ayyy we're matched! i'm only missing hb, griseo eden
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
i might finish faster than you
which ones are you missing
i'm done for
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
aster believe ruby more than me
except me
kinda sus
oh wait i know what you meant
that's
leave me alone
i'm baby
i'm young
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
don't recover my acc ty
i'm october 2nd
but idk if that's the same thing
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
i think i actually know, just need to check the day i got amber
i can find out when i created my genshin acc
not if you ask mihoyo nicely
skill issue
<:lfg:803114423430545418>
there's an end in sight y'all
let's fucking go
oh wait
<a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753>
i just go <:woggers:1002597195645714582> elemental breach
do i have brain damage
for griseo
elemental bonuses
i keep picking
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
HoT (3000 usd value)
i thought it was
for one sec
bastet time
good ol' 5 to retain
then you wouldn't be at low 600s lmao
but i guess if you were
if you're playing optimally
i think ss AE literally doesn't matter here
good ol' anime bullshit
wtf is that
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
not that
ggz seele
kyuushou
motivation for ggz lore is like
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
<:TeriTeehee:476615023343697921>
i wouldn't know
that's the only reason anyone would say you know, i actually want this heimdall fight to be harder
that's why
masochism
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
go go carv
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
low hanging fruit
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
i'm fine with 2 minute long 3s fights if they weren't bosses like BKE, wolf, fgo
thats the current plan, yeah
and i have nowhere to stay over lmfao
i'm going back to college tomorrow
i can't right now, i'm looking for a place to live
yeah it's like their core design trait MA but make them awful
hi baby
making 3s boss 0s won't solve those problems
and disgusting transition phases
is that they have awful gimmicky mechanics
i've always said the thing i hate the most about them is not that they take longer
i mean that is literally not true
memorial arena
yeah she's going to be the herrscher killer alright
the one herrscher to end it all
if i made carv mad is because i'm right
think through it with me
1. PE HoE was clearly kiana, it only makes sense CE HoE will also be kiana (dudu)
2. dudu has insane honkai resistance, for a herrscher to be born a person needs to have good honkai resistance (or else they just die and turn into zombie instead), so you need insane honkai power (HoE) to transform her into herrscher

just need a little retconning for dudu to go from immune to honkai -> near immune to honkai
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
HoE dudu
if it sells they'll do it
for future playable herrscher
is my prediction
corruption -> seele -> rita -> teri - > dudu
trust
ice will get the herrscher treatment
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
we don't need more ice support
yeah bio makes sense
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
god literally everyone is going to have 2s2 bke soon huh
that makes sense actually
back on 5.3 on type dxy, she was already top pick if people had figured it out then
it's kinda hidden strat, not many people use it and less people know about it
and still isn't
it was the case, just wasn't popular to overseas peeps
BKE would be kinda dead if mihoyo didn't keep giving her rank ups out
same about TP
yeah
or just HoF bosses in general
i think global doesn't try really hard at heimdall
it's a very annoying boss
the way you break the shields is really unintuitive
bullshit
i use her every week
and then it's still bullshit after you whale
mihoyo just makes it so you need to whale
nah
i'm assuming yes
by the end?
get lv100
does knight bp
bug abuser
i mean yeah but normal for beta to have more than 2
sss hepha so small
lmao
who's pos
the last one
there we go
,qdel 1795128
,qdel 17951289
it isn't kiana without it
hair thingy
nah kiana needs her
until i find a better one
can use that for now ig
o i see
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
i just used the like character select screen for the others
i dunno what pic to use since she isn't playable on beta
yeah missing that one
can't help but love the belts on lycaon tail LMAO
yeah i did for all of them
i guess that makes sense
nekomata is also there?
it's her, anby and billy
they're outlaws or smth
it's like a group i think
so it's easier to remember the zzz characters LMAO
i did a thing
i mean i dislike mihoyo putting genshin artifacts on every game <:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
how's that a bad thing
they can make nicoles boobs a size bigger
every year they add to game rating
a2 gamer
that's some good quality
pass me some of that copium
that looks tasty
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
cause it's false for both and for different reasons
like in game or in lore?
what
she's the pink haired booba lady from zzz
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
but my asterite all going into sp valk rn
i want mine
<:lfg:803114423430545418>
up to which one
<:HeartHug:774300073642557470>
meanwhile you use cat on ice, fire and even sometimes lightning team
cat is overall less buffs than griseo, but you only use griseo for phys team
and griseo just makes stuff less bald
cat is way more flexible
pardo
<:Madge:909232418379153418>
i want my color back
me neither lmao
it's not leaks
is non-nda
the cbt1
also take this color away from me
there u go
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
lmfao
and making every new game genshin
making every gamemode in honkai abyss
damn mihoyo really do be
yeah i can see that
i guess it's shitty but i don't think i would've skipped her anyways
i haven't decided if i'm mad at that or not yet
oh ok
5 week patch?
what are we mad at exactly
so we're down bad
oh ok
how are we feeling
what's the vibe check on the announcements
i just woke up
lmfao <:Widepeepohug:675260898956410910>
based
<:IinoDespair:838805351117357096>
i skip story and play gacha
some people skip gacha and play story
if you skip it
it's small
is usually cg + small epilogue in-game
i think final act of arc
there u go
animation?
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
elysia is not PE kiana
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
kokomi is great
true based
very subtle
yeah, god wrote my character with underlying autistic traits like being autistic
LMFAO that's great
LMFAO
i suck at MA
but in reality
everyone treats her like she's good at what she does
relatable
see
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
cause i'm also mid
relatable character
then i'll take it as a good thing
if kokomi is mid
i just said something that wasn't true
it was really easy
wasn't kokomi on 2.1?
i was doing misinfo on purpose
wait
kokomi released
understanding of honkai
average genshin player
i wonder what is
lmao
can't wait until genshin hitcount shield
<:yippee:1002596802656223274>
i think i believe it
hmm
<:collapsedwoggers:652852676228546611>
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
i can't pause the gif lmao
damn lmao
i datamined fnaf assets
with CF not as much sp problem
well, without CF at least
and i have sp problems in abyss
i have 4/4 and ss0
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
imagine without it
yeah like she sucks for sp even 4/4
that's the special no sp gen mobius
darken times
HoT best option on husk
god
weird af
where you did use slug AE
but there was a boss in MA
i don't remember when
isn't slug AE a legit tech in a boss?
again not even that bad
thank you i ruined the joke
i'm very slow
ooooh i understand it now
yea
lmfao
there's those there?
what's the nirv retainers in maincord?
don't get me wrong tho, neb pri is definitely good value too
oh no i was talking about base weapon
neb pri is also nice to max, but not as big as normal neb
it's so fucking good value
to max
weapon prio
highest
the
i'd prob put it on like
maxing neb is like such good value
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
the rest is pretty good
non-max neb is sad
that doesn't even look that bad tbh
with idiots
and it's filled
i have to interact with the community
yeah now that there's no more game for me to play
send help
shitposter and toxic
yeah i'm slowly becoming iriya
when the best they've done is half clear RL sidestage
some people talk like they're fucking nirv retainers
don't act like your opinions are like the truth
i mean it's fine if you do just
but no they're fucking a3 demoters
but i just thought it was like weird takes
in specific
i had noticed that person have some wild takes
honestly it's so annoying
worth it
still
oh
how many bchip is it again? like 300?
knight bp is already p worth it
just on xtal alone
yeah like
but i know i don't have it lmao
i don't remember when or why
i did get rid of my apho1 greatsword tho
yeah that too
like a new valk + weapon to invest in
and i dunno if f2p or budget player even affords a new pri every 2 patches
so like if you pull for a new pri every 2 patches you profit torus
cause you get about 300 for free per patch
i'm pretty sure you don't need that much torus if you're catch up on torus
and if you're somewhat budget player
cause i def have enough torus
i mean i'm pretty sure i did melt some gacha weapons into cubes
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
already have enough torus?
what
<a:LoveWink:814532094381391882>
ooo looks tasty!
but yae in general is <:gigachad:950480147084115968>
oh wait they're talking about genshin yae? thin ice
based and chadpilled
true actually
carv it was a joke about me being illiterate
wish the game did that
documenting stuff
fan community so nice
o i see
i didn't know what the valks did was written somewhere
wait what's that
i'm obsessed with it
<:elypout:1002924041142796408>
share?
not hoarder
in that case you're just lazy
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
hoarder is a person who obsessively keeps tons of stuff when they don't need it
i love you too baby
have you been keeping up with my simulation stuff
hi taihen
cause it might not deliver here + it might be chance based and not guaranteed
damn not gonna get my hopes up
for all societal problems
is the solution
but look at can breakdancing
i just got here so idk what's going on
aster
it's irl <:FelisD:987145546974253056>
<a:kok:1003847230568013934>
my new emote
wanna see
hey
lmfao
genshin killer is called mihoyo and they do a really good job at it already
i'm on fucking 6 month break already
me break?
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
cause i'm just
that makes me want to do gaa less
you do realise though
that's a lot
wth
should i do gaa
2 weeks?
are we from sumeru
how far
ok
just living out an alternate universe
lmfao
that thing is the only thing i haven't done yet
oh that makes sense
have to find those now
also ty
lmfao so average maincord user
there's an achievement for completing all the collection
i mean i doubt it
LMFAO
yes pls
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
wtf am i missing
<@218762069338619906>
she got the HoT booba
so like
well, not without taking hits, but on 1 hit = i die mode, and i died a lot
like i absolutely suck at games like that, but i eventually beat momodora without taking hits
i find that kind of stuff fun
then i wouldn't bother
i mean if you're not having fun with it
yes
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
lmao
and then work on it during the week
i was like okay i'll figure something out during the weekend
lmfao yeah
i thought that was the deadline to join
it's sunday to submit the piece of art?
wait
waow
so edgy
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
that's fucking giga secret info apparently
not even i knew about that one
<:MeiKnife:647104199406125100>
dear ruby
confirmation
i don't think we have
SK?
i guess she has feet
lmao
that skin is a debuff
even if i was to play her
i mean
cause i didn't pull, lucky
and i didn't get 1
there was a 67% chance of getting 2 skins
on 60 pulls
also
LMAO
the wrong chat
this is
what the fuck
or sp
vg i think
next best to not get would be
ty
and then did not use the 2 boxes on lili's and le's
i did not roll roza's
couldn't be me
not me
i didn't spend 6k xtal on skins
weak valk
only cover the bosses she covers smh my head
LMAO
to doompost on first frame
they like spam paused the announcement
frame 1 doompost
we know literally 0 from her lmfao
with people doomposting her so soon
i'm impressed
to make others mad
i'll doompost her for fun
summer -> cn anniv elf
usually they do
b2b elf
on 6.1
we'll get another elf
do we think
okay so how we feeling
yeah on heaven
you'll see a feather one day and senti will say that reminds of an old timer... wonder how she's doing out there....
you silence me because i'm right
who learned with hua's death
and she's a mature girl
her body is senti's
hua is dead
apho3 senti
<a:BAKOOM:482798416032956426>
i'll fucking
if we don't get apho senti
they're busy married
senti
dead kiana corpse
apho3 with teri seele
oh nvm then
but i think it's hard to argue otherwise
no direct confirmation
credit card
would become the strongest herrscher
so the strongest body in the world
so the more resistance you have, the more powerful the honkai needs to be to possess her
or else it kills you
like you need a base amount of honkai resistance to become a herrscher
dudu is going to become a HoE
like i'm 99% sure
dudu can become a herrscher, she just has insane honkai resistance no
like fucking half of our herrschers lmao
she can awaken the powers to use it for good
herrscher doesn't have to be enemy lmao
time to make a new herrscher
mihoyo feeling empty pockets
i think it doesn't matter
rita could be HoD
like senti is
but yeah she'd be just a new valk
even though i love my lil baby senti2
seems like they don't want us to empathise with her
yeah from the way people been talking about her
seele and teri herrscher are in the far future now
is if they do HoH -> HoC
the only way b2b herrscher is happening imo
yeah no
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
we don't get expa
there's a chance our 6.1
cause
still fucked for us htough
and just get her on rerun 6.1 with spending
if no spending event
i might skip 6.0
6.0 is absolutely having spending imo
LMAO
jesus fucking christ
like HoV before SW
most player won't afford her but those who can, good QoL
good deal for avg valk
she's aimed towards mid-high spender
i dunno if i'd call her bait
that everyone was talking well off
that korean movie right
that's like
original gif of this
i need
lmfao
i might be dumb then
o i see
between those
there's no messages on arc city for me
wait who is blocked LMAO
i think i'm just petty LMAO
good
i'll save myself
lmfao i'm worried to even check maincord
cause you talk about dumb shit here
i just hang around in my channel usually
i'm not hibernating often
also thank you cherry and tet and heki and epi <:BARBARA_LOVE:708170069548597248>
i love you so much taihen <:BARBARA_LOVE:708170069548597248>
:(
you don't appreciate me
but yeah it is a bug
and unlocked it for them
i think game thought they were ahead on story progress
not even beta, it was live
i retained RL without an M piece once lmao
for most purpose
yea, i dunno if i would wishing well, TB + welt M or peary M is good enough though
oh okay
since one more stig and you would have 4/4
i dunno if wishing well was the best option
hm
lmfao
on the finisher
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
kiana cameo
second coming of mobius
my pc is not going to like that
holy fuc
no spoilers
i'm watching the reveal
is that in the reveal
HoH:E
herrscher of human:ego
she counts as the 0th herrscher
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
herrscher of human-ego
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
she's psy
thank you my love
WOOOOOO
:(
this is the best weapon effect description ever lmfao
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
abyss is fucking gone
my dream update
nvm i'm in
i still can't fucking login holy fuck
i'm fucking ready
do it mihoyo
exalted+ and give us 4 ss boss
before the changes
it used to be 3s
with 9s?
i was sleeping i think
<:Sadge:715448677162024980>
if that is already a thing that's even more infuriating lmao just make it available for normal player
i just thought they gave you a ton of old bosses in a week so you can test it out
wait is it actually? you can pick any boss?
yeah see <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
even easier would be enter a training mode and select an MA boss
i mean i'm sure they could give us a way to enter a training mode and select a disturbance
<:gaykiss:1000428892768714762>
<:peepoRiot:598608041990029313>
cause i can't fucking login
about the game
also i guess i complained too much
well i wasn't here for that, i've been asking for that since i brokethrough personally lmao
i mean sure but we've been asking for this since ssd release
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
and then enable it for us too
they should just make it so you can test any diff
the higher dist?
no one can use those refs lmfao
it's like 30 points above our rl and 30 points below our nirv
which is like extremely not useful for us rn
funny how they give us cn rl dist in beta
even if you kill faster if you don't, something something timestop
just saves points most of the time in abyss
i think you wanna kill with finisher
on beta?
what's the dist
lmao
cheapest time
that's the best time to care about ma
hey
true
wow
i don't think i have permission to share
don't share it too much
that's moriso's spreadsheet
go check
maybe tona?
on anything else
jack shit
i don't think she does
there's the sss kosma ones
i mean
<:Shrug:616394597211439118>
spa sucks
eden leader skill is pretty good
i dunno
if i pulled for v2v
so i'd be px diff'd
oh yeah apparently v2v leader skill sucks
nah this year july also counts
<:POGGIES:992227650460459078>
is that a genshin reference?
sheeeeesh i'm proud of you
what the fuck
has a wikipedia page???
that meme
what the fuck
2007
wait that's fucking
like i can has cheezburger
that's actually a descendant of 2012 cat memes
love u so much baby
<:BARBARA_LOVE:708170069548597248>
new phys support comes -> time for old one become dps
the other 6 got retired into dps
nah only the most recent phys sp
new mecha phys dps deals damage more consistently but for nirv BKE is still best if you crit bald
BKE will stay alive just through sheer force of will
yeah no she didn't get anything new, still the same valk
hey keilo wanna see gameplay of the new weather? it's bio enemies, BKE weather
PE 0 skins
eden 0 skins
pardo 7th skin by 6.5
great
so i'm doing
you know the college fucking answered my email and they said we have no answer yet you'll have to wait more
LMFAO
yeah i don't think i will skip new herrscher on patch of release
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
and then if hi4 doesn't suck i'll play that
i mean realistically i'll stay here till end of service
and then quit lmao
and then prob like surf some patches of having good setups
i'll def go for like herrscher + elf whenever that comes around
after
and i'll be living the f2p life
dw tho i'll spend it all next spending event
maybe more
i'll be at like 45k by 6.0 i think
and fuck morbmaid
i'm at 36k
LMAOOOO
i'm surprised i'm managing to save up so much
i know the life
yeah same
you have to spend less money
nini it's good for you too
please
i would love that
i mean
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
nvm they could hold off for v2
well actually
story 100% will have the reveal
sheeeesh
eh i wouldn't go for it still
lmao
and got 0 paga
i went 30 for fhd on last paga + fhd
for skemsal
i think 30 is average
i went 30 for fhd
the stigs are sad
the weapons are aight
then don't pull lmao
carole is like, new budget mech dps lmao
depending on situation
skemsal could be worth it
what
right
if i have 2s2 BKE
0 usecase for TP
there's like
soon i'll have her at 2s and then i'll forget about her
she's one of the cheap ones
i'll work on that eventually
that's a lie
i'm working on that
it's skill issue
so you're saying

honkai patch notes:
go touch grass
apoloxtal?
xtal?
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
yeah can't login here either
no issues
early on global tho
i was having issues
when i was trying to log in CN
cause i think mine might be glitching out similarly
is it forcing you to spend 15k xtal on summer skins
is it
i mean that sounds fun
and they're all so pretty besides HoV's and PI's
only dp and sn i think
i have like none of them
oh i see nvm
you get some outfit tickets i think
<a:nosekiss_hh:758188498191908864>
i don't even think you can get it by luck
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
might go for one
sheeesh 3k/6k/10k/15k for 1/2/3/4 skins
that's pretty based
<a:COGGERS:772315943254097951>

<:woggers:652740192653934633>
yae sakura from genshin impact
eh there's plenty of weirdos on college
lmao
where i went wow i wish i had aponia
in MA
there hasn't been a single week
and tbh i don't regret it one bit
i ended up not even grabbing s0
<a:ninomaenod:873903469843591178>
i'm also f2p
yeah 1.0 character still dominate the meta
LMAO
cause there's no content there
they can't shill stuff
genshin is at least less abusive
you can stay in blustorm discord
it's abusive relationship
yeah just leave the game
<:mirioThink:997517555138826362>
so i haven't eaten any yet
lucky for me i never fucking do abyss
every day before i do abyss i eat 3 of them
<a:Nod:915873106323709962>
<a:ninomaenod:873903469843591178>
see
each cup of ramen = +10 abyss score
it's what gives the gamer genes
and very bad for anyone else
M is pretty good for HB
TB is good enough
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
you don't need a 4/4 cat you need turg tet
i said either ae or cat with purana because cat with purana will be holding margrave
do you have bastet? what do you plan on using on cat?
like i'll tell you right now, an HoR with 4/4 supports will easily outdamage whatever new shiny valk with shit supports
so like pull for AE or purana and turg for HB
it's okay to go for new herrscher first, just accept that after that you're stuck going for their team for her to work
lmao cute
supports are the entire game
it's not 2019 honkai anymore
a herrscher with no team does nothing
then don't bother
and don't plan on investing on one
if you don't have a team for her
you prob shouldn't pull on herrscher just because she's a herrscher
no, ruby recommended quitting the game if herrscher was psy
oh that sounds fun
what's that
<:BARBARA_LOVE:708170069548597248>
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i remember you, i think of you every day
<:Nerdge:792504573830496306>
so
to force you to use bastet cat
they could always give the herrscher awful sp issues
hmm idk which of the 2 supports is the better one
look at phys
you think they wouldn't do it?
and the banner is bait
2nd is new herrscher is ice support
and it's a sick banner
1st is new herrscher is ice dps
there's 2 realities here
<:Deadge:958122498019434496>
it's apparently better than foca
actually imy did some math on it
<:peepoCry:598607564443353091>
fuck bke
fuck fgo
the only thing i know is that that patch looks way more bearable than what we're having right now
<:ganyuConfused:997517548448927885>
shorter patch too
will it be 6 now?
since it was 3 sss bosses per patch before
in 5.9
how many bosses are showing up even
need to prepare my DA carefully for the sss pig that doesn't exist
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i need the ss1 DA ss2 BKE
i'm locked in for this bp season though
which is f2p
only bp monthly now
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i have stopped spending
except aponia, she's at s-1
everyone else is s1+
did you know i only have nyx and aka at s0?
idgi
phys for some reason gets way less % from dorm
actually i think mine is s1, but you get the idea
so i have 3% on her and you have 4%
i have s0 HoV ofc
o yeah i have ss SN over you
i have neither
or ss TP
ss HoV?
kinda depressing, play for 2 months, farm my ass off, no progress lmfao
haven't made any upgrades
still the same as before i think
v2v shill in MA = kosma/tona or kosma/bke
we stay calm
no v2v shill in MA
no red alerts yet
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
so i can buy more newts
they should let me transform them into red reso
yeah i have SO many of those
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
to craft the second dk
i'm actually going to need more purple lens
soon
i'm getting there
i'm below you right now
i'm at 94
114 is the max
<:Shrug:616394597211439118>
but i'll get there eventually
to be realistic, i'll prob not be able to craft the second one before you get anniv
i'm missing the 2 craftable ones
what do you take me for
ofc
<:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
not if i craft the second dk before then
and god was i fucked over it lmao
for me it was zhenyi
every aspiring competitive player skips 1 sp release banner, gets fucked over it, and never skips one again
that's such a big amount uh
1.5k on honkai
speding
y-yeah imagine
no is the answer
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
pull on that
should i
can't wait
<a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
that was my favorite
5 months lmao
for like
i've been using boosters
<:BARBARA_LOVE:708170069548597248>
yikes
wth
SEA is so fucking horny
not the ones before that lmao
yeah act30
i thought she always was herrscher but just hid it
wait she wasn't herrscher before?
a lot of herrschers per square meter
ER has fucking 3 herrschers now
if you think about it
<a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753>
did i
oh
yes baby?
raven there's a herrscher here yeah no shit mei's trapped in there wtf do we do
what if HoC can't leave ER
and then she becomes good
and then HoT needs to figure out a way to bring the ER around so HoC can help out
and ER never dies
that makes more sense actually
oh i see
you lost me
...aponia?
HoC is my child, i'll not let anyone fight it
shut the fuck up take out the HoC
also dw we'll get to remember ely forever when HoC gets out of ER and becomes senti 2 as an ely lookalike
<:5Head:995381294538178560>
on what carv said, they'll always be alive if you think about it
that is true
what's that
character development
lfg
so i knew about that!!
hey this time! i read the story!
yeah i'm pretty sure we'll see them all one more time
it's either going to be like the few still alive saying goodbye or them all coming back and all saying goodbye
i'm not ready
no other option
or them coming back and then disappearing
all of them disappearing into nothingness
it's either going to be
oh god the flamechaser cg
for a whole week
at HoF
just looking
yeah i'm not joking, when i first got her i'm pretty sure i spent 30 mins daily on the valk select screen
her design, her story, everything
i love her so much
HoF is still the only character i can put on my screen and just admire
i didn't cry i was too fucking hype going LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
yeah i guess i can see it actually
honestly i disagree with that, knowing what's going to happen doesn't remove all the power of a scene, the ones that touched me the most would've done so even if i knew what was going to happen, and i know that cause i can watch it again and it still touches me
people be like i don't even know the backstory of these characters and i'm crying in the yt comments and i'm like bitch wtf are you on about
but not nearly as much as people make it out to be
like it's cool and kinda sad
hot take but the himeko one where she dies is way overrated
idr the names
well the hua one made me sad
this fucking chat goes into horny overdrive when the milf-lites are called into action
ayyyy
if you know what i mean
yeah it's pretty HoT
<a:2D_KermitDarkSideSlap:768475478398205983>
pre-HoT mei is a sub top, post-HoT mei is a dom top
mei is a sub top
not mar7th
isn't that
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
fuck
did i
oh the theory you mean
it's her passive
oh shit elysia is march 7th?
l + ratio + purple is better
can't even ask properly
cause that's purple
just not the best
like pink is pretty good don't get me wrong
based
nu is naked in portuguese
i'm specific slugs
and that's why i like purple
LMFAO
they had no other option
oh shit that explains why everyone before then had shit taste
those are like the kpop group names
it's okay to have wrong opinions, i'm proud of you being brave to share it too!
like objectively, scientists have looked into it and purple is the best
purple is the best color so you're right
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
rita lumine?
lmfao
got a 541
but the 9s person on my rl bracket on bleed mobs

carv deserves the vent channel
though i do really dislike tectone too lmao
jinjinx left yt for multiple reasons tho, not only drama
they shared revenue from both
yeah they were partners, jinjinx did yt and most of the tc, while tuner did twitch and tested rots out since he was a better player mechanically
yeah
like the girl who runs that shit was just awful to them
and they have some insane history with honey hunter
and they were monster hunter yt before
dunno if people remember jinjinx and tuner, they were like the good tc youtubers from the beginning of gensh
i guess kinda obviously
yeah, they were in monster hunter before
yeah, and not only that they have history on other communities, just a bunch of idiots
god the time where the leaks were mainly on honey hunter were the worst, i fucking hate honey hunter
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>

oh yeah bennett
yeah AE i think?
i think i remember you creating that
fuck y'all i thought my internet had died
** **
** **
not mothertongue + adhd + l + ratio
i have excuse
well that is not up to me
like, the broad strokes of it
now i even know what cez B does!
that was a few months ago
i've changed
only the raven sections
are you proud of me, i only skipped some of the story this time around
this for akayuki's pain rating compilation
since if you put any on T or B, you lose the ability to activate margrave with weapon active alone if you're not wearing fullset
and sp cost reduction is also quite finnicky, you basically only want it in the M piece
healing at least is at most useless
yeah
it has the potential to just neutralising the stig set entirely
affix makes ult and weapon active cost less sp, it doesn't alter the stig effect to activate with lower sp cost
that's not how the affix work
neko wtf are you talking about
yeah
when the narrator in specific is broken
with only narrator speaking
to make a long section of the story
very brave of mihoyo
god fuck
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
and then blink me to the end of villv patch
please 2 9 week long patches
yeah
that's a 52 second long maru fight
i'll take any copium
i'm copium connoisseur
we already have the emblem, it'd be confusing <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
i'm calling it right now, 0% chance we get paimon in honkai
we won't be getting paimon in honkai
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
sorry
hm
oh
i dunno shit about it, you know about the source and stuff
also i posted your leaks on blustorm, if you wanna answer questions about it there
disapproud
or disappointed
i dunno if i'm proud
you're spending money on your NA acc?

take the bet and immediately resign
just take the -1
though tbh i really should've
nah i suck at chess
for +-1 point on final score
play a game of chess with you
which i'm pretty sure you could get him to like
i did have one professor
holy shit lmao
that sounds right
fight me for grades
i kinda respect it
LMFAO
<:mirioThink:997517555138826362>
i just engaged with them most of the times and that was enough to get on their good side
and i complain a lot about a lot of what they teach too, if i don't agree with it or w/e
not even kiss up though cause like i'm very outspoken
damn baban xenophobia arc
because of it
i'm just nice to them and i get on their good side and i can get away with more
which doesn't mean i don't miss deadlines
i am generally a good student
that is how it works here
your teacher murders you
if you miss your homework
yes
lowkey i thought it was like a movie only thing outside of brazil either
yeah detention just isn't a thing in brazil
you have to stay longer on the call so i get to sleep more
how would detention even work on online classes anyways
imagine reading the answer to your question instead of just asking it again
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816>
<a:teripoor:838366314924867625>
wait i'm poor?
the thing you use to view what's going on the pc
if you don't do this i'm going to ask fenri >:(
lmao this is the least threatening threat i've ever heard
what? can they do that?
buy monitors idk
you can like
i assume that's a good thing right
oh sheeesh a level 1 monitoring card
to change colors
maybe ti's time
i've been blue since forever
unfortunate situation
just
i'd feel the same way about girls nudes
cause i like cock
and this isn't even like a oh it's because it's a dick
would still be awkward as fuck everytime i saw them
yeah but still
that'd be like the low point of my year
you're weird
epi
????
i made an account for nothing
well
that's boring
oh
that sounds cool
but with text and links
like i imagine it's like a drawpile
i dunno just sounded fun
for honkai
lets make one
potentially fun
that sounds
oh
is that a star wars thing?
what the fuck is a padlet
the fuck happened here
stacked lobby
nini and eli!
<a:sheCrazy:997517525170540635>
hot prob more annoying lmao
i thought it was husk huodou for some reason
wait is it HoT huodou
maybe with actual affixes you can make it survive though
it just killed itself everytime during husk
i tried qua balls
and then let them kill huodou afterwards
and i timed their ults so they're invincible during huodou ult
i ran HoT and bella and some other shit
the way i did it is really bald
dead corpse on dead corpse violence
so i dunno if it's a good comparison
to be fair that is also a wedgefull HoR
he gets 50% tdm on all valks
yeah it's fhem bonus
but she do be farmable now
ss2 HoR
fhem does it again
wait shees theres a 616 HoR ref on tona
tona kosma you're dead
like if you have no nyx no villv
there are definitely some awful ones
depending on what you don't have
if you don't have everything tho
there's not really any bad ones if you have everything
you run SW on husk
husk bke
you run spa on andrius
andrius bke
yeah
HoD has 552 ref with HoT
like even for HoD FGO
yeah tbh we don't have many 2 sss combinations right now that would be awful
and kosma is HoT boss ayyy
though tank has HoT and ely as options
tank and kosma
bke wolf would be annoying
any double same-type-of-damage
so still pretty important
HoT still gets her leader skill
even if we get triple sss boss
sss LE will always be good investment
hello
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

imagine getting the stig first

sorry i'm awful with that kind of stuff, wdym by seeding it

that's definitely psycho behaviour
i think i got mine through bp
the only weapon worth the blue reso
i think it's literally
neb is absolutely worth the 4k blue reso tho
lmao
yeah it's fine
for a2
more than they have
at this point i think i've looked at theirs stigs
yeah that's fair
wtf is going on
wait no but the aug is clearly active
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
if that's their explanation, they're running fucking non-aug core roza
it's on recommendation for MC, not FT
that's cursed knowledge
oh no
B: worse attila B
M: does nothing
to understand it
can't even begin
wow.
wow
<a:keilothebear:997517488713638048>
and i still haven't met magerylao
will be my 20th
my next nirv bracket
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
bracket lucklao
like promote with 500 score
oooh i see what you mean
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
no
yeah wouldn't surprise me
o it's a2 right
tf is that bracket
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
just climbing up the ranks
that sounds very fun
i wish i started exalted on sinful
powerful
lmao
cause it's basics
back then
but we wouldn't know how many trophies we get
yeah i was in sinful in basics
LMAOOOOO
deeznuts
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
drive
state
solid
no you don't taihen
born into RL die is fuck
lmfao
9th place
ssg babanlao
skipping years
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
so i went back
specner beat my score in abyss
lao
sheeesh
and i'm sure i'll figure it out
just need to take a tour in the depths
i dunno
i'd be at xx20
so if i got +40
i have xx80
with good enough planning
to get 420
i think you might still be able
hm
since like there's no way you're ever going to have a sane amount of trophy
yeah if it was like that i wouldn't mind it
oh that sounds kinda fun actually
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
dunno fossil stuff
no i'm baby player
what is this number dlc
i only know +0 +100 and -200
what do they mean
the numbers
if my trophy count ended in 5 forever
restart my account
i'd fucking
oh god
just need to ping pong?
how do you stay there
is there even +0
so weird
extra funny since idfk either LMAO
yeah i think that's how a3 works
i like how the convo between nini and ruby are like this
<a:2DAmongUsDance:760297678461468692>
i think i answered your last dm
did i ignore your message
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i love you more though
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
so yeah don't blame yourself
nothing wrong with that person
i've left people on read for week cause of anxiety
many reasons why they might not want to talk that is not related to you
still tho i wouldn't blame yourself over it
hmmm that's unfortunate :/
and i don't want people to see me online and think i'm ignoring them when i'm dead asleep
which is not the truth, for me i go to sleep at random times and leave my pc on and discord open
which now makes it sound this is the reason i leave myself on offline
cause there's a good chance the reason she's offline is to avoid someone that isn't you
is she not answering you or smth
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
you can just kill it immediately
if you're RL tho
<:Woggers_lum:608915988351811584>
ssg
so many kazuha cons this server
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
i remember stories about friends
yeah see
and that's why you're NA
for different region
and not realise it was different client
didn't you download the client
i also like you more than i like aether
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
i hope you like me more than someone you don't care about
more than you like aether? didn't you say you didn't care about aether?
i like aether
wow so mean!
2 people will find it useful at best
or else like
somewhat affordable
RL ref has to be like
lmao
team
ss dps
when i have 13/13
how much value is it even RL content
yeah but i also have ss0 BKE lmao
2 hours max?
just took the 825 in like
didn't try much tho
on this fight
i don't think mine ever not crit
huh
like you mean the nuke or the other one?
active?
i think i can take avg crit and kill everything anyways
i haven't had that much issue with crit on RL
cause like
are you nirv tho
gimme gimme
mainly for that extra 3% crit rate
i'm getting ss1 BKE
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
crit rate is just Like That without 3s griseo
so i'm not getting less lmao
and the 3rd is also on dante M, which i also share with FT
and i care more about her
2 of them is in ely B which i share with FT tho
is too much for BKE
which i think
3 cdmg lines tho
1409
my lobby kinda <:Wokege:945150727473471508>
when did this happen
how is everyone flirting with me now
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
the frills are nice
summer griseo is pretty cute tho
next week i'll get ss3 <:Wow:759857863848886303>
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
give free FR 6.0
i'll be done with FR by then
don't
so fucking clunky
i hate how she plays
i like her
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
don't cry sss is going to be baseline
but still
not all bars
wait no sss is only 2 bar after burst mode
that's just sss
lmao they ain't doing that
make new boss and she's set
i guess 2 bosses is enough
maybe she takes back type huodou if she's strong enough?
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
with revival dk
besides freeze huodou
would HoR even cover anything
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
sounds fun
why make old valk outdated when you can make both old and new valk required
they just make new bosses for the new valk and force nirv player to pull everything
can't kill a corpse
nyx was already dead lmfao
mihoyo 2022 doesn't kill old valks
also sw won't be killed
just wait for next one
if you want new shiny lightning valk
like for mooost player, you never backpull
i wouldn't pull for her now
but i think for most player
depends on your situation
nah aponia is very different from vill-v and sw
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i don't wanna update the banner image again
mihoyo pls stop announcing banner slightly after another
god
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
though i guess you don't need to proc the secondary colors
to proc the secondary colors
since you want blue/yellow/red for it
then you want blue
if you're going stars2
lmao
<:sex:998637653585055835>
sheeeesh
oh i can see that
v pretty
it's aster's drawing i think
thank u carl
i was about to bonk you
i thought this was genshin leaks LMAO
i mean i can't imagine masters sinful will be hard
wtf
i swear the bosses are more paper than MA bosses
with qmani
also yeah idfk what went over their minds
25-55 basics
56-69 elites
70-80 masters
81-88 exalted
it's level bracket
i wouldn't craft kafka nowadays
then yeah go for dirac
if that's their only team
hmm
nice
ely bow is a sick pull
honestly
lmfao
that is what i said yes
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
really good already
it's like
and then like dirac BKE or kafka TM ely B
ideally they'd get griseo gear
then run like gpn eventually on HoS
get neb through dorm exchange for HoS
BKE with AF and an HoS can prob get a lot done
that's not bad
oh shit
<a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
with the xp changes
lmao
2 weeks
nowadays that's like
prob won't last long LMAO
and they're bored with the valks they have
but if they're just starting
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
already too late to roll for HoS
def wouldn't go over that
yeah idk it's not thaaaaat bad, if only for first card is prob alright
but then again you have so fucking much to farm for as a new player
prob not if you're not a new player
i do think getting a card is prob worth it
i'm interested
dan heng?
whos this furry
that's kinda metal i vibe with it
gsr stickers
do we want
sora will prob check it out there later
send message over at <#994536652993200138>

i dunno if the cut message is more explicit than the original one
jesus LMAO
fucking ass out on the skins over at w/e game is that
sorry had a weird few days, now i have time for it
all skill issue
but mine will be
neither is mine
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>

i've never seen that before
lmfao

<:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930>
there u are
that looks comfy actually
velskud did the double 946
<:Sadge:715448677162024980>
next patch we'll have normal lite clearing ss boss tho for sss boss
neither does normal lite
lmao
summer lite doesn't clear ss
wtf is updating in this game
since no one is going to bald SS FGO LMAO
i'll guess probably
i wonder if i'm still t1
the 66666lao
i can look it up if you want me to
yeah i dunno if i can help i'm awful with that kind of stuff
that's nice to hear i think!
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
the cat game??
what game?
i'm not great at hardware stuff
lfg
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i'm not using mine either way
+give kazuha
<:whalepat_hh:710738275845013576>
than the rest
one of these is way easier
something tells me
mine's about to lmao
<:shrug:877047647511384064>
can't be asked to do them LMAO
i'll only do achievement commissions
i think if i'm coming back to genshin
dunno how fun it'll be
but lv90 is a lot more expensive
and i did it
yeah i was putting everyone at lv70 asc5 before i quit
i wonder how expensive that'd be
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
is putting all my characters to lv90
i guess the last thing that i have to spend resin on
when the program can think for you
why think
whenever i decide to optimise my artifacts i'll just check which is better
i have a lv90 HoD
i'm running spindle rn
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
the character that's being replaced by yelan on my hu tao team as soon as she reruns
albedo
game wants me to stay
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
because like going from 5% -> 10% cdmg and going from 330% -> 335% cdmg has wildly different value
and that supports also give
would need to add up all other crit damage on kit
only the crit damage from affixes isn't enough to tell
that's cool
oh sheesh dates
but i could calculate which is better
second imo
those are random vegetables i think
<a:aheresWorry:901829819770232832>
there u go there's the homu doll
sheesh did it
<:Deadge:958122498019434496>
i dunno how to copy gifs lmao
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
dawei hillichurl has a homu plushie
like, one story affecting the other
there will be direct connection to hi3 and genshin
but i really really doubt
there u go
can she age?
and now i'm <:Wokege:945150727473471508>
also i heard someone say they believe alice is genshin elysia
but i really really doubt the griseo we see on genshin will be hi3 griseo
i mean i doubt we won't see griseo on genshin
she's dead, accept it
but that's cope
the long answer is we lost contact with the ark so she could still be alive out there
the short answer is yes

honkai battle chronicles has been a thing
nini
this is the kind of trans character writing that you'd see in 2012 and then look back on it now and go huh... yikes
here is my 13 step plan on how we can get apho mc into the main game:
trans adam headcannon
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
too much anime
why are you surprised
you're the one who kissed me
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i feel ya, that's awful
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
first 1500 valk
i think you should feel happy about that
aw i mean you shouldn't feel bad
i'd try that
yeah if u have ely
ooh ely is a smart choice
HoT?
what u running
sheeeeesh
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
don't fucking woggers that
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>

gib coin?
oke
<@704867526877904908> come do your UM
is this the 401k i keep hearing about
keilo misinfo
oh wait she does
lmao
on evade
it is what i did
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
the fucking 5.0 bp changes lmao
it was 4 before the bp changes
5/14/16
kinda surreal to ult with HoT and not have no buffs afterwards LMAO
what options do you have
i'm on stream doing abyss -> genshin abyss
yeah
jst TM cez B
perfect for her
pardo is the one who holds jst
but if i didn't, i'd prob be using 2 jst this week
from BKE
cause i was scared of locking important elemental stuff
yeah, i decided to run phys on hepha
LMAO
twice
which is to say
already
more than once
i've used my dupe jst
LMAO
3k passes
then you must have fucking
i just barely got 2nd jst set done before handel released
i was finishing up 2nd jst set
i didn't farm beforehand
ye
and i got 2 guns lmao
i did 20 pulls on eden banner
i'm doing my best i swear
i do have slug tho
LMAO
alright i'm running FR
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
2/3rd of the way to farming last handel piece
i'm like
<:COPIUM:996309513328140319>
i can run bella HoT and margrave eden right
so....
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
sleep well
bye eli
but it sucks to play
and nice that it's cheap
like it's cool that it exists
i hate turg cat
i can change the crit rate for something you feel more adequate though so you can check out how much better it is on avg
if we don't assume all cdmg buffs are fully stacked then the cdmg affix is even better, since cdmg would be less diluted
better image there sorry
though the second one is better for the atk affix
and also assuming all the crit damage buffs are fully stacked
<@416445660443967491> assuming 100% crit rate, keeping the affix is .3% better
LMAO
skill
fuck NS
HoS just has a
wtf
max value of this
can you tell me
i mean on effect, not affix
is on T, right?
the only crit dmg on kafka
sorry i'm doing very numbers
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816>
oh
what gear they using
what team do you run her with usually
but on other valks, not worth it
on TP yea you are
<:Deadge:958122498019434496>
issue is you have to run kafka B
yes
and on the team she's at, what valks you're running with what gear
what stigs she using and send me this but of TP's
i need info on your TP then
which was better
do you want me to calc
though depending on level on investment you might not need AE on those elemental teams
yeah you use it on phys on HoS, and then you can use it on AE on every elemental team
that it just ends up being worth it
or was, before cat
it's on like literally every comp
because even if it's quite small increase in performance
that is top 1 priority
but dalao player say complete opposite
yeah, is what low level common player says and usually listens
for u
affix calculator

<@416445660443967491>
so cosmic pri, cat pri are prob the top 2 pris people would say to max
so it's really good, if that makes sense
but it's improvement for every comp
not necessarily because it's best improvement
but yeah, most dalao player put very flexible pri arms on very top of prio list to max
more like she's great on multiple teams but rarely BiS, similar what AE was before cat
if you're budget player, you're prob using her as a support on multiple teams
since it's very flexible
it's not a bad pri to max early
though both are A-ranks on the comparison so doesn't matter
SSS A-rank usually has similar atk to s0 S-rank
depends
but keep
there's a calculator somewhere
keep
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
LMAO
same
exactly
so you might have an easier time on t2%
people will try a lot less
after double SSS bosses
eh i do think
for avg player
dupe cez B is good but prob not worth 30 pulls
then yeah i think i'd just wait for wishing well
oh
i would pull until you get weapon
i'm on his mind <:Wokege:945150727473471508>
is what baban has
MMBB
shui zither and another 2 DA stamps
<#963280001900376064>
yeah
and it took a while for me to remember she was on dorm
the other was someone earlier in the week saying they got HoT
you're actually the second person this week that made me do a double take and ask myself where the fuck did you even pull that from
congratz though
it's different from awakened and non awakened
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
LMAO
then i'm glad i used my dawei card
if i'm following taihen's footsteps
o in that case
if it was like his then i'm okay with it
o yeah i didn't see his pulls for skin
LMAO
call me outlier cause jesus
and then 2 for skin
then all 16 for third round
then 2 for second round
i did all 16 for first round
i literally went ping pong
nvm i'm not salty anymore
great start
issok <a:huggies:865273755152678972>
9:30 am is still quite early

if anything is specifically making you uncomfortable just lmk
you're very smort

if you think some terms are confusing
i can work on making the discussion more accessible
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>

it balances it out
well i'm there and i'm stupid

jesus
like 20 mins before the banner opened lmao
i went to take a nap
no actually
sheeeesh
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
better than a special person
that is
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
close enough, he's a very sweet baby boy and i love him so much
is based on positioning
my bf
evn do you know
don't let him get away with it
i'm pretty sure heki is looking for excuses to not go to sleep
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
o
or just wait for wishing well
can either go for one more stig and then hold 2 B and go for wishing well when it reruns
those are fine pulls tho
cez?
on what
LMAO
in predicting future releases
very wrong
i am consistently
but just to say, this is my own personal reasoning for why i think 6.0 is unlikely to be herrscher
dunno, feel like that would just go too near a better valk
so if they tried to do some big thing for 6.1, like a big new valk
eh i mean i dunno, it's not only about making more money, i really doubt they can make a release look more enticing than a herrscher
you wouldn't understand
and now i need a place to be emo
i switched back into normal era on blustorm
because blog is very happy
i traded off
yeah imo
even for mihoyo
is just too much
since 6.0 herrscher into 6.1 anniv
which is why i'm lowkey thinking that 6.0 won't be herrscher
yeah
6.1 is cn anniv
personally i think there's a good chance we see new herrscher on 6.0 or 6.1
we don't know yet
LMAO
wait for a new ice dps and roll for her
yeah no don't invest in meme
but
than 200 bucks
more
way
way
not whale shaming, i def spent way
didn't you spend money for HoS too
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
heki is like i made awful decisions and only had to get lucky and spend money for them to be worth it, you should do it like me!
scores go 733 786 840 893 946
it's 786
let's fucking go
one for each hand
it 946s
on hepha
on FT KMB CH or SI CH FT team
it's for CH
heki <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i understand

yeah going all in on an ice team is prob not a bad option, can roll for turg once it reruns
good job <a:pat:969402615538520064>
these give AE imaginon
you def don't need another LMAO
but that's only one
wait no i guess you need one if you run handel HoT margrave eden
let alone two
you don't need one margrave this week
tf does that mean
lmao
unhinged take
cause then you'll complain none of them work
don't go half investing in 5 different teams
you should pick a team and complete it
then don't go for it
but if you aren't
yeah it's good value and most people are looking to build one
i dunno if i'd roll on griseo gear if you don't plan on building a phys team
and also
i wouldn't invest on her if you don't have hekate
she's willpower valk
i mean knowing you heki i wouldn't be surprised if you rolled for her
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
heki making heki choices
after they made it farmable
people can farm it
and i went sheeeesh
was like on 4.6
and then i bought kafka TM from bp
kafka b
i think one of my first gacha stig pieces was
<a:peepoLeave:646986909381558273>
oh it's pgr talk
hannah?

<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
20 + 20 on both paladin + 40 from stamps
you can ss
if you already have her
LMAO
i was getting DA leader skill from having PE at ss
while most players were getting PE leader skill from having DA at s3/ss
PE is DA awk
or 0 if you end up not using a combo atk for that rot
meanwhile you only get one activation for cez
so you get 2 newt activations on a rot
can can reapply it off-field
for general abyss purposes, newt should be better
and also, the paralyse thing for the mob is not required either, it's just like if you paralyse it, it self destructs, and then you don't need to kill it
for BKE herself you don't need any special valk
is for the mob before BKE
the paralyse thing here
in other news i need 3.6k ER coin to buy out the HoT stamps on 5.9 <:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
and only go for more once she's farmable or smth and i can raise her to 3s
i think i'll just keep my HoT at ss1 for the forseeable future
hmmm it's ok i think
for that
needed
9s teams is kinda
i mean she was top 1 MA
so she also wouldn't know about rankup breakpoints in terms of scores
and also, she was a 9s leviathan, she had like 3 zhenyi sets on release
she doesn't really talk w/ other about meta and stuff
like the way she learnt stuff was just going in training mode and testing stuff out to understand what and how stuff worked
she was t1 MA on her prime time
oh she absolutely is
she has p much all intuition knowledge and no formal knowledge
celine is both long retired + she plays on a completely different way, she doesn't know much about technical information
issok, celine is definitely not a better ask though
oh the choice is between
ss1 BKE ss2 DA - or - ss2 BKE ss1 DA
i just wanna know if it's worth overdumping frags on her
because idc about price
in any way
is it going to affect my scores
by worth it mean
it doesn't look very good
yea
do you know if ss2 HoT is any worth it
you as a mei simp
~~is also cheaper to me~~
since she's used way more
prob BKE right
the other would stay at ss1
which would y'all prefer
hmmm between ss2 DA and ss2 BKE
besides 7tr
since i don't need literally anything from the banner
yeah it's just too much high value for me not to use it
i have a different banner LMAO
<a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
you are doing god's work by increasing avg to pull for 7tr
jesus
unfortunate
<a:NOOO:994821180672450642>
that doesn't make sense, i'm not even pulling LMAO
thunderclap is what i'm doing to this banner <a:claphic:970643150001553439>
back to a3 i go

<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>

you're gonna fill xp bar after reaching 30 right
where honkai new players go up by 300%
this is the time
oh
the special card skill
i think that's

and then i rolled for ss cause i thought it would make a bicc difference
the only thing i tried with S griseo was sss HoD
is it that bad?
oh
on fucking who lmao
time to save
70k asterite
and then a time capsule shows up with only stigs i don't have LMAO
i'm like okay i've been playing for 1 1/2 year, i must be almost done

<:RaidenSheesh:880900512084541533>
but if you don't care much about MA you can prob go for those stigs, dunno if the tesla T should be your highest prio
and then using another 2 on the SS boss isn't uncommon
cause there are some SSS bosses where you use newt
hmm i do feel like if you wanna be competitive in MA, you'll still need 3 newts some weeks
thank you for your hard work bruh
oh i see so there's a way to fix
play muted
i uh
i'm going to actually read ch30 story
i'm not going to skip story
in my life

i mean ofc but when you get piece before pity, even if it's a dupe (+ it's the only good one) you can't complain
it's implied
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816>
wth
\> gets a stig on 10 pulls, 20 before pity
\> gets the only dupe that is useful
\> still complains
epi you literally can't complain
and which mods to pick
by having a thorough discussion of ER
lmao i wanna annoy them now
also we'll still have 1 SS boss <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
since on 9s strat it's used on HoD, it'll trickle down to normal people strats once powercreep goes <:Stonks:668331960430493696>
very nichely
will prob still find use on SSS boss
<a:peepoLeave:646986909381558273>

but i like it
why my name is gay girl bees
i actually forgot
<:Sadge:715448677162024980>
still too long
but not i wanted it to be like that cause i thought it would be funny if i did it slightly wrong
since it was too long
oh i wasn't able to change it
i wanted to name myself Extremely gay girl bees [they/them]
LMAO
getting banned for actual good reasons
heki is going to be the first person in wfp
i'm starting to think
over the hedge
heki racist arc
hmmm i don't like this
well you're special
i'm surprised everyone here has their dev options turned on lmao
oh shit he's reading out the barcode
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
and then get lucky and kill it afterwards
my strat was just use HoT and bella invincibility during ult to not get hit by huodou
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604> yeah i think she carried me
f50 was the only abyss floor i didn't do auto
.
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
you gotta time your abilities so they don't hit nothing
yeah
so it can get executed
scoots to HoT
it just like
i fucking know right
quick <@416445660443967491> tell us before u forget too
i just remember it was easy
and then 50 is kinda awful
yeah 49 feels like they're giving us one for free
sometimes shit just happens lmao
yeah that's how it works kind of in this event in general
this but u can run cat instead of BD
should be this
for u to copy boo
sheeesh
and i might've gotten lucky?
i ran spooder instead of shepherd
oh wait no i remember
oh okay
what's floor 48
but yeah it'll depend on what boo has, i think he has everything there tho
thank u carl
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
<:safe_hh:710968174887305311>
so you're safe
u have lite tho no?
i ran like bke heim hepha snow hunter and shepherd i think
oh 48 is the 3 HoS one?
<:miriothink:959328310033252432>
get only the outfit
don't pull mobius <:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
what's 48 again
done for now, i was the 42nd person on global to do it
<a:swipeboobahic:940613030968963122>
can't use HoS
everyone else is fucking shit lmao
cause she in specific is very good
is a blessing and a curse
so they're invincible during huodou ult
basically the strat is just time the ult on HoT and bella
if anyone wanna copy the team
got it
i just can't take screenshots of this event i guess
oh where the fuck is the hp bar
almost...
i don't think you can farm 20 sp before he nukes
you need more though
jesus
on f50
kill itself
my boat puller loves to fucking
and then i just reset until raven magically not died
BKE had the reflect affix
.
oh yeah quantum balls!
so mean again
oh god floor 50
nah the only thing she unlocks at SSS is a healing skill lmao
and tbf i dunno shit about PI but i think she needs SS for turg holder? which is all she does
from SS
DP gets nothing out of SSS
out of these, DK is the only one with slight meta usage
only 2 more
climbing the ranks
so i'll take it
raven just survived for some reason
nvm i did it
if that cheese strat is the only way, then i just got luck locked lmao
and it's not enough to kill
and only got 1 damage reflect
cause i used all my affix mats
do you think this is the only way to beat
hmm
<a:Hugs:598593305898385418>
wait i know what might fix it
i'm using discordsrv, dynmap and skinsrestorer for plugins
oh shit that's a thing isn't it
these abyss floors feel like mihoyo fucking with us
and kills you in one ult
a huodou that starts with full sp
LMAO floor 45 is very funny
i think that was floor 42?
that one was for the HoT bella floor
i keep changing it
she and BKE are my current wow they're a lot stronger than i thought units
self heal too
spooder kinda stronk
i tried to take a screenshot of my abyss
skill issue
shit
lmao i'm doing my best okay
<@309634550273933314> are you proud of me
need new cat
old cat not pretty enough anymore
get on with the times aoi
new cat skin is bchip
old cat skin was spending event
yeah
<a:nosekiss_hh:758188498191908864>
i use it often
a friend of mine calls it keilothebear LMAO
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
i am pleb
you'll get there don't worry
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
he is v much optimised to make us angry
i'm here for this aster arc
<:worryGibCurry:433117130339123200>
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
issok
i do
just give her hekate
to be clear though, for less than nirv retain you'll be able to survive with s griseo
smort
they force her at SS
and then second boss, where she is now achievable by non-rollers at S already
first boss forces people to get griseo before she's farmable
actually insane from mihoyo
yeah HoS is basically forcing people to go SS griseo huh
trust
issok there's place for 2 at the top
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
imagine working there
i feel so fucking bad for them
LMAO
<a:PatPat:814547161878364190>
good job nini
oh oke!
cute valk :D
lemme look at the rot?
the even that is
yeah that's why i'm not balding rn
and they really like mining
the youtuber thought the acc would be banned in 1 hour but no one can start streaming until this guy stops
this is how the stream looks like
i just wanted to share
and someone is mining in runescape for 6 hours straight while playing techno music
my favorite youtuber is making an experiment where she created a twitch account and made the stream key public so anyone can stream on it
thank you
<:wavekawaii:590500669119660053> hi magery
so i can send it to magery and go
me and magery on same score
can you print
oh wait
i think i shouldn't it wasn't that hard
i don't know if i should be proud of it or not
did you see my HoD score
hey
LMAO
i think i hate myself
aw <a:peepoBlushSHAKE:827795801065127949>
what
schrodingers victim
LMAO exactly
indistinguishable from parody
it's literally sucks to you but that's god plan lmao
it's fucking disgusting
oh yeah i fucking heard about that one
they are astoundingly stupid though
well, to tell the truth, the thing is that they don't care about changing stuff. for people like them (conservatives), a problem isn't solved if it isn't erased from existence(all those countries with ban on guns still have gun deaths), and then the point isn't to solve the problem, it's just to react to it. a person gets a baby aborted = they shall be punished, someone dies of a shooting = we shall pray for them. when any problem is unsolvable (in their eyes), then that's the best one can do
lmao
i wish i had the level of dissociation these guys have
literally abortion is murder but killing women isn't
i saw someone saying we should give death penalty to people who abort babies
so i'll subscribe for one more lmao
but now it's too late
i didn't want to sub to too many honkai yt cause when i quit it'd be very annoying
oh that's nice to hear
who dat
oh sheeesh
they're like oh i dunno it just feels wrong
dw not even the pro life peeps know if you push them about it
they're pretty phase shifters
they're from befall stages
<@218762069338619906> found someone worse than you
what smell reminds you of me?
to say otherwise
we don't have any other mod here
he's a mod
is fenri's rule
sorry i won't be affectionate anymore...
that's what i was going to say!!!!
you know what else can be good
p-prepared for 7tr
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
not thrash me
you're supposed to invigorate me
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
brazil fucks me up
what's that supposed to mean
remember to drink a fuckton of water
<:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
but even here we don't go much over that
i live in a very hot city in brazil
jesus
oh those look nice
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
MA buns?
so cool so pretty
look at the pretty rank up
yeah uh
i can quit after that
forever
and i'm done
and after that only 4 more meme ones, bri pri pri, SN scythe, 11th and positrons
ely bow is going to be my literal last pri lmao
ely bow and 7tr
i only wanna craft 2 more pris
kinda crazy how close to catch up i am
but i have 22 dupe weapons i can get rid of, so i just need to scrounge up the asterite lmao
missing 100 torus and 12 metal
almost
yeah i mean i have the mats
15 maxed and 5 unmaxed
i have literally everything besides aponia
yeah
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
i wish
so now i'll save coins for 7tr since it's coming soon
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
today's my day huh
lmao
yes - child kidnapper
impressive
you got a bingo and still missed
.
wow
too smort
<:miriothink:959328310033252432>
i also need torus
:notstonks:
my vocab for everything else goes
i can really easily talk about honkai meta
yeah it does become a problem eventually
because kanji pronunciation is based on context, and that's like baseline first thing you learn about kanji lmao
i mean the kanji's position doesn't affect the pronunciation -> that makes sense is just wrong tho
bullying
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
i always have the ref searcher on hand lmao
i think
识之律者
<a:ratJAM:916117648918585364>
glad i didn't even touch her lmao
yeah i remember that from last time
oh i see
and now sushang is?
i swear last husk wasn't this competitive
tfs wrong with this sushang
but then i picked 2 HoS by accident
i wanted one of each
i'm collecting these now
owo enlarge
this?
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
3 free cubes i could get
also not done with the apho2 one either
i procrastinate forever
if game doesn't give time constraint
i should do ruins more often
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
lmao
this patch
mihoyo gave us 1k stamina
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i can go again tho
i just did it with gresham before this one
i'll give you an ely elf
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
i always do the one to the right of me btw
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
3 herrscher team pog
and me!
oh
oh
<@416445660443967491> what did you use on sidestage again
SP i think?
eli used
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
<@370438895965306882> want in the dk raid?
:D
dk raids? :D
i have the M
the game fucking knows
from dorm
fucking schro T
what my first gacha piece of equipment in the game was
did i tell y'all
sheeeeeeeeesh
sheeesh
it's event t100
i mean the placement only matters if you want it to matter
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
it's insane lmao
is SO fucking bald
my trademarked strat
yeah exactly
so i'm not even trying
instead of on affixes
i'm using all my mats on unlocking characters
nah
i bald for the non-abyss one
even in fucking event
so down bad for MA
god i am like
on day 1
lmao
i stopped on floor 4
that's abyss?
i think
besides aponia
and that's the only thing that can even get a good score
my FR sucks
and sleep
i think i'll just take the 18k
tbh i don't think i even want to try myriad
:D
but ty
i am not retaining
else i'll forget
i do but i wanna do abyss first
she throws her shield lmao
where i did PE normal attacks
this is the first time in all of my honkai playtime
also
i need em D:
wtf
lmao
but you could say that
you'd be wrong
you could say that
i'm clearing an abyss stage
shit gimme a sec
i do <:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
anyone wants to do raids
it's only to make it easier
there's no shame in playing on lower speed, nor no honour on playing on higher
only go up if it helps you though
yeah that makes sense
i guess that's necessary because of the limitations though
a lot more snakey
it's interesting the different patterns that come up
oh okay
is that supposed to played in actual dancepads
i <:deadge:933767520085770341>
but even without, if i try to go slower even on easier maps
i mean yeah ofc
no actually
but yeah it's funny, a lot of people would think faster note speed would be harder, but the truth is slower note speed is waaaay harder
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
as a top 5k player
but i'm just talking about my mania experience
it's project sekai i think
yeah faster is p much always better if you get used to it
personally i can't do hard maps without fast note speed
i hope it's helping her, i suggested to her going up slowly
that's cool
oh is citrine up to 9.2 now?
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670> don't ghost ping me it makes me sad
oh i see
:(
i got ghost pinged
is tough boss
you don't have pri either
last time it was there
in RL my HoT team only got like 600 i think
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
are you RL?
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
me too
nah, in RL/a3? that team can still do a lot
wait that's def snipe tho
people really underestimate how slacc/bad NA player is
lmao
and then taihen did the different quotes
at random
i modified the code a bit to allow multiple different quotes
no it's just a plugin
i'm going to be on stream building robots if anyone needs me
it's very fun actually
do people wanna watch me build a robot
so you won't see their names
eh v little of actual top players bald event
i'm so fucking proud
event bald
y'all are fucking
DA time?
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
no aponia
oh i have the gear issue too
small break
i'm sad about honkai
no
<@524782681389793280>
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
2. pause game before fischl qte so sp pack can drop
1. hit weak spot
the only 2 things you have to do is
is it inconsistent?
...balding?
are we playing tower of fantasy?
for sp gen on AE
you also can try cf on fish
but that doesn't sound good
you could try
idt
but you can't bald for 20% tdm taken on lightning teams
since you can bald for crits on phys
i mean meta-wise, you go eden
if you had sss eden tho, it's sss eden always
but normally you'd rather use AE probably
for the paralyse
i think on this occasion eden is prob better
hmmm
i dunno scores lmao
probably
yeah p good i think
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
since only ss
not that i'm using her either way
my handel also lv35
yeah that's what i mean
handel i mean
eden still has team buffs i think
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
oh god that eden setup
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
now do mine
So dalao!
<:PogU:465017582249050112>
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
for 7tr
need to save phase shifters
short lived
there goes my hopes of pbing this week lmao
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
i accidentally locked both of my mei m on the same boss
but i don't personally know anyone who has old beach skins in global
has the mei bikini
the sea blustorm leader
and forgot to login in a day
and i nolifed that for like a week and a half
and it was early this year when runescape made new event
since i started my acc
i missed 1 day
and then came back on march
but i gave up at level like 15
i do have a 2020 acc, i started playing on DA patch
not 2020 player
i started march 2021 tho
i'm shit at the game lmao
3 pcs? i only have mine unfortunately
i'll prayge for weapon
oh wait sheeesh
2p is 2p
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
like a month older
:O
what you're older than me
not even close bby
sorry for y'all in the us
4th of july sounds awful
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
all very pretty
all with skins
and it'll be like HoS IO raven
coming here like why is my team not retaining a3 guys
you'll see me in like 6 months
i'm either quitting or becoming giga casual player
sheeesh
sorry that joke is just always funny to me
wait you play the game?
1 boss = good enough for me
yeah i needed it for rimestar
i don't regret it
what?
<:Shrug:616394597211439118>
i thought you were talking about me lmao
11th is even better at farming sp than neb, though it needs field time
lmao
she'd use 11th
if HoS could use 11th
tbh
different times before HoS
and you needed the ult for the impair + gather
11th gave her nuts sp gen
CH had no sp gen
and max based on flexibility
now you p much just craft the ones you have
eh just don't work that way anymore
<a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
:D
new seele new name!
but like name change
yeah
actually i do have a theory that seele will be herrscher of life
HoD staring at you
she no hoe
wow more respect!!!
mihoyo devs went to look at fc rankings and they gone ooo higher number = stronger, let's make cat and griseo broken
not with that attitude
and the NS is still good too, just you don't use NS much anymore
the cross drop is still useful actually
SR?
is that mihoyo does like 1 HoF boss every 5 patches lmao
problem with HoF
nvm i might rethink that
oh shit i forgot about SpA
well i guess it really depends on how you measure it
as the worst element
really? i would maybe put fire up
lmao local baban studies 2019 meta
that makes sense tbh
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
carv always on our minds
and i wrote carv lmao
i meant to write carole lmao
i have brain damage
wait
carv lmao
does it only show up on the left?
looking for ely first door?
wtf are they doing lmao
but she's v good at being v cheap
she's not best at anything
cat is great cheap ice dps
i think they're on moriso server actually
i could send this video to them
i wonder if i have nyll somewhere
since you wanna catch ignite debuffs
nah i think on HoF you do that either way against AKA
where they just give an old MA week with old valks and gear
i always say this, it would be unironically sick if any game had a throwback event
argent knight boss guide nyll please
LMAO
right after all the good banners had already finished
i started on the last 2 weeks of 4.6
i'm not dumb
see
i was being gaslit!!!
LMAO
is that all bio valks?
full creature team?
wish i played that well
sheeesh
okay lemme watch
i dunno how to search for it lmao
i'll take your word for it carv
i got bored of looking through old refs trying to look for those balls at the bottom
<:PogU:465017582249050112>
trust
and i'll do it
5.9 i'll retire and craft dumb pris
isn't the last missile stacking valk BN?
but i never seen it as those balls
i mean i know what that thing is
and i have no recollection
i started 4.6
i'm going to check it out
no way that's a thing
not in masters
not when i started
wtf is those balls at the bottom lmao
imagine if i lose out on 100 damage
i'm glad to know that
the damage without TF is 409, with TF is 511
god that looks so good
look at that kallen kill!!!!
it looks so cool
i wish it was still a thing so bad
so fun
missile stacking looks
yeah just going to research old MA
how does that even work lmao
wtf was the meta back then
CH can be replaced by VE for even better scores
lmao
this is not the f2p run
somehow
new strats waow
waow
UR too strong
is this 2019 valk drama
wait nvm i'm interested
holy shit
lmao
before gameplay
jesus 9 minutes of guides
can't wait
12 ways to kill?
o waow
rpc 6626 according to google
and then some numbers
rpc
also week 5 you just do the 893 with HoF on assaka for s0 player
so you can also save HoT for kasumi if you want
on rimestar
HoF SR SpA can 733 too
HoT dps
but yeah
is karoto so 9s
i think 7tr enables a new rime strat or smth
it's HoF dps on kasumi and HoT dps on rimestar i think
yeah
lmao
after the shit they've done to her
you really think mihoyo would give a respectful death for nyx
bleed mobs is BKE?
yeah
on assaka
there's an 893 strat with LE FR Aponia
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
she gets 0 score
does look fun potentially though
that is not a lot of gameplay
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
i'll be getting out unscathed
i'll be using my dawei card on 7tr
still really interested in seeing zzz gameplay
aw
i wanna see that
oh gameplay?
i am getting contradicting info
what news did we get
sheeesh
after the first teaser
did we get any news at all
don't even think that would buff nyx that much
since they got cat which already has cd red
the one who needs it the least is ice probably
tbh of all teams
or reduction
reset?
like unreasonably surprised
if it's ice elf with no switch cd
i would be v surprised
p respectable
from cap
that's -3
is not that low
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
seemingly at random
but small adjustments in positioning change her attack
if you do same inputs, she does the same thing
well consistent
i did learn it's consistent
HoV things
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
yeah you could use slug SR
oh i see
aren't you using avo SpA
i for one am guessing  we'll be getting dante columbus
but we don't know about 6.0 and 6.1 gear
6.0 will be BKE card + stamps
i said before you and i was right!!! :D
5.9 is SA gear
5.8 is da card + stamps + da gear
is it because she stole mei's herrscher core at that point?
i have no fucking clue why
she is immune to lightning damage, yes
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
teleports everywhere
or she does some dumb bullshit
since HoV you wanna kill asap
between the 2 i'd use the scuffier setup on homu
oh oke
SA?
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
me too
i read HoV
skill issue
that makes sense
oh wait
how
in one of them
you can use cat instead of BD
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
but i'm guessing you prob rather save the HoF for homu
that's actually better
then you use HoF as sp bank on HoV
if you were to use IO on homu
that's interesting
24 mins and onyl 2 0s
oh wow
with HoF cat BD
there's an 840 on homu
and then some LE SNS IO
80% FT CH BB
they're like
i can barely find homu refs tbh
than on tona
people slacced more in dxy and doom
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
i am proud
t2% in exalted is not easy
good job carv
<:PogU:465017582249050112>
and i'll never learn phoenix lmao
kinda sad that i'll never do SS BKE
i thought BKE was easy 946
or is it? maybe it's not that flex
that's a flex strat lmao
i don't think it's that
oh
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
she and aponia are only 2 valks i don't have
but idr when or why
where DB saw use
one MA week
there was actually
<:Sadge:715448677162024980>
yeah
but now you can just SSS HoR instead
and it was to SSS her so you can have SSS leader skill on HoR
but it got killed now that HoR is farmable
yeah, DB had a v small niche
so you're not investing in bad stuff, just doing weird order of investment
since a good amount of them have good dorm bonuses
is not even a bad investment
i mean depending on the valks
nothing personnel kid
:carvintime:
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
since you're not MA player yet
that instinct clearly isn't strong enough
then you have to decide for yourself
so if you're picking anything else, it's for non-meta reasons
for meta reasons, you always go for affix mats
what matters is the flex we made along the way
that makes sense
oh oke
i've been picking raven since she's my only sss so i didn't bother to look into it
wait i wonder which gets you more witch orbs
lfg affix mats
lmao jesus RL getting competitive <:tericrosshic:640175520146784287>
jizo people were sleeping until last day lmao
people like this cycle
wow
going oh yeah for griseo
multiple times
i have picked elemental dmg and elemental breach signets
that for some reason you keep thinking griseo is a fire valk
carv was it you that said
and i'll stay that way
i am so very out of it about genshin
i am extremely out of the loop and i will stay that way willingly
there's been a lot of discussion already at <#976184454949240872>
is fruit, i eat it like apples
ssg catastplao
<a:AmphWave:872205358838460507>
on it chief
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
i was just going to say hi
<@370438895965306882> you there?
do people like this cycle
mine kinda awake too actually hmm
def not
3s nyx lmao
yeah it's not
wait is shubs morbin iriya? lmao
see nini got all the ones who wake up early
you severely overestimate the nirvana population
ssg elilao
t1
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
so proud
sheeesh!!
it's a sign
literally wake up to this message
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
you gotta squeeze out every position on your flex
you say i'm t8
when you're t8, you don't say i'm t10
baban i need to teach you a lesson
you're fucking 8th?
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>

SA > HoS confirmed
but that would only make you want to be horny in there
i was going to say i would punish you if you were horny in there
yes but no horny
i'm vice i will mute you
is wholesome place
but you can't be horny on that discord
you can try
i went to look for the team to join and help
waow so many yes
wait you're global NA right
did you get someone
i am t100 player i can help
if you need any help <@482139585355448333>
new cadet just dropped
oh let's fucking go
your id so much higher than mine
oh wow the influx of players
v easy to retain
i feel like global NA nirv will be like
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
whats your id
<a:pepeMeltdown:933941237021569035>
<:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
and i missed it
did you send friend request?
same
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
then we could hold hands back to RL
oh i wish we were in the same lobby
they still don't know how to balance it lmao
but no
and you'd think they learnt from past mistakes
since first inception of affix system on hi3
fucking 5 years passed
i think it's funny how
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
don't just go spending without knowing how much you'll gain from that spending
do the calcs on how many pulls that would get you by the end of the banner
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
but like
and you already have SA or carole geared
and then you can't afford to pull there at all
maybe if you have literally 0 xtal
but yeah you gotta have a fucking weird ass account for griseo gear not to be a good investment for you
i'm proud
good job
oh yeah i saw that, you were t1 sim battle
you can prob live without if you're not aiming for nirv
so
if you have the hands
like, it's good enough to retain nirv
it's harder to play but it can keep up
it really depends, gpn has higher powerspikes but different damage windows
than having geared HoS + scuff second support
you're way better off having HoS with gpn + geared griseo
yeah
on HoS?
i mean i've said this a lot before
dps HoS griseo
but general support for all phys teams is griseo now
~~and mech dps~~
as a shield breaker
carole still has place in phys team
griseo also has TF
nope
no lmao
she's very good, sp on release is very cheap
griseo is prob a good investment
95% of players
like i think for hmm
i told epi same thing
yeah ofc lmao
yeah i'll just skip this great deal for broken gear and go for the old gear
i don't get it lmao
lots of honkai player skip sp gear on release to go back pull
that's not even heki-specific
people just like suffering huh
if he's pulling for a phys sp support gear
i mean i hope he's pulling for griseo gear
as long as he doesn't use those resources he's topping up in a bad way
but that is not thaaaaat bad
the 7tr pull is definitely not the best choice LMAO
yeah i mean
i like topped up 4 future bp this patch for ss1 HoT
than not during a top up event
better to do it now during top up event
hmm i mean i guess it's still not a bad option to top up right now for future bp
oh yeah i forgot about that
that's what i did
i mean that's alright
oh
looking for new people to bully
and now the arc city hidden base is in shambles
i know he pulled HoS
heki newspaper?
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
oh sheeesh that's true, though that's your own hiscore
unfortunately
what did i do
did i guide you somewhere
hi taihen <a:peepoBlushSHAKE:827795801065127949>
lucky for me, this time i have like 40 days to procrastinate lmao
i am doing my trademarked strat of balding day 1 and procrastinating doing the rest until last day
oh i definitely didn't buy the ticket, but i didn't know where it was used in and that the beach house existed lmao
i am balder not houser
sorry sora <:Theresad:476616089178996746>
for xtal
and i like how it's sold on the coin shop
it's to buy another dorm
i figured out where you use that one dorm thing
oh yeah taihen
idfk
maybe?
i think it's mexicatl?
it's all of them?????????
that's a thing??
wtf
:teririp:
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
same
now that i am slowly quitting
<:whalepat_hh:710738275845013576>
lmao
3 9s player on the bracket asleep = me retain
and then saint and tka just decided to <a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
akabane is busy irl so they slept
just global NA slacc
i think
which should be an s-rank valk choice box?
only the 2nd highest prize isn't there yet
we know most of it
LMAO
my abyss bracket last cycle
ruby did you see
i spent a good 10 minutes the other day with cezanne B on CH wondering why i was dealing less damage when it was supposed to be stronger
i understand the feeling
issok i'm also illiterate
and people still fuck it up
nadeko is like the simplest fucking bot in existence
you understand me baban
LMAO
i think y'all just addicted to bullying heki
then AKA is a really good boss
which tbf is most bosses
if you're okay with AKA being a single-answer boss in nirvana
HoT?
wtf do i even run in sushang nirvana without aponia
i skipped aponia lmao
<:worrynirvanajail2_hh:828444826822508554>
get me out
wtf
for sushang
i don't wanna be here
???????
ssg brave eli
not even wanting to peek their bracket
when the next abyss is their first nirvana
going to sleep half an hour before abyss closing
jesus eli is fucking strong
but it would be very fun
5 bosses is prob too much for our current roster
makes older investment still relevant
that is a good thing
SS MA makes old characters viable, it's very flexible and diverse
that is not a pro though
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
all 946 is bad too but the solution isn't to fucking destroy the gamemode
we want either 4th boss or new bracket with stronger MA bosses so that not every boss is 946
no is asking for this <:Cryge:953999086506377306>
<a:peepoBlushSHAKE:827795801065127949>
preach
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
based
:D
and then you'll do mine!
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
idt you're dumb lmao
-1 46 atk kit
aka means he used one of these
wolf is like a 9 i think
the 893 doom was an 11/10
there's the kallen where aka used his second dawei card
depends on your definition of highest pain rating
well i am theorising that DN LMAOOOOO IMAGINE CARING ABOUT GENSHIN LORE
i would lie about that
oh sheesh nice!
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
but i'm hopeful
so it's going to be lonely probably
since most of them quit or finished already
and i'm also going back with no friends lmao
yeah i'm like kinda scared i feel like i'm very rusty
thank u
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
saving up for going back to college next month
i am poor
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
lmao
again?
<:POGGERS_lum:511958434351153152>
oh that's nice
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
then you can still run HoV
how much copium can you inhale while being alright
yeah wasn't it just for sale?
life's not fair
that they call it a bug
i'm still in fucking shock
yeah i mean if you're into leaks it won't change anything
people will datamine it still
fucking finally but
my best time yet i think
not even birthday mail lmao
nah they spent all that time telling kiana to move on and accidentaly moved on themselves
pretty sure is just moriso memeing
<:Wokege:939232994852483122>
oh lmao
is that leak or copium lmao
lmao
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
yea you'll just get blocked by carv
how many times do i have to point to the sign
genshin leaks are at <#976184454949240872>
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
the question is like
how do you feel about current era male character becoming playable (otto, welt)
hate it -> love it / idc
how do you feel about past era male character becoming playable (kevin su kalpas kosma)
hate it -> love it / idc
i'll make sure the next time you sleep will be your last one if you don't stop misgendering me
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:Shrug:616394597211439118>
idts
idk
shouldn't we keep it for posterity
see i told y'all
ayyy nice!
after this bp season
i'll have ss1 DA ss1 BKE
sheesh i did the calcs
go off
lmao damn
<@218762069338619906>
don't forget the password lmao
so yeah add anything with that in mind
so now you're registering your hoyoverse acc, which you'll use to login to honkai
i think what ruby said was right, your account was linked to a ghost hoyoverse acc with no login info
nah it sounds right, maybe not finished but there
it's pew pew pew pew
it is now
oh was it not before
jesus
just pew pew pew pew pew
villv is so loud
so here's the thing about shui, i would say the power level of it is still quite high
getting it through bp would be a good deal, especially if you're needing an sp phys set
but if you need an sp phys set, pull griseo
shuijing owners get to suffer
baban said fuck budget players
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
shuijing changes???
yeah idk wtf those are though
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
fenri on cope
that's more nerd than coding
no i know
lmao
above software
2 or 3 levels of nerd
hardware is like
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
well not that i keep it a secret if you ask over at <#975572314198511626>
is private info you see
yeah i keep most of mine hidden too
and then i didn't realise baban's message was a joke about it
no i mean like i didn't see that message of yours
god damn it
i was ready for some drama
i was fucking grabbing my popcorn
go on
alright
and then took this unironically LMAO
i missed this message entirely
ah wait i'm a fucking dumbass
is that a chat in some other server?
i mean i can guess that but
tfs shame-and-name
it's partly user issues but if shit like that is happening it's mihoyo problem too
jfc
mihoyo moment
that's fucking
with like 35 different login methods
yeah, the way they had it before was really bad
i'm sure he can recover it one way or another eventually
unless he just gives up
i mean i really doubt heki will lose his acc
<@781539392039682058> 



<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
yea tentacle meta on bella for day 1
you know how hard it is to clean
tf you mean why not
ayyyy
just like my MA pb!
wait now i'm 12th!
i can't think of it though
there could be a more consistent strat that the 11 people above me are using
for this strat, at least
fucking d5000 dice rolling t100
same as like
this would be awful as permanent gamemode
just get lucky 4head
and affix
2 main thing is stars
yeah levels is pretty meh actually
just gotta get lucky on the positioning and the tentacle ult
i dunno if it makes any difference to be completely honest
this is current strat
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i then just need to score better again
i mean please do
<:PepeHands:909232418211364957>
gonna copy and score +3k again
i wonder if there's a strat less bald
this strat is so fucking bald though
i changed
no
<:PU_PepeSniper:702496145393451118>
LMAO GET FUCKING SNIPED
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
you did your best
lmao
unironically lmao
hackers
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
i'm trying my best
chill <:Cryge:953999086506377306>
you're above keeb
check hiscores
also <@447218009749061632>
i came up with the bald for pokemon event
actually true lmao
you're just better ig
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
yeah affix rng
jesus
wtf are you running btw
anyone who's lower than this is bad at the game and anyone who's higher than this is cheating tyvm
updated mine
wait alt strat time
but full auto before i started going for t100
for bald i am doing manual
if bella ults = you lose
so you need it to get hit so it gens sp
quantum tentacles drains sp from enemy
it's very bald
i t100
....
jesus
hacker
crazy
the first one is fucking
initial sp is kinda w/e
LMAO
made a bald strat
i fucking
lmao i used something like that to clear one of the story chapters
1 from each chapter and 1 from abyss
it's going to be 10 max i think
anyone who's lower than this is bad at the game and anyone who's higher than this is cheating tyvm
she gets typecountered on bella
dunno about everywhere else
BKE is fucking cheatcode to beating floor 3 abyss
yeah sure
thank u carl
is bonkers
+20% sp gen
yeah sp looks fucking insanee
that's awful <:Cryge:953999086506377306>
LMAO i refuse
zzzz
my assassins go for the tank
enemy assassins go for my damage dealers
lmao
yeah i don't get it either
since it keep changing what comp it rewards
the abyss is also very mean
yeah day 1 placements feel very based on luck
nvm i care
wait there's a rank in there
i only want the buff on teamcomp from floor 30 but i don't think i can reach that right now
idt i care about that for now
i cleared only the first 2 floors
fuck that lmao
just taking the L this jizo
in 2 weeks?
idk
sheeeesh
i balded the event
i went to the evil side <@447218009749061632>
and you're p safe at TTMBB
at most you'll ever need TTTMBBB
jesus
it's not a good hiding place
issok i'm very weak
gj
lmao
it was on offrates
i didn't even know
did you 4/4 mobius
:D
good job aster
is 2k xp <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
but ofc griseo kinda new still so hard to tell how useful griseo pri is outside of griseo
every other boss you can just use hekate pri
because dxy needs the bleed
but that sounds quite niche
you might need 2 griseo pri
so if you need to do that + use griseo somewhere else
the only place i can think where you'd use griseo pri on someone else is on ch on dxy i think
hmm as far as i can think, only in one occasion
no
for SW, i mean
i mean is still best set
aslaug did find a home but is not on SpA unfortunately for heki
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
even if piece looks replaceable or non optimal at first glance
yeah if you're whale you never skip fullset on release for sp valks
memory issue
nvm i think my last was T
wait was it M?
i would suffer in the future on a niche ass rot that needs it
tht if i didn't get it
i went for M, it was my last piece but i just fucking know
zzzz mobius broke me
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
if floor 1 takes more than 45s i'm already
clearing slow is bigger flex
lmao
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
like these receipts too
you have lots of info on it
yeah just recover your acc
from heki rolling HoS
it's the game protecting itself
sheeesh
what is this, MA?
imagine mihoyo letting you use different valks on bosses
oh yeah i remember that
what got patched
ehehe
too scared to go against me
lmao
did heki figure it out
jesus mihoyo
so much stamina
y'all remember the event that gave this? if you got the supply card from it, your account is properly linked
dumbass
are you on the right server
still on verify files
i can't
okay
people are like qixing and other shit
in wfp
this new role thing
what's
skill issue
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
still downloading the stuff in-game
ah shit i'm gonna have to be the second to stream
<a:nosekiss_hh:758188498191908864>

<:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930>

jesus christ
yeah wtf are you playing
<:PepeHands:909232418211364957>
oh is gone
which i guess is not a lot but for event stig not worth lmao
buying all 30 would cost 600 xtal
though if you're missing a lot, wouldn't recommend
if you're only missing a few for the rita stig
you can buy the sweets here
no you can still get
you're sea
oh wait
you can still get
help
top2% global too try hard
wait
give them guns
imagine the ranks <a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
imagine the ranks, eli
even keeb skipped it
so bad
i wanna 946 dxy
<a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i need gricross, i wanna bald MA
help
i am giong to morb

i want new patch so i can roll for gricross and try for 946 dxy
i'm down bad for MA
oh that's kinda cool
heki's going insane
is that me
and blood
sheesh
unimaginable
the levels of based
good luck on the 7tr guide, v unfortunate situation
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
no way to get cezanne at all?
is there no supply either?
that's fucked up
oh i see
<:ganyuConfused:979144263742943272>
how do they not give you cez on griseo beta
how? why?
what
different rot and different boss will favor different gear differently
and that is to say only on that rot
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
i know i am
that makes sense
sti
oh
STL?
what's that
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
sasuga betalao
those people are the reason why copium supply is astronomically low
fucking 8head
for update?
pleb angle
i went for the 893 dxy like a pleb though
very chill
and today was only like 20 mins
yesterday was only like 2-3 hours
i haven't balded in a good while tho
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
need more bald
riven in NA used to t1 myriad with ss valk
if you are good enough you can def beat a lot of whales into submission
really narrows down the people who compete
is nice that honkai is bald and expensive
<:miriothink:959328310033252432>
scoring high is not necessarily skill
they don't give better ranking to who's better, they give better ranking to who scores higher
it is objectively true LMAO
still suck at the game
just spend more time balding
i mean just because i'm high in ranking doesn't mean i'm good at the game
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
same
wtf is wrong with intellij
now i'm missing 23
i alt tabbed like 15 mins ago missing 22
i am downloading maven dependencies
<:collapsedwoggers:652852676228546611>
<:TeriCopium:969281688414875728>
trust
which is why i pulled for nyx
yeah that's not how it works
people want to have it both ways, they want to both be insanely good player and that their pulls are perfectly meta AND they only want to pull for waifu
just accept you're simp
those are very dumb
what i don't like are people actually my simp decisions are good meta-wise
yeah i think people who go i know the meta and i am doing bad decisions for simp are based
i mean when you say person who is mad at story even though they don't read story sounds like me is just wrong since i don't read story but i accept that and don't really get mad over it since... i don't read the story LMAO
i don't read lore but i also barely have opinions about lore
i am offended
normal NA moment
i dunno
<:sleepy:914211439286304778>
prob true lmao
people will try a little harder
nah i don't think it'll be that easy
i'll try to steal t1
love my weird flexes
you just do them until you do them right
no one does those rots right the first time
i mean ofc
<:ganyuConfused:979144263742943272>
i can make them go down? if you want??
well
how would've they gone gone down
what they went up
very simple
that's
\> says it's MA
\> shows MA bosses
\> shows MA gameplay

epi: wow these abyss rots sure are complicated
i haveth been called
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
SS MA?
so edgy, i like it <:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
i'll make that my alarm tyvm
i'll put it back in my name so neko has no excuses
that's oke
i don't like that
scappreciated
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
not if you misgender me to make me feel bad
<a:peepoBlushSHAKE:827795801065127949>
i'm not sure how fun you find me feeling bad
yeah it would just make me feel bad
aww that's very cute
that's true i was ewing at heki
ew
message
from that
what did you not understand
buy bp for free AE
gotta start them young on the bald life <a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i'll take the compliment tho
oh that's nice, also it makes sense you say that since you haven't seen <#975572314198511626>
i wanna be included
what about me
me?
very rhythmic
my favorite word to type with one hand is beastars
aster
yeah you can type aster with one hand! is very cool
my pronouns lmao
i don't actually care about it that much, being mean is just me trying to drill into their heads
dw i'm only mean to neko and taihen cause they don't learn
probably more bald, i think you need better grouping for waltz prob
sheeesh
dumbass
it's ,. to register ,.. to display
dumbass
which tbf is prob likely since he's s0/s2 gamer
he pins his demotes on rank issue
he's like nirv retainer btw
he's a good player but he's a crybaby, i love it
bern's just like this
LMAO this is really funny
it really is
LMAO
so much
love bern
unironically
the technology isn't there yet
calm down guys
genshin doesn't even have a pity counter yet

cerulean flare is kinda meh in MA
but turns out
everyone thought about that
funnily enough
poor peeps who got rid of theirs
the cerulean flare
lmao
LMAO
893 is laughably easy
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
we just value nirv promote now
but
altho you're right that it does devalue first nirv retain a fair amount
most people i see are either neutral or happy about it
that's surprising
really?
based moment from epi
on nirv
i always finish 6th
i am clueless lmao
but if that is not a thing
and then you do HoF dps on kasumi?
i think 7tr enables new strats on rime for HoT dps?
yeah i honestly have no fucking clue what to do LMAO
i'll easily retain then lmao
that's interesting
oh lmao
<:GalaxyFpsScum:966579765865742386>
<:fpsscumhic:959744049546416148>
for it is based
why would you ignore it
17:17 is same number twice = good luck
it's funny genshin impact reference
from solstice
from dariuslao
honkai survey
which is very meh
to everything else
and an insult
which is very good
to genshin's exploration
and that's both a compliment
the only good part of the game
it's
<:ganyuConfused:979144263742943272>
what's that mean? seconds?
-10s?
and this is how my chasm is looking
this is how my enkanomiya is looking
it is very unexplored though
i have it unlocked
well you might be able to get it if you want to go through a long trek
you won't be able to get it
so if there's fish there
i haven't explored enkanomiya and chasm
though
if anyone wants
for fishers
i can open my world
1k fish, r4 catch
my catch isn't even r5 yet lmao
about 1k left
aw i was expecting to get dn'd
<:HoEOuch:671132101592088577>
iirc
i need like 1k
sorry i'm logging up to check LMAO
i need like around DN LMAO IMAGINE PLAYING GENSHIN <:duduL:963697489179975710> 
less if you steal people's worlds
if you clear everything out
2 weeks
i think you can do it in like
i'll get you in as a guest so you can see it
and maybe more stuff if i think about it
and maybe quiz
like help with MA teams
and i'll also do some fun stuff
gives announcements and reminders
shows past MA t100 players
is weekly blog
it was celine's work
it's a weekly thing
that'd be too mean
LMAO
but if y'all wanna see more of me <:ChillSmug:586658267170734090>
today will be my first issue but it's a lite one since i'm not completely ready yet
if y'all want, i'll be starting doing the blog over there
blustorm peeps
oh yeah
sorry
i am getting sleepy so now i am typo central
i just did mrob
but i could be wrong, i'll take a look at what other player are doing
hmm yeah i think SpA is better hitcount than RC, comes out faster and lasts longer
if so, open MA, show me on #2 on dxy and tell them that's my friend!
are you global na player
i think the best hitcount on that team you have is SpA tornado
you say shit like this and i go <:noelleDisgust:845530432450854982>
i don't have such visceral reactions to anyone elses messages
heki it's pretty impressive the faces you are able to make me make
<:disgust:782468829598974003>
but i didn't have her lmao
so she was fucking broken
shill
and ti was burst mode
on ER
i remember when she released
fischl is pretty braindead i like her
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
that's true but she's pretty strong still in the SS MA that doesn't exist
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
she is literally not!!!
thank u carl
it's not FT powercreep <a:peepoBonk:755849746668584990>
like lv50 pri i mean
yeah base hekate is nice
and you understand it
then you actually go to nirv for once
you hear everyone talking about how it's paper lotus
yeah ikr
kinda based i think?
choo choo
comes at you like a truck
yeah so soon
for u
here
sea closes <t:1656554400:F>
sea opens <t:1656576000:F>

global closes <t:1656561600:F>
global opens <t:1656583200:F>
only ss BKE is better than sss TP
sss TP actually outscores s2 BKE
yeah that's bicc skill issue
i fucking wonder why
hell yeah she'll retain RL
if that SS TP has good supports
it's all about the supports really
i can easily see SS TP retaining RL lmao
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
so you can easily beat them if you know what you're doing
or not try hard
people also either suck
not only not everyone has ss BKE
he won't promote but ofc he can retain jizo with HoS dps
NA RL
waaaaay overestimating
heki you're
and then change off AE for eden once she's sss
yeah just run FR handel, turg pv/cat, margrave AE
than that
i think the other team would be better
do you have irene at all
i dunno how worth it is to run turg fish on lightning team
hmm with turg pv i'd maybe try to run turg cat instead
though you wouldn't run eden support if she's not sss
like if you're running eden support
but depending on supports you're running you might wanna go irene?
i think handel for pure FR damage
ss0 is pretty conservative guess of what you have her at
so yeah if you like remotely care for ely
10 months ago
and she's been released since like
for ss0
so only 50 frags, that's like 3 months of farming
but yeah we get s2 for free on ER
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816>
boomers should be hitting sss in july
that's an extremely conservative guess
<a:MeiQuestion:930749563655061514>
what?
which is already p good
i mean i think everyone at this point should have her at around ss0
you know exactly what that means
she's p cheap and v powerful at sss, which we get for free eventually
and say that she's a very good investment for budget player
also i might change my opinion on ely finally
but i really doubt it'll change an actual perceivable amount for normal player
that might change with villv
and last time couatl was around, ely and BKE were getting similar score
abyss tona is FR boss
sss tona second best pick rn is HoT
normal player will prob easily live without villv
that but unironically
i mean
<@82358863155703808> 

lmao
from your own discord
immediately kicked
you'd get fucking
based
lmao
i'd automod the word roblox
and have a community discord
if i ever become like youtuber or smth
self roblox strat
you can say it outright
you're not on wfp
they're nirv rankups
but where it does matter it's quite nice
it doesn't matter everywhere that's for sure
it's both smaller and bigger than you think
well
ss SN is still 1% phys damage though
if yeah then i'd regret it a small amount
i haven't done the math if i could've ss'd AE if i sacrificed SN
a little bit
eh
and she's left unused
spent 2 bp on SS SN
yeah i spent like 2 patches crafting it
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
so
the mode that's going away
on SS MA
she's p good still
<:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
AKA, SN and AE
the oldest valks not available there now are
also after HoR and VKE being added there
not available in WT
the oldest valk
huh AKA is n ow
i am very jelly
not untrue
lmao
ch isn't even a real valk
memento?
get on with the times old man
KMB
6s?
my first was shui maybe
stayed at margrave TB for a goooood while
AE took a fuckton for me to 4/4
it was a lie lmao
NS?
who do you simp again
HoR?
i dunno you're a fossil
same
that sucks
i'm sorry
i didn't read the rest of the convo
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
and i can ignore it easier
so you can say that shit on the horny channels
heki can you be +18 faster please
i don't like that
<:Toebeans:585731577963610122>

lorelao
yeah only sick dalaos get in
like me
beta doesn't accept plebs
<:PepeHands:909232418211364957>
i'm not in beta
i got it for free and i have 0 regrets
that'd be sick
hopefully i didn't say anything wrong
oops i'm not fluent
you are sexy william
just go talk about it over at <#963273616852652095>
yeah please be careful when talking about leaks around here ty
<:5Head:465017469833314314>
5head
yeah KR is fucking nuts
so way harder to place t100
just has like 4x as many players
score to retain in sea is about same as in global
sea just has way more player
not more than sea or eu
i wouldn't actually say global is sleep
in global
than retain nirv it is
can't stress how much easier to myriad t100
lmao
with DA on AKA
global you can place myriad t100
that's SEA
and bald as fuck
they do decide to wake up on random cycles
since global is sleepy
like you likely won't have to worry about it
it's that it's bald as hell
it's not that it's not realistic
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
ely's bow is not one of them lmaoo
on certain MA weeks
i wish i had leveled
including pri
there's multiple pieces of equipment
i actually will for that too
if it was MA i would lmao
i never actually noticed how big it is
hmm i think it's just too small probably
&w mitternacht
idt mitternacht has AoE, or if it has it isn't big enough
i think the explosion counts as weapon active
but with ely pri it's AoE
weapon active only hits 1 enemy
from B
not the qte
it's the weapon active that makes them take more damage
it's the weapon active that makes them take more damage
&s zhenyi b
$s zhenyi b
by definition, those buffs are only applied to the enemies hit by it
and zhenyi has damage taken debuffs
idt
waltz is not AoE
to apply zhenyi debuffs to everyone
you can use it on fish
so on mob stage
yeah, ely pri active is AoE
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
an HoR stage lmao
i think that's like
not even dudu stage
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
powerful
simple enough
<:sleepy:914211439286304778>
take break from abyss
skip villv
very balanced and fair
for faster farming
maybe even like ss/ss2
most whale pull for s new sp at least no
i mean it's v likely
that's fucking smart
so that the active AoE applies zhenyi on everyone
people are using ely bow on fischl
oh wow
lmao
day 1
i'm not fucking ssing griseo
good cycle to sleep
i'm going to be on nirv for that lmao
<:Clueless:920566094832492554>
everyone's fucking quitting
that's true
i know gresham didn't <:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
did people just get tired of it on the second run?
but the one before that we went up
like we lost dist from last aka
it feels like manually set based on mihoyo's feelings LMAO
it's even performance related
like i'm not sure
weird
and yeah global rl is at 398 again
kasumi was 455
haven't checked current abyss tho
then we went -2 -2 -2 -2
like jizo 453
we're dropping a lot
yeah since jizo
<a:peepoBlushSHAKE:827795801065127949>
maybe global sea are holding hands in dist now?
hmm global was 447 last cycle
though maybe with PE it's way easier now
the first is probably the jizo one
non-boss stage
it's prob the second worse
yeah that stage is fucking
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
LMAO
dunno if that's sea or global
446 dist
ye i'm rl
no way rl is only +25 point over that
people are scoring 775 on nirv with s0 mobius
i think 806 might be shitter score
though looking at ref
mobius pv fr
eheheh i score 806 with dumb strategy i made myself
and is going to be very good for 7tr hot too
it's very good for mobius
in abyss
op
cerulean flare is fucking
and that'll help a lot with sp issue
on pv
you should be running cerulean flare
and zhenyi
if you have sss pv
though by now
mihoyo design
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
good luck farming sp though
and yeah mobius deals a lot of damage with monet goemon
and then you lose like 100 points over it
but not enough to one shot HoD p1
and yes PE can deal a lot of damage with budget gear like ely and dante
you have to time your shit to use it properly though
like yes gpn on HoS works great
mihoyo always makes them always somewhat annoying
yes
budget gear look good enough
even if on those dps tables
new valks
that's the thing about
effectively way worse on most occasion
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
if the set doesn't have as good sp gen
so even if on damage comparison it looks alright
sp starved as fuck
mobius is like
iirc she's fucked on sp
gj aichan
lmao
maybe cezanne? idk wtf cezanne does though
or maybe even holmes TM newt on BB
so you can run like glut ppm newt on BB
on dxy
since bleed and ignite buffs don't stack
and then you can run normal stuff on BB
to bleed
on CH
instead of hekate pri
since you can run griseo cross
shennong
soon it won't really matter anymore
dxy takes more damage when ignited or bleeding
t piece ignites enemy when alignment is raised
2p makes ult raise alignment
+ t piece
it's for 2pc
skill issue
but i can't 946
that's what i'm running
but it's energy pause
genshin also has sp pack pause LMAO
but no
is that you'd think they'd learn from it
the part i love the most
lmao
and all purpose cat
and HoR black magic pause tech
with SW jumpsec hell, maybe the new fps valk
the most cursed
ice team is maybe
LMAO actually unironically probably
but idk if anyone knows for sure why it works
it's for fps
i thiiiink
black magic
that vid's old
the nirv at 402d
at the end there
have you seen HoR black magic pause tech
not that many pauses
that's actually
look at this cursed shit
wait wtf
my FT sucks
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
it's FT?
oh
simple week if so
just mobius?
idfk what homu is
though
guess i'll do that
with HoF cat SpA
yeah apparently spa 946 HoV
oh
spina scores on rime?
out of kasumi
since that locks both options
and can't run the HoT SR HoF
since PE on HoD
can't run the PE HoS SR
wtf i'm running
i don't even know
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
lmao
about abyss
who tf cares
HoF?
tf am i running on HoV
oh no
wait
oh HoD HoV HOMU looks fine
fucking guess
guess
jesus christ
awful week
what an
wow
that's mean i wouldn't do anything to anyone
<:AnselBlush:596473956597235723>
sure?
doom bald
i am
that's kinda cool
walk in the park?
what's the first one
7 tiers beofre lmao
you had like
jesus
lmao
instead of 400
100 xtal
sinful gets like
damn citrine fucking uncovering new abyss tiers
and you were scared you wouldn't be able to get 15k lmao
see
right there
heki play
that's a fucking
:versionissue:
smh my head
those minecraft balders
cute
i'm on sleep team
how's that going to anger me it's really cute
you making pillows
that's ctue
hehehe
🪶
it opens in 2 hours
and then bald MA
for me to do dailies
and it's perfect time
literally just woke up
lmao where are you
true true
sheeesh
1st place
that would require thinking
mobs suck
yeah
SA maybe for gather
just try it out <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
<:shrug:877047647511384064>
i guess
you have HoS
i wanna say you'd have a way easier time with ely
ty carl
<a:peepoBonk:755849746668584990>
just try both
ikr
aka maintained at 398
and then type huodou dropped another dist
401 -> 399
from last andrius it dropped -2 dist
so you take it
but like for people who actually play and understand it's just free xtal
since they won't get demotivated from the game
it's prob a good thing for casuals
it's just free xtal
as long as you can clear 15k points
i mean it's fucking better for you lmao
<:ChillSmug:586658267170734090>
i'd have a taste of a3 for once
if i brokethrough now
oh that's nice
doesn't matter which dps you pick, just pick one and pull for their supports
pick a team and complete it team
i think keeb's just on the
mimi mitsu promoted RL with SK dps on andrius
unironically can retain RL
that's just how honkai's been lately
and how you should invest nowadays
like what you should look for in the future, what impact past releases (cat aponia eden griseo) made
just like keeping up with the meta, talking about the new valks
MA tank, before griseo ely wasn't a great option
just have to wait until better player tries or we see tank in live
TRL was trying with s2 and wasn't able to match HoF, nvm outscoring ely
i dunno how many ranks that is on HoT for that 808 tho
ely was +1
HoF s0 cap was 744
<:PogU:465017582249050112>
so we'll have to see
certainly differs from valk to valk and pure numbers are never the whole story
i meeeean
and i dunno if s0 is good pull for me
i prob won't afford to s2/ss her
wanna say i'll prooob skip
and then i'll decide
and also wait for 6.0 valk reveal
gonna wait until she's out, see how she scores on non shill bosses and how off options score on shill bosses
no reason to
i don't make choices this early on
dunno
husk is not there lmao
wait no i didn't forget about that
oh yeah husk forgot about that
but it's nice for aponia havers <:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
i dunno if one aponia boss counts as strong shill
yeah i mean
so they'll just lock her out
she scores on like almost all SSS bosses as like a t2 or t3 option
since HoT is like the god of SSS boss clears
that we'll see BKE v often
honestly i really don't doubt
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
BKE wolf
they'll run like
good chance it'll get ripped off of me
that's fun to think about
but will have to do soon with 2 SSS bosses
the thing i don't have to do
oh i see
oh yeah that's a much more smart look into it
but i also have 3 avo Ms
cause i feel like i haven't
wait <@385655541248163840> have you ever actually needed siegfried M
<:5Head:924393632105136128>
we're the same person
so glad to have you back
you're a very esteemed member and great person to have around
<a:peepoBlushSHAKE:827795801065127949>
yeah i know in the past it existed
1 on SSS and then 1 SS strat with 2 and another with 3
i think around the max you would need nowadays is 6
as a joke it sounds funny
i was saving up for it
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
a 6th newt
i'll prob not need
i think it'll be a situational change
yeah a more powerful but less flexible option
before using reso on craftable stuff
hmm i see that but i would finish off the non-craftable first
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
LMAO
that is true
is more important than 2nd ppm
i'd easily say 3rd and maybe even 4th newt
people really like ppms
wow
oh yeah then
you already have 1 ppm i'm assuming though?
and then there's possibility of needing 2 newts on SS boss
there's some sss MA that does use newts
but it'd be for MA only
i think it's still fair to get 3
hmmm
i own it
yarr
we pirates
🏴‍☠️

i'm guessing another 3-4 people running
prob another t20 placement
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
is not bad
so realistically, -2
currently
but i don't think i can go further than 600
632 or 648
cap is like
next scores are 584 -> 600 -> 616
but i have no tries
anyway i'd bald more
I AM INFINITELY POWERFUL
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
i'm -4 on wolf too
-4 isn't thaaaat bad
-4
552 -> 568 -> 584 -> 600 -> 616
now i'm only uh
that's +3
504 past cap -> 552 now
this was a sick bald tho
i'll try a bit more
i'm getting bored i dunno if i have the damage for this

yeah i can't go higher than that
my damage for some reason sucks
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
good score
is 875
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
i mean you clearly are if you're wasting xp mats and coins on levelling M pieces
just in time for griseo to drain it all
i have 5m right now
where tf you getting coin from
damn
<a:teripoor:838366314924867625>
you can prob afford to
well you're fossil no
LMAO y'all say that but
but for real competitive content it p much doesn't matter
which could matter in ER
since you get a good amount of hp
actually for some M pieces it might be worth it
an example
the only thing that going from lv1->lv50 changes is base stats
yeah you can leave it like that
dunno which is better tho, i imagine if you run kalpas 2 you can bring sirin/jw to help with healing and stack it faster?
both should work
very easy to remember
most people here are prob very tired of it already
i've ranted a fuckton about that recently
my sleep schedule is not normal
prob the latter
very stressed <:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
and i'm still extremely tilted over it LMAO
it's been like 2 days since the news
is depressing
and thinking of my favorite content in the game being cut in half
i'm not going to quit just because of that, but i'll quit if i stop having fun playing the game
ss bosses is my favorite part of the game
it's going to be 2 sss bosses and 1 ss boss
instead of 1 sss boss 2 ss bosses
they're changing MA
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
most people don't care about SS boss on the level that i do
it's the end of honkai for me very specifically LMAO
i mean i don't wanna make it sound like honkai is fucked or anything
<:pepeW:770030202548912179>
gotta have every gear for the death of SS MA
i mean i gotta right
yeah

it's healthier for you
pull morbmaid and quit the game

to stare at taihen
quit the game LMAO
i'll fucking
:(
aw
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
yeah look at me
i mean i guess if that's the case, i think flexibility is most important
i think this is not the smartest move tho LMAO
no need to rush
if you don't think you need it then u don't
if you think you need the spa pri to retain then u craft it
just wait lmao
shouldn't it be epi do
lmao
if you're not nirv
literally anything
but it's one of those weathers that you can run
it's very shit
it's random mobs
but spa can do well too i think
that's a mobius cycle
if you mean the mobs we're getting next cycle
depends on the blood weather lmao
is good score fo aka
what score
before transforming shit into cubes
make sure u have enough torus tho
trust
for emotional damage
extra 7tr and waltz just for torus
on 1 10 pull you'll get 2 7tr 2 zhenyi B 1 waltz
you'll do 1 10 pull
i believe on 7t banner

i mean turg B then
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
slacc NA
turg B vs fhm B on who
literally not working lmao
okay so what context
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
oh fhm
radio?
what's fm
about what
and want to compete at the highest level
they whale because they like the game
competitive whales don't spend so they have an easier time
2. they'd have more competition
1. they'd have to spend less
about something like that
would fucking be hyped
but like most of the whales i know
maybe some
they wouldn't
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
by balding your ass off
yeah
wdym boring
on fair ground
so anyone could compete
with 9s valks and stuff for free
MA but with everything unlocked
we would just have
in a perfect world
it feels like a fucking middle finger to players like me
i am 100% salty and prob being too pessimistic
so yeah i dunno, i said i wouldn't mald over MA changes but i am malding over MA changes
LMAO
fucking killed MA
that video
but no
no one would care
<:shrug:877047647511384064>
just make it cheap
like the fuck ton of old gear
but yeah there's a ton of stuff they could do to make MA more accessible
homestuck number
413
it's huge W for zoomer whale
for new player it's absolutely more accessible
it depends on PoV
MA is too expensive to go have fun in? let's make it too expensive and also not fun
how does that sound
yeah so i see that it has plenty of problems, how about we fix none of that and also make it not fun
lmao
is by fucking it up
and their plan to make it better
ss bosses to squishy, too much niche gear that is inacessible, shit rewards
so i think it's cool how they pick a gamemode with plenty of problems
at least imo
but it's fun when you have the gear
it's unacessible as fuck
main one is that
MA does have plenty of problems
i mean fair
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
a single sss drains it all
4 ss breathe life into me
less exhausting than 2 sss that's for sure
it's insane
yeah absolutely, MA player has been asking for this for SO long
that's the way to enjoy honkai according to mihoyo i guess
teach me how to enjoy abyss please
but it's still just worse than what we have right now lmao
2 sss 2 ss would be leagues better than 1 sss 2 ss for me
and add 4th ss boss
still time for them to throw away sss boss
like on mihoyo design quarters they go how about we make this boss suck as it's main personality trait
infuriating
like wolf being fucking
some of the gimmicks though
i mean i doubt it but maybe LMAO
yeah maybe
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
for the possibilities
i am open
but
nor am i hopeful that they removing one of the type of the boss i love will make me happy
i'm not very hopeful that they adding one more of the type of boss i dislike will make me dislike it less
yeah maybe
but they buffed HoD
we had 3s kills before
that's w griseo
it's only matter of time
for 9s team
sss hod is 4s already
not even a question
yes
you didn't lose much just me losing my mind over mihoyo staff
yeah hopefully i grow to like it
i'll not be too pessimistic anymore trust
nini were you here when i had my meltdown over the MA changes
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
poor HoF
fucking end me
but who the fuck cares about that am i right
i do think HoF is more useful than HoT on ss ma
i found this
not jizo but
that bitch is broken
HoT is scores every sss boss it's insane
every week lmao
HoT will be used
no joke with 2 sss boss
yeah i'll laugh too
i came from the future 7.1 version:
the grass is pretty out here
today i've met something i am told is called a human being
husk is really not that bad lmao
husk or sss tona
they removed HoD as option
no, only 2
exactly
<:miriothink:959328310033252432>
just do cat with griseo core
husk or sss tona
instead of husk or hod
just new option for final boss
colorful chocolate
kinda based
LMAO
make ER another abyss too
who cares
yeah fuck it
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
for making my decisions easier
ty mihoyo
that i don't have to cube old gear for ss ma
i mean i just got way more cubes now
or SoS?
on bri pri pri?
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816> <:theliterate:959737715564359740>
supposed to be a good weapon for all cannon users
it makes sense, bri pri pri is like
that's cool
oh so villv is cannon
oh i see
25% bald
it is p based i stand by that
sorry i was playing dumb for the joke
that makes sense
ooooh i see
why do you have no spa
did you sleep during ani
wait
m
aka just like distilled AE skill test
in the game
are prob the best combination of well designed boss and valk
i think aka + ae
fair
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
m stands for masochist
husk is fine pick too
aka is a good pick for fav boss
m
overthrows any meta
the power of the simp
powerful
yeah bruh showing their card there
tet's open minded that's kinda hot
based
other half don't know yet
half this server know they're furry
based
true
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
sn sucks for abyss
i mean no way to know without testing
it must be abyss
yeah LMAO
living in another universe lmao
they're fucking
if they're talking about ma
def not ma lmao
abyss couatl i'm thinking yeah
true
this is like theorycrafting based up on the stars
unless couatl shows up
i mean we literally can't know
that's funny
lmao
repulsive LMAO
i actually fucking gagged at that
oh my god
nai nai aoi
rats fighting in the ceiling
gay girl bees

i mean he should rest
yeah
i am too
<a:huggies:865273755152678972>
i would love to meet sheer but i wouldn't like that if it hurt taihen
i mean it's not doomposting is the thing
not fun
it's uh
i don't know if i want to play either
hey baby?
they got it awful lmao
you think we got it bad with everything 0s
i feel sorry for them
yeah masters MA is fucked
lmao
that's masters
38272 is +20% score on ss
that's ss tho
lmao
there's like a 3 second sss hod kill
1 year
for like
was saying that
literally every MA player
fourth boss would be perfect
just let me play the memorial arena i enjoy
some are very bullshit
like i don't even hate sss bosses that much
that's what i'm saying
i'm not even mad most of the time
when i bald MA i have fun
it's different
it was kinda like obvious it would happen eventually
i mean at this point everyone knows 3 sss is coming
cause i'll fucking quit LMAO
i'll tell you something it'll definitely be easier to place 1 spot higher in t100
that's great
like sure it's less trouble, a lot more slacc to place higher if you're non ma player now
that's what i'm fucking asking
<:A_HuClown:795116510636408852>
for people who don't play ma
catering ma update
they're just
but god damn it
to hear me malding
and not very fun
i'll stop being salty over it because it's prob very tiring
to keep the content some people enjoy playing
it fucking is
you know how easy
and separate leaderboard for the sss boss
one leaderboard for 3 ss boss
we got mistranslation that we would have
on beta
back when sss boss first released
no questions about it
i mean it's coming
just removing the game content i like playing
like giving a middle finger to player like me
it's just very depressing
but not even close the amount i am right now
well i'd be a bit salty
unironically
i would be completely fine with that
it's fucking awful
in this game
i enjoy the most
of the content
losing 50%
i am like
is losing the one ss boss
the thing i'm mostly sad over
i don't even mind another sss boss
is insane
over sss boss
like the amount i enjoy ss boss
i just am p sure i won't lmao
and if i have fun at it i'll stay
so i'll def try out double sss boss
but i will quit if i stop having fun
i'll keep playing
i won't quit out of principle or anything
like just to be clear
yeah i mean
<:Mad:621070256747708446>
i am glad the game i am playing is catered to the people who don't play the game
game is not meant for me i guess
yeah i guess
lmao
sss boss
who actually enjoys
what's thsi change for
so i'm asking
i mean yeah exactly
for me
sss boss is not
and ss boss is fun
i'm here to have fun LMAO
you know what's easiest? not playing the game
i mean who tf cares about easy
oh
like alt universe stuff
that's fucking appalling to me
do people enjoy fighting sss boss?
wolf is fucked up but with mobius but apparently it's fine with other valks
tank is fine
husk is alright, rng moveset is fucking aids on any boss though
i do enjoy some sss fights
maybe i'm just being salty
with cerulean raven
apparently spa wolf isn't even that hard
kill me already
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
SPA WOLF
I DON'T WANNA LEARN
god fucking damn it
genius mihoyo
make it fucking worse
so what they do about it
no one cares about MA because it's inacessible and gives shit rewards
is prob overstatement too
.5% of the player caring
like fuckign
biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiig overstatement
1% is
yeah i can send mihoyo strongly worded letter
cause no one else does lmao
you won't have to
yeah i mean that's the point
i hate it here
who the fuck asked for this AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
who the fuck cares
there's like 3 people on global per week that cap this shitters
no one fucking cares about them!!!!!
since no one fucking caps these bosses
and place t100
it'll be easier to score higher %
i mean realistically
i already do that
i am completely fine malding for 5 hours
i'd be fine with that
ss but more tanky, no gimmicky phase transitions
like if sss ma was just
it's not even about that
get fucked lmao
now it's the same as the first
actually fuck you if you like the other
and then mihoyo goes
if you don't like one you might like the other!
here u go 2 different game modes
mihoyo is like
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
only game mode that matters
mihoyo clearly wants us to only enjoy abyss
help me enjoy abyss
lmao
god fucking damn it
we don't need 2 different abyss gamemodes
it's so fucking easy to make MA player happy
mihoyo does a little bit of trolling around here
a little prank
yeah and they announced MA changes for fun too
is my downfall
sss bosses
just
i would love it
i mean if it was 3 ss qua bosses
it's just for testing
give me back my ma
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
<:peepoMad:598607365167644692>
fuck mihoyo
they looked at MA and went wow that is a gamemode different from abyss! we should make it like abyss
exactly
sure
y'all crazy
so you play the game you hate for the rewards so you can play the game you hate better?????
is that it? only for the rewards?????
mihoyo wants only that
because clearly
someone teach me how to enjoy abyss
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
i don't need to play shit game to get taihen ass
i don't need anything more
i retain nirv
look i t12 ma
jfc this game
but i'm done
i am baby still
i hate that they are gimmicky and awful
i legit don't care that they are 30s long kills instead of 10-15
or some transition phase that's cancer
and giving every sss boss some fucking annoying ass mechanic
it's the forcing abyss teamcomps into MA
it's not how fast the kills are that matters
i just got lv88 like 2 weeks ago
MA will be abyss but 3 boss and time fracture matters
like 450 days
gfdi mihoyo
countdown to keilo retirement
roll the skin quit the game
like fucking hit it and quit it
i'm thinking about it
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
but i won't enjoy it
unless i somehow enjoy it
but i know myself, 2 sss boss will make me hate playing and then i'll stop playing
like i won't quit
once 5.9 hits
stop playing honkai
yeah no i do think i'll prob
that's a funny reference
outside world? like mei getting out of ER?
i'm leaving that like that that's fucking karma
LMAO
:duddul

you get used to it
that's just how nirv is
lmao <:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
it's my turn on the genshin - tet
but based still
not that
no
based
LMAO sorry i like cosplaying as maincord user
def not because i'm skipping her
i'm on doomposting arc already
she's a disappointment
those fucking flamechaser booba are too big to be attractive to me
but i hope they are
i know they aren't
yeah i hope they're smaller
oh i see
who are we comparing to villv
i mean i know i'm asking which valkyrie's assets
what valkyrie assets?
for the situation
oh wait i have the perfect sticker
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
yeah that's true
it doesn't look like they used weapon active though
so maybe similar?
it kinda looks like how SW weapon shows up when she uses weapon active
there's a part where a canon shows up above her head
while vill-v is ulted
on the dev video
<a:nosekiss_hh:758188498191908864>
yes baby?
canon would make more sense to me too
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
i guess PE is similar but jesus that's another level of shill
unless she's chakram, again, that's very shilly
well that's fucking scary
oh yeah you're right
i guess it makes sense, would be v boring if they weren't
oh i see, yeah i think that's fair, i do like how they're actively different
LMAO you know you can do it too right
since i doubt they'd lock that on sig weapon
i was kinda thinking press ult but if it's weapon active there's a good chance she'd be chakram
well not necessarily weapon active
yeah that's how it looks like
i feel like you have secondary goals
carl so nice
carl bonk when we say bonk
thank u carl
taihen i love you too bby it would make me love you more if you didn't misgender me
heki is very good at digging himself a grave
i mean i think heki's oc is fine LMAO
it's accurate
heki is like 12
even if heki's oc is shota
yeah taihen i think you're blowing out of proportion a little
what am i doing
and i don't wanna be on the same category
cause i'm mid
i don't think heki is mid
now that you should huh
why you huh over that LMAO
i'm wearing skirt
physically i am a disgrace to god
<:SenkoStare:759859271650902097>
can't wait
time for taihen to gender me correctly
oh shit look at the time i am going to sleep
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
if i cry will you stop
i'll hold your corpse under the sunlight, while i cry because i didn't want to kill you over misgendering, i was made to
are these sexy?
do people get aroused by these?
look at this shit LMAO
jesus christ
goddamn their tits are big
flamechasers more like backbreakers
baban told me
<a:NOTED:915100038915571714>
based carv alert
that's a based
and you would've gone oh shit time to waste 80 pulls on HoS
i could've shown you literally anything
heki don't place responsibility upon my hands of your mistakes
<@482139585355448333> lmao
<@482139585355448333> i see actual VKE gameplay
<@482139585355448333> this is the first time
oh sorry
lmao
i see actual VKE gameplay
this is the first time
don't worry about it
yeah machine gun eden on nirvana is going to be like 32 score
yeah i said that
<:tericrosshic:640175520146784287>
946 is MA cap, that's 920
in RL
than MA scores
to PE scoring higher
we're getting close
this is how PE is doing
you wanna see PE
machinegun eden vs HoD
the rest is 4*
albedo is 1.2
zhongli is 1.1 and venti is 1.0
and kazuha 1.6
most recent characters i run is hu tao 1.3
actually i guess that's a lie
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
LMAO that's rough but kinda funny
and i run fucking 1.3 characters lmao
my artifacts suck
came back and 36* abyss first try
i quit for like 3 months
idfk what you're doing in that game LMAO
and you can't 36* abyss
but if you started like around release
but yeah i can understand if you're new genshin player
i was so used to no name <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
i forgot bruh could type
good excuse good excuse
though that's prob because i run friendship team
LMAO
is harder than f12
ice lawachurl in overworld
i swear
too mean
LMAO
i guess
deal with hticount
can genshin
so mean
kallen would be so funny in genshin
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i would t100 honkai and genshin MA
literally would make me come back to genshin no questions asked
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
cryo character hate me
yeah the only thing it's abusing is my patience
fuck that
but
since i literally only have aloy
realistiacally i should really get a cryo one
guess i'll just wait for a new 5*
LMAO
and let the banner end
and i forgot about genshin
i was 2 pulls into soft pity with guaranteed to yelan
i would SO easily whale for that
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
god damn am i whaling that patch
i'll fucking get out my genshin addiction again
actually if sumeru archon is ely
and they'll be the same character trust
herrscher never die (besides HoV)
since mihoyo loves their herrschers
the only thing she'll be missing is future proofing
she could actually literally be a herrscher and i don't think people would bat an eye
lmao true
and fucking kidnap their bosses
completely lose interest on their element
they'll hit it and quit it
the way they've done the last herrscher
stay quiet
don't jinx it
she'll be shilled longer
but when she comes
you'll wait longer
think of it like this
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
as long as possible
you know it's better for us right
since 5.2 at least
but now we're pretty stable on 6 week patches
lmao
but going even farther back we had some 7 week ones too
we had a good streak of 5 week long patches for a while
patches a while back weren't as consistent as they are now
based
lmao
why make a good valk if you can just give her an extremely specific niche, make up 3 bosses for her and pop them up once every patch or less
yeah it's like
mihoyo is legit going all out on you need literally every valk to retain all nirv weathers huh
\> sp gear rerun
\> good banner

pick one
bet they also get really sad when they break a mirror and accidentaly kill alt universe themselves
treating story characters as real people LMAO
the thing i like about them is the complete inability to understand and think about stories in a critical way

they're like this character is uh actually really mean, so obviously anyone who likes them or enjoys seeing them on screen is obviously also really mean!!
i mean soon i'll not need it anymore i hope
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
lasting longer than usual
like 2 days actually
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
i bought one
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
i want coin
very very entertaining
they have like 3-4 iq combine if they also count the ones from their germs
my first diavoros rant was about people unable to do literary analysis
they make me so mad
i love those types though they're so entertaining
i approve of that message
that was pretty smart
awww
like? <:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
i am extremely stupid
and i am outwardly dumb
wait actually i usually send like 32 messages instead of 1 long message
i do that
true she was only good while she was good because she was good, it was kinda obvious that when the gooder was released she would be worse
i am pleb my jizo scores sucks my crops are unwatered i have no bitches + l + ratio
<a:NODDERS:832470682721583175>
i think they announce it
look for it on maincord
caféquanta
<a:deadlao:943923331097321513>
me pleb
than rl
there's more 9s whales in a3/a2
yeah i legit think
<:pepeW:770030202548912179>
and then started pumping out gacha S-rank
asked if we don't want more SP valk
mihoyo looked in our eyes
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
it killed AE on universal cheap elemental support that is very cute and kinda dead
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
cat
oh i mean i wouldn't roll on vill-v and not go for at least the 110 pull
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
can't wait for my 2023 still-not-HoD quantum valk
s0 will be enough for normal player who only want to retain RL
ss will be standard/common
in nirvana, s2 will be bare minimum
she's having SW banner
she won't
i missed the lore reason for that
why is VG even quantum
lmao
VG was post cny 2020
SN was like really late 2019
oh wait no you're right
SN was 2020 too i think
VG was 2020
last patch of 2020 for CN
it was the first patch of 2021 for global/sea
5.3 was first patch of 2022, so 4.2 was first patch of 2021
each year is 9 patch
from year to patch
i do have a translation table
can hit score i would never
3 month later: omg look at marisa new video WC so powerful
can't 0s literally everything? bad valk
just skip the valk honestly trash
lmao
with like KR HB cat
you'll be iriya clearing in no time
you're still baby
i mean i did too
sidestages eventually become a joke once you're in nirv enough
eh don't worry about it
v2 release: ult nerfed by 5%
vill-v is fucking dead skip dead patch
v1 release:
wow villv so op must roll can't imagine they powercrept literally every valk in one release mihoyo more like powercreephoyo
i'm going to speedrun maincord
and we can know 6.0 valk before 5.9 banner reaches us
we have global/sea future vision
not only because no beta/no release
but yeah no reason to make decisions on vill-v for now
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
just not for long lmao
i mean last qua valk was shilled alright
on nirv that is, you'll def still at least retain RL without villv
just eat the -100 on the villv shill
and go for stuff you do like instead
but you can just skip her
than vill-v ranks
vill-v would be a way bigger power increase to your acc
realistically speaking
since ely hogs HoS and griseo
you'll likely pick and choose based on the options which will leave best score on SS boss
ely at 760, HoF at 744
to have 2 s0 option as top score so close to each other
it is exceptionally nice though
and he was doing it with 2* dudu
TRL said it's easier than HoF strats
apparently it's really easy too
just living in an alt timeline
linn judah TP
it's not a lie LMAO
when we say CN player are the only ones big brained enough to make strats
that's true
imagine if they gave that a pri
base judah already is situationally better than mobius sig weapon in MA
because any wrong move it can come back into the meta full force lmao
mihoyo needs to be damn careful about it
judah is like just another newton
since andrius is immune to ice
HB was there literally only for the hitcount
just hitcount central to proc judah
it was judah TP
no LMAO
here's the thing
the fucking most insane team i've ever seen
with TP PV HB
and otto guy on bili bili got a promote score too on one of the andrius
with SK
i think mimi mitsu got a promote score on lightning andrius
they just never show up and people don't try on them lmao
on nirv, nyx bosses are still nyx bosses
yeah they are competitive in RL but anything is competitive in RL
that's another goals thing though
i mean AE
cat just the second coming of christ
not having enough sp gen
tbf, the problem that cat solves is like the fucking most common problem ever LMAO
i meeeean
so things are slightly different
ofc now we have cat
this is talking about her on release tho
no neb kills AE sp gen
marg TB is very big, the atk speed quite necessary
turg TB bare minimum for new era dps
no crusher just kills burst dps rotation on nyx
no dps weapon you can guess how well that goes
and if you go missing a verne piece, you lose 3p, which sp gen for nyx who is sp starved and enemies take 20% more ice damage, which not only is insanely big, is also a multiplier missing in ice team, so it's extra big cause it's undiluted
anything else, she lost a big amount of performance
can get away without marg M or turg M probably
depends on the piece but yeah, p much
compared to other comps
her issue was the fall off if you invested less or more than that lmao
as a full team she definitely wasn't bad
you can eat some demotes if you promote on the weather that shills the valk that you have
maybe do that 2 times so you don't get fucked for off-weather but even if you do
and that's it
rolling their support gear
you can prob retain by picking literally any dps
so that's what i say, if that's your only goal
HoF can retain on RL
and not on ice weather
like i can bet p much anything with no insane elemental resist like jizo
at least in global, you can retain
is that as long as you're not explicitly countered
like the thing about retain RL
i mean she also counts as fire damage
that is pretty fair
bitch you picked asterite over skin, YOU of all people don't sound like you're fine on asterite LMAO
simp?
and then i dunno
issue is why then would you go for vill-v rather than other valk that can also do well in RL AND potentially retain nirv at s0
eh i think if you're rather casual and are fine with just retain RL as goal, s0 vill-v will prob be good enough
who has the asterite in this economy
you're doing that? <:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
yeah with asterite
then you can get more
unless you skip other dailies and use the ai stuff on resetting the nano stage
lmao
15
having sw at s0 in nirv is the same thing as having no sw at all
if you're nirv, then she won't keep up at s0
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
NOT THAT THAT PART WAS NOT FUN
but so can literally anything else
if you're RL, she can easily perform at s0
well it depends on goals as always
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
<a:Y_PepegaCredit:792811182364819477>
in RL it's <:sleepy:914211439286304778>

while kurikara is on field still
the sss one lets you get a charged attack after finisher
oh wait that's true that also sounds pretty strong
nah it's SSS
keilo misinfo maybe
oh is it
it lets her do charged attack after ult
actually i do think sss skill is good isn't it
is 3 card worth 30 atk
gotta think value wise
but i don't think any strats open up because of it
i mean sure
and heki
difference between people who think and plan ahead
i'd like to save the pity for new s rank
since i'm already 40 in
tho i'm a bit scared
without getting card

14 frags would cost 30 pulls
way cheaper

you'd rather use full handel HoT full margrave eden i think
it's not BiS idt
for that rot yeah

just 500
500 moneys
500 currencies
ofc java what are we
<a:peepoBlushSHAKE:827795801065127949>

we are not pure taihen
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>

i answered you
<:WICKED:897590154691248149>

<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>

HoR scores like 860 apparently

FRlao
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
do people want to play factorio today or another day
this is the game
that's kinda sick
a site that lets you host a factorio server
there's literally
oh shit
i already have my game pirated, i'll figure out a way to make a server
like tetris
where everyone gets into it
eh you don't have to try it but i feel like it's the type of game
it sounds like chaos
how a multiplayer will look like
i can't imagine
insanely disorganised
my factory on single player got like
and then it just gets out of control
like at the beginning it's really simple
yeah it's like that
it's not like a gacha or anything
yeah it's coloniser simulator
<a:peepoBlushSHAKE:827795801065127949>
this sounds very romantic actually
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
i'll take care of your paid porn
go take a nap
jesus tet
<:ChillSmug:586658267170734090>
the game is good but the creator is a transphobe fuckwit so i'll be pirating it
like i think there's multiplayer
hey y'all wanna play factorio some day
who else wants to join aneurysm club
breaking arc city mental health arc
this is the fucking
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
the issue is that we need them in the first place
i mean the issue isn't that we don't have crit support
<:IinoDespair:838805351117357096>
why am i going mad
can you guess the reason
same
the server it is from
LMAO
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
i'll suck the ligma out of you too
so y'all be alright and i can be bedridden like a 16th century old lady
magnet them unto me
all of your illnesses
sponge
i will
<:WICKED:897590154691248149>
i'm always sick
hope you feel better
<a:huggies:865273755152678972>
it wasn't good enough
they said, knowing full well
good enough i say
4 crit lines
lmao
yeah my affix kinda suck balls
i can only have 0 crits or average crits
it's like my bell curve is cut off at average
you know how there's under average, average, and above average
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
i've ever seen
worst p2 crits
the fucking
that's
yeah i don't think i want to crit
p2 went
crits on p1 were meh too
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
and then i wasn't able to get freeze on AF
took fucking 3 years to go off LMAO
my HoS ult
that run was giga fucked already
800?
like
i don't fucking know
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
but i didn't see the cam
i saw you opening cam
and i don't have 4* dudu so
i don't think i can realistically if i don't elf ult
but that's fucking god levels of crit
i mean i guess ideally
i dunno
but me going <a:PatPat:814547161878364190> to taihen
not my bald
not my mald
is the only thing you react to
LMAO so this
<:sadge:816827297851244585>
<:miriothink:959328310033252432>
i let the spreadsheet math for me
i spreadsheet because i can't math
and useful
spreadsheets are pretty
<:A_NoteTao:928234793844486164>
not your fault ofc
<a:huggies:865273755152678972>
and i get the score when the game decides i deserve it
not the bald where i am doing the button clicking properly
i like the bald where i suck and i get score when i get better
on MA too
i hate crit bald
remind me when i'm less salty <:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
i can stream crit hell tho
i'm quit
i don't remember genshin characters
i dunno
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
LMAO
cause i'm very salty
the lines would come out awful rn
or the bald
the lines
OH SHIT
i'm grumpy LMAO
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
i swear to fucking god
i am going to kill a dev
because the dice decided you're not worthy
and then not get the score
who decided that yeah you can do everything right
why is crit a thing
<:pepeW:770030202548912179>
i've had one nuke non-crit
<:A_HuClown:795116510636408852>
have to run BKE with no crit rate
type huodou
crit starved
<:pepeW:770030202548912179>
buffed mode is only if you literally can't clear
yeah
HoF will be good enough for bke in abyss
for like anything outside of nirv
not yet but we will
lmao
i dunno if bruteforce counts when she's the best option pre-7tr
<:pepeW:770030202548912179>
not even close to sss
my eden
yeah that sounds awful, you're doing great already
having to farm all the sp valks
god starting an account now
same
send help
on this fucking huodou kill
damage variance
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
LMAO
and actually spend weapon reso on that weapon
i am scared for the health of the people who look at those vids
and the mobius one is probably the easiest 946 in the game
AKA is 946 with SpA/mobius
kallen is 893 with PE, 946 with FT
cause start of the video moriso shows pri arms
is it?
5 different comps that can 946
hepha there's like
either way doesn't matter since we'll never see ss parvati again <:deadge:933767520085770341>
parvati is 946 with HoF, 893 with HoS iirc
946 if you do shakes adrift tech
893 with FT
dxy is 946 with PE
520 in hephaestus is actually pathetic in any competitive terms
just meme stuff
lmao
you expect too much of lowly me
this is nirv and i'm MA player
<:Copium:875793728055418942>
good enough right
anyone wanna accompany me on crit roulette
even tho it's p old by now
zhenyi getting a foca tho so that's nice
they all had pretty shitty reruns though
bastet might
paga didn't <a:ppPoof:933892036296343552> for as long as zhenyi did
which i relate
one of the older players in my armada rolled shui through there and ended with 7 BDs
first rerun was shicksal apparently
it was insanely powerful and still is pretty great
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
shui is fucking crazy good
like the reruns ofc
shui also sucked
actually from what i hear of old players
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
been that way since zhenyi
you talk like it's new
kafka 3p is more than enough to retain/promote RL if that's all you care about
if you don't have bianka T
i mean it doesn't really matter that much
the keeb tech
i dunno if it's huodou only
which is really funny
apparently
it's actually bianka T kafka MB now
yeah i vouch on the neb pri
the 2nd one is just really long lmao
from the top of my head i remember the jizo one has like 3
not every mob stage has 5 waves
well the point system isn't that simple
yeah
the one we're having right now is from freeze huodou i think? and maybe some other bosses
the side stage is just stealing a hard from another boss
yeah, each boss has 2 main stages, an easy and a hard
so if you reach wave like 4/5, you get like 4k point
if you can't clear, you get score based on how much you cleared
just clear
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
idr now, i haven't done boss yet to check
wait no i think clear boss is 3k
max score on sidestage is 6k
if you can't clear boss, you only need 3k point on side stage
so if you can clear the boss, you only need 1k point on side stage
clear boss is 2k points
2 main stages is 12k points
how you get them doesn't matter
you only need 15k point to get all missions
don't need to do it to reach the boss
kinda like side quest
the side stage is called side stage because it's like optional
yeah
the one side stage is called side stage because it's on the side lmao
there's a reason the side stage is called side stage yk
wait are you just talking about the main stages
we rarely get side stage that you clear with same valk as main stage
not really
cat issues
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
so i can meet evn in nirv
i hope i retain nirv
no one is following that lmao
that they frontload so many manga
that's fucking nuts
based
but i can save
hakcer i know you feel like everyone is like you
mihoyo: speak cn or perish
whel
i lied
actually i do have nyx at s0
i'm ultra f2p
i actually have no s0 gacha valk
yeah exactly!!
f2p
see
same
you're still f2p i think
if you spend 100 dollars or less per transaction
this is absolutely true
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
i wouldn't
i can't
i would never
please get on with the times
yeah we're whales here
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
potentially way more
at least by 1
cap is now higher for s0 peeps
i mean ofc
so still an HoF boss if you have ss HoF
cat strats with ss HoF score 792/808
yes
just honkai things
runs on blood
but it caps higher than HoF AE raven
yeah you need ss0 for it to work
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
she's too good on SS bosses
it's better when she doesn't
i mean
i would break every NDA probably
to not let me in LMAO
it is prob on mihoyos best interest
i mean tbf
beta diff'd
never on beta
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
i'm not on beta
so we'll prob have sss griseo by the time it does show up
since we're not getting tank on 5.9
not that it matters that much though
so you can prob get away with ss griseo
though trl did say sss griseo made no difference
that's 7s
is a player
:painpeko:
time for me to make ely pri
and trl broke the cap
that's worse
in the wild
found a heki follower
didn't even do it yet but already accepted mineth defeatth
samesies
aw
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
that lasted 9 hours
a nap that i took
for uh
oh also <@171082989046988800> i only woke up now
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
is that true
also i heard EN beta got some stuff up for testing that isn't even released in CN yet
maybe next time i get in
<:Sadge:715448677162024980>
unlucky
dariuslao getting MA scores in abyss
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
i'm pleb i don't even fund myself
that's scary
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
bullied for being a pleb
<a:nou_hh:833500436526530570>
me pleb
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
4/4 everything
because they make a big deal out of it
i'm like 99% sure we're not getting a full on animation on 5.8
we could get a cutscene or teaser on 5.8 for 5.9 valk
i mean we can't be sure
to stores near you
but they then went nvm it's 5 week now, HoF coming soon
it was supposed to be a 6 week patch
like on week 4 of the patch
no, that was the patch before
wasn't like PE where she was playable in the patch before
we got it through the moon halo cutscene only
we didn't get datamine since she wasn't in game
it was story
hmm i see
have you decided yet if you're pulling on zhenyi foca or not
after getting sss FT
to 6* core FT
i think i took like 2 weeks
got the keeb's seal of approval
sheesh
bianka T on TP
mobius patch
i dunno, i can ask
i am done with MA now time to catch up on pings
LMAO
this was pure luck
i completely understand you now
<@82358863155703808>
and being humble
you are obviously in nirvana
you are clearly not red lotus, i can see through the artifacts on the coloring of the bottom right of the red lotus emblem
but i see, i use my detective skills
sheeesh such big lao
got what he fucking deserved
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
i'm not very smart on abyss stuff sorry
i dunno, like tesla beet newt maybe?
when i said mihoyo higher ups told the devs to make replacement to AE and they understood it wrongly
my joke went unlaughed the other day
oh shit thank you!
that's surprising
SpA? really?
i haven't checked what scores are like in huodou so idk if that's good or not
sheeeesh i think!
have u tried
<:ChillSmug:586658267170734090>
just have to do it again
i mean you literally got the 946 though
you don't need sp stig i don't think
the ss rots i'm seeing just use full ragna
and like no, -1 is just like 20x easier
it's made to poke fun at people going ay i got -1 but that's good enough
and 893 is a lot harder
then 840 is really easy to get
if you're following 893 rot
i mean it's more meant to go like
840 has big window, 893 has small window, 946 is extremely small
it's like the window to get the score
thales M is a very good piece and prob good enough for most situation
it's not as easy as that
prob can at least 893
cute
maybe if you're running non-ss you run different stuff?
the SS rots i'm seeing just run full ragna
based
that's just 2022 MA
doom is 3 phase and it has 2 second 0s cap
just to prove it is possible
even if it's just ss rot with s3 instead
so it would be a good vid
afaik there's no non-ss 946 ref
record it
actually if you do have the hair to bald 946 again
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
coin diff'd
and the annoying new on the rank up button kept taunting me
LMAO the same thing happened to me
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
ayyy nice, i got mine last week
sorry no it was 5.0
like 4.9
and i don't think i have the hair or the fps for that either
but my SW does not deal enough damage for that
it does steal the cat from potential 946 maru with SW
and do BKE bs on jizo
i'll run the 893 mobius on maru
i guess that solves my week
oh shit
s0 HoF 3s cat 2s SpA?
<a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
maybe i'll just copy your strat
what are your ranks
<a:dalao:882059165093228635>
and huodou is certainly not one of the easiest ones
yeah no that's fucking sick, 0s are always hard no matter the boss or the setup
i'll ofc try
and it wouldn't matter either way since the week got changed LMAO
i was going to plan yesterday but i procrastinated
i dunno i have no plans right now
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
sheeeesh that's fucking sick neko
the HoF stall strats are really cool
more like 1/3rd done
:painpeko:
always hos gear
oh wait yeah i guess supplies and bosses count since i upkeep that
i have a third?
awful
but that's uh
if you're running the 946 SW
well i guess it can
wdym maru doesn't use cat
i think i hate it though
i have nice memories
huodou was the first MA boss i balded
same
mobius
time to score once well on jizo in my goddamn life
honestly i'm kinda up for that
this week is going to be jizo huodou hellmaru
yes
we just morbed into week 6
we got week changed
also
lmao
i already have nitro
i didn't claim it
sheeesh
the spoiler mark leaked content for carv sign
do i have to tap the sign
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
i guess i can see it
alright
<a:MeiQuestion:930749563655061514>
i would prefer 3rd newt than 2nd ppm imo
or it's going to be a real rough patch for me
i guess i just have to learn HoD and FGO
god fucking damn it
that's emotional manipulation
<:SmugSage4:314264526776434698>
i was going to but now i don't want to anymore
fuck the right nostril up
oop look at the time i've been awake for 25 hours

teripoint
<a:Nod:915873106323709962>
my schedule isn't consistent enough for htat shit
wait that's awful actually i wouldn't be able to take meds
that's sick
<a:huggies:865273755152678972>
i'll be there
even when i'm gone
and it'll be true otherwise
god knows i'll play honkai still so every time i bald with hua i'll remember taihen
you see, even in a future where you're gone, i'll still remember the taihen in every small thing i do
can't sneeze if you're fucking dead i guess
very efficient
i like my allergy meds they make me unconscious
do help with allergies
i mean like even inside home
everything will end eventually
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
i wouldn't have taihen be anyone else
so it's a really good thing
and i love taihen
i'll give you 10/10 at being taihen
then i'll make up a reference
i need a point of reference
what each score means
gimme some measures like
that's ominous
unironically
wear masks
<a:Wiggle:843300917914501141>
right now i'm chilling though, there's nothing to worry about
you do make my days happier and my life better
you mean like in general or right now?
<a:nosekiss_hh:758188498191908864>
bald that to t1
i would unironically
and i think i'm 42nd
i actually did among us speedrun on saturday
good job
yeah that actually places you on t100 toilet paper speedrun
lemme look it up
wait gimme a sec
sorry that's another lie i know that that's arknights
i don't play pgr
that was a lie sorry
on celibacy vote
me
it is what it is
just like in general the way i was brought up probably
it's not like any actual single event that fucked me up
yeah i don't easily feel a good amount of emotions
<:shrug:877047647511384064>
probably trauma if i were to guess
yeah it's uh
feel things
it's not easy to make me uh
don't force yourself
if you want
i can find it
or like ever
i don't blush much
flirting is supposed to make the other person blush?
well then what the fuck
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
sex
and
i'm horny
i mean your main strategy seems to be
<:ChillSmug:586658267170734090>
you're getting better at flirting
she's farmable you know
one free SR sounds pretty bad
honestly
so i dunno anything about it LMAO
this is the first time i'm caring about global beta since i kinda wanna try my hand at content creation
i'm just local dumbass
i mean i dunno anything
because we're really close to next patch
and we just didn't get invited
<@218762069338619906> are we sure there is not a global beta already going on
if i'm balding abyss
haven't decided yet
i might want crit
it doesn't sound fun
but type huodou used to be NA's favorite boss
since new whales don't have BKE
keeby thinks type huodou won't be too bad
i'm kinda hoping  keeby is right
we'll be doing that piss easy run on repeat until honkai gods decided we suffered enough and we win crit lottery
no fun allowed
you think we'll have fun
fucking christ
the opener was like
yeah i was doing the one fhem strat
that's not awful
3/8
so that's what
bosses i don't know:
- tona (no sss HB makes opener pain, no damage on nyx)
- HoD (been a while, wasn't trying MA then)
- FGO (opener way too hard for me back then, maybe i can do it now)
- jizo (fuck jizo)
- pig (my DA sucks, maybe i can do better next time)
bosses i know:
- tank (728, cap is 744)
- wolf (664, cap is 712 but it sucks balls so 664 is good trust)
- husk (616, cap is 616 but maybe i can push it to 632)
my list of sss bosses is like this now
i guess i just need to learn how to do FGO then
<:pepeW:770030202548912179>
we don't need 2/3rds of the patch for PE
not fgo
then that's going to be a fun patch for me maybe
hmm tank or wolf
i hope the 3rd sss boss for next patch is like
since you have to position yourself in that wedge to dodge
and then the transition looks annoying but you can prob do it consistently after a few tries
get the resets done early
which is always nice
the opener looks to be the hardest part
yeah the clear doesn't look that bad
so i'm fucked for sss bke LMAO
and it's very big
it's because i don't have it
oh
what is hard? sss eden?
sss eden <:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
i mean you say that, have you tried doing it LMAO
maybe keeby is too big to fail
since moveset is rng for some god forsaken reason
if you only watched the SW husk ref, you wouldn't guess it's quite a fair amount rng dependant
but even then just watching a ref rarely tells you the whole story
i haven't seen clears of it on live tho
i've seen clears of it on beta but those runs usually are not optimised and are up to changes
LMAO
we were discussing it
if by break the code you mean talk about datamined content, yeah
high scoring rotations can be very different and a lot more difficult
ofc i know it's different from abyss BKE
why do you act like i'm a dumbass LMAO
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
and for cap they can then be very painful
like, strats when you're scoring low can be very painless
i mean i see where you're coming from but that's not necessarily how it works, no
then you can expect 47.5k
on the higher scoring bosses, or the ones with least bs
depends on the boss, but generally 47.2k minimum to t100
but we're not that sleepy
look i know we talk like global is sleepfest
uh
i need to ask competitive player
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
wait
let's fucking go
is sss bke fucked up
i feel dumb
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
and i'm the weird one
and no one talked about it
everyone noticed it
okay so you're telling me
oh shit
it's not
pinned there
it's on <#963273616852652095>
i never made the connection
i hope it's a good boss
so that means 5.8 will have 2 HoD 2 BKE and 2 unknown boss
no one told me
WHAT THE FUCK
IS THAT NOT NEW
5.2 wolf tank jizo wolf tank jizo
they only do 3 sss bosses per patch
wait what the fuck
don't go harass keeby tho tyvm
his dms are open actually
LMAO no
you have no clue
i talked so much with keeb
don't open that but take my word
sorry carv
god damnit
i should've spoiler marked that
ah fuck
but natural i am not
i am a lot of things
i am done with honkai
i've held a conversation with keeby
that i can die happy now
i am here to say
hello everyone
yeah
i dunno how you do it
y'all always so horny
so i made that
and last year
this year
apparently wolf showed up on valentine's day
literally not horny
is it
that's not thaaaat bad
missing
4% fire
4% ice
2% lightning
2% phys
1% tdm
good i wanna know how far i am from max dorm bonus
after HoT AE BKE
we don't have new dorm valk do we
you don't need the atk on that lmao
people were retaining nirv with lv35 cf
both are really low prio but if you're going to level one of them, i'd level mitter
that's fucking cool
cool
i mean
you two can mingle? that's fucking hot
well, i, for one, am really proud of myself!
oh i see
are you not excited or proud
oh
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
do you want to
gosh i'm so proud
did you see!!!! my MA placement!!!!!
and my HoT also kinda sucks
and i got cucked out of the 733 couatl because my FR sucks
i got cucked out of higher wolf score because of FR ranks
i mean same
MA still really useful but for abyss, eden is better on lots of situations
eh tbh prob not a bad choice, if you're whel you'll prob not need need FR in most situations
and prob FR frags tbh
hmm i see, yeah i think i definitely slacced a bunch on ely frags
i bought out her stamps but not her card
i guess i skipped buying frags a good amount
cause damn
did you pull?
ely is like 10 weeks
i'll get it done at the start of 6.1 i think
yeah honestly
lmao
before i craft her pri
good chance i'll sss ely
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
and only 13 weeks for sss FR
only 12 weeks for ss BN
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
sinked into BN
next 3 months
alright okay
this is how they looking like right now
it's about order
i am going to get all of them
tp is 1% phys
bn is 1% tdm
6s and meme is 2% ice
the question is more like what type of damage should i get next
it's for the 1% phys damage
if i move her to ss
i'm not using my TP
look
i have to choose between meme, 6s, tp or BN
which one do i go for now?
like that's only useful for +2% damage
just finished my first ss dorm valk
and i'd be the only one there in EU
3 way tie at my score in NA
really surprising
wow that's actually
i love it
fucking sick
that's actually
LMAO
global be waking up last hour lmao
yesterday
8th
i was like
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
LMAO
we're we dropping boys
<:HYPERS:933892134271082506>
12th
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
and still t10
i could've been ahead on the ties
and if i got my score faster
is that i am slow as fuck and bad at the game
the fucked up part
11th + you've fallen + l + ratio
sheeesh
and tell me where 111242 places
can you check t100
hey <@309634550273933314>
<a:pepeMeltdown:933941237021569035>
and i'm at 10th
2h to close MA
my heart can't stand this
oh god
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>

you're a bicc gamer
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
thank you gamer
<a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
the devs really understood it wrongly huh
when the higher ups at mihoyo said they needed to replace AE
thank u carl
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
boo abyss is still open
i left it for last second and the boss made me want to jump off a cliff
i don't retain nirv
i demoted on jizo
on andrius
i wanna know what dist we are at
do we have any global nirv gamers here
<:wavekawaii:590500669119660053>
me pleb
cya everyone
okay i'm going to sleep
yeah pig, and that's it lmao
pig?
520 is like a good score on uh
what
and you save like 6 seconds
you don't fuck up
but instead of fucking up
this is how a kill looks like
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
husk is very fun
i could stay here all day tho
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
tilting
getting slapped out of the air
lponia
which i'm not doing
<a:MirioThinking:966579554254729286>
then my acc powerlevel is increased way more if i just rolled for the valk i'm skipping instead
if i'm pulling for rank up
realistically speaking
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
there's nothing for me to pull for
so if i'm not pulling for new release
my account basically has everything
yeah didn't spend enough on this patch
post gears is rng for moveset
hell nah
wanna see a run of husk
but t20 would be cool
i am not hopeful for t10
for 632
missing a good half sec
and i was like
i got a really good run when i did the 616
but i really really doubt i can do it
i could bald for 632
okay i think this is it for me this week
literally built into me now
before kill press pause for better fps and less chance at jumpsec
MA muscles
i got fucking
but if i'm pulling on the patch then i'm pulling on the patch
i won't go specifically for it
then it depends on situation obv
oh
and it will prob not be bingo
i'll prob only go for it if it's bingo
leak spoilers depends on what type of skin it is
yes
it's also what you do on homu abyss
she gets seed refund when she kills stuff
<a:huggies:865273755152678972>
shut up
<:Madge:909232418379153418>
there's madge
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
i swear
okay i'm doing thi THEN i'm going to sleep
oh shit daily reset
very satisfying
this heimdall was fun
i wanna do it again
917 is max score
:D
wdym i capped
everything dies in one hit
sim battle is kinda sad
there we go
bronya does charged
if you tap atk and pause
huh i found something new
yeah no no tech LMAO
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
fun huh
yeah it's the tech that loses you score
wait you wanna see tech
damn
that's cool
wait you can do it with FT
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
i forgot how to do the 917 on kallen
i'm a sim battle cheater
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
saving for griseo
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
oh wait i have to do sim battle
is there something cool i can show
i won't do it again trust
sorry
exposed
WAIT SHIT
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
that's how it goes
lmao
even though he's dead
andrius just decides to attack
half of the time
you want to watch a single try
the morb herself
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
where is your turg
on anyone
because you don't have to farm sp at all
this is an extremely unique rot
though to be clear
on this rot at least
than going from handel -> linn
is bigger increase
i do feel like going from turg -> zhenyi fish
and turg fish
moriso got 778 with handel mobius
just so you know how it goes ig
but i don't intend to go much higher
i can stream one try if you want
i didn't come up with shit
i'm just copying dalao
the setup
i don't think 900 is possible maybe
umm we're a bit past that
i'm assuming if it's from you it's a good thing since you wouldn't do something bad to me
i was scared
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
can you give me good answer please
at wolf
should i be aiming for
what score
LMAO
if i was hakcer
this would've gotten me banned
i was p proud of that one
and i said wow street fighter also getting griseo patch
was when this came out
i think my smartest joke in recent memory
so it's just truth with more
they can just say i dare you to answer truthfully to this question
dare is just objectively worse option
it's a really badly planned game
i mean
where i don't even find them funny, i'm just so fucking proud
i've had some jokes before
that was a pretty good joke
was me going kids these days don't play truth or dare anymore, the play truth or blank and i typed out dare
that i did at least
my favorite joke from the jackbox thing
it could be a very bad thing
i mean i say it again
you're funny as fuck for me very dumb very stupid sense of humor
i mean you take it as you will
i love being annoying
do you wanna see how i am annoying on dms?
<:PU_PeepoSadHug:585916633692897283>
<a:WorryHug_luma:530613959095615500>
i'm kinda scared of people getting angry that i annoy them but i've come to accept that i am extremely annoying as a main personality trait and that if someone doesn't like that on me then they're prob not built to be a keilo friend
oh that's sad
always works somehow
i use the template of hi -> being annoying
i vibe with that
yeah same i love saying hi and then said hi back
<:whalepat_hh:710738275845013576>
well we can't all be happy
and i like feeling good
i like myself
i mean but i like it
but really i only like making others feel happy because it makes me feel happy
it might look like i care about other people
i am very egotistical you see
it makes me feel good when people are nice and then i like them
you know like
i like liking people
<a:ppPoof:933892036296343552>
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
fuck
<@726672158151147521>
i can ping aoi
i think we literally pinged you but you were on account recovery hell
tet has a fuck ton of keilo points, she's funny in a way that i understand but that's an insult i think
because my sense of humor is really dumb and stupid
but tbh i dunno if having lots of keilo points is a good thing
you made some really good jokes on the jackbox thing
so when you make a really good joke you get keilo points
keilo points is how funny i think you are
keilo friendship points is how much of a friend i feel like i am to you
keilo friendship points are different than keilo points though
i know right i didn't think people cared about me that much
gresham is at like 50 and it's because i sniped him so i feel bad about it
you're cool too, you have around 25-30 too
you're baby you have infinite points
i like you you have like around 20 too
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
taihen is different, it's boyfriend points not friendship cause he's my boyfriend
bruh you're on thin fucking ice
you have about like 25-30, you have to fuck up multiple times for block, don't worry about it
when you reach 0 i block you
you purposefully misgender me to make me feel bad and you lose keilo friendship points
for real
i mean you heard him
for real
everyone at mihoyo is bald no one knows how hair works, don't worry about it
but
you can't run away from it
time runner has a bunch of bullshit too
like jean armpit hole
mihoyo loves putting bullshit on character clothes
that's trademarked mihoyo bullshit
i feel like i'd be a shitty cat
i wish i was a bitch
that's kinda based
nothing else to do
they quit
and once we left
maybe 70% of the mods were stationed at arc city
LMAO honestly
what happened on wfp
no
nvm based
actually that sounds sick
i assume that's like being the grinch or weed
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
lmao imagine being green
it's kinda less funny now
i thought the meme was just abstract
oh wait that's a guy
teat
hehe

i don't like bullying neko i just wish they wouldn't misgender me
i'll do better next time
sorry fenri i didn't mean to be so rude
i'd feel dirty
he gets off to it
i definitely never said something as rude to heki
i feel loved but i will be suing
that's also a thing that i say!
fenri you're really good at being unlikeable
i heard from iriya who read it on a cn forum LMAO
i mean i have no proof
i regret that message
i believe it it sounds like a very easy bug to fix
and report it to cn government lmao
so cn player don't look at griseo panties
he said that the bug is on purpose
according to iriya
like children
yeah you need to make it to be able to destroy it
it starts with ... /
i wanna remove it but i have no perms
so bruh did that by accident
the morse code started with ... /
sorry i was dissociating what happened with u and fenri
aoi dyslexia kori
i am a sinner
i am deserveth of no pats though
i can give you the png of the birb if you wanna pet karl
i think that's a compliment
is that a compliment
eheheh i call people dumbass

i'm asking
i'm not saying

my ci still missing like 20 frags
i got sss wc and vc
yeah
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
but carv's also isn't
my CI is not sss yet
oh shit i'm not that bad at the game
smh my head
game so unfair
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
carv getting onigiri diff'd
small indie company pls understand
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
i mean i'm agreeing w you that saving columbus is prob the right play
not getting rid of a gacha situationally good stig for a craftable one
yeah that sounds like a good play
i'd use like iris on blue nyx or smth
or weapon transmogs
i wish skins got weapon skins alongside
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
me no like
blue nyx get mismatched weapon
and accept that she's bad
you can be seele simp
so it's okay
nyx sucks
no either
me?
like 3k
it wasn't even that expensive, was it
i got pretty tempted too
that's sad
oh HoV
so pretty
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
with HoS clone + another sp pack from somewhere
you can prob ult easily without even sp bank on leader skill
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
and also has skill for self sp bank
she has leader skill for team sp bank
LMAO
so no one figured it out
but everyone on CN pulled for sss
maybe it's bugged
for content creator
carv just gets alt griseo
<a:MeiQuestion:930749563655061514>
55 at the end i see
i dunno
either that or it's 45 50 55
griseo is 55 60 65 i think?
LE is 50 60 70
if she steals sss parvati i'm sad
but who tf cares about abyss lmao
she'll prob still be good for rimestar parvati in abyss
i guess that's fair
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
.....
if she becomes useless
yeah the sp gen pretty important but
i dunno if i want HoT or DA frags now
that's fucked up
hm
🥚
that's a feelsheki moment right there
yeah
oh i see
i think even if you are ulting it's still best, but farming sp on CH without 11th pri is painpeko
hekate pri should be the best weapon for CH if you're not ulting
evil!!!!
no you did it for evil
oh i see, i mean i think it's pretty safe to assume that you'll get in since you're award winning guide creator carv
skill issue'd

i've seen some MA runs
i'll just pick asterite on the next rerun
<:safe_hh:710968174887305311>
and i was able to get it in time
but then i found out how to get the rest of the currency
i was very sad when i thought i would not be able to get BKE skin in time for jizo
since i'm never using BN, i don't need it asap
i'm leaving it for last tho
pretty skin
god i hate this raid LMAO

oh shit

4/4 mobius, turg fish, irene FR?
whatcha using
<:E_BarbaraHeart:793914591611715624>
and i slept 12 hours lmao
so i could bald husk afterwards
i went to take a small nap
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
i'll stay pure
i'll take the tip
honestly
and i'm still tired
god i slept so much
moorning
me pleb
same
abyss opened 5 hours ago
yes
well
global slaccs very hard on andrius
618 is prob retain
yeah
but after gears you can wait a bit and it will unred
after the first gears, if you're killing it fast it won't be unred again so you just have to deal with no freeze
when husk is red, it can't be frozen
that's how i deal with my problems
husk fight?
sorry
oh i don't how the fuck to do it either
couatl who
eheheh
:O
it's the upside down castle from utena
lmao
i was gonna say if they show it off on patch pv and not open it on that patch
oh okay
the final island is the one on the patch pv?
by the end of this arc
if we don't get herrscher ely reveal
explode
i'll fucking
mobius was just final boss of 5.1 ER story
and then we got mobius on 5.2, even though the patch itself had no ER content
5.1 was chapter 2 of ER
i was going to point otherwise, but it did happen on first ER patches
hmm yeah maybe
the other release is herrscher ely?
and i don't think mihoyo would release ER valk on non-ER patch
like 5.9 is last ER story on the main story arc
yeah that's what i mean
that's like their last chance to release her if 5.9 is the last ER patch
and she's the only female character from ER not in game
since there's a high likelyhood after that patch they move on from ER
yeah vill-v on 5.9 is p much confirmed i feel like
do you think they'll delay elf too
to 6.0
if they delay herrscher
carv
there's no armadas there are only top players in NA, i imagine it's similar in EU
top armada players is not a death sentence
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
sick ty
i don't wanna open the game rn but ik i'll forget later
oh yeah can you check if the event notice for FR says you can buy out the store <@218762069338619906>
i don't know either
i know because i left the skin for last and panicked a little when i didn't have enough and tried everything LMAO
and do some more daily investigations
you have to go back on the old map
it's not
literally only mobius and aponia are meh
ely can go kalpas, su, kevin, eden, vill-v, sakura, kosma, griseo and cat
so you can't lowroll as bad
the better she is
the more signets you can go on a valk
ely is very powerful because she's extremely flexible
PE is worse than both realistically speaking
as the 2 easiest clears
reigned supreme
for a while she and mobius
ely is fucking op as hell on ER
wdym
am i blocked
you can talk with phi and see how it goes, but i'm worried about vouching for too many people one after the other
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
oh yeah that's just theo
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
i'm from there and i'm a vice there lmao
yeah the best armada ever
.liqu
i could do that
wait you want me to remove him from blustorm?
i have no power
sorry
here
moderator rights
i don't have
what am i helping with
add to the charm
i think the fact that imouto is mispelled
but best set is prob different now
it'll prob be a good set
that's from last type huodou, like 10 years ago lmao
type huodou is just boss
freeze huodou has mobs before boss
that was freeze huodou
don't ask questions
my bastet even affixed for phys cat
bastet actually really is a set
LMAO
i'll find out once i watch ref
idk ask abyss player
i think so
this is the zhongli one
i hate it very much
this is cringedog
oh i don't even have cringedog
and the one zhongli emote
it's close to how much i hate cringedog
i hate everything else besides the name
it's really good
LMAO i fucking hate that emote so much but i didn't see the name of it
reading that message
had a stroke
i fucking
a cat for every situation
and now we'll use phys cat i think
on type huodou we just used SS before tho
both do need freeze
BKE topscore
and type huodou
HoR topscore
there's freeze huodou
2 different bosses
but other mech valk also can perform
so it's a mainly BKE boss
type counter weather just makes type counter even stronger
sheeeesh i dunno what that means
i'm glad we're on completely different pages
LMAO literally the opposite i just said
i only have space on my mind for 1 thing at a time
carv 3 days ago i was crying over sniping gresham
oh hmm
yet
her damage type
wait do we know
doing 0/4 challenges i see
break past record
i actually want to bald it

taihen blocks heki so he needs to click see message every message
really thursday feels on lite event
boredlao
i have a secret to share with shudan too
LMAO i feel loved
i'm going to ask her if she remembers me <:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
wait actually?
god fucking damnit
MISSED SHUDAN
I FUCKING
am i blocked?
sorry officer
do we need to ask for morbthorization now?
for when you need to morb on the go
y'all wanna see something cool
hey
like neko or someshit
wait not carv, carv is eu, not sea
>:D
for coop
pester carv or someone over blustorm
when you do beat it once
for weird strats
is that you don't feel bad for fucking them up
the good thing about having shit affixes
they can be ft
dw i'm main story roza
?
there's 2 roza
they don't have another name LMAO
i think welt is just welt
herrschers
historically
<:HYPERS:933892022060859402>
i don't feel bad anymore
i got my fucking revenge
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
eat shit sonagi and sonju
i'm doing couatl bald over on stream
for that
am i fucking up my zhenyi
i see
i'm assuming it's elemental damage affix
to tell me wtf are those affixes
anyone here knows korean LMAO
fhem s0
she's SS and i swear she deals less damage than like
my HoT fucking sucks lmao
the issue is that
i suck at the game but i'm good at trying the same thing for 20 hours
like i get the skill eventually in MA
not even skill
god couatl is going to suck so bad is the issue
for a bit
i can try couatl
i guess
i can't really force myself to do anything
i mean hopefully i will but i know myself
i'll quit the game ofc
i work on goals
eh i will
mine is but you don't need one
and gear level
like both skill level
yeah it's not very hard
and if i'm tired of playing at that point i'll just give you the week you ask for probably
awful weeks are the easier to t100
i've said before
and have your name on hiscores if you can perform
you can pilot my acc on a week i don't wanna play
maybe once i get tired
i am unfortunately too crackhead and play every MA week
yeah the your name in hiscores i can't help for now
<:SmugSage4:314264526776434698>
i can help with that
if you just wanna go like it looks fun to 946 and i wanna prove to myself i can do it
like this AKA
cause i can lend you my acc and you can try your hand at different 946s that i have the gear for
or do you want to see your name on scores
to confirm that you have the skill to 946 a boss
do you want
so it's hard to place high
since it's so free
literally everyone tries
like hepha heimdall
meanwhile weeks that sound like you'll do great easily
so it's easier to t100
no one tries those weeks
sss wolf
kallen, couatl
doom rimestar
so bosses like
easiest t100s are always the most annoying weeks
tbh he won't like the week he has the best chance to t100
lmao
but i believe on him
to catch up on pri stuff
it'll take a good while
yeah absolutely he can on the right week
i need a new pair of hands i think
well clearly not since i'm still shit at the game LMAO
and i don't do much besides emotional support
like a lil over 1 month since my promotion
it's sorta kinda recent tho
LMAO yeah
issok
<a:2DGentleHug:768515384449695754>
i don't want to potentially cause trouble between armada, especially now that i'm vice i feel things could go out of control
oh yeah i see them now
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
so i can beat them
what's their ign
eh i'm not going to bring it up
i'm just weak right now
and i don't think sonagi meant to be made me feel bad probably LMAO
and also some other people idt you know
most of them are very nice, catastp and gresham are from there
yeah an armada, not with assholes tho
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
i'll just have to beat them both next time i guess
where do they place
is sonju even honkai player
sona too cruel and sonju misgendered me
solstice made me sad tho
and it didn't change when i'm coming back to nirv
i retained a nirv lobby
yeah i think it's funny that
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
i get to keep the emblem
main goal achieved
yknow we win some we lose some
lmao
wtf is RL
my friends acc
kinda fair but i think you're biting more than you can chew
what did u do
count your blessings
at least america isn't jizo
judah is prob better
a3
so on like
basically
judah is better if you can kill on qte
depends how low you are
is sss husk moveset rng
yeah i think at around 350-400% you can stop
unironically yes
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
i quit genshin 2 months ago i don't remember shit
babe my memory lasts like 35 seconds
oh you think i know anything about genshin meta
what am i helping with
hi love
oh taihen's back
lmao
on 3.8
before raven, it was vg
a-rank rarer than farmable s-rank
about that
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
like on how much i need her
it'll depend
so i'm in no rush for first cycle
i mean idc about abyss
i'll try ss tho
no
actually more like s0 -> ss gacha valk
is like same amount of buffs as s0 -> s2 gacha valk
ss -> sss eden
it's quite insane
she gets 20% tdm taken on all enemies paralysed
sss eden is broken lmao
or wait until they give more for free
roll on her banner lmao
stamps from ER only get her up to s2
yeah
lmao
to max her ss skill
but i don't have coin
i just got ss SpA
okay anyone global want raids?
they did 4.5k worth of stamps per patch
last times they added stamps
so i can buy out any new stamps
try to always have 4k coins or so
i'll prob like
inb4 5.9 has new stamps and i need to keep grinding
ayyy i'm done!
i have taihen kink
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
that does add to how much i like you, yes
goddamnit
i have a crush on shudan but don't tell them that
shudan <a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
you? taihen? sheer?
who's my lady
sss i assume
how high rank is your FR?
that sounds like fun
sure
just do my raids it'd be more sexy
send help
and then my game crashed
and then someone left
my internet died at 2nd stage
i'm having the worst raids possible
epi take decent screenshots challenge (very hard)
i think it's uh something event
it's tet, she isn't embarrassed and she can't feel the human emotion of shy, she'll die on that hill
the quote tet said
because that's just
taihen i need to teach you how to take stuff out of context
they have weird as fuck banners
might be jp server
i found someone worse than heki
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
don't tell him though
you know who my crush is
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
also yes romantically i love you taihen
LMAO see at least one
not romantically but i love you baban
there's still time until zhenyi foca
but i'll ask around before giving you definite answer
i really wanna say just go griseo + 7tr and it'll save you pulls and dawei card in the long run
hmmm
fish
like 0/4
no zhenyi no bow
?
you are at 0
hmm
since it's like, double dipping on what you already need
but right now yeah i do think so
and see what other player thinks
i'll think for a bit longer
hmm
there's wishing well
really? i'd think you'd skip zhenyi this patch and roll only on 7tr
<@385655541248163840>
oh did y'all already see this
welcome back aoi!
LMAO good job i think
wait me?
oh my gramma has cataract
without paying
like it's veeeery achievable to get everything good in there
it's not entirely p2w
it's interesting
it's really nothing bad, i've played it a good bit
don't worry about it probably
i'm not angry often
i think it makes sense
you can be a good person
you still have a bright future hakcer
don't follow fenri's trails
i don't like you
i'm very good at baiting <:sussge:968897150249484389>
i'm the most innocent from here
i think
and i'm nice
hey i'm here often too
i think i did that at one point
maybe i should do that
also kinda liberating
oh god that sounds awful
that's fucked up
well
oh aoi's in password hell, i see
i thought it'd be like 1 day recovery
LMAO so mean
is aoi back?
oh yeah i remember
was it not a heki alt?
hexcode
who even was
wait so
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
i swear i'm better than this
sorry gresham
well it's absolutely not too much trouble, and i'll break peep's kneecaps over your pronouns dw about it
great choice btw, they/them is great
oh that is fenri
isn't that actually rebooting though
<:SmugSage4:314264526776434698>
though i do add that me and taihen are an open relationship
yeah i approve of that
oh my fucking god herrscher of dyslexia
actually very true
i like neko less than carv
LMAO
i like carv but not like that
was a good run
now back to disagreeing
yes
first time i'll agree with bruh
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
dumbass
i literally do
that's fucking hype
me evn and aster they/them buddies
ACTUALLY? LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
what i was assigned at birth doesn't matter at this point in time no longer
if you are being serious, i was assigned male at birth yes, but i am trans and non binary, and i use they/them pronouns
cause you should
have you written your last will already?
you're going to be 6ft deep soon
i don't think i mind that info, and it's also pretty clear to most peeps who've heard me on vc since i don't work on my voice really
assigned male at birth, that is
yeah sure i'm amab
it's prob not a good idea to ask
like if it's not pertinent to what you're doing and especially if you're not close to them
depends on the occasion, most of the times not really
when you put it like that i'm embarrassed
i'll annoy him in dms so when he wakes up he's scared over the number of dms
i think he's asleep
i miss taihen actually
oh thank you
let's fucking go
<:safe_hh:710968174887305311>
and you need space between word and dots
2 dots is to register new quote, 3 dots to actually quote
i had to
lmao i'm sorry
.. babancope 
why are you getting bullied
the second one i asked about
LMAO i don't know why i got the first one either
like some of you neko
not repeat offender
greshamlao is nice
that's turg dps SpA with iris
yes
very innocent
i'm talking about bp balls
not horny
happy
there u go
jesus neko
... keiloballs
wanna see my favorite one
yeah
disappointed
just
i'm not very violent to heki
just to be clear
i'm only this violent with neko cause they never learn, i'm kind with everyone else
frfr
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
if you don't stop misgendering me
and stick them up your ass
neko i'll fucking tear off your toenails one by one
where you bald your head off in the last 1 hour
but the hard way to snipe
i mean it's kinda sniping
yeah i did last hour bald
i'm never balding abyss again <:Cryge:953999086506377306>
so why would i lie
it's not working
i literally don't already!!!!
i have proof!!!!!
not even sniping
i went balding last hour
i swear it was an accident
i felt so bad
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
GRESHAM NO
shylao
yeah
yeah just invite them
it haunts my dreams
i haven't either
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
phone a friend?
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
i mean ofc i trust you, you have my acc details
yeah i trust you a fair amount that you'll do what's right
<a:huggies:865273755152678972>
also <@846910913118601226> if you're giving out invites, i'll take one too if that's okay. i won't be active there (already got one too many discords i'm active in) but i'll hop on every now and then or lurk <:sus:866768426478862366>
tyvm
still don't do it immediately after i invited you here so phi doesn't hate me
and if it's amicable you'll still be around yeah?
yeah that makes very much sense, i think if you have a good reason i can't blame you for changing armadas
i spoke it unto existance
yelan piece
i'll bald that
so worse
help
oh god they are literally slowly bringing genshin into honkai
<:morbintime:980789930441707600>
we morb
and then
some phys bosses are similar too
still elemental crits
like wolf doesn't matter how well you know it
depends on the week probably
fucking nuts LMAO
t100 just 10 player piloting 10 acc each
we're really going the path of CN huh
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
smart
psycopath is the name i give your style
phi will kill me
if i get you poached from blustorm because i invited you here
thank u carl
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
i think new divine key is a pretty good deal for dawi score
like a day after a banner comes up for new gear, the new gear shows up in dawei store, every new gear
once it releases
wait not right now ofc
it's what i'm doing
yes
not discord boosting
boosting scores lmao
can you guess
lmao inukai fucking pilots 3 accs at once
and keeby did SpA wolf
since i did mobius wolf
and beat keeby hard but that was unfair comparison
oh wait i beat iriya and magery on my pb week
yes i can't read english
ayyy my man! i do the same thing!
which is fucking surreal to think about
on my pb week i matched iriya score and scored higher than keeby i think
like by name, not actually know anything about them
shiraishi is in blustorm, i know them
so he might not retain every nirv on valk diff'd
but now he's only going for stuff he finds fun
so he was pretty much retaining every cycle in nirv
he went through a season where he kept up with every new valk at s0
and yeah keeb is absolutely not dead lmao, if you look at top scores he's always there
that event looks really fun, i like the DN LMAOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
so he would know <:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
yeah, inukai is also on a somewhat competitive armada
keeb is stuck on this game until it dies like the rest of us
like RL balders and stuff
there's still plenty of people that are competitive but stay at lower level of competitiveness
around 50-60 people who actually bald at the highest level of competition
i'd prob say like
less than 100 LMAO
in global there's like
optimistic
you're so
oh god
you get 3 free rl cycles
<:Copium:834822065231364156>
everyone knows basically
on the competitive community
but shhsh
it's kind of an open secret
secret keebster abyss channel 
don't share it with everyone
this is a secret
also
i use senpri mostly yeah
since the fast sp is too big generally
in MA it's mooost of the time senpri still
on abyss
cosmic became HoS signature glove
yeah at this point
HotF, NS were juggernauts of the f2p for a while
hua is f2p saviour yes
but still 4/4 highly important
columbus and ely
actually recently she got some okay stigs
4/4 or bust, just that her stigs are craftable now
SN still is
4/4 or bust
all seele are
on the gacha groupchat
lmao you really trying to be responsible
sleep
money seele sequel
and nyx is MSS
money seele
SN is MS
i love how iriya's mind works
and BKE is BKE but it's burger king employee
and is Bronya Kiana
then herrscher of reason continues the trend
since herrscher of void got to be God Kiana
BK is a continuation of GK
and BKE
i also really like BK
i just like that it's longer than mobius lmao
i dunno
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
longer than the name LMAO
it's hasekura
i really like his mobius abbreviation
keep fucking copium
kfc is phoenix actually
mei cuckerino donger is HoT
iriya went through a fast food abbreviation streak
that's mcd
no
iriya's mind is one step ahead of ours
i don't quite understand
apparently it's thunder hoe
LMAO
god the rimestar
oh yeah i had that a fair amount too
play more
then it's not me being dumb
if iriya is mad over it
and like
happened a fair amount to me when trying the 786 rimestar
doesn't change weapons
she just
sometimes
iriya acronyms
TH is HoS
<:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
great even
is going to go fine
this jizo
am sure
yeah i uh
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
yeah probably
sheesh 504
i dunno how the fuck that works
if it's couatl i dunno if i'll be able to do much more than emotional support though
i can do that in a bit
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
or did you steal PV for aponia team on husk?
just felt like it?
why are you running HoF over PV btw
clooooser
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
sss aponias?
show don't tell
yeah see this is a really simple rule of writing
NA RL
remember
and that they suck
both that your BKE is SS
well
so i can understand
poorly
which is to say
because my brain works like an underpaid teenager on mcdonalds on overtime
i can't really fault
<:miriothink:959328310033252432>
yes this is smart now
and right clicks -> synonym on all words
heki just writes a sentence
LMAO duduhate is a good one
if you know what those words mean
i'm not sure
lmao
i love that quote
oh yeah that's cope alright
is also mine
... meilopp
by a small margin
yeah that's slightly lower than ref
close enough
or someshit
.lqul
which is pretty cool
are just jokes i made
i think most of my quotes
LMAO
just do it yourself?
you're too shameless
good job
that's a good use of a quote
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
slug TB ppm on carole

couatl you go glut T/tesla band T paga MB on DK
memes like these literally invade my mind and change how i think forever
LMAO i'm glad your mind works like mine tet
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
and read the rest of my messages
go back
you prob won't even need 2nd mei M this week
there u go
<a:deadlao:943923331097321513>
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
lorelao
whoa
videos? <a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
prob the boss i've performed worst historically
since idk how the fuck couatl works
i dunno how well i could help with actual performance
i mean i can help you look for strats
yeah sure
he gets dailies done in like 2 minutes
it's insane
i'll record douglao menu apm later for y'all to see
they're both a newbie and i think doing it for yt, catering to the dumbasses
turg on fischl is prob more damage
turg open?
this maybe as last resort
hmm
oh
if you're doing SN couatl
you could prob use glut T paga MB
i can look into your situation if you want
yeah sorry i was talking to boo
lmao glut MB
people are using tesla band T paga MB on DK for couatl
you could maybe save that ppm to go on carole on AKA
on couatl
apparently people be using paga on DK?
i haven't seen what couatl SN looks like
and couatl looks right maybe
even if that's unoptimal
then i guess she keeps tesla band M
give slug to carole
oh in that case
you don't have second turg/slug?
so you don't get a lot of value from tesla band M
SNS stays on field during her ult
switch LE and SNS gear around
chill individual i think
i think i've also met them in abyss once
they're nolive in game
from caféquanta
oh i know them
time to hardmode it
and learned how to dodge her attacks
so now that everyone had fun with AKA on abyss
from my experience
but that's harder to keep track of
and also time dps windows on husk downed phase ofc
but also have them be there on clone to clear it fast
so you want to use those 2 on husk
and so does HB ult ofc
because her weapon active does a lot of hitcount
you want to make husk stay above the clone
is positioning on SW
the 2 main tricks to clear clone fast
look at the ref tho if you want tricks on how to clear clone and stuff
oh yeah that's better
and lightning is 50/50, i feel like there's a good amount of no elf runs but the force QTE for lightning is very impactful
fire is fine since a lot of people are still rolling around with good ol fuxi2
and dudu is very powerful
WE numbers are so big
ice and phys are the worst for this right now
we'll only see more elf runs
as mihoyo releases more and more broken elfs
with cat
can score 616
but an s0 with elf run
since that's max reward score
as you're getting comfy in exalted, getting about 46080 is already good enough for sss boss
that is true
for aiming for t2%/t100 yes
for just brokethrough not really
well
aster twinsies
oh let's fucking go
i just picked my favorite character after hua since taihen stole her from me
i don't think i could play a good roza
yeah i don't think we're roleplaying
go on then
oh i see
your name could be e[v/de]n
cerulean flare
not that i'm changing my pfp but
yeah fair
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
11 if i end up getting a dupe bd back
since it counts some really low prio shit like cf
which is pretty low
if you count with 7tr and griseo
right now i only need 10 weapons
oh actually
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
since i still have So Many weapons to upgrade
i am always picking AE
<a:chadn:977032787087482962>
based
<a:pepeMeltdown:933941237021569035>
but i'm at 0 AE for 7tr
i have 3 cubes for griseo weapon
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
yeah that makes sense
oh you mean our beta
<a:pepeMeltdown:933941237021569035>
how many do i have
oh god she's coming isn't she
we're all mammals
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
just on hiatus for a good while
i'm 100% sure orobashi was always staff
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
i don't even look over there anymore
and quit LMAO
wait this is just genshin comms!
and went
i reached like mid game
i didn't play lost ark that much though
so it's not that bad once you have them setup
dailies on them can be around as fast as genshin comms
alts can be pretty chill to play on
yeah
and i have a friend that played all and then made a new acc so he could have even more alts LMAO
since 1 is your main
i guess 17
on the same acc
you can literally have 18 alts
you're expected to have at least one or two
lost ark is literally built for alt gaming
i mean that's not that weird
ayyyy nice
oh god domain? *genshin flashbacks*
idk if there's quotes or not
yeah
or some shit like that
<color=red>hi</color>
simple markdown formatting
i think it's just
HB AE
that it's still in the game LMAO
insane
it's fucking
so you can basically freeze once at 29s and another time at 31s
it counts stage time in 30s increments and you can use it once at every increment
it's not normal 30s cd, where if you use the passive it goes on cd for 30s and after 30 seconds passed, it can be used again
but for some reason
and that has 30s cd
BB has a passive where first charged attack or ult freezes opponent
the way BB freeze works is also fucking mental
i spent like 3-4 hours on it i think
i had to figure out how BB freeze works
it was very fun
huodou was the first boss in MA i balded
ayyyy my man
and shit
yeah i don't even know how to play VD
what LE buttons are
i don't even know
you wouldn't understand with your tiny peabrain mind
1.0 strats
oh
hm?
<:PepeHands:909232418211364957>
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
besides my score fucking sucked last week lmao
i mean yeah but that wouldn't help knowing my theoretical placement in EU
it doesn't matter right now since it's day 1
and yeah, this week i both haven't done it yet and even if i had
and i don't think you can see it anymore
i don't remember my last week score
<:SenkoStare:759859271650902097>
if i was EU
you can tell me where i'd place on MA t100 now
oh yeah tet
true true, i dunno who they are but they're based
i'll put that one up on hall of fame of keilo jokes
thank you, thank you
<:KianaBald:959736877374652498>
that makes too much sense of a joke
oh i'm not changing to that
i'm not talking about your mom i respect you nini
growing up loving disney media, i know what's it like making integral changes to be family-friendly. that's why this pride i'm partnering up with your mom
the password joke is old now
oh i should change my bio to dumb shit
link in bio
i couldn't and i wouldn't
i would never
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
he's kinda doing his best
poor heki
oh you already know how heki is?
and then they block the wave attack couatl does when he starts p2
and then they use gaming mouse active for another shield
so that the orb pop takes a shield from p2
so for p2, they evade into couatl to pop orb and kill it before it pops
does look like sp is quite tight
hmm i'm not sure if SS senti matters for that rot
rank?
you need to level it to 50/50
so if you ascend BD to max 1/50, it's the same as 1/35
BD and kikaku are 2 of them
for some old gear, the passive actually scales with levels though
so for most new gear, if you don't care about stats, you can leave at lv1
but the stats back to lv1
it makes all passives better
from 35/35 -> 1/40
for new gear, if you ascend an equipment
just to say this for any dumbasses in chat
also
but now i have another one back to lv50
to make dupe sleepri
last week i used the lv50 one
yeah i had one lv50 and one lv1
i'm glad it's not fully leveled
i mean tbf
<a:NervousSweat:765639934555324486>
see everything's fine
got my bd back
look i've read once or twice before in my life
it's asleep
i'm enjoying my nirv bracket
i keep thinking he's masters for some reason
wait oh yeah nvm heki's exalted
the only choices you have are silver reaper or zither
hekate before pri also sucks for support
11th before pri sucks
CH uses zither in masters
i mean you can always try
lmao
no
me pleb
it'll likely open new ones and make some existing strats easier to perform though
i kinda doubt it'll make improvements over existing strats on SS MA
yeah cat is prob going to use that p well
HoF is combo, maybe improves on the mobius HoF doom
playing better
have you tried
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
<a:AA_Gab_Bow:914213000594980964>
MA is going to be so much easier now
how did i not think of that
oh my god
sweets <:POGGIES:665371426932391947>
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
but
i mean you can't take your bad luck once or twice and take it as avg lmao
it's ~76 pull avg for whole set but you don't really divide that by 4 to get avg per piece
i don't think 20-23 pulls per piece is avg
insane how much difference it makes
yeah FT with sleepri is different valk
if you don't have those, i'd go for those first probably
and for AL, i'd def say valks like SS LE, SS FT are more important than SS TP
whenever you do end up investing on that
well, and TP ofc
i think it'll be mostly MA after griseo release, yeah
at least base pri, ideally
though you do have to take in consideration that it needs some resources to shine
than irene M
and opens more doors
between hekate and irene M, i wanna say hekate gives way more flexibility to your comps
yeah i dunno shit about FR dps
oh i see
but similar thing, you'd just rather use it on eden
well actually i think her best set now is handel
and use irene on FR
you'd rather use zhenyi on fischl
cause if you have only 1
yeah issue with that set is that you need 2 zhenyi
and i usually use her pc
i dunno if i will tho, my sisters coming back from school
oh lfg
hardly worth it
for support, irene M is very meh
hmm i dunno much about dps FR
basically different valk
hmm SS LE is veeery important in MA
you should be able to farm 1 AL valk and 1 AW valk concurrently
FR is AL
and what would spend bp balls if not on hekate
what would you be farming with AW if not TP
because like in a vaccuum it's really hard to say one way or the other
otherwise
what are your resources going to
i mean the main thing about those are
maybe it'll become less important
but it still stands to see how griseo will change stuff
yeah hekate is quite nice to have in MA
a lot actually
yeah i think i agree with this idea
<a:Wiggle:843300917914501141>
i retained with them nirvana this last cycle
oh lsa!
<:RaidenHeart:887141348493361153>
i'll get to it
ghost in the shell is one of those anime i'm supposed to watch eventually
yeah that makes sense
oooooh i see
i assumed it was from like an anime or smth
yeah i've never seen it before
i've seen like a few other people using the same
what's your pfp
sora
<:morbintime:980789930441707600>
i can morbintime
sometimes you disappoint me
you know heki
i like my pfp
y!pfp
if i don't i'm FT
if i like them i'm MC
depends on who chooses to be liliya
<a:peepoSithappy:756572285271408672>
anyone wanna be twins?
hmm
we doing characters now?
smh my head
imagine not knowing who nini is
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
hua deserves everything
based
it's called style, darling
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
my coins
100 morbillion skill points
oh no
i'm very hungry <:deadge:933767520085770341>
oh that looks so nice
ayyyy that's what i tell myself too
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
but it sounds big
i mean i still can't follow refs with it
yeah
i do have 2 HoS though
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
i'd give him an HoS for handel
like every 3 days
that happens
oh
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
okay then
oh
i just woke up lmao
i need to eat first
maybe
as always
iriya doing 5000 iq stuff
i dunno what the hp threshold is
it's based on hp threshold
wait why was i pinged
cute
yeah
mostly the same way
well kinda
scores aren't but they work the same way
i think
ideally i want to retain again
i should start my abyss too
damn
:dalaoFrenzy:
oh wait is nqn dead?
you can steal it again
there u go
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
ayyyy
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
and collapsed afterwards
and then i stayed up for the stream
i ended up not taking a nap
sorry that one time i said i would take a nap
prob also so rino can say it's a budget run, only one gacha piece
so you could try that instead too
i did check ragna TM + 2p and it doesn't look like a big difference from thales TM + 2p
there are alt strats that use avo TM newt B instead
i wanna say thales TM > ragna TM, they need B piece open for the beet B for sp
wdym
touching grass i think
<:morbintime:980789930441707600>
just pretty name color
he's a trophy mod
bruh literally has no power as a mod here, don't worry about it
yeah that's a lie
you're too pure
i like this one
... tetawooga
LMAO thank you i'm actually quite proud of that joke
not heki
cause it's about hakcer
i typo'd it when i made it
i changed it to hakgrape
.qdel 1762586
.. hakgrape 
oh i typo'd that
wait did id one wrongly
oh god so many heki
.liqu 2
.liqu2
good job tet on this one quote
that's a great quote
LMAO
love you eli
the only one that does shit is eli
the other half are dead
LMAO like half of the mods don't know shit about moderating
i can look for it
not that i know of
couldn't find it, download the not mad one and draw eyebrows on it or some shit
<:worrychungus_hh:772136190697930752>
you ask too much of me bruh
this?
<:worrywokearms:885296664955478026>
i also have this
<a:worryangery:959797278200176791>
closest i have
this?
<a:aworryAngryPlsGib:534953469744906240>
too many alts
fucking change your alt names into heki's alt please

there you go
.. niniscaly 
sorry
oh
that absolutely counts
finally!!
... keilofurry
AYYYYYY
i'm fucking metamorphosing into frat boy
LMAOOOOO good one
see deez nuts LMAOOOOOO
she has like mostly good opinions
that's so mean i love nini
no one cares about her
yeah something like that
a bad mei
SD is a mei
and that shit
into 1 heki 2 heki
so i can rename all heki alts
someone give me mod
hexcode is like 6th heki alt
is way better
that one
look at lego piece 98989
have some respect
oh please don't
it's less sus than lego piece 32557
look it up it's worth it
and after that i can help with abyss
and then watch a 4 hour long stream
yeah i'm going to take like a 3 hour nap
oh okay
cause i'm going to take a nap in a bit
how much is later on
did you look up lego piece 26047
easy answer
just slacc then
lego piece 26047
pokemon 591
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
not even my first mute
LMAO
man the one thing that's still in my mind about the new story chapter DN LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOTTEM
intelligent
the hak gambit
i see
how did i not think of that
just choose to not get the weapon
and shit like that
by turning eden guns into 6s pri
if your account get stolen they could fuck it over same day
it's interesting that you can pri-arm a locked weapon
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
there's no way to get rid of a pri-arm
we don't have any other choice
it'll make you feel worse once you get it
it's going to be a DB, don't worry about spending xtal for it
to see how much damage she personally did
wish the boss was still around so i could check the graph stuff
maybe it adds up overtime
like i used turg cat in AKA, a ult dealt like 1/10th of an hp bar, being generous
yeah
on like a fire team
doesn't deal a lot of damage
she uh
i have no clue how much the stuff from her pri matters for non-ice teams
that is true
purana is for ice team, cosmic is for fire/phys team
they're for different teams though
they are prob looking to retain nirv and stuff like that, for that you need everything to be able to follow refs
yeah but neko is at late game prios already
i wanna say +5sp on the one who ults is also pretty important situationally
i'll test it later too after i wake up, maybe global diff
that's fucked up
so the 5sp is for the one who ults?
i am too tired to test
ideally we'd test
i mean there is a chance that it's a mistranslation
the wielder
see?
what the hell literally different from ingame
&w cosmic duality
but the sp always goes to the wearer i'm pretty sure
oh i know that
that the sp gen is for other people
but i'm too tired to go test out
i am pretty sure that's not the case
on certain rots
can be very big
so even small sp gen for them
yeah but AE and HoS are both very sp hungry
so you should consider it eventually
neb pri is pretty good to max
ice or fire/phys
but it like depends on what teams you care more about
prooobably purana first then
<:KianaDumb:909232418052014171>
because i didn't recognise purana there
i'd say neb
what's next to max i presume
don't tell me another heki alt pls
new person
who is
ayyy 999 score
next sss tona you got it though
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
as long as i don't slacc heavily
but i dunno if i'll be t50, t100 is p much guaranteed tho
+another 50 if i place myriad t50
+50 if i place myriad t100
it's 20 xtal for finishing nirv
poor eden
though FR kinda sucks without her pri
but you can still use FR
yeah
i guess it's not free at that point
i think you need to pay for the free weapon
something like that
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
they're making it more op next patch
especially new one
starter event is too nice
hmm then i'd prob just play on the new one
i dunno how it'll work with the new newbie event tho
i'd prob stay on SEA, and choose the acc that has more time on newbie event
yeah
just can't figure the 786 out
i can 733 with PE
and also, DA scores like 626 or some shit, i'm already past that
<:SmugSage4:314264526776434698>
who cares about abyss
MA rimestar, obviously
current nemesis is rimestar
i got my revenge against MA HoV
i can't even argue against that, that's literally how i work LMAO
very abstract fun but fun
LMAO yeah that was fun
and do dumb shit until that works
then i pause and watch the next part
and do dumb shit until the beginning works
i just watch the ref once, and then watch the beginning
or am
you're a lot more thorough than i ever was tho
yeah that's fair, i understand how you feel
<:Cryge:953999086506377306> see ya
<a:MirioThinking:966579554254729286>
and then use them as returnee event
graduate them
everyone should make 3 alts
like ideally
this is very smart actually
though i'm a chronic balder
at least personally i get really burnt out if i have to take care of more than one acc for a long period
yeah it's prob best to focus on only one
nice try you won't get me to watch a scene of the film
like how HoF usually combos and that kinda stuff
as you do more and more stuff, you'll start to recognise common patterns
maybe only the hardest parts
i think you should prob ease off on annotating so thoroughly
can't wait to not see it
3rd time is the charm
i think there's about 5 or so people who watched it
<:morbintime:980789930441707600>
the morb connection
LMAO TET
you can reply someone with a gif
for you to annotate stuff?
oh i see i'm blind
but maybe not? <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
you'd think that'd at least save 5 points and match sss HoR
and like, no sss SW score?
and sss HoR scores 786
actually it's more surprising that ss1 SW scores 782
poor HoR
oh yeah those are not bad scores actually
<:KianaDumb:909232418052014171>
and i was seeing teams like BKE HoS SA and i was like i wonder how they freeze
thinking it was huodou already
i was looking into next boss refs
god i'm so fucking dumb
that sounds about right tho
not the facts and logic <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
well maybe?
unless like PE or mobius steals it, which i doubt
and BKE will still topscore
yeah and BKE topscored before
or just SS still
i wonder if we'll see phys cat tho
but def not top score
i mean she can score
so i can understand
i guess it's been like fucking forever since last huodou
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
not HoR huodou
we're having BKE huodou
that's the other huodou
so i can try AKA again
i'd like to retain jizo or huodou
is it actually
but if i demote now, i'm still coming back up on type huodou
i guess i get like 70 extra xtal
that me retaining nirv didn't change anything
i just realised
especially #cn-discussion
yeah i'd p much vouch on that, especially the part to not trust people who are not in the meta community
ssg coffeelao
seizing new talent and trying to help them on MA and stuff
i'm only taking in unofficial cadets now
still whale
so less whale
but this time it was ss HoF
i found another HoF HB FR
yeah i didn't find shit neko
sorry LMAO
nvm
oh fuck it's karoto
<@82358863155703808>  there's HoF HB FR
i'll take a look
maybe ely?
that makes sense
... ryuuimpossible
so
literally black magic
is that he has different client
the thing about replicating fhem
so i take that L
i wasn't able to do the 946 hepha with HoT tho
just content creator and i think good player? i have beat some of their scores tho <:SmugSage4:314264526776434698>
but the only thing i know about them was nini talking shit i think
i think it's fenrysk
<:blush_peepo_2:482047569820647434>
if you can beat fu huas chair you can become fu huas chair
yeah who needs mechanics LMAO
this ref is pretty sick
holy fuck
... mediocrity
but yeah basically only lightning or phys i guess
SN can also score
you literally have nothing else <:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
wtf you mean just no
DK with gaming mouse
FT can score there
couatl is fucked up
husk is around fine
aka is fine
husk aka couatl
kinda annoying
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
then everyone caps
when it doesn't involve hard stuff
the issue is
MA's the real game <a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
abyss not very fun
usually procrastinate until last hour and place myriad
i don't try very hard tho
this cycle was my first
i don't
lmao
after my first retention
i can't wait to immediately demote to RL
:D
so it's like a vacation!
and we'll be here when you come back
well there's no such thing as losing info on discord
oh i see
i believe
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
i mean the thing is i don't have any responsibilities, so i can just rest after 7am
are you going away aoi?
or stay awake until 7
i dunno if i sleep now
it's 4am
i have to take meds at 7am
sleep well
see
&lick <@482139585355448333>
like
platonic licks
yeah
a way of greeting
it's uh
LMAO
yeah?
i haven't seen roy in 3 year <:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
you and tet are literally the only people i know from EU
cause they all leave me
a while ago
LMAO yeah i stopped taking in cadets
i can't talk about it <:SmugSage4:314264526776434698>
you can be still in it
yeah if you already told him you wanna join the armada and sent him your UID then just wait and he'll tell you if you passed or not the test
LMAO i don't think so
the level of lao in a single nini is unimaginable
and retained her first nirv
and then went to nirv
promoted every cycle
didn't demote once in RL
but she also was bicc prodigy, fucking brokethrough
which i already poached
we had another one, ninilao
too late <:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
yeah this is his last week
oh yeah also, 34th place is <@171082989046988800>, another masters prodigy we have around <:sus:866768426478862366>
yeah it surprised me too
so you'll have more time next weeks to bald MA
we're getting lite soon
also think of it like this
do the stuff that actually gets you rewards before just ranking higher in MA
yeah finish ER first
wdym by focusing on ER
built to make every worst decision
he is like
oh god you're going to love heki probably
yeah it's funny if you think about it, everyone knows each other at the highest level of play
i literally told you what to say <:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
actually don't say that i poached you it might come off as not a joke
you and <@781539392039682058>, message Phi#9538 if you want to join armada, lemme know if you do and i can tell him i'm sending you 2, and then just say i poached you and you're still on your armada
so it's not a requirement to be a balder
we're mostly a community, we just got lots of competitive players
but we're not a competitive armada front and center
i mean i'm not the one at the end that decides who gets in or not
yeah sure i'll pouch anyone i can <a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
oh wait i think i got vouched into it too
i dunno how i passed that
idk how armada cooldown works
i wish i was the person y'all make me out to be
LMAO i actually did
LMAO double dipping
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
yes and i did it badly
and i'm shit at the game
since i'm there LMAO
but you def don't need to be a dalao to join
just tell me when, if at all, you want to join, not as simple process as just applying in game
LMAO aw that's very cute
yes
but i stole hakcer and nini from here
so i just brought her to discord
aster was already in SEA blustorm somehow
and yeah i poached some peeps here to blustorm
new chapter talk is going over at <#985721462147145798> <@524782681389793280>
spreadsheet gamer
bicc prodigy
he's very powerful, but he's still masters
but he's like
yeah
i'll be inviting a friend of mine if that's alright
not fucked over these mods lmao
yeah i bet peeps are glad now that morb isn't burst mode
is griseo gone? 🦀
did i guess it right
who died
which is the lil guy going aaaaaaaaaaah
she doesn't have the burst mode icon, next to the level
what's wrong with your mobius
i don't think so
just try it out <:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
by not doing dumb shit
tank wins sss boss competition by doing bare minimum
tona is not that bad
wait actually i think tona is consistent too
which is kinda fucked up lmao
the only consistent sss boss
like it's prob
tank is the least fucked up sss boss
yeah tank scores
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
new modifiers
and fhem does it with s0
i barely had enough damage for 744 with s2
712 is pretty chill, 728 if you have elf, 744 is possible with s0 if your s0 is insane
fhem just has crazy s0 HoF
-9 if you're fhem lmao
600 is like -8 from s0 HoF score
she has a tough slope to climb
how much does she score right?
maybe
... mediocrity
if you can't cap
but it'll be a good option probably
since like, after ult, she just doesn't have much tf
i don't think it'll be cap anything, really
enough to ult
HoS pop clone +15 to ely
actually yeah maybe, griseo ely HoS
and she doesn't see much play
because like sss LE already gives 70, enough to ult
how much sp is sss griseo again?
eh maybe
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i retain more than RL
i retain RL
and i really didn't deserve it
was on AKA
and now my first nirvana retain
on patch 5.2
and i really didn't deserve it
was on AKA
my first RL promotion
yknow what's really funny
to what??
sick
we have one???
Do tell
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
to what
but that would prob not even move you 0.01%
3 spots higher at max
it would prob place you like
when everyone's capping, p much
only on the really really high end
i wanna say there's not that many ties on the mid-low end of scores
hmmm idk
we got a lot of slaccers tho
especially on high scoring weeks
since who scores first gets first on ties
real balders do it asap
depends
so you can do MA day 1
since the clears for lite don't use up actual clears
lite MA is very big for exalted too
let's fucking go
oh we're getting lite??
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
lv50
yeah she's fucking
god my nyx sucks
god i suck
opens up new spot in the party
5.9 new elf: ice paimon
okay i have a prediction
but it's intended
it would be very funny if you think it's your pc
have you checked other CN player
just falls off greatly if you can't one rot
she's still the best support if you can one rot stuff
raven still has a place in the meta, to be clear
even if vill-v is better than AE, then you just run the second best support, AE
AE is the better support of the 2
that between raven/turg cat and AE
but the issue is
because that's already what cat is basically
yeah but it would fix AE's problems even more
off field
and she can reapply turg
cat feeds sp to AE, which is very sp hungry
it makes sense if you think about it
raven is dead for turg cat already
LMAO
not AE
it's killing turg cat
if new fire sp
99% sure
i'm like
idk, i'll let you know once i start looking at refs
i'm pleb but i can try to help
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
i lucked out
yeah gresham bicc lao
god my nyx sucks
i don't like this
more chill
i'll go back to my MA
abyss too cutthroat
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
<:2DAquaCry:772572607060377630>
gresham hates me now
<@704867526877904908> i feel so bad for gresham
but if you're not doing that, you'd rather pop it early so your attacks before can get the buff too
so they do it then too
and weapon active deals a good amount of damage
they do that on the turg cat ref because they time tornado pop with can reapplying turg + mei
you were prob copying it from a turg cat ref
you shouldn't do that
where you weapon active just before popping tornado
the thing you were doing on your AKA
oh yeah <@385655541248163840>
<:wavekawaii:590500669119660053>
hi!!
so the only way to keep em is by never demoting
you get 180 when you hit a3, and another 100 when you hit RL
it's one time only
i could ask
but maybe?
very unlikely
i mean
nini too
and then i lost them at nirvana obviously
so i kept 180
i demoted once in RL
some, at least
actually i did too
she's insane
ninilao did
maybe 1 or 2 for top spots
LMAO
there's really not that much sniping in RL
here's proof that i'm not sniping
I'M JUST DOING LAST SECOND BALD
I SWEAR IT WAS
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
honestly it would also prob be more fun
but ss PE will prob outdo ss BKE
just because it feels right
if i'm RL, i'll use BKE
i'm fucked
i'm not even at 30k yet
i want xtal
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
<:morbintime:980789930441707600>
calm down peeps patch's not over yet
everyone fucking morbing into week 6 for some reason
read carefully
4head
eli is also talking about abyss
lmao
and easier than cn for sure
but prob around the same as SEA
maybe harder than EU?
i don't think retaining in nirvana global is really any harder than any other nirvana
i've gotten t50 before and not retained
because in global, it's waaaay easier to place myriad than retain
are you SEA?
rose and gun is v likely sniping tho
LMAO
with this shit score
my first nirv
if i retain
NA RL moment
with SpA
you can prob clear stages
i mean
+20 xtal and less work
take the 3 day vacation from abyss
just go to nirvana
ty
lmao
also <@385655541248163840> what's RL dist
<@385655541248163840> 
yeah i don't think she's had one LMAO
um
lechonk wouldn't commit tax evasion
based
especially if i loaded too much of the map
restart it every so often
just
i could play with 8
like i said
i mean
that's fever
40 degrees?
oh wow hot birb
birb!
shit's chill
now with 16
game died lmao
if i tried moving from one to the other
like i had to explore either mondstadt or liyue
if i loaded too much of the map
it started to lag very badly
back when i had 8
that doesn't surprise me
LMAO
MA score
unironically
that's
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
teach me
yeah i dunno how RL cap score is looking like
ssg ninilao
in nirv?
it won't be good enough for retain tho
600 might be good enough for myriad t100
you nirv?
he was she's morbin last time i checked
he was like
i think iriya isn't that anymore
we've had way more in the past
there's only like 2 sus names there
satisfying scores
(not me)
i've only read the hole one
like the meme one
some of those are really sick
lmao that's just a compilation of cool counters?
no one's leaving this alive
funeral of heroes
is literally
the name of the new chapter
what decision?
hmmm?
i think we've had stig cost 12 before
yes if stig costs 10
it's obvious it'd go down but by ~10 pulls that's quite a bit
oh that's really interesting
oh i see what you meant
i stole it
thank you
<a:MeiQuestion:930749563655061514>
did just get kin assigned as mei?
meilao?
before being deleted themselves
they don't deserve to see all their loved ones being deleted one by one
yeah, it's also the kindest approach if you think about it
griseo - mihoyo doing the shill and get rid of maneuver
or
kosma - no one cares about kosma
okay so my bets are either
look at that gap too! damn
dalaoster
holy
literally t1
wdym it's not much
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
what the hell
catastp isn't a toddler <:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
you're valid, you're a toddler
but now you <:huh:966619839307321394> at my celine's foot fetish?
and no one <:huh:966619839307321394>'d
also what the hell my name was will suck dick for crit at one point
... keilofurry
which is a pretty good ratio
you only have one bad opinion afaik
i vouch for that
based ninilao
wow
1 week LMAO
not worry about coin for like
like sell 100 torus
i'd eeeeasily sell off torus for that
if each torus was like 100k coin or smth
i would literally unironically sell torus for coin
<:lfg:803114423430545418>
which is BKE shill
the one we're having is type counter
freeze huodou, that is
yeah i think so
which i am, so that's why i like it
but i grew to like the name, foot fetish has alliteration and it makes it sound like i'm close to celine to make a joke like that
i put it that way for a quick joke
and i'm the personification of her foot fetish
celine is another vice of my armada
you see
no griseo tho
hmmm
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
i wonder if ss PE would outscore ss BKE
i see
just a little tough on the gather
SpA on bleed doesn't sound that bad
you'd use PE over BKE on jizo?
hmm
studylao
dj with koc i call that the trans musician build
i'm so poor
i'm never fucking priing her bow
that's how i feel about ely lmao
me too! but i won't be in nirvana probably
and don't explain shit
leaves
come to honkai, aslaug SpA, retains ag2
kinda chad if you think about it
to be gaslighted
perfectly crafted
heki you are like
i think we're the villains here
lmao just gaslighting the kid
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
so mean
LMAO
heki just had to get the demons out
everything else can suck a dick
husk is not that bad
tank is pretty fine
but most sss boss suck ass
i haven't tried tona yet
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
sss tona obviously
and i do the fun part
you do sss boss
wanna share acc?
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
the gamemode that matters
i was talking about MA
oh
like top5 or so
not top 1
even more than exalted
and everyone slacs
0s kill galore
true
<:morbintime:980789930441707600>
<a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
and like 1.3m in abyss
i feel like mine are 800k in MA
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
is 600k ult a lot?
you're supposed to know this after the most insane thing i've ever heard anyone say
come to RL <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
yeah i don't know why people feel bad that SA is getting killed, it's actually lore accurate
it's the cursed booba senti art
like next patch she's killed for griseo
does BKE still use SA this patch?
that's a call for help
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
thank you carv for cat
couatl is worse than tona
but huh
oh okay
how can you be sure
carv next sss boss will be couatl alho
but when you do it it's fine
she will be either way
we deserve older hua
yes and i'm saying, cowards
spreadsheet is the true game
hey don't make fun of spreadsheet gaming
still corwards to write that as a thing
mihoyo are a bunch of cowards by not making him look 82
you'd think so but you'd be surprised
heki found out i'm gay
that's the same thing as like this loli is actually 5000 years old, <a:NOPERS:933892177707298896>
honkai brainrot
young adult = old
guy is like fucking 25
LMAO
you look at a normal aged person and call him old
see that's why you have alphabet role
i'll just take it up the ass when i make my first acc and get like fucking 8 claras in a row
that's coward PoV
you're rerolling?
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
star rail in 2022 is pretty cool actually
i do not pity heki anymore
poor heki
y'all treat heki so badly
i only spend like 2-3 hours per cycle
nvm then, i wouldn't know about actually trying at abyss
oh actually?
jp game translators said fuck MA
heki just coping that next phys elf will impair
not that you need it too often
dudu gather is kinda insane tbh
that's a lot
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
ssg babanlao
damn not even carvlao!
i can't even 3* my jingwei cause she's too low level lmao
ssg babanlao with jingwei 4*
carvlao with 4* BE
sheesh gamers
yk?
but not extremely
AKA is like always kinda fun
i haven't decided if i'm balding abyss or not yet
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
no turg?
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
i need to max neb pri
i'm poor
that's pretty cute
yeah she feels like a mistake
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
and fun to play
but still cheap
doesn't have that many topscores anymore
MA still pretty powerful
but both are mainly for fischl personal output
mitter is better now, it will offer some team damage
cerulean utility doesn't get better with levels
both very low prio
eh
yeah
which is the only place SN is good at
oh i'm talking about MA
like wilde T
sometimes there's a piece substitution
most of the time yeah
that's kinda nuts lmao
waow powerful
maybe is a no but my ego is too big to admit the size of my ego
can anything i say even change heki's mind?
hm
oh
on jizo RL
you won't retain without HoS
um
so it can fill holes if you have them on your setup
but even when it isn't, it's usually pretty good
it's rarely BiS
nice to have
generally i'd treat columbus as like
and SN has some uses to it
because of bastet
double sleepri strats use tesla M tho, nowadays
M piece is good on FT sometimes
hmm
tyvm for coming to my ted talk
is actually unironically impossible
this 840 doom
yeah based
LMAO
can she?
that's fucking cursed
what?
i unironically want dirac T for SP LMAO
duh
for SP
that's when i'm <a:ppPoof:933892036296343552>
add 1/2 SSS bosses
nah the ways i leave is like, remove MA
oh i could see that
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
i'm never leaving
stig pri, 4 MA bosses, no sss bosses
add lv90, new bracket
if they
good luck making teams
just to fuck with players
lmao 2 sss bosses 4 ss bosses
fuck sss bosses
than sss boss
4th MA boss
i'd literally way prefer
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
how many ppms will i need then
tell me more about 2025 meta
he's ascending
<:worrygalaxybrain:698804372766851113>
nah i believe him
it's oke
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
only 2 newts
heki is a robot programmed to make the decisions that cause us most pain possible
i don't think that's how it works
<- says while completely failing 840 doom for 4 hours
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
i can talk cause i'm t100 player
LMAO
this is the venn diagram
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816> <:theliterate:959737715564359740>
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
not my fault you decided to play on the server that doesn't have 1 month future vision and doesn't sleep every cycle
do ya now
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
and read what it does
click on a skill
oh my god heki
READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
level up her fucking skill, dumbass
is that p much any dumb shit can retain
the thing about RL
riku retained RL with mobius
especially since she has lower damage threshold to paralyse the boss into not spawning clone
but HoT outperforms
she can get fair score
heeell no LMAO
lmao
you need to level her skill that makes her regen sp
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
i've t50'd myriad before and not retained
maybe retain on slacc bracket
so that score can t100 easily
so you don't need to retain to place myriad t100
we have a low amount of nirv players
i mean it depends
every other valk, global slaccs
is PE
global knows how to play
only valk
both
it looks a lot more fun than actually understanding stuff
please let me live that life
i wanna retire into a #cn-discussion dumbass
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
jesus stop sending porn to the kid
proportionally, same amount of dumbasses
but like
so they have 5x the amount of people with head on right place
SEA just has like 5x the amount of players
besides otto, every other boss global slaccs heavily
no, underestimating in how much we suck
you have no clue
we suck so hard
like you are severly underestimating global playerbase
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
no
nvm agony 3 lmao
even for RL it's pretty chill
yeah on agony 3? i don't think so
the only way to demote from a3 is not playing the game lmao
don't worry about it
you won't demote from a3
if you have minimal idea on how to play the game
oh that's nice
and i hated it so much lmao
but it was there for q-sing
i dunno if it is there in q-mani
in masters
yeah the floors you have to do before doing actually abyss
god i hate abyss gateway
you won't have abyss gateway anymore
think of it like this
better do that earlier than later
you need to stack up on pri resources
no matter how fucked you think you are
i mean it's still better to breakthrough asap
what the hell
there's stuff below agony 3?
the fuck are you talking about with this paper size numbers
yeah um theoretically yes
and to see how much my nyx actually sucks
to go back into doom
courage
same
global skill issue caught in 4k
just need to bring my multi purpose cat
HoF missing for stall strats
based
<:wavekawaii:590500669119660053>
hi
unless? <a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
so it doesn't help on p1
hekate pri makes enemies hit take more damage, but it can't hit core
zither boosts phys dmg
which is why zither > hekate pri on SA on HoD
it can't be if it's not out
since core isn't bleeding
your ult damage won't be boosted on core
and you ult
if you're using PE
but like
i think so
ofc
jizo again
sounds about right
to shill new patch release
yeah 4 bosses
eli one day: please patch end soon for griseo
eli next day: i'm glad the patches aren't shorter
yeah thank god
don't come to me with math
nvm
oh yeah there's shorter patches
how
since 9 patches don't go perfectly on a year
patch drift
yeah we could get some like
you say that
5.9 WE powercreep
6.1 Sirin powercreep
6.5 klein powercreep
6.8 dudu powercreep
to put patch numbers on that
dudu actually living for a good while
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
it was for danzai
i was absolutely not around back then
or should i do that over at <#963273616852652095>
was the stig art officially announced? can i post it here?
on how to shill
mihoyo's test subject
BKE was like
green and shit
it was pretty
like on wiki
yeah i think i remember seeing the art for it
poor danzai
at a BKE only support
a really bad attempt
wasn't danzai like
<:Wokege:939232994852483122>
p much the same stuff she covered on release she still does
because it's not like anything changed
i don't think it's fair to say nyx had a short lifespan
that's hard to answer
just giant gap on score
other valks need to deal with
mobs at the start, she just skips with ult
has same issue
even abyss otto
PE still unskippable for the 3+ patches she dominates that boss
hmm yeah, that's fair, but even if that's the case
if you don't think about it too much
oh yeah that's actually not thaaaat bad
literally no valk can compete
PE is only necessary because of how they made HoD and she being the only one who can just skip one phase
well, more fairly designed ones
we just need better designed bosses and valks tho
i mean new herrscher never was and never will be skippable
it's 1 patch gap -> 2 patch gap -> 3 patch gap
it's kinda fun
but nowadays you're fucked if you do that
like retain nirvana and shit
you go back a few patches, game was cheaper cause you could actually just straight up skip a valk every now and then and still be very much competitive
it's just that recently nothing is skippable
the price hasn't really changed
and the worst thing isn't really the price
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
to stay on the loop
20k xtal tax
every patch is like
i mean if you look at it that way
sorry like 1 year 1/3rd
but new elf is always like 99% better than old elf
well, depends on what you mean by heavy, they have 1 year lifespan
just make sure to pick the newest one since of everything in the game, elf is arguably the only thing that actually has heavy powercreep
since newer elfs are very strong
p much every player will want an elf eventually
but the old p much never invest on elf is not 100% true anymore
i dunno how invested your acc is
with cheap way to get
yeah we can have anni elf like klein
yeah about that
it's very dumb
4* just deals so much more damage than 3*, and the ult cd literally dictates some fights
dudu elf is like literally different elf from 2 -> 3 -> 4 stars
i mean it's mihoyo
and the charged attack thing at 4*
switch cd reset at 3*
just to twist the knife
yeah now that sounds more believable
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
and selune counts as gen 0
carv has theory that ely elf is final elf of gen 2
well that depends
if you are pulling
and then pull on it on release
but just wait for new one
not because it's whale stuff or w/e
at this point i literally wouldn't pull any elf
of everything, really don't bother with back investing on elf
when you do, just pull the newest one
that would likely not be much
so if new elf is just same numbers + rime trauma
since WE is already so ahead of all others
but because of that, i really doubt next ice elf will have even higher numbers
without WE
i wouldn't recommend trying to follow a WE ref
it makes a fair difference
especially since the elemental damage taken% it gives is p undiluted on ice teams
yeah WE is actually v big
i've said this before, but WE is the highest damage taken% elf in the game
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
ss PE can't even 840
wow! i got dragged!
4 huodou in one patch
i guess they can just shill it after
pretty weak
that'd be
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
powerful
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
no ult cd
she'll be hua-type
ely ice elf will be gives every non quantum valk -10% ult cd
ely
until herrscher lightning bio ranged dps
just wait
i'll do it after i sleep
not yet
<:morbintime:980789930441707600>
the A stands for AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH which is how i scream every time i don't crit
so skip
yeah aponia is shit in MA, the only gamemode that matters
let them expire into torus if you can't buy anything
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
ah yes i read skills and i'll pretend to agree
didn't you get griseo pri?
so worth
she's pretty
but still
FR
she is probably the hardest valk in the game
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
poor heki
true that's also based
going for her gear on release = skipping her gear on release >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> going for her gear on rerun
i mean in terms of basedness
good job
heki's disease is gone
after saying that
based
idk, i'm a balder, not a curer
hi aster
jesus everyone's got heki'd
heki's virus was inside you all this time
lmao nvm
you don't have to do it baban
look away from AE skin banner
control yourself
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
i want 2
share?
ninilao
ooh
don't you have ss tho
unironically
yeah
morning lao
on AE
2 bbbs
do 2 rots maybe
you can try not to ig
are you ulting on mob?
oh
to try to get to sp pack
like weave more autos or smth
if it's before, you can try fitting in more damage on that rot
is that after or before sp pack drop?
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
when she's on field
so you can gen some more sp on SpA
do that
and if you're not doing mixed combo on AE
you can either try to fit in more attacks in the rot
oh wait i guess prob ely TB
but you don't use her often in abyss anymore
just shui
s1 HoR 893
i see one 946 with ss HoF ss HoR
ss HoR needed i think
so proud
taihen finally catching up on craftables
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
the ult just going
oh that run is fucking satisfying as hell
huodou
HoF SpA cat 0s apparently
that looks fine tbh
when i actually have 2 max pri
maybe later down the line
i think i'm fine staying at 893 for now
took vaff 28 hours
but yeah kallen 0s is fucked up
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
probably
so she can't be that bad with FT
i think i 0s her with PE?
idk shit about her
nvm then
oh
kallen is pretty fucked up to 0s
look not to throw shade or anything but i don't think you would be able to 0s even with switch cd elf
so she can clear shied easier
and i gave the 65 one to lili LMAO
so i have one at 65 and one at 55 now
i made second sleepri
yeah you tell me
such whel
ssg
greshamlao has ss SpA <@704867526877904908>
you can almost clear with this! be happy.
LMAO
that's kinda funny
lmao
for what boss is that
carole stronk
if you can't finish in one ult
i mean at that point i think you'd rather use turg cat
oh
are you ulting more than once?
do you need sp/s on raven?
cause i feel like it doesn't matter for this run
for atk?
why you affixing that tho
same
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
that's big improvement LMAO
yeah good job
oh no
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
my carole has more atk than that
why you talking like he has good atk
prob save you 2-3 points
for sp pack
with pausing
do MA strats
yeah i was going to tell you that
who knows right
yeah i think i'll try
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
oooh
i think it's the lightning
idr which one is the andrius global slaccs more
global slaccs like crazy on andrius
you'd be surprised
eh
which is the case for nirv/lower invested team in RL
you'd rather just use turg cat
if you'd need more than one raven ult tho
since you can kill with one raven ult
in RL, raven is better than turg cat
you can steal it again
there u go
<a:deadlao:943923331097321513>
tbh sounds fun
and grab stuff from that
you can look at rl ref
sorry
who makes ag3 refs
i don't know anyone
yeah uh
lmao
heki is in a3?
wait
but also 8pts dist higher
like slightly lower than 600 score
there's a HoF here
i'm pretty sure it can't increase in the middle of a round
ty dearly
full answer is: no one fucking knows lmao
simple answer is: the better the players play, the higher disturbance
no for us normal people please
is rl right now?
what disturbance
but it def is a thing on first ult
back to seele is a lot more noticeable
both ways
poe has atk speed
same reason too
SN also has fast ult, same inputs as AE
same thing on SN
it basically forces the atk speed of the normal attacks onto the combo/ult
is because of margrave B atk speed
the reason those fast stuff works
for some reason mihoyo devs made it so atk speed don't affect 2nd atk of the string
only 1st/3rd/4th
can't be 2nd attack of string
as with every fast combo/fast ult on AE
can literally be press atk -> hold ult
just use an attack and then ult in the middle of the attack animation
fast ult is very simple
i can look for one
slow ult is like fucking 3 years long
but like after you get used to them
kinda hard to tell the difference at the start
they're really easy to do
fast ults will change your life
<@385655541248163840> main improvements will come from ae fast combos and fast ult there
turg cat is harder than raven
i don't think she's easy
meanwhile i'm stuck in nirv
everyone having fun in RL
yeah those
kinda
train AE anicancels
yeahh kill on ult, that's pretty
do mixed -> black on mob
you should train anicancels
based wallpaper
it's like ult-lite
that applies debuffs on enemies
on AE
you should end with BBB
if you're not ulting
every rot you do
so like
and black combo on mob doko
<@385655541248163840> anicancel doko
yeah sure
elf is weird
that looks pretty okay
so literally any anicancel is impossible for them lmao
magerylao has dodge and ult all on face buttons
oh that doesn't look that bad
i found diavoros
thank u carl
yeah but i'm a slut, it's different
i should sleep
LMAO
bitches
yeah and you know what being good in abyss doesn't give you?
and MA are idiots
why does abyss get to be malder
jk i'm slacc
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
doesn't apply to me
if you're not hardcore
but that's so much asterite.....
optimally i should go wafer
that's fucking scary
you can buy 200 per patch through there
100 wafer costs 60
take it away carv i'm sick i have an excuse
math is hard
wait
yeah
duh
if you need asterite
but even for scrap value you'd still go skill mats first
for cost ofc you'd just go skill mats
but if you're scrapping it for asterite
oh i meant like not cost
1 skill mat scraps into 240
yeah
oh wait no you're right
it's not hard to figure out actually, it's skill mats lmao
skill mats or straight asterite
i wonder what's better asterite value
since i already have everything available
so 110 more
i have 295
i spent 595
just plan it out so you spend 1k at the end
it's 1k in total
^ for eden event
okay keilo
generally doesn't matter, can go just for sp stuff
it's not in announcements in NA yet
the real global
ah shit i thought it was here for global
wouldn't you rather use turg cat then
you following that ref from earlier?
why bd
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
on first rerun with no wishing well
literally went TTTTMM before first B
me being whel and pulling for 2 TB
and that isn't even
and i hope that's true LMAO
decided i won't ever need 3 TB
i think i got rid of one T and turned MB into B
i had TTTTMMB for a while
based
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
on other teams?
without turg
turg cat
would you even use
yeah that's what elishua meant
AE and eden is situationally BiS
isn't she 125 sp too? but for pardo it's for cope
only 2 characters that use 3pc margrave basically
yeah okay then it's fine
literally haven't touched her lmao
125 too?
wait how is sp cost for eden
yeah for M it's optimal
the second sswords
both
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
now show the sswords
eli will never have sp issue shua
holy
damn you're getting spoonfed the affixes
sure you can take it as that
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
would be for flex reason
so double sp/s wouldn't be optimal
slug you really want sp% red
either way i wouldn't be sad if you didn't get it
i mean it's unintended
yes
per stig
1 chance
then that's it for that stig
if you don't
good job
you get sp/s
if when you unlock the new affix line
use the thing that unlocks a new affix line
no
yes
<:RaidenThumbsup:873489374803816468>
with other global players
fits right in
heki
i can't answer this question here
wait fuck
i can also be free
well for the right price
damn
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
whale for me instead
i'm a they/them user in real life
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
let them suffer
and we get like a kinda-ER themed patch
like next arc could pick up from there somehow
we could have more ER related story after
5.9 concludes the main story ER arc
<a:Love:534242801131454516>
i can take you
that looks comfy
whoa i get to pings now
i've learned so much since then
it's been x years since you've passed away, teacher
maybe himeko's could be read by kiana
mobius got her's read by klein
who
+eat
🍃
gimme a sec
have fun²
yeah!
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i think it's my fault prob
take care of yourself
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
oh the damage isn't that bad huh
just me failing
nothing interesting going on dw
<:Sadge:715448677162024980>
hate that
fcs?
wait
that sounds like fun
this do be crit baldy too
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
stamina
that's just
oooh
little ducks?
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
time to learn doom
well anyway
that's fucked up
:D
that's the fun of it!
it's crit city over here
to clear shield
i also need to crit everything before FT QTE
if i don't kill on ult
but i don't think i can 946
i need to auto attack a bit with FT
if not
it dies then
and if i crit perfectly
switch into CH -> put cross down -> evade to cancel cross animation -> charged attack -> switch into BB -> weapon active + elf ult -> time ult for perfect retaliation -> QTE CH in -> evade to cancel QTE animation -> QTE FT in -> weapon active -> time ult for perfect retaliation
it's uh
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
and i don't think i'm good enough for 946
since i already got 893
i should prob move on to doom
oh be careful pls
start stream -> get score (true combo)
nvm
on stream
crit issue
i'm uh
me on MA but the opposite
mihoyo indie dev
i swear to god
???? if it's different in abyss
it's both
lmao
counts as combo
for some reason
carole air charged
you can probably actually
just pull on the new gear that will be cheaper and better <:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
i will disagree with that for the same reason i'm disagreeing with pulling on carole on rerun
i am absolutely not saying to pull on griseo rerun
or like close at least
4/4 griseo on release
oh not 4/4 griseo on a rerun
if it costs like 30 pulls for one of those, you'll likely have gotten 2/4 on griseo
T/B of paganini is going to cost 10 pulls
like the thing is, you're talking like
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
forget meta
just pull on skins
kinda based
but if you have the choice between spending xtal on either, you choose the better one
it absolutely is
i'm not saying carole is bad, or that her geared won't be enough to retain RL
like investing on griseo or carole
between the 2 valks
lmao petition to mihoyo to give stigs shoes
on the worse of the 2
why would you spend xtal
i mean absolutely but the question is
^
at least imo
yeah p much
okay, so without memes, skipping griseo cheap banner so you can back invest in carole gear on rerun is not what i'd recommend, to say lightly
maybe on 5.9
so not 5.8 at least
they didn't do heimdall with different weather in beta did they?
yeah i guess that's fair but
idr what weather it is
do you think it'll become HoT boss?
really? isn't heimdall HoF boss?
not that hard
just get lucky
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
yeah that's why it's called an average
it's 76 on avg
<:RaidenCopium:878364003880030208>
surely a great choice
yeah 4/4 mobius so you can skip on griseo banner
<:ganyuConfused:979144263742943272>
and you make fun of heki's choices?
wait you have an AF?
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
yes you are the only player on all of global without AF
who
uh as different choices of dps, not a single team
you can use HoR mobius SpA
HoS type is not necessarily BKE tho
oh
<a:MeiQuestion:930749563655061514>
are they
sora? chibipiyo sora? i'd fucking pawn my house for 5*
<:sleepy:914211439286304778>
you think i'll read patch notes for old story changes?
i don't even read story
that's interesting
oh you don't have to finish a past story arc to start a new one
and it fucking attacks herself
story teri put judah down
wait i need to get another screenshot
what the fuck is wrong with mihoyo
stuff being in beta =/= leaks
not leaked, it was on the beta
only one dk for 10 atk
there it is peeps
pocket size lao
pleb
yeah if they didn't then wfp would've personally killed mihoyo staff
<a:dalaodalaodalao:959706475394117632>
sasuga carvlao lorelao
yeah
damn not even 9*
<:poke_uwu:662578981094162442>
keichan
carvlao took keilo pills
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
you figure out it's impossible to do without
but when you actually try follow any ref and do anything competitive
where avg honkai player will be eh who cares it's useless
it's going to be something very small
that's too much
fuck everyone
more like -5% ult cd
20 global atk?
i don't think that counts but if it does it'd be 13th
6 on each side
you can count, there's 12 total spots
that's the mirrored spot of AF
new slot, i think it's the first dk that doesn't need sync to get 10 atk
impossible objective
<:TrollDespair:947945944090026015>
but not that slacc
this week will be a lot more slacc to t2%
last week was hell
i mean tbf
oh okay
cause i could see it being easily portuguese lmao
are you sure yours is spanish
yeah about that....
that's a dark souls boss
<:tericrosshic:640175520146784287>
5 minute fight
handel FR
there u go
wait
<:No:761601587843432539> 🧀
but i got no refs for that
you can try with eden
more TF i think
ye
fr handel
then do bella hot
handel?
and do your best with turg fish
you can use this rot as base
HoT actually doesn't score badly
you can run triple phys if you want
FR
my nyx sucks
maybe first sss boss i'll cap?
tona is actually supposed to be very braindead with nyx
oh yeah that's some bs
and that boss doesn't even have rng
you're thinking of the wrong boss
should be chill
yeah 46080
sure
i mean if you don't care and want easy clear and worse rewards
no
fucks w your score tho like baban said
so the longer you take = the easier it gets
it's an option you can turn on, it basically makes your valks stronger every second that passes
are you on buffed mode?
ssss
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
7tr not released yet
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
yoink
yeah
people might not know that's the case since if you only pull on expa then, then already got on this banner = own
since banners like that are only on release
the distinction from already got on this banner vs own is important to make tho
can make a difference
lv35 -> lv50 is +5% tdm taken on enemy
it is a good amount important
heki good gear arc
my gaming mouse is lv35 still
that doesn't even look that cope lmao
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
good luck king
so you can get away with some shit
i think i 893 without collapsing him lmao
back in masters
doesn't look awful
you can prob read on description of banner what it is, though i don't know anyone who has pulled on expa equipment to vouch LMAO
<:SmugSage4:314264526776434698>
do you want me to list out what i have
support gear is just that powerful nowadays
1 complete team >>>>>> 2 decent teams
global rl <:sleepy:914211439286304778>
and you'll be fine
for global RL you can use SA
skill issue
that's not how mihoyo do supports anymore
i think she will eventually, but not right now
i don't think anyone thought griseo was going to be niche
griseo everywhere <a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i agree but i'll say that while being mean
if you play well you can prob retain
marco polo prob
gogo carv <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
oh yeah i guess that makes sense
lmao good one
he makes yt videos
keeb's sanity is gone
pick one
\> honkai player
\> sane people
do you not see the equipment
that's a dalao run
both times they change valk immediately
yeah they dodge twice in there
this then?
or i guess -1
schro M is +1
?
for doom
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
getting closer!!
trick is literally get lucky LMAO
and then video comes out
going like i finally figured out how to do nyx
keeby hyped it up for a while
that video is really funny
that's what i like to hear
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
what score are you aiming for?
i'll just pick a rot with less damage than i deal so i can have some wiggle room
kasumi: no, fuck you
deal too much damage? you're fucked
deal too little damage? you're fucked
like literally every different rank up needs a different rotation
fucking black magic
HoT kasumi is like
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
and that's not even the most cursed thing about kasumi
it's just a different type of bald where you need to measure your damage perfectly!
that's not much rng, and it is also true of every elemental shield i think
and some here too *fucks with hitcount husk*
let's add some fuckery here *fucks with sss wolf*
well elemental damage is actually too consistent
mihoyo just like
awful
it sounds
i did hear about peeps having big rng with aponia in specific, just like random small positioning changes making her deal more or less damage
<:ganyuConfused:979144263742943272>
cat uses slug TB on tona
why
yes thank you that's the link i wanted to share
you can try the like weaker versions i guess
that sounds fucked up
oh huh i haven't heard of that before
with aponia? or just in general
iriya having a meltdown
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
either that or they are just there hanging around
rinolao and mimi mitsulao are also from there but SEA division i think?
that's the one jialao is from
if you keep track about which laos i talk of
an armada
i've actually never seen a skill crit less than PE QTE
we don't need to make them bald the ult too
yeah that's enough bald
they're like
i swear they gave PE 100% crit rate on ultimate because everything else on her crit has like 5% crit rate
lmao
i mean do make fun of them LMAO
i think they're from café quanta
no but they come around in lumina every now and then
god fucking damn it
if that's who i think it is
link me that message
wait
i really want to learn how to make those memes
7tr is shit, easy skip, barely better than DoS
no 7tr demoted to agony
oh no
i mean i now understand why you were missing damage on your strats before
<:ganyuConfused:979144263742943272>
and no sss FT?
you have 2 sleepri
wait
that's going to be fun
time to farm 3 fucking AL valk for a while
oh hmm i think i'll be at ss3 ely by then
i dunno how time works don't mind me
oh no wait there's still a good while until beta
wait isn't beta like next week?
we only need lightning cat and then cat will be everywhere
the last fire valk we got was cat, it's been a good while
and then we get a real fire valk in anni
she can just be SpA 2
i think it's just a lot of new whales, since there's so much to pull for nowadays, if you're catching up you have lots to spend on. i think (hope) i'm getting close to catching up
tbh at this point most of the characters just do dumb bullshit and mihoyo decides on their type based on what they want to shill
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
i'll unironically take you up on that offer
this was me yesterday
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
she could be a very niche dps like spina after all
yeah imagine if a valk had all phys on the game mode she came from but then they made her a different type of damage on release! that makes no sense! oh we're not talking about SW?
true we get a new fire support it's just replacing cat LMAO
i want too but there's too much things we don't know <:deadge:933767520085770341>
well it does cut off on extreme bad luck from focused, and people will not be baited into pulling on the expa banner, and the focused banner will last longer
so it's bad
and you're saying people will have more stuff
unless this is a 500 iq take
gacha got... better
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
i still have 2 cubes here
oh
abyss <:sleepy:914211439286304778>
if i ever decide to actually care about abyss
i think it's good for abyss tho
664 is -3 from 712, which i guess isn't that bad but <:deadge:933767520085770341>
so i'm not even capping LMAO
because i only got up to 664 last time
and i'm speaking realistically here
for +1?
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
so like, one of my ss gacha valk realistically 0 difference with judah lmao
cause it's shit
and no one caps that boss either way
and s2 -> sss is 712 -> 728
like s0->s2 is 696 -> 712 in sss wolf
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
rankups barely change anything
if you're using judah
the funny thing is
trust
you don't need basilisk
look at my f2p mobius
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
only 3 months until sss ely
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i'm gonna buy 2 LE frags -> turn into witch orbs -> buy an LE frag with witch orbs
that's not bad conversion
hmm so it's like 8 AL = 28 AW
don't woooorry about it
eh it's only like that cause i just bought out monthly AW
that's how me stash's lookin
epi is heki's friend, it's rubbing off
2 months now lmao
for like
i've been buying FR ely CH every week
like it is completely my fault that i have 0 AL
so idk
i have no clue how many golden witch orbs one non-awakened valk gives tho
it's still an interesting question
i mean i know but
and i still need 40 ch frags for the ss2
cause rn i have 0 AL lmao
how much AW -> AL conversion do you get like that
is that worth it?
hm
that's
i'll do my best with like ss griseo on week 2
<a:pepeMeltdown:933941237021569035>
more xtals
i need more time
oh no
wait we're already week 4 of 5.7?
bruh found it by clicking on my profile
that's mean
okay if heki's the one voting for yes it's prob not the smart thing to do
should i turn my dupe bd into second sleepri
okay can i do a poll really quick
why are you two like this
damn
and i thought hakcer lied badly
LMAO
stfu bruh
i wasn't doing anything sus
oh hi carv
not me lol <- words of a liar
yeah i think it's bruh too
i'm cunny immune
thank god i'm always offline so i wont show up up there
you're getting cunny tainted
your original dad LMAO
cum isn't that liquid
i should stop talking
i'll note it down for my next cum eating session
never ate cucumber with cum
hmm
i like tet's answer
...me?
and i came back and my hu tao was dead
and ask for peeps to leave a message
were you leave your world open while you're away
i did that one thing
jesus christ nini
okay grinch
that's so nice
i was very excited
i thought you were morbin
i read true human blood
i think it's pretty fine
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
and be uglier than wyvereins
it will show less info than marisa
i'll make my own
rebooting: wow marisa's shows too little information
rebooting: okay this one is too clear, too much information, please hide some
it's insane
or some shit like that
it literally like doubles shield strenght
to CN 470
from our 450
so like
our nirv is slightly higher i think
in RL yeah, in nirv no
and that difference can be like upwards of 20-30 points off a score
SEA is like consistently like 5 or so points below global
disturbance is actually exponential, so the higher the disturbance is, the more difference one point of disturbance makes
everyone agrees it's just a typo lmao
and like
they said it's not a typo, it's actually IMA up, but it's a mistake that it's IMA up and next cycles will be QUA up
and said it's right
doubled down on that
lmao mihoyo support actually
but the only quantum stages we're having this patch are sidestages
well, actually just quantum weather changes
i mean not really, we had couatl weather change this patch and no couatl
i'm literally in global too, dumbass
so you'll prob be using turg cat too
turg cat > raven when you need more than one raven ult
send help
i don't wanna use turg cat
i'm fucked
i'm in nirvana
based
one for each s
6 ue charges
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
you'll be fine probably
don't worry about it
AKA is a slacc boss, boo
well anyway
that sounds about right
so disturbances don't go to 800s
so we made a deal to not touch her
no one uses her because she's too powerful
it's in the name
yeah she's an ssssss character
how much do you wanna cope
some are okay, some are shit
but lv88 are pretty half and half
at least
cause they're small whales
those are kinda scarier
i'd be scared about like less than lv88 peeps in RL
oh you get used to it
wtf does that mean
about what? doom?
if you have her
probably CH?
i mean i just feel like there's better characters to hold that paga
not really, she has a lot of damage but not that much
hmmm i guess you can try but i don't think she would do much
what do you have for doom tho
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
i need help with that too
i guess yeah probably
am i lazier than you
yeah
i'll get to it
don't worry about it
that's my hidden xtal stash
see i can do it whenever i want if you think about it
oh i'm not a masochist sorry

you're supposed to have this shit ingrained
you're a fossil taihen
it's either 733 or 786
there are not many scores for 700+
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
but <a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
not that i think you can 0s either way, 0s is waaaaaaaaay tighter

based
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
who's the 3rd heki again?
there's 3 i think
because there's so many hekis
that's why his name is HoD
lmao that's another acc of heki's
who needs new supports btw
skill issue?
what's with people stopping at 650s
hm
<a:ppPoof:933892036296343552>
goobai peeps
oh my 999 streamer is on
smh my head
that's how you farm sp on BKE
and connect that back into ora ora ora
which is throw lance
you can do a charged attack
after she does the ora ora ora and slams down the lance
it'll be fine probably
don't worry about it

a small scale trash fire
your acc is like
yeah just pull on himeko idt there's any better banner for you in spending event duration
as long as you have good supports
i actually don't think himeko set is too important for HoF
hmm what other options do you have
based
was that an actual irl thought you had on your mind
were you actually considering leaving the spending event at 8 pulls from collectors card
where to use those 8 pulls
so the only question is
the value is actually insane
using those 8 pulls for turg B is extremely worth it
then like
does he already have turg T
i can try i guess
what am i helping with
should we send help
wtf is going on with genshin players
i'm sorry for your trophies

i'm actually
on kin test
what i got
<@447218009749061632> wanna guess
just grab stuff to make crafting faster
if you're done with all of that
guess you can add sirin asc if you want to meme
gustav is craftable now
i dunno if ppt is still that big for sss HoD with the changes
there u go
3-5 newts, usual week will use around 2, 3 is pretty common, more is rare but still nice to have for affix and the rare weeks where it's useful
2-3 ppm, 2 is already kinda overkill tho
1 ppt, for sss HoD
gustav TM, good easy to proc phys stig, kinda low prio nowadays since there's so many options
welt TM, slightly better than ana TMB, very low prio since it generally only saves you 1 second on HoR strats if that
3 times already
given this list
i've like
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
every single one
i dunno
she sounds cool
<:feelsPhoneMan:755847895315513396>
so you don't peek at it accidentally
so be sure to mute that or w/e
<@218762069338619906> i'll make sure all leak/datamine talk will be done over at <#963273616852652095>
sure
since it's not degen room anymore
make <#963273616852652095> available for everyone
no, not unban baban
bug them about it
i'm not a mod
because degen room was just horny jail lite
it's because it's repurposed degen room
oh hmm
instead of here
<@503044914016419840> pin that over at <#963273616852652095>
8pm
yeah
<a:toodalaotorelate:959796978131271730>
<a:KleePlane:768128642638413847>

and i'm not the bad luck magnet
so if you're not the bad luck magnet
you're not the bad luck magnet?
wait
why did i become it
wait wasn't baban the bad luck magnet?
and you can pull without it around
so i take all the bad luck with me
you should wait until i'm gone
wouldn't pull when i'm around make it worse
1. it means when i'm away good things happen i think
2. i have an excuse when i fuck up
3. i can be an omen
i dunno i'd like to be a bad luck magnet
i'd take it as a good thing tbh
hmm
if i got traveller
i'd be disappointed
wow
oh i see
<:disappointGura:756520039426949270>
smh my head
baban bad luck magnet

jesus
друг

why the fuck
????
to do this test?
another test
heki has to do
LMAO
we be weird flexing
OH
<@218762069338619906> do you have the knowledge on how scoring on last stage of blockade works
boo just got morbed
take him away boys
ohiohater just logged on
the crit bald begins
but they got almost everything wrong
which is anata wa eigo ga hanasemasuka
it's meant to say do you speak english
lmao
wrong japanese
that's
if you wanna save a mei m
you can try avo m
is all
a weird setup
just
i mean i believe you if you're actually qteing in
this is not right
does QTE even have DK
qte DK in?
do you
while the true laos don't run
i'll just bathe in this
yeah sounds about right i think
oh
in exalted
without impair
you'll be able to do kallen
i don't think
weird
but i've seen it as support for some other valks i think?
mainly for PI support for nyx
useful on some MA strats
weapon active has TF
can we get a pog single digits?
but it's not bad
since undine has niche uses
it's not optimal
yeah sure
i've never needed a quantum dps lmao
hm
waifu reasons?
maxing undine is so weird
yeah i just need to level her stigs now!
happy?
a seele with max pri
there u go
cube doko
you can pri it into pta
eh just remember to save the next gacha scythe you get
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
save the congratulations when i actually cap a boss
twinsies
pleblo
i'm only pleb taking what i can get
LMAO don't do me like that
closest i have
if you got actual xy sword tho that's pretty cool
they're different
there's xy sword and dxy sword
gtx are on raids
i wish
no
through raids
you just get them for free
they still need the other dks tuned
the only ones that are kinda not like that are xy twins and an utu
yes
10 atk comes from tuning the second weapon on the same branch
yeah
you need judah to get 10 atk
and i'm missing 8 atk from fire branch
so i don't have pinions or abyss
i'm v behind on crafting
no
i don't have a 1500 yet i don't think
<:BronyaKing:646539680979877888>
i've been told, i haven't actually seen proof or checked
to unlock divine key branch and 10 atk
counts as PoS
PoS spirit
apparently
get judah from exchange and get xy from firepower
yeah i should've done that
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
i should've gotten xy sword and saved the dawei card
though i did play i got judah
yeah kinda same
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
it won't do you any good in the long run
don't get into the trap of i'll never match atk so i won't even try
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
you gotta fix that though
i can't complain anymore
yeah i feel like
bigger atk diff than s0->sss
that's like
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
also higher dist than our RL tho
but s3 AE with WE
this is s0 SW
but 7d over our dist
with WE
this is s1 SW s2 AE
from last hitcount husk
nyll's old video LMAO
here's just
wrong link lmao
wait
:painpeko:
finding refs are
3 s0 SWs in NA though
there's legit like
so yeah don't expect to with s0
last time we had hitcount husk
with s2
i actually couldn't skip clone with SW
there's a 757 with AE support
so it catches freeze buffs
usually just ult first i think
depends
yeah i remember
for what
so like, weirdly enough, HoT has lower dps requirement to skip clone and score 800+ than SW
and make the down phase longer
they can paralyse
for like HoT or aponia
because she just needs pure damage
to skip clone in RL
but for SW she p much needs like ranks and elf i think
before it gets back up
so you just need to kill it
but it can't if it's down
and then when it gets to like 4 hp bars it summons clone
like, at 6.5 hp bars husk goes down
just deal a lot of damage basically
then you can do upwards of 800+
if you can skip clone
if you don't have enough damage to skip clone
so like i think you can score around 750s at max with SW
i think around 700 should be possible with that team
yeah i think that's moderate-big skill issue
and i can tell you if moderate skill issue or big skill issue
how are they scoring
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
skill issue
i'll go all the way and say
very different
that is
shoes are a piece of clothing
you can still draw them using sexy shoes
it's just shoes
wasn't it literally just the shoes
<@309634550273933314>

edgy

i came back to genshin
yeah
some of it was fine
and like character story
i did read genshin main story
i'd say same but i'm a thorough skip gamer
how's your carole?
i think that would be safer
you can try both
ag1 warrior
<:E_RaidenPat:882522815532781618>
no thoughts in my head
i only press buttons
to read
that have the patience
no i mean i applaud y'all
like i do be brute forcing RL
yeah surely you can
afaik about TP she doesn't work really well without SS
i've never been there so no clue but
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
bald's the game
bald?
or else i miss out on event reward
i have to skip
and then when it's last second
so i leave them for last second
i am chronically lazy
look it's not my fault
they're all like 23/23 22.8/23 23/23
every CN ref maker has like perfect affix for HoF for some reason
so you can actually follow CN ref LMAO
HoF is one of the best characters to use it on
i mean tbf
saving until i quit the game
i'm doing the same thing as i did with crowns
whoa you're using those?
i have the mechanical skills of a small and old piece of bread
but i am objectively a bad player
i'll take criminal
LMAO
1. i suck at the game actually
2. i don't read stig/skills
3. i skip most of story and wait until lorelao tell me
i'll list them out so it's not weird
i mean it's not weird reasons
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
so i'll bathe on the good rep
LMAO i won't say the reasons why you might give up on me cause it might change your mind
i don't like the chocolate one personally
you don't like the strawberry one?
well actually i have no clue
eh realisitcally
but then you can change into lee TB
i feel like ragna is better
hmm from reading effects
or am i safe for now
have you given up on me yet carv
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
than before
even better
is that
<:KianaDumb:909232418052014171>
wtf diluc?
i was like
lmao
imagine having coins
maybe?
<@482139585355448333> is a fossil
<a:nou_hh:833500436526530570>
me pleb
so babanlao
i do say this again, last week was a hard one to place high
powerful
<:BronyaKing:646539680979877888>
so that it's still a griseo signet only run
and they chose one that doesn't matter
and they had no choice in one of the doors (or they had already completed griseo at that point) so they had to choose a su signet
and the answer is no, i think the user was trying to do a griseo signet only run
because of the random su signet
baban means if combo count affects griseo performance at all
hler gamer?
my irene is lv1 still
powerful
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
on tomorrow exalted
also congrats <@171082989046988800> !
since no zhenyi rerun for like 4 patches <:deadge:933767520085770341>
it was pretty understandable
for a while
LMAO to be fair
smh my head
global boosting
so there's nothing new to discuss
it's also quiet because new patch just released
<#973924771727290399> is for beta and officially announced stuff
<@&963274168705630248>
since it's just horny jail lite
maybe repurpose degeneral
for leak and datamine talk
create a channel
we should prob like
LMAO
he's asked for us to at least spoiler mark it
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
carv's gonna block ya
out in the open
if you're talking about leaked/datamined content
i mean it's your fault if you can't
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
why's that
the power of <:morbintime:980789930441707600>
i just gave this server
i forgot about nqn
oh no
<:morbintime:980789930441707600>
at wfp
what's going on
aren't you sss HoT?
but i just reposted the one nini posted with spoiler mark
i could look around if you want
i dunno i think that one came from wfp
we have morbintime for the mp4 and morbnifyingglass for the gif
so i'll be on touch with 999 memes LMAO
my streamer is starting to play vlr
<@309634550273933314> about 999
so next one, pyramid
sw bchip, cat spending event, HoT bingo
i really don't want it to be but we just had
is pyramid
my theory
kokorbius
so it could be similar if it is real
but yeah we got PE datamines back in 5.4 because she was available in the last part of the story of that patch
leak/datamine stuff
i can repost
for carv
spoiler mark that
oh also
i mean we think it's not up
in abyss
like at most 3 minutes or so for a fight
but it's way shorter
while honkai can have even harder tricks
do multiple hard tricks in like 20+ mins
because speedrunning is very much endurance fight
hmm it's very different i think
is very sexy
just because i care about it
to do something that is arguably very dumb
i think the fact that i give all of myself
yes
i could list them all
yeah! multiple things in me
there are multiple things in myself i think are sexy
yeah!
it's sexy i think
and sucking ass at that
but my niche is devoting all my time into one thing
i mean i feel that
interesting approach
but i have an image to maintain
kinda based
which tbf
i'd go from ma balder -> monkey boy (unisex)
nah that would erase completely all the reputation i'd have here
i think i could voice act that
activates the dog instincts
but it wouldn't make sense for beach skin
she do be riding her alright
i mean
yeah those !
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
and those foam sword things as the lance
i want like those circular floaties as a shield
just goes squoink on dodge
she could have a floater for shield lmao
maybe griseo or mobius
a flamechaser
i'll bet on
hmmm
watch
heki bout to get HoS skin before HoS
like gold pins n stuff
but better rewards outside of that
it gives same amount as pri mats i think
blockade is single player and i think it's supposed to be harder?
i think it's supposed to alternate between raid and blockade
>:
LMAO she really does
both for the sp gen and +2% fire damage
yeah i really want her ss
cause you can just craft scott M and get away with it probably
but likely not worth the balls unless you're in a very very specific situation
like welt M you mean
i mean sure
if it came on bp i'd recommend it
shui i still value very highly
welt is eh
all very big
zither + shui and KoR
dante which is nice
with neb + margrave (it wasn't craftable then)
it also had nuts gear too
she's insane
it'd be HoS 100%
if i could sss any gacha valk
i've said it before
yeah
but in MA it's very big
and it makes a big difference there too
because she cheats ig
she still gets the 40 starting sp
even in abyss
a monster of a valk
yeah sss HoS she just becomes
if they don't, it won't change much
if they enable a different rot it can be like 20 point difference
and sp gen ones like that can be pretty divisive in the right conditions
but in nirvana those small edges can make a big difference
it's like in the grand scheme of things pretty small
it prob won't be a big deal
but like before nirvana
more sp gen
it can make or break a score in nirvana
ss HoS is similar to ss AE
imo
she was better than turg is right now
like when they gave AE on bp
and the thing is, if it's not coming this next season, it's coming on the other, so they'll get to it sooner or later
so if it's time for turg, it's time for turg
just how old it is
to give it for free
mihoyo historically doesn't care much on how good a piece of equipment is
i wouldn't be surprised if they made it available
yeah
that's DA, asuka, HB and save HoS for next season
and then save 4.6 for next season
i think we'll have 4.4, 4.5, 4.7 + dante rerun
but it's not necessarily in order
like this season was HoT stuff (4.1), FR stuff (4.2), FT stuff (4.3) and goemon nuada (the random one, like 3.x)
it's not really random, they usually do 3 sets in order of release + 1 old one
like in 6.2 beta lmao
the next bp season?
yeah i could see nyx HoS
i think nyx is pretty fair
it's 2 patch to one, 2 patch to the other
no
if you're asking about what's coming in the season after that
next season is DA and BKE
we get 2 valk per season
bout to get a mappa mare boys
mine was like 700 to promote lmao
comatose bracket
580 for promote??
jesus
where like 550 promotes
wtf kinda bracket are you in
both
at RL kasumi
how high did you even score
yeah mine's been piling up for 5 months now
i just really don't want to use resin LMAO
no i'm talking about me un-retiring from genshin
maybe dm?
i don't right
do i have to spend resin
well she's ss0
my mobius with judah is like 1300 i think
poor taihen
LMAO
they're not obtainable anymore
before they changed artifacts
yeah, i'm saying the old ones that i kept
how did that go?
oh lmao
idk what those are lmao
yes?
but i'm sure if you start now they'll update it
yeah that too
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
just start as soon as possible
like the thing with honkai is
good banners
i'd say so prob
guess i'll keep mine
oh the gladiator/wanderers troupe box is now unobtainable huh
are they making it easier since i left
first tried it
huh
yeah that's tka, the sex name
oh griseuoooh?
sex girl?
weeks like these are the hardest to score high
legit impressed
pretty fucking sick week to do it to
congrats!!!
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
if only i could venmo some to honkai
coin
to flex
do you want me
you can assume i'm playing like shit
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
i think my streams are pretty shit usually
i dunno if it'll be watchable
genshin abyss for once
i can stream abyss if anyone wants
sleep well!
literally haven't touched abyss since january
2022/1 waning phase
lmao
<:Theresad:476616089178996746>
yae release
since like
is abyss harder
guess i didn't lose that much progress on the farming achievement lmao
oh wait didn't teapot get disabled for like 4 months
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
there's a new challenger?
D:
oh no the lost progress on the farming achievements
bored already
i'm uh
lmao
and quit
i pulled yae
when i left
460 torus
oh
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
it sucks
yeah that!
it's the lightning one
but it sucks
which i forgot
and a himeko battlesuit
striker fulminata, mei augment
there's 2 sf
lmao L
yeah
carv said it's good i think
actually i also want to try the event out
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
prepare yourself tet
time to update the genshin
LMAO i'm actually doing it
i have time
and log off
and beat tet
i want to log in
literally quit the game already lmao
my most prised posession
i've done the leyline one
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
oh i see
i quit like 6 months ago and i have more time played and more achievements than you
oh wow you're kinda baby
well i love roza but MC sucks balls
that's why FR needs pri
like as long as the base valk isn't shit she doesn't need pri
just base numbers
cause you don't need pri to be powerful <:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
no (thank god)
i literally balded achievement in genshin like i bald honkai MA
was like -3 or -4
i think the close i got to achievement max
what the fuck 650?
oh no
i'm at 523 from back when i quit
you can get to 600 now?
oh sheeesh!!
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
honkai won't kill itself
*looks at himeko*
most of the times honkai won't kill itself
i like the purple
tp probably
that's praxis
oh based
<:teridum:846151270916947998>
cause i was writing that
i also missed all the talk
oh yeah that makes sense, it's probably from japanese, they like to abbreviate stuff to the first syllables of each word
ロリータコンプレックス (lolita complex) ->
ロリコン (lolicon)

and because the M in complex (コ**ン**プレックス) is the katakana for N sound, when romanizing that they decided to do it as lolicon instead of lolicom

same thing happened with computers in japanese
パーソナルコンピュータ (paasonaru compyuuta, personal computer) ->
パソコン (pasokon)
i feel like it's better than being a cunny attacker
wait is being a cunny defender a good or a bad thing?
that's scary as fuck
what the fuck they do that?
cry harder <:duduL:963697489179975710>
🛳️
🚢
yes but we can say hoe here
well for that one i kinda agree though, the worst thing a character can do in a story is make me dislike them, not actual like bad morally stuff
people be like making callout posts

and they actually ship x/x, what kind of psycopath would actually do stuff like that...
13 paragraphs later about that

...and they killed a person in 2013
LMAO yeah i feel that, there is like a big thing about cancel culture where they focus on dumb shit, so funny though
well tbf tectone is kinda of a troublemaker <:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
honestly i just find it really really funny, genshin is just like the most sterile game ever, there's literally 2 or 3 things at most you can describe at problematic
oh no doesn't sound like it then, the one i'm thinking about is about an autistic woman i think that 4chan picked to stalk to hell and back and like a ton of people got seriously extremely attached to her
oh wait is it that 4chan stalker thing?
she is funny as fuck, i love her sense of humor
that's a compliment tbh
so many moving parts
twitch drama is way too much for me
yeah joji is pretty based
xqc is like a train wreck you can't look away from
more like what didn't he do LMAO
i would let him get away with it just by coining that phrase
tbh heated gamer moment is very funny
eh i can see that
which is a pretty low bar
he's not a racist LMAO
i don't think his humor is particularly funny anymore? like too 13 y/o for me but
idubbbz isn't bad, like very edgy and the humour isn't for everyone but def doesn't stand on the wrong side of the issues
i mean could be worse, could be jontron
oh i'm sorry
ie. being a dick lmao
i mean i can say that i only get so mad at diavoros because i did similar stuff to what he does
i mean it's very good just very sus
yeah
made in abyss
i think my problematic faves are like
you can just sell the nfts without making them nfts and he'd prob make same or more amount of money lmao
well that's also true lmao
that's kinda sad
cause it's not as known as it should be
i do need to share this ig
morbed
i prefer the rotten version <:deadge:933767520085770341>
...minecraft ost?
fucking gooooooooo
let's
cherry too powerful
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
there's a lot of good old anime tho
pretty cis, to say
yeah, it's around same level as cis as me wanting to take estrogen to grow boobs so i can use a binder to hide them
4kids censoring just goes they fall through and there's a shadow realm portal
there's one duel where they're on top of a building and when they lose they fall
it's actually really funny
shadow realm is actually just 4kids censoring
shadow realm actually
yugioh shadow dimension
that's like
it's actually just based, it was going to be destroyed so they kinda saved it, and is there anything more cool than skating in a church? bathed by the colored lights? i don't think so
did you see that one church a bunch of teenagers bought and transformed into a skate park?
well after that they're not angels anymore i don't think
*grabs the densest anime available* i watch this because they're gay in this part
fucking love that
LMAO i watch it for the plot
when you put it like that
but bald too
i mean i more related to her not being able to make decisions and accept the future
LMAO actually true
i kinda vibe with her
is homura insane
<a:chad:969329762206093372>
that's the chad flag
i don't wanna think about it flag
it's the non binary of sexuality
just go pan
yes i'm attracted to some men like su lady of the lake
lmao
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
i know
that sounds like a kink
yeah that's fair
or bi men
i mean it absolutely applies to gay men i feel like
yeah that makes sense
so i don't think i've been straight really lmao
idk i think i've always been down to suck some dick (i'm amab)
compulsive makes more sense
oh
computer heterosexual?
what's a comphet
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
fucking godfather on a mafia movie
i was straight once....
<a:COGGERS:772315943254097951>
turning down the brightness of the phone
just like
not assuming what you were before, it just came up in my mind
LMAO the image of something going from girl -> demigirl is so funny in my head
also based
based
gender: your problem
tbh based, at one point you do be like well i'm clearly not cis, but you know what this is also not? my problem lmao
it's inevitable
i'll welcome you into the trans club when you're ready
yes nothing to worry about
LMAOOOO
like aponia would go to the M's but she doesn't wear a bra so it doesn't matter
i'm just assuming it's like higher letter more booba or something
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
oh god you doing calculus to find out your booba size
if we made trans people acceptable, then everyone would want to be trans! every man wants to be a woman, you shouldn't get drawn into it
LMAO or like yes, everyone gets the urges to suck your best friends cocks, you're just supposed to hide it like everyone else
is so funny
this shit
is gay homophobic people in deep deep denial
my favorite type of content
okay i found it
oh god i just searched cumblr by accident on google
you know what my favorite type of content is
i mean i'm sure if you look through ben shapiro videos you can find one where he says lesbian couples in tv is actually destroying civilisation or something
based
you're one of those kids who will come out to your parents at 20 and they'll go we know
anything but the lerbian couple marry
that's what we were warned about by the steven universe haters
prob can get through them quite fast with genshin character
they have more like around 10-20m hp
well actually not 300m hp
and they deal like 600 damage to our 40k hp characters
they have like 300m hp pool while our characters deal 50k damage
it'd be really boring
if we just import a honkai boss into genshin
i mean tbh
(assigned gay at twitter poll)
AGATP
i love them so much
<a:CATBEHOMEFROMWORK:666060986930692116>
and then the sequel
<a:CATBEGOINGTOWORK:666060986536689671>
my new favorite emotes
hey wanna see
and then he made it canon
him being gay won out
to see if the people who played the game thought snake was gay or not
<@309634550273933314> did you know the writer of 999 did a twitter poll
i hear mei beach skin actually enables some 0s kills that normal mei can't
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
but <:Shrug:616394597211439118>
like playing for a few years should give you some stuff that can't be bought that easily yk
i mean i guess, still kinda dumb
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
kinda fucked up
new player comes in, spends money and gets an acc better than theirs in like 3 months of playing
someone in my armada complains a lot about stuff like this
that's kinda scary
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
just make more credit cards
yeah with that attitude maybe
with the power of the credit card, the limit is you imagination
HoS and turg, the 2 pillars of honkai impact
especially if you mainly care about abyss and not MA
and look forward for new releases mostly
just like, grab the old op stuff like HoS and turg
most of the people i know don't recommend back investing at all mostly
the thing with honkai is that investing on new patches is just generally way better value than back investing
are more important than sswords
paganini or cezanne
like i'd definitely say
it's just really hard to give recommendation without knowing more about a player setup
but generally, sswords is more consistent and deals more damage, while being way easier to play with
so under some circumstances it's better
you might need those spikes to kill in one ult
for a boss like HoD
it deals more damage than sswords
and during those spikes
gpn has like dps spikes
depends
well
yeah basically
the answer is prob not
and you gotta ask yourself do you think the avg honkai player is good enough to play with gpn HoS?
gpn is way harder to use
but also
it's not a bad set, does make her stronger, but not by much compared to gpn
hard to say tbh
i'd prob say for a good portion of honkai playerbase it's prob a skip?
it do be typo impact
so it doesn't surprise me
i mean maincord fucking takes up a good 30-35% of global supply of copium
LMAO <:Clueless:920566094832492554>
HoF and HoT were pretty obvious too
i mean it's obvious but they don't really try to not make it obvious
it will be your last
if we're getting herrscher on 5.9, she'll likely show up on story
i will commit a warcrime upon your body
there u go

gimme a sec
i have the thing
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
don't wanna roll for 5 of those
i'd like cry
i'm kinda glad, if it just became better newt B
i have had broccoli before on pizza, it's really nice
i wasn't the one asking about it, but thank you
unless you're doing like schro bb dps on HoV or smth
it's too slow for current strats
and even if she had
cause she doesn't have combo
cat is combo
i was going to say
oh
i dunno if there's many combo attacks you can get off easily
can't use bastet TM cezanne B on BB anymore i guess
i don't even know if that's better or worse
3x combo
i got broccoli with a gun
<:mp_brocdie:585574418261082152>
yes
you understand me, yk
i mean not romantically, more like
that's like a way to get keilo points
LMAO
i'd think you're into me
honestly if you sent me broccoli emoji
broccoli is pretty cute
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
sleep at day
it's time to go full degen then
hit up aim labs
gotta aim train
skill issue
why is it a square he says after typing the emote blue_square
just do finality
i think so?
that enables you to get 2p without luck
but not good enough to sacrifice the flexibility of the box
guess it could be situationally better
but -5% damage taken
1s longer duration
that's just worse newt
i wouldn't use B alone
nah just wait
yeah slug is like very luxury rn
zhenyi is kinda debatable
turg i'd say is exception
with how fast mihoyo is releasing stuff
especially recently
you shouldn't back invest
like 90% of the time in honkai
that is also true about p much every old content in honkai
that is true but
you can't just faceroll everything with the one best setup
after you play enough, you understand that there's not one size fit all
it just comes from not playing the game
avg understanding of game meta by players is just very 1 dimensional
more like 50/50
griseo is coming oh no the powercreep every other support is SHIT or
griseo is coming, not better than carole on 100% of situation she SUCKS skip her
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
and hua is just incredible
and FT looks bops
i really like twins aesthetic
yeah!
just like very infuriating, people acting like they care about a part of the game that they very clearly don't give a fuck <:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
LMAO and i'll do it again
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
i dunno what else there is to do in honkai besides bald
i mean i can only assume
go like smell their feet or w/e people who don't bald do at this game
tf you faking caring about meta then
and i'm like
you tell them oh how high have you placed before and they go i don't bald
tbf it's a very complicated game, i just really dislike people who talk like they know more than anyone while not knowing shit
LMAO that's a funny one
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
time to roll for sss HoS
<:Wokege:939232994852483122>
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
it's just like a lot of regurgitating what other people say instead of looking at the meta
is comparable to that of an old potato
the knowledge of an avg honkai player
i've been to maincord
even then, prob won't just consume newt's uses
idk
oh maybe
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
stronger newt but needs ult to proc
needing ult to proc is just very situational
turg still living
eh we said the same thing about aslaug and turg
you won't be able to tell
so even if they say the truth
cause like half of the chat lies, other half doesn't know what the fuck is going on
i mean i'm sure you get used to it at one point
if i stream honkai for randos and they start backseating i'd fucking melt LMAO
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
god i'd be one of those streamers that would permaban on sight of backseating
her booba do be warping space
yeah eden wields the twins of eden alright
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
by singing like shit
i'll be the exception
<a:winkeline:587369205482127361>
best way to train is to practice
you just have to get better at being
so if you aren't
i mean it's just a skill right
i only need to be interesting now
i'm very stupid
i think i have half what it takes to be a vtuber
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
yeah you got a good voice
sorry i play dumb as a hobby, i should stop but it entertains me a lot
why you checking them
who's mike
you think you're more important than my bidet?
like HoS ult
that's a fucking finisher line
<:Childpeepothink:920083702090969118> <a:TeaTime:933888221530710057>
yeah i can check
+10 atk soon?
sheeesh
you got AF?
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
send all
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
will solve it
no simple bundle
the mat drought runs deep, neko
suck at the game
i, in the other hand
nini is too modest
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
ever since i got to exalted
i have been taking Ls
since they'll get shilled
i wanna say 7tr and griseo pri would prob be higher prio once they release
you do it then
and if you feel like the point increase is worth the mats
and see how you do with lv50
prob just wait until jizo comes around
if you mean like max it
pri hekate, yeah
no sss could hurt but you won't like extremely suck if that makes sense
yeah, she used to get okay scores without pri, so that's not necessary
since ss bosses were easy as fuck
not this past week tho
depending on the week you could t100
you can prob retain RL with that
if she's 5*
work? sure
is it a bad thing to be quiet
to be a nyx boss
they're forcing couatl
yeah
it's a typo lmao
it's the awful one with tona right?
i wonder if i can clear that side stage with PE in RL
mihoyo shilling PE even in anti-PE weather
i know it's not that easy though, but yeah <a:WorryHug_luma:530613959095615500>
so why should you care about their complaining?
you prob wouldn't take advice from these kinds of people
here's the thing
why can't you sell them? i'm sure they still work for learning probably
what that's fucked up
they'd prob get sued
i wonder if they could make a joke about it
<:RozaScout:928714351534309386>
LMAO i am the *Herrscher of the Void*, and this void is 30cm long, you're welcome for the hard work
to measure stuff? kinda boring
oh
what the hell
wait herrscher is a word?
cursed i think
yeah sounds harsh
oh you mean the language?
i'd take a german
and it sucks yeah
portuguese has grammar gender
crazy stuff
it's a different language
it's almost like
is kinda hard
actually learning syntax stuff
i got up to 500 or so memorised before
eh i'm not that much scared of kanji anymore
<:ganyuConfused:979144263742943272>
but now i think it would be better to know chinese because of honkai
it would be fun to know
i should prob go back to learning japanese
what the fuck this is just portuguese with extra steps!
and i was like
yeah that's how i felt too but then i took advanced english classes
na only opens in like 6 hours
i am jealous
eu has er open already?
i suck at language classes lmao
powerful
i'm sure you did great!! <:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>

i just can't
i wouldn't
to surpass the ban
and then made 2nd acc
some people here have been banned
you might get banned lmao
isn't orobaxi a staff member
so i'll never know if they woke up
before it closed
to check my bracket
i forgot
let's fucking go
morb buddies
LMAO
i'd prob keep to myself
i mean i just thought if i was in ER, i wouldn't just go saying hi to literally anyone new i saw
we do be morbin
i vibe with that
on the kin test thing
ayyy i'm actually mobius
yeah i think you're probably safe in t2%
what am i doing
so dumb
on BKE
happened once to me with px and AE i think
so fucking niche LMAO
lmao i know right
and because of that you can't use LE there
are you sure you didn't lock HoT on that boss
what
very touching
yeah itto goes goddamnit yelan you morbed all over me
fucked up
LMAO
<a:MeiQuestion:930749563655061514>
literally no paga on offrate
no shit you didn't get any paga
i mean yeah
tbh quite impressive
i think
hakcer said he already has AF for some reason
but she'd prob not be a bad choice
depends on what else those resources could be used in ofc
i'd go for her why not
but if they gave her for free
i wouldn't spend xtal on her
it's all about goals
in global
rl retain she can at s0
i mean it depends on what you mean by competitive
if heki had turg they'd be able to run cat strats
lv88 in nirvana anything goes
that bitch is sss everything
like you see a lv85 in nirvana?
i'd say lower levels in RL are scarier than lv88
honestly
literally doesn't matter
bitch you getting taken away from 10th isn't even sniping, it's like throwing a handball ball at you
so you have a better chance than usual
so a lot of people decided to run early
with high cap for s0
but this week is 2 easy ss bosses
usually peeps run p late
i'd say medium chance
hmmm
masters?
eh hard to say
nvm
oh wait that's just sushang
CH FR phys team
based
prob idk i wasn't here
1k was big damage
back in the olden times
literally not using it
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
share?
now CH will take a while to ss2 <:PepeHands:909232418211364957>
i was buying out FR ely CH
i had a big pile saved up from anniv
i'm starting to run out of AL tho
i would recommend farming prob
but even past s1
yeah s1 is very good
lmao
just farm FR
i'll promote even if they try to bald
i dunno i don't care
<:deadge:933767520085770341>

IT'S TIME TO FUCKING WAKE UP
GOOD MORNING RED LOTUS
oh shit i should write the disturbance down
it's technically just nerfed mechanically-wise paralyse husk but idk
you could say there's 4 if you wanna count ER as different too
if you count ma husk as one
i guess
no turg is yikes
idk maybe
oh
in.... nirvana?
hitcount husk
<:BronyaKing:646539680979877888>
most fun part of the game
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
start trying in MA
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
t100 all ruby
just open a portal to a bright room and fuck everyone's experience
or not i guess
hmm you'd need to be in a dark place
Piss of the Void
calling adding commercials a quality of life thing is debatable lmao
i mean depends on PoV
just weird on theaters
for when they go on tv or w/e
the movies have breaks built into them
i mean i guess it's not that weird
and the break is dr strange 2 starting
to get you in the mood yk
maybe they were playing dr strange 1 before
never heard anyone talk about it before
sounds weird tho
i think i've only went to movie theater like once or twice in my life
i dunno
movies have breaks?
wtf
than either using another support or giving another set to cat on the same team
you'd more likely just want cat on the team and cat using bastet
is that even if it was good on an ice dps valk
like the thing is about bastet
and BB on double sleepri strats
bastet is p much only cat i think
not at all i don't think
not really i don't think
but i kinda want 11th and positron
SN, bri pri pri and second sleepri
well, more like craft another 3
and craft like another 5
i still need to max 4 pri
cause i still need like 30 cubes to cube everything useful
well more like equipment and cube stuff
yeah
like AKA
and be able to invest in dumb shit
i can't wait to be done with my real investments
if they add a dumb second passive that's useless
i mean i guess not necessarily
bd pri would giga break the game
this is my yellow screen for now
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
could've been worse
all in all
eh
i also have 2 dupe nyx scythes
where is aoi
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
i win
oh wait nvm i got 19!!
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
you don't need to self own
7 an-utus
i once had 7 twins of eden
not recently but like in general
i burnt a lot
i have 18
like gacha weapon dupes?
hmmm
share some?
that's a lot of cubes spent tho
<:A_HeheTao:817474907003682857>
than you do
i have more yellow
you're extremely skilful is how
not my worst investment by far
yeah aslaug is now carole set for MA
raven is dead now
i like how
and if you have sp bank, you can prob use senpri to 2 combo into ult
so if you don't have sp bank you're already kinda fucked
since you need 25sp to use the active in the first place
neb pri is not very good in MA
not really
you don't need to use eden in MA
even if it's husk week
is the reason why i pulled eden's guns lmao
yeah that one strat
but in MA, eden isn't very useful
on ss doom
that uses it on HoF
there is one strat
well
probably
yeah i don't think you need 2
oh
the overwatch champion?
who's echo
not like i'm scary or anything more like this player is playing like shit because it's not them right now lmao
i changed the name tho to make sure peeps know i'm the one piloting it

<:disappointGura:756520039426949270>
imagine spending money on the game
but because no one will pay how much i'm willing to sell it for LMAO
not because i'm against it
i'll prob never sell mine
look at keeby

yeah that doesn't really sound like abstract art lmao
aw thank you
owo 8ball am i pathetic(compliment)?
well, most of my experience with art is with games
most of my experience with abstract art is mostly with indie games i guess
fucking paid off owobot
LMAO i mean if you want to sure! but i don't see it that way, i was there just having fun, if you had some fun too by listening then the exchange was already complete
abstract art can be boring, some have really touched me in the past before tho
i can send you some
i'm sure it's not that bad but i understand how you feel
really? that's kinda unfortunate

that's a fucking great joke
apparently
assigned child at joining arc city
LMAOOOO
i think my english pronunciation also kinda sucks
i don't really like my voice
oh that's kind

whoa
glad i didn't do that
could've rolled 80 times for an irene piece and got nothing
i mean yeah it could be worse
and i didn't knew shit
they preyed on people who didn't knew shit
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
bought the ryunosuke one
i uh
gj
already higher than bruh
oh wow level 17?
that's big
i get to be friends with asterlao
oh lets go
yeah like it's not nothing but it's not like a big difference in mechanics or w/e
sss not that big of a buff
prob doable with ss
cat strats btw
wants to score high in RL
if any 12/12 s0 gamer
idgi
people be having half a support set and scoring 900s
a3 is a whole different beast
i mean idk
s0 scores 830
it could make a difference
and usually it doesn't matter but for strats as tight as this one
BR does have frame advantage on getting BD off
if not BR it will be slightly harder
needs to be psy
well actually i guess it works on ss
yeah
or FR dps
or HoT dps
can do mobius instead
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
can use turg instead of second newt b
this is basically around what you need
if anyone has the gear for it here pls go for it
we're so close
go go global
i do my ramen the way someone taught me to
everytime i hear that certain song, i think of that certain person
my phone background was chosen by a certain person
and every time i log in one of my old social medias i see a description i set as a joke about someone

every single aspect of my life is molded and inspired by the people i once loved and the people i still do
you know i always say
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
wdym she's going to be farmable like current elysia
i never forget though <a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i mean it's okay, you don't have to believe
rino, jiayou, fhem...
the honkai channels i follow ig
so you can see
yes with search history and yt acc logged in
bruh i'll leave you my phone
do you want like my rubix cube
yeah true i'll leave you some stuff after i die
isn't that the guy from undertale
ghaster
aster ghost
i mean you're memorable right now to me
i could try if you really wanted me to
sorry
hmmm i don't think i would be able to forget you
LMAO tf you mean now
for yourself? or just any funeral?
to be like that
maybe i can arrange my funeral
yeah i wouldn't mind dying like that
<a:YoimiyaFireworks:856652206740734012>
i think we were talking about me becoming a firework
at least i feel like so lmao
i certainly become A Bitch when i'm annoyed at sounds like that
yeah i feel that
it slaps
from like recent updates
i was listening to the new minecraft ost
you gotta have some sick headphones to cancel out firework noises
trying to break the kid
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
eh i dunno if telling someone who's suffering because of loud noises to grab a headphone and put louder noises on it is the best idea
so i really like it
and it's the favorite color of my best friend
yellow is the opposite of my favorite color
let's fucking go
you're yellow?
w/e the fuck that tells you
so
yielded no reward
but also most of my longest balds
and undeserved
i got by luck
most of my good scores
it's kinda funny because
<:KianaBald:959736877374652498>
it was the power of violence
but better
still shit
i'm glad i did it though cause now i'm a lot better at the game
very skill issue
just
it was jizo, but not that phase, when i was doing jizo first time i couldn't even get to that phase LMAO
<:MeiKnife:647104199406125100>
yeah i made them stop
it's pretty clear LMAO
in honkai
balding a single boss
i've spent 30 hours
i'm not diagnosed either but like
not pushing any labels onto anyone
i mean i'm talking about myself here
prob autism thing?
if that makes sense
so i can understand disliking sounds even if the sound by itself are not much
like i can p easily get overwhelmed with sounds
i mean that's understandable
i think i'd make a pretty good firework
i don't smell of smoke though
just like me!
like new years probably
dunno don't remember last time i heard one
yeah i guess i can see it
talking as if it's a natural phenomena LMAO
like they're pretty rare around here
hmm i don't mind them usually
<:E_RaidenPat:882522815532781618>
oh :(
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
no one likes these
and get rid of sss bosses
make ss bosses stronger
please mihoyo just make exalted 2
gimmicky, baldy, tanky, annoying
for what sss bosses were going to be
really set the tone
literally one of the 2 first sss bosses
i'm -7 under cap <:deadge:933767520085770341>
but i'm downbad
well i'm not that down bad
fuck jizo
same
well not really on a saturday i guess
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
it's prime bald time
honkai reset an hour ago
starts with an h....
can't quite put my finger on who
huh reminds me of someone
just like investment prios as always
switch cd reset just like literally makes every boss -2
switch cd reset op
especially masters MA
for MA
well dudu elf is actually extremely useful even outside phys teams
based
just weird investment prio LMAO
but like
it's very strong
i mean dudu elf is great don't get me wrong
favorite past time
just checking off stuff on a list
i like completing stuff
i mean i did those for fun
cause no HoS lmao
but can't use phys team
phys elf
heki got the weirdest acc i've seen i think
it was based before you said until i have to
well nvm
based
sheeesh!
gl
you really fucking scraping the bottom of the barrel huh
for the future
150 more just spend 100 bucks to be safe
<a:Y_PepegaCredit:792811182364819477>
<- has no idea how xtal income is without topping up
yeah i think you got it
oh you'll get some xtal from new event ig
lmao
<:NoBully:759859271549845544>
so you're aster mathlao
lao is a really good mechanical player
sasuga is like whoa impressive
you topping up yeah?
so you need 1600 xtal in a week
to get how many xtal
so you have a week
sasuga asterlao
no it doesn't, amount of wings increases per pull, cost of wing stays the same
yes
with it's 8
without discount it's 10
yeah
do the math
costs 8 xtal
each one of those wing things
pls understand
indie dev
lmao good game design
to roll the last time?
and it'll tell you how much it costs
can't you click to roll
yeah my only gacha gear is blood embrace
can you guess if i have it or not
is this boss fun
don't do this to me mihoyo
craft dracula?
time to uh
infinite pokemon
i should reroll affix for sp% red
i'll still be missing sp on HoS
i think even if i evade everything
hmm
transition easily the hardest thing there
kinda wish i could train a specific phase
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
we go for greatness
and here
but that's not how you achieve greatness
sure you can just stay away
yeah
jizo transition phase: get ready to get fucked
parvati transition phase: baby talk
it's like
if you get hit you're fucked
as long as you don't get hit
you can prob miss 1 or 2 dodges and like lose 1 or 2 seconds
send help
or you don't get hit but don't get the sp from dodging and won't have enough sp on BKE
either you get hit and lose the sp pack
if you miss a single dodge
all while positioning SA whisperer's net correctly so it's there when you switch HoS in to break clone
then you need to time the dodges with SA which is in the middle of a clusterfuck
the positioning already for the first 2 dodges is fucked up
and then dodge another 2 spears on SA
switch SA in, dodge into the spears and then out for TF
then close on jizo dodge the explosion
dodge 2 spears with BKE
literally need to
is so fucked up lmao
like the transition
you saw me bald for it for a while
the one i'm doing
this jizo strat is so hard lmao
treat honkai like scientific process
try other button
if thing goes wrong
then good job
if thing goes right
press button
<:GachaPlayers:976191636415602738> <:TheLiterate:976191666564247612>
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816> <:theliterate:959737715564359740>
it's literally on the title
to being able to slacc
getting closer
yeah if <@964806731471405086> is still around
3 HoD in 3 weeks
just look at PE release patch
you don't need many ice bosses to shill ice
suddenly you're on the other side of the room
do 1 thing slightly wrongly
is positioning hell
god sss jizo
maybe you can help aster setup filters?
idk how to use it either i only know it exists
yeah sounds right
did you not look on pixiv?
lmao yeah i feel that
hmm probably not very
but people don't make them anymore
yeah! i kinda want a cute one
such a throwback
i didn't find one that i liked but it's like
different mouse skins
one time i found one of those old sites that were like
LMAO that sounds awesome
yeah don't worry about it! you're fine probably
HoV be like:
pixiv def has nsfw stuff on it though, so if you can't find a way to filter it then prob not a good pick
maybe deviantart if that's still alive
isn't there like filter in pixiv or something
please mihoyo take them away from me
this bitch really be oh yeah i have too many mats
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
so it wouldn't help much
idt bleed is good hitcount
prob but even if it does
idk
that's hitcount
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
yeah on jizo
i'm talking about HoS sp
sp doko
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
yeah and did you
choose one
\> bp
\> all f2p
send help
just chains to stay in place
oh wait that's not as bad
these strats are kinda fun but jesus
i need to fucking whisperers net
<:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
jesus
for sp
is fucked up
yeah this strat
oh cool!
okay it's not that bad
god i have to time that?
great start
already forgot everything
which should be around 632 for me?
i mean ideally close to cap ofc
i dunno yet
if anyone wants
i'm jizo bald on stream
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
aster on genocide mode
fun event but i feel like they forgot they made a valk that specialises in shield breaking and makes the hunter the least intimidating thing ever lmao
if i join in and it says all daily missions completed then i'm done for today, yeah?
was half expecting for you to say no
thank you <:peepoBlush:620449739070111763>
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
so i don't have to read?
<@218762069338619906> wanna explain me how this work
where is event dalao
me: event is too confusing!!!
me: skips event tutorial
i'd be thankful
do you have a better quality image of that
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
god i wish
we've been out-zoomer'd
i'm too boomer to follow this
vacation
jail is just escapism really
are for
what <#979707949159178300> and <#979119475389513749>
i still don't know
LMAO
are we bidetposting now
that was the start of the end
once phyllisd was banned
arc city started to die
i don't think anyone knows
... morbnifyingglass
but he's done the opposite i guess
like i truly believed he was like just a child and would get over it eventually
feels like he only gets more insufferable with time <:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
but he's really annoying recently
i mean i dunno i feel like at the start he wasn't that bad
am i losing or gaining points by not balding for you
pretty bad, funny sometimes, makes memes just on existing, no one really takes him seriously anymore
must be for the memes
yeah i don't think 5k people even watched the movie
LMAO thank you, that is where i got it
like about a 50 or 60, would go up about 30 points if you stoppped misgendering me
i think he's rated pretty accurately actually
diavoros is a lot of things but not overrated
thank you baban
hell fucking no
<a:PU_PepeHacker:531794953903407113>
we're in
it worked
<:sakurabless:959767002669527080>
good luck carv
but god
at least they leave the fun part for last
not that i'd want to
can we even be mlm exclusive
i mean you're enby no
yeah good luck
never fucking mind
online???
oh god
thank you, if gay evn likes it then i'm doing something right
are you doing like a 2 player one? it sounds kinda fun to plan it out
LMAO i just have a really stupid sense of humor i think
whatcha coding?
am i good at flirting yet
spreadsheet gaming
calculating the eden event stuff
if anyone wants help
they wouldn't want her to break mobius lmao
like if they make a support that can summon 20 summoned entity
i think they'd count as support valkyrie
the max is likely to future proof her though
with VC ult + aponia on standby + elf + cross + doll
but you could get the max right now if you really wanted
realistically yeah
well
it's nice to get an idea but it won't and can't tell the whole story
dps chart gaming is just way too far removed from actual gameplay to be worth looking into after you're a good amount competitive
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
and then you lose 200 points over that
but does it matter if you can't one shot HoD p1 without maximum output?
and yeah PE deals like 85% of her max damage output with budget stigs
good luck farming sp though
like yeah mobius deal a good amount of damage with monet T goemon MB
nowadays they're making sure you suffer if you don't have fullset
and like an armada mate of mine said, even if a set looks competitive on dps chart gaming, it's not always the whole story
oh this set is only x% worse
so it's really hard to just put a number to it like
because they have different dps windows and stuff like that
different sets will outperform each other on different rotation and bosses
like honkai dps stuff is too complicated to just spreadsheet gaming your way to the top
eh after a while you stop caring about dps charts like that
<:sakurabless:959767002669527080>
if you believe anything is possible
i got my dupe zhenyi B through SpA gear banner
and copy it then
i just wait until dalao uses it
eh idk
i'm pretty sure handel is better for FR dps <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
this week
to literally kill bella
you can actually use HoT with handel
LMAO wait that's pretty funny
there's an 893 on bella with handel mobius
i dunno about support but i think it's good too
ik it's BiS now for FR dps
yeah
eden, FR
just keep using bella
if you have affix like that
handel doesn't outperform bella by that much
i mean tbh
nice!
it doesn't even feel that good since everyone has 3 46 atk affix on HoF
this is the best affix i have i think
perfect for people with shit affixes
i'm just making my setup accessible you know
i mean
LMAO
based
for AKA
ofc
on that banner
that's why i chose to get 2 elegy before homa
yeah i planned that in advance
oh sheeeesh
i'm fiiiine
see i told y'all that getting 2 elegy wasn't that bad
oh wait she can run elegy?
buy out the coin children
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
cause mihoyo said we can
who asked if we can buy out new event shop?
oh wait sheesh
i mean it's weird they phrase it like that tbh
oh okay
wdym elysia 13th, that'd be only the 2nd
entire shop costs 1644 to buy out
that's the entire shop
if it's 1650
wait what
maybe by next sss tona
i was too optimistic thinking i could get to elf
LMAO
and i ran out of coins
i got to the max nyx and cat pri part
i needed to:
max nyx and nyx skills
max nyx and cat pri
max nyx stigs
max eden gun
max WE level and skills
because for next week
i was saving up coins for like 2 weeks
yeah it's so bad
it's 900
1200?
oh hey peeps anyone remembers how many eden note things we're getting?
oh no
shamash was different obviously, it was a revival DK
the way my crafting is going i'll never get to it lmao
tbh i would rather they did
but we didn't have to pull for black abyss
no way mihoyo would make us pull again for some weapon right
we get all of the other forms for free right
if we pull 7tr
she's at 1460 rn
HoT maybe can get there with 7tr
1466 with PE
closest i have is
her affixes kinda suck but
my delta is at 1428
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
you'll get to 1500 before me
jesus
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
okay so i'm going to need to do event today is what i'm hearing
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
or can i slacc
does the new event have daily shit
oh event peeps
yeah i see. makes sense
too expensive
can't even ask for crystalyte
i'm so down bad on coins
cause i barely explored the latter and haven't even went to the first
chasm and enkanomiya stuff first
should i do like
should i join back just to do that
i've been hearing good stuff about new event
since it's most recent phys support + cheap banner on release
if you have none, then griseo prob a great investment
if you have either you're still safe
on any phys weather
you can def retain RL easily
if you have 4/4 SA 4/4 carole
i'll always repeat this, it only matters depending on your goals
leave him be
he vibin
<:sus:866768426478862366>
i mean
oh okay ty
i'm trying to contact sonagi from seeleland
was your armada seeleland or seelelibrary
hey <@846910913118601226>
apparently
when you have griseo
who needs to deal with mechanics
when i can see LMAO
because that'd be boring
making a point to not just run the same thing on both acc
TP on my friends acc
i'll be doing BKE on my acc
just a lot more trouble basically
but they can score equal, sometimes even better
is that the hand mechanic is p much built for BKE lmao
like the issue with other dps on jizo
PE apparently scores well on jizo
<:sleepy:914211439286304778>
sleep like me
without you having to worry about it
it will auto counter
and it has so much hitcount
you can plop it down
if you have hekate
it's not that bad, jizo alternates between counter hand and dodge hand
finish clearing it <:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
after slamming down lmao
but i never seen what the fuck he does
like i assume it's possible
after he slams down
how to clear the meter
tbh i don't even know
ideally
before he slams down
you want to clear that meter
i think i said it in a weird way
like ideally you need to break the hand before that
oh
carole?
who tf stuns
stun?
and still break the shield completely before he slams down
you can also miss 2
yeah
you alternate between dodge and hitting
it's basically
what that's not *that* bad
the strat is to kill jizo before he does any of it
he has like 32 different attacks
jizo is pretty simple
ofc
cause i need the challenge
yes
i dunno i kinda feel like i can maybe
help?
he came in my eyes and taped them afterwards
yeah i think there's something wrong with my doctor
that
yeah
yes the eye doctor put tape in my eyes
oh no like the thing they put on your eyes so you're blind
jizo time?
i dunno the english both for either but i can't see shit
i've been to eye doctor and my eyes are fucked
lmao
global tries
it's the only boss
it's HoD
<:frtea_hh:837765224312209458>

<:E_RaidenPat:882522815532781618>

hepha and bella are p fair bosses
you're taking that fun away from yourself tbh
are really fun
ss bosses this week
<:sus:866768426478862366>
i'll do your hepha and bella if you want
not accurate lmao
just
i mean i'm not saying it's bad
LMAO see

i was going to say
okay help me decide if a joke is untasteful or not
yeah i'll change my opinions over that
kinda based

yeah that's how it starts, dw about it you'll get there

and you know exactly how
my answer will LMAO
are we talking about front one or back one
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
but ooooh when it's like meta stuff
idk shit about lore
i can only roll my eyes
because like if it's lore stuff
i always fucking love when he spouts out random competitive bs
i'm vibing to it, very relaxing watching you draw <a:Wiggle:843300917914501141>
but if it's like normal strats i do try to understand why i suck so bad at the game
crit bald strats i just glaze over and think of the past
well, sometimes i do
eh i don't really
i wish i had the mental disconnect to do stuff like that
LMAO i mean honestly kinda based
diavoros be like i just made this opinion up on the spot, i don't have any proof behind it but i would literally die for it
dia it's not doomposting when it's me doing it voros
and he said no this time is true
and i sent that screenshot to him
literally mihoyo doesn't care about mei
like he just went down bad with the 7tr nerfs
the 7tr one
... diavorosdoomposting
was the best
the fucking doomposting saga
but he just went on about how wikipedia isn't a good source LMAO
i mean yeah it was supposed to be pretty obvious
LMAO
so i sent him this
and diavoros goes no mihoyo always does this, they say elysian realm is roguelike too but it isn't
and carv goes no it literally says on the site it's roguelike
and diavoros go no it's not roguelike based on nothing, ofc
cause that's literally what the site says
and we said roguelike
it was like, people were asking what type of game zzz are
LMAO
photoshopped that
i fucking
LMAO THAT WAS ME
LMAO that one was really funny
acts like he's always right even when it's about stuff he doesn't know shit about
diavoros is very annoying and condescending
21
i'm literally
i'm about to make you a fossil too, in the old fashioned way, if you don't gender me properly

head hurts
okay i'm taking a small nap, sorry
scary

like prob plan it all out before would be best
yeah i dunno
i mean yeah but just saying
even on sss jizo
HoR scores like 47k
since last jizo
it's been a while

it's like weird but it's been that way for a while

<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
cause i suck
but i will

<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
i'll just finish my dailies
i'm gonna do MA on my friends acc in a bit

i think it's just HoT weapon active

<@309634550273933314> going to start MA
i see her now and then, i think she's chill
i would
lmao
9 mins
in
cause everyone tryhards in it for some reason
this is also a very snipy boss
there's a chance even t15 rn wouldn't retain after snipes
my lobby is lobby from hell
depends on the boss and the lobby
i'm so bad
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
this is so bad
before the vietnam
786 is t30 myriad
<a:Love:534242801131454516>
you're MA? i love MA!
still shit score
10pt increase
only sadness
out of stress
HoD tping will give me a heart attack
a w is a w
let's fucking go i guess!
most of it is very generous when compared to like fighting game stuff
there's not many frame perfect stuff in honkai
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
and thing survives
buttons are pressed badly
well more like
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>

i immediately went to MA LMAO
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
sign to keep going
it's a sign
game crashed
low 800s might be too low too
idt i can retain without 800s
matched my score ffs
help
there's like 5 sss PE here
cookiezi is good at the game too
kartolao, akabane
777 is prob not retaining lmao
i'm on bracket from hell
777
ayyy lucky?
i hate it here
like it's really hard to tell wtf is going on by design i think LMAO
that's honkai
i mean
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
this is hell
no lmao
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
if anyone wants to join
i'm doing nirv HoD bald -> 946 hepha bald -> 893 bella bald -> another 946 bald (last 2 on friends acc) stream
vouch
yeah
that's weird af
and no other cutscene?
only sakura samsara has subtitle?
i understood it poorly
oh wait
so you don't have to either
mihoyo doesn't care about sakura samsara
if it makes you feel better
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
asking mihoyo to be clear
lmao
i wanna say no but idk
yeah could grab scott to make ana cheaper for when they make ice g4
yeah, maybe grab monet to make handel craft faster
beet
like dupe jst
or again, just start catching up on craftable stuff
but if you have nothing else lmao
it's really not necessary
newt T is for newt TB on BB for double sleepri strats
shennong is shennong T shui MB
they're different use case
not necessarily
then just buy stuff to make crafting faster
but if you have all there
oh newt T is very niche, you might want that
if you have all there
not on order of prio, just in general
i recommend looking at
these are the things
3-5 newts, usual week will use around 2, 3 is pretty common, more is rare but still nice to have for affix and the rare weeks where it's useful
2-3 ppm, 2 is already kinda overkill tho
1 ppt, for sss HoD
gustav TM, good easy to proc phys stig, kinda low prio nowadays since there's so many options
welt TM, slightly better than ana TMB, very low prio since it generally only saves you 1 second on HoR strats if that
i think i've done this a lot by this point lmao
what do you already have
<:miriothink:959328310033252432>
so you don't have to think
just go a ton of sp gen
since lots of the value of it prob come from high af atk as pri
though only if you have it max or close to it i'm guessing
yeah apparently
she made my acc MA ready in masters
i kinda suck at her but
i legit can't hate HoF
doing the right attack strings can make her do way more damage
since she has the ember mechanic
she's actually not that unga bunga
people don't care about learning her lmao
people do use HoF here they all suck tho
similar for global
new gimmick: game is actually fun this time
io rankups are pretty weak
worst investment
prob my uh
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
and he's gone
plan your MA
you gotta
you have a fuckton more than needed
but if you have linn mobius
and handel mobius
works with s0
done did it
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
sasuga boolao
i'm pleb

oh idk then
for what?
ssg evnlao
<:lfg:803114423430545418>
you want a bunch of sp gen
for these new modifiers eden is v good
moonlight center recommends hua2 on aponia
they need to have some shit opinions to balance it out
yeah you know, cn player can't get every w
and yeah mobius is kevin1
she already kills everything
because she doesn't need high uptime lmao
like low uptime of kevin on mobius isn't that bad
than hua
if you can use kevin, it's usually better
it really depends from character to character
we should prob have a vc text chat
oh sorry jayson, i'm talking with peeps on vc
for who
yeah
rotmg is like fucking ping pong with devs tho lmao
it's prob my favorite story yet
ye
bald <a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
<a:WorryHug_luma:530613959095615500>
... heki
that's what you'd think huh
it does make aponia just worse mobius tho
so mobius core makes linnaeus broken
and mobius core makes valk count as summoned entity
is that linnaeus 3p buffs both valk and summoned entity
that makes her so powerful
the thing about mobius
yeah like
in ER
is better than 4/4 aponia
apparently aponia with linnaeus
i want it too
<@704867526877904908> did anyone give you trick map for new chapter

i dunno i'm just counting
juan
gensh abyss
i'm doing a friends abyss rn
LMAO fucking based
yeah same
idk i'm not really into it, i only know of it because apparently cn community call otto boss ntr
like as a meme and for actual kink
oh i mean i think it's used for both
<a:WineTime:933941250955026492>
cheers
like otto
what's nfr LMAO
ntr is cuck stuff
LMAO
from ntr
very different
oh okay
i only know ntr
what's ltr
i actually don't know shit about dating apps lmao
like maybe not on grindr
can still bald as a lesbian i think
grindr myriad t100
so
is the issue
i think i'm already max gay
so sounds good
i dunno what else i do
sure
oh yeah tet was balding that i think
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
it's not pride month here yet but i'll start commemorating already
but for sss boss that doesn't really matter
you'll lose like -2 or -3
elf doesn't make that much difference
can also try this
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
way harder tho
i can grab you a sswords ref
yeah prob
do deal as much damage as possible
ofc ideally you want it maxed
is it not pri yet?
just dodging properly
so you don't have to worry about that part, really
and since it hits so often, it pretty much always will
like hekate pri active can do the counter
it's prob not that bad to do scuffly
oh
not even fine, like actually v competitive scores
while bke is unga bunga do it eyes closed
is like trying to fit a shoe 3 sizes too small
but trying to deal with the mechanics
like TP and PE and HoS get fine scores at it
boss was made for her
ofc
BKE
yeah
mistiming probably?
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
execution wise and gear wise
and hepha is prob the easiest one
it feels great pulling them off though!
yeah 946s are always tight execution wise
yeah i feel that
so i'd prob recommend skipping on like xp chip daily if you don't need them much
planeroid is like a system to get some rewards from past days if you skip dailies
by skipping dailies
and failing
and trying
you get them by training
i mean neither do i
and 2. you could help with global 100 946s on hepha cause
and 1. it could be fun for your first 946 (0s kill)
you might have enough gear to 946
i'm just curious
uh no
on hepha
are you using
what
you're better at lying than i thought
oh wow
it should be like asterWave
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
thank you!
oh okay
come count it's relaxing
yeah that's awful
but if they had cut contract like a few years earlier they'd be on the same situation as yours
they were lucky enough to branch out on a lot of different clients in time
a very similar thing almost happened on my old job
oh yeah that fucking sucks
jesus that fucking sucks, i'm sorry
so i dunno what it does
oh i typo'd, i meant i can't delete messages
wait what do those do? i can delete messages
thank you! lmao
disgusting
and you talk about me
ugly red circles
and then you'll be at 1
that's 2 pulls
oh shit
obviously
numbers
i want a counting channel
literally just disable pings on servers you don't care about
<a:Love:534242801131454516>
aw sleep well babe!
tsk tsk you talk about me
nasty!!
nasty
look at those fucking mentions
and you talk about me??
it do be clean already
for no reward
yeah
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>

why?
for ease of access
which i leave unfoldered
those are my favorite servers

they
from another server
i stole the idea
to write out the numbers
it's therapeutic
yes
can we have a counting channel
hey mods
<:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
don't let him know then
look at those ults lmao
rl so paper
jesus
waow
150 atk diff
that sounds nice
for other valk to compete
too many points
is just
PE being able to kill p1 on one ult
like there's close to 0 chance you'll actually retain nirv without PE
<:Hehe:585924636504489994>
i'm procrastinating
not yet
cope harder
cat dps can low 800s apparently
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
i can see on the lobby screenshot
he usually is ss whel
hmm i'm surprised he isn't ss PE
oh chip
i'll annoy them about it
send bracket screenshot
oh who?
not owned before
this many
i've never seen
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
yeah if you farmed properly!!!
<:deadge:933767520085770341>

sprigatito content?
that's new gen, yeah?
ofc keeb's the one to think of it
yeah LMAO but it's kinda dumb
so there's no team buffs lmao
but she's on field during ult
shui T was better because tesla band T buffs only work when she's off field
worst answer possible
the thing yesterday with shui T vs tesla band T
oh lmao
what's wrong with white background images
did you do it from memory? ssg aoi
<:E_RaidenPat:882522815532781618>
doing from memory is impressive though
none of the letters right
you got
i'm listening
go on
or i guess hurt yourself in general
isn't scabbards the thing that you get when you cut yourself
why do you have that info
they are
don't pull for them though
yeah but no they're absolutely very cute
absolutely knows
tet
and you are going to keep quiet
and i'm gonna keep quiet
and i know what i'm thinking
i mean but i know what you're thinking
i'm onto you heki
don't make furry jokes
oh
⚔️
yeah i typed it out as a joke but i feel that
i vibe with that
honestly
gender: sword
kinda based i guess
when you put it like that
i've t100 with less elf than you
i've seen people t100 with less elf than you
why
heki how
i mean doesn't look that bad tbh
🔥 cool 🔥
sorry
went from nerd to cool
not transgender, trans class stereotype
yeah i'm trans

i changed into trans flag pfp for last pride
bittet
tet bi itto?
sounds like hell
gotta time it well tho
yeah
and i took that personally
heki be like
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
it'll prob confuse people enough into thinking she's AE
honestly if you give her the knight skin
got the cool kid glasses
sheeesh
<:peepoBlushPoint:756057701091639336>
so cute
i collect these
please
i want yanfei among us voice clip
oh god is that voiced
i think it's the only namecard like that?
quite pretty
i really like how the color scheme changes a bit from banner to background
kaeya is p nice too
pulled on her run and rerun, jean'd both times
i pulled a heki
i have 2 jean instead
i just don't have her
kokomi is v pretty too
if you like completing stuff you'll get there in no time tbh
besides new characters
i think by the time i quit i p much had everyone lv10
but diona, ganyu, rosaria and sucrose are p close
okay so mine is prob venti
<a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
bennett better
how do you even make
yeah it's extremely fair
<:RozaScout:928714351534309386>
i mean tbh that's pretty fair

we got sea branch too
my armada
anyone want in
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
cause i feel like most people run on even no hp zhongli has thicc enough shield, would rather make him deal damage mindset
is it?
i guess we have zhongli but no one builds him for hp for some reason
finally hp character
oh wait actually? that's cool
it's actually really fun
i played noelle dps on a friends acc
barabara yanfei and noelle
for those characters
how are cons now
xingqiu always wins
yeah but that's p much her main use
more damage i think? and better hydro application than xingqiu at c2
no pressure though! can just chill until you're comfortable too
hmm yeah i understand that
and i'll fix it
if something wrong happens just hit me up
i'm a vice there tho so
you don't have to say anything or join if you don't want to
<:E_RaidenPat:882522815532781618>
trust save for sumeru and kazuha
just worse xingqiu just skip
you can prob message him and tell you just quit your armada and he'll let you in the server while on cd
lmao
now aster and hakcer
first nini
i swear i'm just poaching hidden base for honkai player
yeah, don't worry about it! he's really chill
just say you're already in the armada and you wanted to join the server!
i already told him i sent you
message him about it! i'll let him know i sent you
Ransu#9295
yeah!
and you can join the discord if you want, aster
so you can join the armada if you want, poi
i can send you both the contact of the SEA branch leader
our sea branch is really chill
whaaat? what the hell, that's sick
yeah it's my armada, i'm kind of recently a vice on it!
omegawhales are built diff i swear
and enjoy balding
i mean all n all blustorm is pretty competitive but we're also just a tight knit of player who enjoy each other
i'm pretty sure dorm cards are balanced on how many people do commissions, so it shouldn't matter whether or not you're in a big armada
it's nice to have a community of people with similar goals
i didn't even know co-armadas were a thing
oh i'm really bad with armadas
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
we'll be vice buddies
what armada are you in again?
ayyy nice!!
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
and your damage will be very front heavy
it's not that bad ig, just adds more time per rot since you have to weapon active to get gustav buffs
you're remembering to weapon active every rot, yeah?
oh yikes that carole gear
sasuga evnlao
oh yeah true!
i guess that makes sense actually
WC has a QTE???
so it wouldn't be that easy to tell
PE QTE also adds buffs by itself
unless they wanna do a lot of math
not exactly
i mean
which is guess makes sense, it's about the only thing i think would make it make sense
they're now theorising that shui T second effect is activated by any team QTE
this is tesla band T
After exit, team gains 10% Physical DMG (effect cannot stack). When on the field, the host gains 15% Physical DMG and 20% faster Attack Speed.
this is shui T
Team deals 8.0% bonus Physical DMG (cannot stack). QTE boosts team Physical DMG by 8.0% on hit for 8s (cannot stack but can be refreshed). While Recommendation is active, duration is extended by 4s.
and no one knows why LMAO
even when carole has QTE turned off
apparently shui T on carole makes PE ult deal more damage on first rot than tesla band T
about HoD
i feel better LMAO
when styx and karto don't understand wtf is going on
... tetawooga
yeah i dunno about ggz but honk's is ass lmao
like i said i've never went to agony myself <:deadge:933767520085770341>
through screenshots n stuff i mean
i mean it's prob not every bracket but i've seen some shit
that's hell
it becomes a fight for the top spots with like 20 pts of difference
like when anything can 900+ a boss
i've seen some ag3 brackets that look more competitive than some global nirv ones
ag3 is legit vietnam
RL is so chill
tbh i'd rather not
i've never even went to ag3, nvm ag2
how is it down there

that's what i've been saying!! <:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
it's hard to call FR or eden the dps of that team
that's just the FR eden PV team tho
oh yeah for FR dps you'd prob use eden
but it's mainly HoT
i've seen her on some mobius teams
HoT dps basically i think
<a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
yeah i would laugh too
no way right
right
i'm not going to get warned for that
LMAO
and on exalted it's not thaaat useful
getting it from dorm exchange is debatable
it's barely on banners
i think it's hard to get BD nowadays
i mean
<@781539392039682058>
5.8 week 1
without ppt
you'll still be around -100 from cap
unless you have sss HoS
for s0
it makes the cap like 100pts higher or so

and heki is like not you again
god i can't wait!!
i can't wait to show up on heki's pulls!
imagine mona being like

not in global na yet
but it's not that crazy yet
like ios cn is nuts
lmao
def not
that sounds right actually
so 12 hours before global na?
just insane player
they like consistently t10 or so by playing 2 hours a week or something like that
they just don't try really hard
it's prob like one of those 3 players in global that are good enough to make ref
tka is fucking insane dalao though
thank u carl
LMAO
before
they were like edens huge bonkers or w/e
they cycle through sex names for new valk
that's tka, like i said
and iriya with meme names
tka with topical sex names
tka and iriya are like our most consistent name changers
that's p fair
and iriya is 14th
tka is 12th
i'd think you'd have seen it before
they've had that name for a good while now
it's just like
or at all idt
nekosexslave doesn't change their name often
it's not tka
do people not know them?
wait
so you'll have issue following ref
since more levels = more team cd reduction
it's kinda annoying tho
i think lv50 is prob good enough retain RL?
wdym by casual
and open up more strats
since it'll give you more options
realistically speaking gustav is going to be more impactful for you than 20 atk
no, mobius just v strong, she only a bit basically to 0s
so you being 1s is <:deadge:933767520085770341>
and on bosses everyone is 0s
are on 0s boss
cause like that 1s you lose
it depends on what you mean by big tho
yeah it's like 1s
so i understand
i only recently crafted it
fuck that
i would still buy it through bp LMAO
honestly
yeah no one likes SK i don't think
LMAO
for the sss fgo run
she has 1.5sp/s
severely fucked up affixes
just
my HoS also has max pri
y'all play characters you have fun with?
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
i can only relate
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
and use HoS SA griseo
and i think it'd be better for you to replace carole
you just said that on your HoS SA carole team you're replacing 4/4 SA with griseo instead of budget carole
if you have shui
i don't think it's necessary either
i'm not telling you to
like shui still has some shield breaking
even then you'll prob not need carole
eh if it's RL
or wait until ice elf
either dudu now
i think you're really ready for first elf
also at your level of investment
i'm thinking it's likely you'll be able to run HoS dps with SA griseo
which i think is base?
shouldn't really as long as you have the tf on ult unlocked
ya
i think i ran slug?
holy fuck
crop your shit better
jesus christ fenri
LE carole mobius
i did a weeks on my friends acc and i got 893 on hepha with monet goemon mobius
she can prob -1 it at least
i have ttmbbb
come back to the present please
you're living in 2024 neko
your mind is in another week
not me lmao
ask iriya
idk
how well those valk of yours are invested
well idk
HoF bella
will be mobius hepha
i think the best for you
drunklightning
<:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
hepha bella lmao
next week is fucked
or keeb ref
for us global peeps, it's wait for iriya ref
yeah that's the life
honkai is like too much of a clusterfuck to make stuff up yourself without any basis
you'll not really get better
but like if you start the game off and you've never seen a ref and you refuse to watch one and try to follow
at one point you get good enough where you can start making up stuff yourself
and it's absolutely true
at least at the beginning
like one of my armada laos said you will never get good at the game if you don't follow refs
it depends
not in normal human hours
i count my weeks in MA time
oh wait i see what you mean
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
after that it's lobster
next week is sss jizo
i just dunno, i wouldn't really do much with it
maybe i'll think about it
hmmm
LMAO
harder than RL
agony really do be
lmao
but i'm 100% sure ruby and nini are better than me in abyss
depends on how you measure it
and also i'm not sure if i'm the best here
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
i can barely copy
who are good enough to come up with strats
like in global we have around like 2 or 3 players
you have to be incredibly good at the game to actually come up with strats
to come up with stuff
i'm not good enough at the game
cause i don't really care for beta
is that the one sss sn video?
lmao
sss 728
s2 712
s0 696
sss wolf is like
yeah some bosses are Like That
or s0 cap?
sss cap?
that's likely like 10+ spots on t100
if you're competitive player at least
yeah 130 is like pretty sizeable difference in MA
it's good enough for global t100 tho
in fact, in ss MA, -200 is like 15 seconds
that's not almost a good for MA
HoT scored like -200 or -300 no?
you're very generous as far as almost as good goes
i mean
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
but it's still sad
she was
i'm glad
and to be completely clear
kinda sad
nyx was left to rot by mihoyo
it's a very fair assumption from part of keeb
i mean tbf
if it happened
mobius would prob steal it too
and if it wasn't ice up
didn't happen <:shrug:877047647511384064>
i mean sure but like
lobster is lightning up
context please
13 different answers lmao
homu has like
this is kinda unfair
like s0 aponia sss eden vs s0 aponia ss eden is like same difference as s0 -> ss gacha valk normally lmao
then it's like you have ss aponia
tbh if you pulled for sss eden
but i'm skipping her so i ofc know why one would skip
i don't think she's a bad pull personally
still play like shit
everyone has it
like first week of new valk
global is so funny
i'm only non aponia in t5 this bracket
eh prob not
i can be a lil proud i think maybe
me
the other 675
shit score but
lmao
let's fucking go
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i mean i guess i'm attracted to some other enby peeps but it'd be hard to be on an homosexual relationship
cause i'm non binary and i don't know many non binary peeps
actually, it's funny because it's pretty hard for me to be homosexual i think
me talking to myself at 3 am:
or this?
<a:AMONGASS:852763889028038686>
is that what you want
<:amogus:856715468643762236>
what server are you
since she was discounted recently
it's going to be a good while until her discount
it has the hair-changes-color thingy which i love
i want it
is very pretty
the first one of those
the ponytail one
i prefer the other
i'll steal that
calling the tetris skin piano tiles is very troll
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816>
lmao
that's how i got mine
it did lmao
she has some good skins
hmmm
yeah it's so nice
oh yeah it's in login event
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
<@447218009749061632>
i can find it gimme a sec
as if people read that shit
lmao they write her skills
the shopping one is so fucking good
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
and they just forgot about twins
i feel like having twins is such high potential in skins
yeah that's true
i really like that
goes from blue to yellowish
cause it has the like change of color in her hair
i like the BB one
it's unironically p cute tho
and i'm not dming him lmao
cunny is automoded in wfp i think
cause maybe he like accepts it
if he's a cunny enjoyer
LMAO have we asked
i don't even know what those are LMAO
what you got one more trick than me
i'm week 1 player
but i don't wanna update it
i'd tell you my gensh uid
okay just do dailies
ooooh
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
am i wrong?
do you know wtf this is
also
still missing 9
i actually kinda wanna max every card asap
happy?
yeah i'm doing it rn
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
leave me alone
i haven't done today dailies yet
here
but this is where i'm at
idk where the 2 other tricks are
yeah
idr how it worked lmao
yeah mine is weird too
ayyy i also ran that!
idk then lmao
you're sea yeah?
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
or some shit
literally a day older than me
oh yeah i remember you're like
sheesh
oh you're newer than me
darius is right but he shouldn't say it :(
almost there
especially back in masters with xp chips
i mean yeah i'm not 88 but i also slacced a lot
dariuslao saying peeps with uid like mine should be lv88 already, so i'm slaccing
that's a good amount older
you're 400k earlier than me
well not really barely
yeah, you're older than me
the newer you are
so like, the bigger it is
it's incremental
3.98 million
uid is user id
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
by not level 88
roasted
i fucking got
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
genshin star rail
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
i'm almost lv88 okay
i don't think zzz will be similar to honk
i just wanna be sure we'll have a similar game to honkai to go to
<:tericopiumhic:893828235954102293>
i just want honkai 4
actually yeah i guess that's fair
not for any real reason LMAO
cause we're getting genshin's cunny meta in honkai now
oh
i wonder if honkai dev team is moving on to a different game
LMAO
at max level
20%
it's fucking
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
is nice
i mean just the base atk
yeah
like it matters very little but it matters
like out of all AL only valk, CH is the only one where sss matters probably
good night
<a:WorryHug_luma:530613959095615500>
prob not a bad investment
i mean unironically
based
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
so long
takes
and i'm never getting sss FR apparently
5 weeks for ss2 CH
yeah that's quite nice
+ other shit too
and eden gets that lmao
how cat gets only 15% team tdm
yeah it's kinda funny
even though she has a p strong sss
so no reason for me to sss her if i'm not using her
setup as in gear wise
because i'm not going to have her setup for a good while
like i'm delaying eden a fair bit to sss
so like, the most impactful SSS skills for each valk are probably
SA -> hell to farm sp without it
Eden -> beeeg buffs to damage
Carole -> makes her better at her niche (breaking shields)
Fischl -> more sp gen, she can use it pretty efficiently tho, differently from HB
HB -> more sp gen but matters a lot less
cat -> very small damage upgrade

dj -> is dead

griseo not on the list cause idfk lmao

but this is not who to sss first, that will depend on your situation, those are the most impactful rank for each valk. like, who you should sss first should be based on that + who you actually use. if you don't use SA at all, then no reason to SSS her
like with phyllis = can ult every rot because of lower cd and more sp gen
without phyllis = even with sss sp gen you can't ult every rot cause of cd problems
yeah
phyllis solves both of the issues
so it doesn't even matter
but because of cd
not because of sp
she can't even ult every rot
i mean without phyllis
oh yeah i see
you mean just self sp gen?
<a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753>
wtf do you mean you need sss hb for max ult proc
ult proc?
dj is in the grave btw
like cat is worse one
hb literally second worse sss sp valk
ely's crack
sheesh
then ss is prob good enough
45 50 55
tbh if her leader skill is like
yeah i have no clue either
ofc she's rank dependant lmao
she's sp valk
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
has been for a while
game is just kinda psy weighted
i don't think SA is that behind carole on non-shield bosses
tbh i don't think that's the case
than shieldbreak
cheap ult with easy tf
carole value on MA is more
oh in MA, you generally don't need dedicated shieldbreaking
even SA is still good enough
retain RL
but like
you can't skip griseo
if you want to retain nirv
like it all depends on goals
or not as meaty
like some bosses the shield is not extremely important
not exactly
expect to see DPS HoS Griseo as top scoring comp for bosses
yeah no she's likely to be the best general phys support for a while
yeah she's just for TP, easy skip right
so easy
yeah duh
finish patch in 1.4k
get full griseo in 4 pulls
get 7tr in one pull
easy
just plan to get every piece in 1 pull
i mean at that point
oh god rolled on rerun got 35 weapon
and then 1 patch later
of people skipping sp valk gear on release
i'll make a fucking compilation
is affix gaming
true end game of honkai
depending on who's using it
and you'll want diff affix on them
handel is used by FR, eden, HoT
if you're looking to be competitive
i mean i said
you'll want
2 sets
since you'll want 2 set eventually
that's certainly a good play
if you're looking to be competitive in like MA
rewarded
i mean i don't think it's a bad decision, esp if you get lucky
gear banner?
what did you luccsacc
HoR is 3.3
DA BKE are 3.9 4.4 valks
that'd be a downgrade
lmao
based
she's still plenty in the meta
not if but when
usually the question for that stuff is
also yeah eventually for sure
maybe
LMAO
i said in the wrong order
i think all of them
oh not in the right order, sorry lmao
next cycle will be BKE DA
lustrous cycle was ely HoT
azure cycle was SN AE
yeah
started on 5.0
even RL has plenty of s2+ BKE
or adv supply
than getting ss through like bp
is exponentially more expensive
but like pulling for ss
you don't know
i guess if you don't spend money
yeah like
spending event
i have her ss without rolling on her banner
so at high ranks BKE will prob outperform TP i'm thinking
but ss+ BKE too stronk
bleed boss, so you'd think TP would outperform
since dxy was basically same thing like
i mean i guess it's kinda obvious
are we sure BKE is top scoring there?
1. baldy gameplay and weird controls
2. best stig and best weapon on different banners (a lot more expensive to fully gear without cheaper stuff like bp)
3. literally everyone at high competitiveness environment have her at s2+, frequently ss+, so not matching that is very rough
like the problems with BKE are
there's plenty of reasons why BKE isn't the best pick to invest in but it's not because she's weak
like just because she isn't best pick at a lot of bosses doesn't mean she's shit
this is like extremely 1d thinking lmao
dxy is better cleared by TP
no
yeah BKE is still plenty valuable, just has a lot of caveats
BKE losing jizo or FR losing tona
so it's more of a question of who's losing their last boss first
i think at that she'll keep her status for a good while longer
like she's an okay option at multiple bosses but not top option
FR as dps is already powercrept, no?
i mean
oh
mihoyo powercreeps dps way faster than support
prob BKE
hmm
:D
hello person i don't know!
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
wait which 2 do you have
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
gamba time
at least the top scores
i didn't expect that from EU
that's surprisingly competitive
oh wow
one of sss skill is legit 10% tdm taken
ss is minimum but sss is preetty good
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
i gotta max cat pri too
oh yeah shit
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
max it
sheesh
scores well on clock, tank, FGO, tona
HoT kinda legit the killer of sss bosses
no HoT?
trust
on sss tona week
nah you're gonna be thankful
in abyss
it also matters a fair amount to her
also for standard support, like if you give it to SA
ofc tho if you're running TP dps soon, it matters a lot to her
hekate matters veeery little on FT MA comp
sleepers is way more important for running FT
<:A_NoteTao:928234793844486164>
must have gotten confused with kikau off field application
oooh i see
more crit bald
just require
but it's not impossible most of the time with s0
rank ups make it less bald
then it's weird
if you need CH QTE to help break shield
this run, literally no difference
depends on what you mean by matter
most of the times she overkills
is that she deals a fuck ton of damage already
thing with FT
like beeg number but
&s shennong T
and even T is kinda overrated/prob not worth crafting
shennong is trash besides T
i meant shui LMAO
prob can just run jw T shuijing MB
true
or ely TB / tons of options for M
shennong T / shui MB
top scoring stigs rn for delta are
<:disappointGura:756520039426949270>
fake simp
i've seen it in sss jizo too
in boss like abyss HoS
one for TP one for SA
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
you'll have 2 hekate
if you're really tp enjoyer
to be maxed
is very important
but FT's
most of the time
and BB's you can also leave at 50
that you can leave at 50
if you give CH hekate pri
to deal enough damage to kill quickly
quite a bit
are all free
those
can just use double sleepri ofc
here's an 840 SK with cheap gear no elf

scuff gear but with elf
yeah i said
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
no elf = completely different rotation
new elfs is like
no elf = less damage
is like
yeah like old elfs
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
used to be the most powerful
she
elf
tesla zero
what?
can run ely setup on FT now

double sleepri but with HoS but t0 instead

very scuff setup still 946 SK with elf
i could see it happen
lemme look for it
there's multiple setups
don't *need* panini either
boomer weighted
just kinda
in MA
still the most affordable
FT strats prob like
yeah i think so
like -1
without elf still scores well
i mean i guess fair but then you just do QTE alt
like 3 farmable character with like 3 gacha pieces between them lmao
it's pretty cheap xtal wise......
it's... not really whale...
like god need to farm ss2 CH? rather roll HoS
that should make you want HoS
yeah keep coping
kmb is veeery rarely used nowadays
like you don't need as much crit
way easier to get
it just makes the scores she get
like doesn't make her score better
it doesn't really make her more powerful
to clear shield
ss2 makes her way less bald
yeah
if you're MA balder
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
but
like it's prob not worth it
i'm considering going all the way to sss
tbh
if you think about it
so it's kinda close
which i'm getting ss1 next week
i'll do SK after i'm done with ss2 CH
right now i'm farming ss BR
ofc she is
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:RaidenSheesh:880900512084541533>
<a:chad:969329762206093372>
before any of those
farms HoV
meanwhile based taihen
virgin me farming SSS LE, FT, FR, Ely
tbh kinda based
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
but it would make me mad
so it wouldn't surprise me
i mean i guess aponia, strongest psychic of the mantis, is bio
<:Madge:939233173424967780>
if she's anything other than mech
the cyberpunk creator of mechanical inventions
i riot
if she's not mech
that'd teri herrscher of domination
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
does she even need a buff to be good
into becoming a good katana mecha ice
carrying the torch of meme
next mei ice mei
preferably
best universe
similar to 7tr
before the beta
but there's a good chance we get a reveal on story
yeah in 4 weeks we get beta v1
<:miriothink:959328310033252432>
and then you have the pity built up for herrscher
save for griseo stigs
for which characters are best or worst to farm for
i could make a tier list
yeah that's really nice
xiangling was pretty fine too
plant-mats wise
i think she's one of the best ones like
now that you say
oh i did that too actually
<:miriothink:959328310033252432>
that's why you skip ayaka
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
farm mora and books and leaked resources -> cry when they change resources from beta
do it like me
yeah that's p much it
griseo only climax
thank you
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
<:sus:866768426478862366>
if you catch me having a standard healthy sleep schedule that's just part of the cycle
so i'll just cycle it every few days
so if you leave me without responsibilities, my sleep schedule drifts 1 hour every day
i work on 25 hour sleep cycles
that's kinda nice
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
i went to sleep 6pm yesterday so i could be awake at 11pm
have a good a sleep
no, he'll bring out of nowhere
you talk like we need to be on dudu topic for diavoros to start complaining about dudu
nah you're too kind to diavoros
yeah, given that her skin is same theme as BKE from captainverse event, i think she's going to be important in this event too
HoT is bingo, LK is event, carole is bp
this are the skins
HoT skin is bingo
wait is it LK?
given that LK is getting a skin next patch
and next patch, LK skin event is prob going to be captainverse too
BKE skin event is captainverse
and another next patch
we're literally getting one this patch
wdym cope harder lmao
even tho i love HoF
but 5.0 is too like epic, not my favorite
like 5.2, 4.3, second half of 5.8
i like honkai pv when they're hype as fuck bops
yeah too calm
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i don't really like the first half of the pv
oh that's the entire pv
<a:dalaoexplode:959706477151551498>
LMAO i favorited that gif
that's kinda small but i like the energy
<a:rascalslap:969891913710837830>
also not a mod
sora started it
well actually
and i'm no mod
i started the bullying
<:nerdge:980201016853164144>
i know
thank you, thank you
<:Nerdge:792504573830496306>
<@728935268702486528> next time use this one
<:miriothink:959328310033252432>
imagine reading
i'll wait 4 years for carv to tell me about it when it's out in the open
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
thank you carv for telling me the lore
maybe 5
i think there's about 3 or 4
sorry
supposed to be BN
oh shit that's a typo
in 3 weeks i'll have SSS DN
sp deserves it
wooo nice!
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816> <:theliterate:959737715564359740>
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
cause they're not maxed
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
yeah way easier to say the word you are saying wrong than pta
cf
pta
gaming mouse
so 36
there's 7tr and griseo weapon next patch
well
:D
that's an all time low!
only 30 cubes
actually that's it
star shatterer, 11th, pta, nue, ely bow, eden gun, nyx weap, dupe bd, gaming mouse, cf
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
wanna compete on who's more cube starved?
s2 is beginning after that
that already happened in the movies <:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
do you know how many weapons i have to level?
huh?
what do you think?
how much it takes to get a cube?
boo you're askin me if i realise
do i realise?
do i?
pump them up <a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
those are small numbers
they turn into supply stuff
if she was already at sss
i'm gonna bald abyss a bit
you ask mihoyo nicely
so it's not like you're against unfair competition
i mean i guess but no one has access to SoS
bye bye
no one bothers to do MA
cause it's way easier to score higher
annoying weeks >>>>>>>>> easy weeks
like i always say
you'd be 13th btw
that sounds pretty good
no reason not to lock that in husk if it isn't going to lock you out of anything in kasumi or rimestar
i mean ik i'm saying that
i mean are you locking anything you'd use in kasumi
hmmm
over like couatl
i way prefer rimestar
rimestar isn't thaaaat bad
i mean i guess?
masters really sleepy huh
huh
okay that's
520 is not bad for masters
<a:cheer:585545022930419712> you got it boo <a:cheer:585545022930419712>
unfortunately
sirin does not turn exalted boss into masters boss
cause that vid is exalted
but it's not damage diff
i mean if it's qte diff sure
then BD and do SW stuff
dodge her attack
on p2
instead of BD immediately
you can just like
hmm maybe
like a hair away
you wanna ult when shield is almost broken
or you're not managing shield well enough
either buffs are running out
you should be able to deal enough damage
for the qte?
to be exact
53 more points
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
MA bald best bald
always crusher
again just crusher
yeah
i guess
and she must do some charged attack to proc irene
to proc HoF QTE
i think she ults to ignite
i dunno like
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
run this then
BR is necessary
cause i think for that rot
do you have BR actually
hmm you can try
doesn't deal as much damage
KoR will kinda suck there
just use hb's weapon
just rot
exalted so dw about damage
prob do something like this
lemme grab ref
HoF HB BD
yeah
way easier lmao
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
why don't you do HoF dps strats
huh if you have HoF open
dunno about actually killing her tho
yeah peeps use SW on exalted kasumi instead of HB to break shield
i wish 1 ult did her entire p2 hp
in masters
kasumi is paper
wow
that's kasumi for ya
<a:W_HuPopcorn:812570589205495808>
i'm watching
kasumi <:deadge:933767520085770341>
to clear those efficiently
i think fischl is p much necessary
you can do better than that i think boo
i love it
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
and see how well you score
i mean just try
i'm baby
yeah sure!
and i slacced on haxxor bunny event
i wasn't able to catch 4.6 piece
i'm new player
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
T prob right?
which of these do i buy
um
hopefully cause i haven't been making smart choices
most i've seen done with WC is that one weapon that spam weapon active
i think she has some scores?
if you use schro T
like CI is an okay carry
i don't think i have the boomer gear for it
you mean like dps tho?
in rimestar
in masters
i did t100 one week with CI support
since AE can proc it every rot with weapon skill
for FR
the bad thing is only proccing it on ult
but 2p (TB) is for 25sp cost
3p grants buff if 125sp cost or higher
it's not that bad if it's lower than 125sp cost
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
not ranks
that's pri-arm
also easier to play i think
i think standard team on sss clock runs FR
what am i needed for?
:(
nothing for old valk
next year we'll get like 13 different qipao skin, one for each flamechaser
<:Madge:939233173424967780>
why not twins
seele gets to have qipao stig and then skin
give me the qipao ones i'll pay anything
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
twins have like 13 different outfits in stigs and they're all great and they release none of them
isn't that a stig
so right
just feels
my favorite one is playing moon halo when fighting HoD
i love listening to 1 song in repeat
i do that on purpose
it sounds prob alright?
i mean idk, i've never fought ss husk
to not jumpsec
spam pause
it's like
everytime you see an SW ref
anytime she's up
also jumpsec hell
just kinda too slow to get her damage off
generally
SW sucks at ss boss
boo is masters
<:RaidenPat:941534428390359072>
yeah sure, what do you need to bald?
no i'm joking i'm an adult, leave me alone <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
i forgot about that
oh no
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
like a good kid
i was asleep last night
are you sure you aren't high rebooting
i'm pure
i don't
it's so fucking clean
like the one where they show future events
i actually really like the last section of 5.8 pv
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
tell that to the court
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
i guess i can see it
pv that is
i think i still prefer aponia eden
is really nice
yeah ost on griseo part of the pv
cunny alchemy
one cunny for another, i guess?
but
i guess kills TP
which well
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
griseo makes every dps a bleed dps
carl too powerful
sasuga
wow carl can read gifs
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
make her useless outside MA -> people don't pull for her -> easy MA ranks
based
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
i have no choice
they can nerf her again and griseo will still be good in MA
nah i only do it for the meme
tf is a sleep
is bald
the only thing i do for more than 6 hours
while HoT can only 840 i think bella
and HoF can 893 bella
since HoT 946 hepha
prob HoT hepha
actually
i don't plan that ahead
might change
bke jizo
probably like HoF hepha HoT bella?
can't wait
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
jizo hepha bella
it's a fucking fun as fuck week
no
v behind on that
cause i'm
probably bald MA tho
i'll come back later maybe to bald abyss
i actually need to leave to eat now
giga skill issue
ss aponia with 675
skill issue
-4 from aponia
prob better if i don't play like shit
my HoT sucks lmao
i can try
not feeling it lmao
eh idk
eh i doubt it, SA deals a good portion of damage
and then rotate better
or if i take into account that i won't clear
i have to farm sp way less
if i can clear p1 with on HoS ult
fucked up a lot lmao
hmmm i can prob go a lot higher
if i play better
hmm i prob can clear p1 with one ult yeah
first she just skipped the dodge thing
tf is going on this bronya LMAO
sheeesh
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
this is also prob way easier with para
it's likely my issue
might be my issue
no mic pls understand
okay i'm here to stream scuff abyss
jesus christ tet
.. fenriliar 
really easy honestly
just use HoS dps
oh that one
RL is boring as fuck
i'm RL
wait me? why me?
<a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
yeah heki stream
oh heki
stream my abyss?
i haven't opened abyss yet
what 2nd stage is
i don't even know
what you need help with
yeah can't relate
<:sus:866768426478862366>
but it's not what's stopping you
it's hard as fuck tho
luxlao retained nirvana with 1/4 HoS
you're never saving
yeah i'm here to prove small f2p gamer can retain RL and t100
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
lmao
5 patches
in like
i didn't promote my first cycle in RL
but because of not pulling apo
hell nah
<:pepeW:770030202548912179>
hey guess what i'm doing for this patch out of those 2 options
sheeesh i'm helpful confirmed
... morbintime
i mean this is for a point, MA has lower hp pool, if a valk needs to be SSS to score in a gamemode where everything is already supposed to die quickly
i think i've seen iriya retaining nirv with dps ae
okay so about SSS AE
she does have some meme kill potential in MA, but it's very expensive for what she does
that's literally 500 AL for 5% phys
why do you want HoV
 maybe this helps? nirv but should be similar, just less rots
raven unga bunga
newt timings n stuff
like a lot more to keep track of
yeah cat is way harder to play, but it does perform better
idk i think nothing
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
you wanna know how long i've been farming FR
though maybe on story earlier
like 3 weeks after patch release? for beta, if she's really 5.9
fucking reading comprehension city
literally said make her farmable so i can sss her and people reacted as me being whale
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
sss her
so i can
farmable
give me AE card
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
but farming sp with raven
if you can finish in only one raven ult then raven is better
= cat is better
if you have to ult more than once on raven
it was already being used in nirvana
it doesn't surprise me
yeah i mean
sheesh neb for blue reso
play well
i'll look for sw nirv runs
<:Sadge:715448677162024980>
oh okay
look what i said after
<:RaidenPat:941534428390359072>
good job
and dps windows
on how they use FR to fill trauma
maybe get inspiration from this run
 <@385655541248163840>
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
unironically forgot
lmao
with FR to paralyse
i mean you can just use HoS
ssg this nirv gamer
SW is nice cause she can do shorter rots with not many problems
take a look at refs maybe?
and then it'll go down slowly, but then it's like a timer
stuff only happens once you fill it fully
like it starts off as empty, when you fill some of the trauma it doesn't do anything special
<:peepoCry:598607564443353091>
ones you once held close
more enemies to defeat
like walking through a barren ER, no commotion to make you welcome, only enemies to defeat
yeah that's what i'm thinking about
lmao ER on v6.0 onwards
You reach closer to the elysia door
No one came to greet you
You think about calling out her name, but it's too late
Pick a signet:
usually they make new content and leave it to die lmao
tbh i'm surprised how much attention mihoyo is giving already to ER
highly doubt
and new areas
new story
but like big updates like
to like enable valk of the patch to clear easily
maybe like a few 2nd cores now and then
yeah like nini said, if it depends with ER being destroyed (which i think makes v much sense thematically) i don't think we'll have big updates
it depends on how it ends
affix gaming
and you'll likely want different affix for each
like kinda niche but you'll still prob want handel for HoT, eden or FR depending on occasion
i mean second handel was always for affix reason afaik
yeah it's quite tight actually
magery was like wow this valk is easy, i'll upload the video of my run and everyone will surpass my score once they figure it out and then they uploaded and still t10'd
but yeah
magery is a fucking giant dalao tho
with s2 aponia
magery t10 nirvana
even aponia global slaccs
but no, that's all global knows how to play lmao
has some hard combos
like you could say ofc PE is braindead but she's not that straightforward
PE isn't even that easy
and it's funny cause like
we sleep apparently
every other valk
but global only knows how to play PE
like idk about sea
yeah i know right!! lmao
that's also close to PE performance in HoD RL lmao
like she's still really good, wtf are those nirv retainers not pulling for her lmao
so we'll have a replacement
and it's prob not fixed for us
i dunno, bugged enough for them to disable it
like fire tank cycles
yeah it's so weird!! i don't get tank cycles
fgo's bugged tho
sss tona to MA
this patch added sushang fgo to abyss
and then quit
maybe people pull on sight
i don't get how that works
next time boss shows up no one has her LMAO
and then for some reason
RL infested with new valk
first few bosses of the patch that shill new boss
i mean it's always like that
it's really funny
also watch the vid, it's from jialao
7tr
this but with
yeah i've seen hard proof (seen people talking about it) so it's trash
LMAO
aw i'm sorry jesus fuck
maincord doomposting reaches whole nother level
can't draw too far
cpu has tiny arms
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
and slept like 8 hours
i took a nap
unfortunately
RL tho
FR ely HoS
i saw a ref
oh yeah HoS
raven to break swords doesn't sound bad
maybe HoF?
maybe FR dps?
i dunno what i'm running still
<a:toodalaotorelate:959796978131271730>
<:MeiKnife:647104199406125100>
yeah sure!
i uh don't agree
but to recommend on so many valks as main/core pick
like hua 2 is fine as a flex core
yeah i don't get it either
he's prob One Of The Good Ones (tm)
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
like hua 2 recommendation
questionable stuff
while moonlight center guide has some uh
i think i prefer butter's, has plenty of input from many top player like iriya and keeb
 <- this is butter from maincord ER guide
 <- this is medbae translation of CN moonlight center ER guide
whel
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
thank you
i need approximately a fuckton of phase shifter
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
i need to max eden gun + nyx scythe + verne TMB
phase shifters
to max a piece of equipment again?
how much does it cost
compels me
the power of the boomer
sheeesh
but it's still really nice to have
one of those things where it's way over valued in masters
it's actually way less useful in exalted
WOOOO lfg!
LMAO
tb?
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
from her release?
didn't you save the box
and you get 4/4
one more stig
you gonna pull more?
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
i'm poor lmao
hell nah
max lvl?
oh wait you mean
can only buy so much every time capsule
i do my best lmao
is rita cleaning new?
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
no all HoT now SSS
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i am feeling great
so
or HoS
while mobius, SW, PE all hog way more contested units like LE
but the supports HoT use are p much uncontested, DP and PV/FR
all 893 maru
s0 SW
s0 PE
s0 mobius
it's nice to have the option
though it's hard to say if that's possible <SSS
though rankwise HoT's is quite a bit steeper
most kills are 893s
but it's jumpsec hell
SS SW can 0s
not really
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
well 9s tho
1s maru is pretty nice
i think it still scores nicely
but i said it ironically
sasuga, idk what it means either lmao
nerfs really hit hard
ssg so weak
i could rewatch s2
but i think i was just in a different headspace probably?
i really liked s1 but i didn't like s2 as much
i'll prob watch it
how close to finishing is it?
it's too complicated to just Know what's best on a certain circumstance
to find the best one
just test out different sets
but like even the biggest dalaos
experienced enough
you can get a good idea if you're good enough at the game
if you take into account everything
i don't think anyone can consistently say what is the best setup for a certain fight
too many buffs have weird timing and conditions
it's just
i don't mean that it's complicated to calculate or like make sense of
for most player
TOO complicated
tbh honkai gear stuff is like
Explaining ALL of Honkai's complicated gear terms and damage sources
around 8:30 is when he explains that
but if you only want to know types of damage buffs
it goes throguh a lot of other stuff
keebster has a good vid
to understand what those are
which is also why it's best to try to balance out multiplicative stacking bonuses
the more you add = the less difference it makes, comparatively
which is where the dilution comes from
the static amount of damage you deal increases in the same manner, but comparatively to what you were dealing before, it matters less and less
which is a 10% damage increase
you go from dealing 200 dmg -> dealing 220 dmg
if we add another 20%
so you were dealing 200 damage
now lets say you already had 100% tdm
20% damage increase
you go from dealing 100 dmg -> dealing 120 dmg
if you add +20% tdm and you have 0
let's say you're dealing 100 damage
lemme make it more clear here
if you can kill in 5 seconds, then a stig with 5s duration 1 min downtime is good enough
like in MA, you don't need constant uptime
different fights and different valks will need different uptimes
the constant uptime part is where it usually depends
if you have 100%, +20% is a lot less increase
like if you have 0, +20% is +20%
dilution in that sense is about adding more to when there is already a lot
not really
like stigs are rarely as simple as 20% unconditional tdm or 20% unconditional elemental damage
but that's not always possible
you want to spend 100 on each
like if you have 200 money, and each money buys 1% on either
you want to spend that money equally
like if you think of it as stig power money
ideally, you want to have a balanced amount
which is 2.4
1 * (1 + 100%) * (1 + 20%)
it goes
but if you add it to elemental damage
which is 2.2
1 * (1 + 120%) * (1 + 0%)
it goes
if you add 20% tdm
so you deal 2x as much damage
which is 2
that's 1 * (1 + 100%) * (1 + 0%)
and +0% elemental dmg%
if you have +100% tdm already
think of it like this
that is
on dilution
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
depends
do i need to tap the sign
i think i can guess it
is she bio?
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
s2 is free tho
but yeah you can prob retain with s0
s2 is kinda baseline
no
and well geared, she's certainly good enough still to retain multiple weathers in RL
like HoR fills various niches which are not the easiest to fill
- ice damage
- ranged damage
- mech dps

while being rather cheap valk to gear
- free stig set
- cheap weapon since it was available multiple ways
- HB has best stig set in game you'd be pulling on either way
- similar about AE, though i guess ideally you'd be using cat
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
where's the drop rates mihoyo
lmao bout to get sued
HoR is pretty good still
eh i actually think
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i think mobius scores well
ye
welt TM irene B i think
abyss huodou is like
since it's not that big of an increase performance wise on most situations
99% chance it's not worth for you to get welt
since if you don't have welt
not worth the time explaining
it's just like
<:BronyaKing:646539680979877888>
welt has it's uses
i mean people say it's BiS but it's a way over simplification
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
and sometimes not at all
in rots where you're ulting
in MA often it saves 1s or so
sometimes yeah
and will outperform each other on different occasions
different damage uptimes and spikes
they have different bonuses on different parts of a valk's kit
different stig sets are hardly straight upgrades or downgrades
it's never that straightforward
it depends lmao
with everything on honkai
as always
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
i dunno
yeah 2.4k xtal on average
it's bingo, it's the cheapest
but idk, between zhenyi and griseo gear i'd prefer griseo gear
i'd go for it i think if you can still pull for griseo gear later
hmm are you pulling for griseo gear? how much do you have?
<:BronyaKing:646539680979877888>
is not what you should do
now THAT
and even if you get AE it's still nice for leader skil
if you don't get AE
i'd say it prob still is
2 50 dollar bundle < 1 100 dollar bundle
like if you know you'll spend later, better spend now and get better value
i mean it's not too complicated if you think about it
<a:MeiQuestion:930749563655061514>
and it's best value
cause i'm going to need more bchip later
just buy max bundle
even if i was like 100 bchip off
but after that
i mean i did
once
less than highest bundle
i don't think i ever bought
i mean in my time whaling
even if you need less, you're going to need more later
100 is best value
why would you spend any less than 100
if you're whale
i mean ofc it cost 100 dollars
cause it's old
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
i wouldn't use a calculator
but if i wanted to do math myself
+500 per week
also no ER
that's the name of the person who made it ig
memory diff
ayyy
or smth like that
itzpootz
it's called like
just look up crystal honkai calculator
league of legends?
i want to know tet
<:borpa:899532075311456266>
i've seen worse
<a:WorryHug_luma:530613959095615500>
it's okay heki
i mean i don't think it's the worst
i think it's fair
i already told heki that, he just said he'd buy xtal if he didn't luck out
<:Wendy:647103746593259530>
42k coin
fuck yes then
ooooh the coin
cny last year
i haven't seen that since
why
sorry
i have too much hos to understand those jokes
hos issue
okay
oh
isn't it only HoF PE SW
i think
there's no HoS expa
i wonder what's the most cursed way to get to abyss is
honkai menu myriad t100
get -> abyss
war treasury -> ancient legacy
get -> exchange coin shop
my plan was armada -> simbattle -> home materials
ah it fixed itself
actually probably!
abyss from here
i wonder if i can reach like
nah i'm in a challenge run now
i can't leave
help
help
i'm stuck
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
55 + 15 from HoS clone enough to ult on ely
oh yeah that's going to work well i bet
and skill for personal sp bank
leader skill sp bank for whole team
she has both
i don't make the thinking, i only do the balding
i mean i'm sure CN dalao will find uses for it
yeah could be useful if you wanna run FT BB strat but don't have double sleepri?
opens her up for mobius team
prob replaces LE on PE MA team if you have s2 PE
idk
yeah like
still really nice
or was it 55 sp now?
is already like another ss LE
just the leader skill
like even if she does nothing
yeah griseo kinda guaranteed a spot on MA
trust
for a patch
she's still going to be broken in ER
i'm a fucking bully LMAO
so often
i'm going to fucking use it
sorry gotta save that
.. diavorosdoomposting 
gj
and they still do good stuff
so much bullshit
admire those kinds of people in maincord
i like
ooooh yeah that makes a lot of sense
LMAO that's pretty good
☆I
i'll call her
aw that's cute
for griseo battlesuit
oh wait we have a name already?
as if mihoyo wouldn't make a repeated abbreviation again
you're so naive
nvm me
fucking eye issue then
wait was it really
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
nvm
oh you fixed it
kinda fucked up that you give <:KekPat:966625000339668993> for 6s and SN but FR is missing
goddamn
i wish i could think that much about an anime girl
honestly i'm kinda jealous
and score higher with less bald
FT BB double sleepri or PE
way more trouble than just using
just like
on some bosses
BB and SN get respectable scores with schro bald
like the option to, at least
not as often but it shows up every few weeks
schro
new cat everyone loves
too bald
old cat everyone hated
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
thank you cat
aponia, HoT and SN all score good enough to t100 in global
i mean rose from the dead is very generous
whale bait, bad rank ups, falls off a cliff without 12/12, extremely limited usage
can't kill a dead valk
nyx was always shit
but truth is
everyone like wow nyx so powercrept, god dammit mihoyo so bad
see ruby is based
lmao
fuck nyx
you can screenshot this and show me when i'm wrong
next herrscher being lightning sounds very improbable to me
i mean i kinda doubt
lmao
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
memento drive kometa
<a:NervousSweat:765639934555324486>
for character you don't use
yeah imagine buying skin
but it just feels a lot worse yk
prob doesn't lose you that much score if you do it scuffly
tbh it probably doesn't matter that much
basically made for fischl lmao
you have to do it 3 times is the issue
slacc singularity
as easily as you can with fischl
it'd be kinda annoying since you wouldn't be able to clear the swords
i mean i wouldn't be surprised
you really don't need much investment wise
but global is very slacc
SEA might be a fair bit harder
you got a loooot of leeway if you're only aiming for retain RL
if you're retain nirv/t100
like the top stuff is only really needed
retain RL with FR
you can def still like
but that's not to say FR is bad
on HoT team
yeah under most circumstance eden is better now i think
>40pt on abyss better
it'd still be like
even if it deal same damage + didn't stop buff timers
is already enough to make it way better
just the time stop
dia it's not doomposting when i do it voros
yoink
LMAO
or reset until the game decides it's your time to get a score
there's reset until you press the right buttons
there's 2 different types of honkai bald
it's just t10, 10 player each playing 10 diff acc each
not even t100
CN is like
built diff lmao
doesn't aka also have 2 global acc
SEA just has a lot more players than global
than get myriad t100
it's literally easier to retain nirv
like SEA
but just a lot more players that try hard
not as many whales
so it's like
on SEA
my t16 was like t20 tho
and they said i wouldn't even make it to t100
and i asked a sea friend
i got like t50 one week
ikr??
t100 SEA score cutoff is like t30 global
SEA is a lot harder to t100
on global, at least
t100 MA you can skip a good bunch of releases if you have a good amount of old stuff invested in
retain nirv is like don't skip any valk
retain nirv is a lot more expensive than t100 MA
tbh if you're retain nirv you prob already have a lot of what's needed to t100 MA
poor himeko
waow even carv forgets about himeko
if you ignore half of the game competitive environment she isn't good
besides MA is the bane of my existance
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
7tr get nerfed lmao get fucked
griseo gets nerfed they'll buff her back right
okay still in denial
LMAO
<:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
i bet diavoros has some opinions about his loli getting nerfed
oh no
bp giving valk
adv supply
break up ranking
what i don't like is a lot of spend bait mihoyo is doing
i mean i think new newbie event is fine
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
i hate it here
it really is
how to speedrun tell me i don't actually am competitive in honkai
Plus, i don't understand why the exageration of playing on 120fp, when 60fp, with default video settings, is equally as good.
they're SO bad LMAO
lmao that's funny
LMAO
so bad
it's
check the comments on that
this video was my black pill on general honkai community
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816> <:theliterate:959737715564359740>
but like nda closed beta, getting mad at changes lmao
yeah i get mad over that
seeing they removing sp gen from valk and adding to equipment
some dumb shit like
like a non-nda beta i kinda get getting mad over it? like it's not right but i see that
so stupid, it's a closed beta lmao
i meant like the community reaction for genshin was a lot worse
i mean the genshin one was a lot worse imo
yeah
and then not actually play the game LMAO
they love to have hot takes and controversial opinions
i mean in the end it's the same problem with the majority of honkai community
and test it out on release
like we literally can just wait until dalao get their hand on valk
cause no way
or their first beta
their first game LMAO
it's like
i just feel like all of those peeps doomposting in maincord
she got nerfed, people went dead valk, still insane value lmao
yeah i remember HoF doomposting LMAO
nerfs barely changed much in that front
it wasn't worth it
or rl nirv ping pong
and yeah like you said, with or without nerfs, f2p or people only aiming for like RL retain
so you're gonna need her, if you want to compete there you'll need those ranks
in abyss
and like, even past nerfs HoT will still have bosses
because literally everyone will have it
in abyss
is going to hurt so much
not having ss+
like if you're aiming for nirv retain
depends on the type of player
eh i mean i still think it was prob worth it
infested with sss HoT
nirvana is going to be
it's a lot of peeps first sss gacha-only valk too
like past s0
i got ss HoT without even pulling for her lmao
a lot of peeps just got it like passively
2 bp, spending event, top up event, 2 adv supply, now supply shop and another top up event
so many ways
is because they gave her away for cheap
i mean the main reason why there's so many ss/sss HoT
you barely can find likes <ss refs <:deadge:933767520085770341>
even though HoT rank ups aren't thaaaaat impactful
specially from CN
yeah all refs are infested with ss+ already
<:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
soon
sss HoT
so many
there will be
based
<:miriothink:959328310033252432>
if you get ss3 HoT
you don't need to farm sss LE
well i guess
if you have sss LE
literally atk
isn't it like
is ss3 even worth it?
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
that'll do it
oh yeah mobius on 2 phase boss
i respect it
you treating her like an abyss boss
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
kasumi is like IS THAT A MISINPUT??? -7 BITCH
all other bosses are like oh no mistimed tf, here's -1/-2
as all other bosses LMAO
twice as fast
i swear kasumi clocks just runs like
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
it's kasumi
<:sus:866768426478862366>
with lv35 bow
my ss2 4/4 ely
i'm going to hide
before going for gustav TM
i'd at least finish ely TB
prob quite low prio
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
like on double sleepri CH strats
and for that CH is better
the buffs and that's it
you just need
you don't need all of that
but on some strats
HoS can do a lot more, like more bonuses + better tf and time slow and time stop
CH gives way faster bonuses if that's all you need
in MA
and HoS is not a necessarily straight upgrade from CH
2p has tdm% taken that she can proc cause of high cost ult
if you're actually using her for her impair
glut T margrave MB
she uses like
like CH doesn't even use gustav i don't think in abyss?
eh not necessarily
fills a good amount of holes
really nice to have for MA
yeah gustav actually
for SR requirement
phys rime is a lot tougher
with like turg debuffs
then you can get away with way less
like if you're doing elemental rime
debuffs and stuff
how high it needs to be depends on like
so if you have low atk, it does nothing, but if you have high enough atk it actually works on the shield
yeah think of it like this, it's hitcount but it has a minimum amount of damage the hits need to deal for it to count
yeah long overdue
like i feel like 37 atk is prob good enough for a good while
yeah prob not
just atk diff
yeah like the skills make no difference in this strat
just for the stats
maybe max her to lv80
like, specifically atk
you're just missing damage on her
yeah that's rough
did you at least level rangers to 35/35 <@385655541248163840>
but are you set on that?
then second yeah
rerolling with wafer
if you're set on
ooooh i thought you were talking about that or the sp cost one
yeah
glut T paga MB SR
give newt to hos
atk then
do you have newt open?
SR not dealing enough damage
yeah hmm that's weird
for who
to rimestar
rangers wasn't close enough
yeah
to proc paganini
did you do the charged attack on SR?
so that the rangers active damage
that made her take more damage
prob applied some debuff on rime
after chains
i mean it looked like it did in the vid
clone pop off
evade -> chains -> sword
and then ideally wait until shield is popped before doing
-> HoS QTE -> spear
PE evade -> SR drop cross + charged
you're supposed to go
just like get a feel for when you're supposed to weapon active
especially since i couldn't figure out like a set of inputs to do it consistently every time
very annoying strat LMAO
and you saw the sword slowly approaching dxy and not hitting
so some times you just ulted
and dxy needs to be bleeding for HoS ult to break shield
you needed to ult on HoS asap
kinda tilting too since
so if you timed LE active right you could watch the sword just slooowly getting near dxy
and then chains time slow + clone pop tf slowed down time a fuck ton
you had to like LE active -> switch HoS evade chains
i had some recordings back when i was trying the 946 dxy
so it can be a bitch on some strats
if you tf the sword in the air travels slower
muramasa is similar
so it deals less overall damage too
and afaik it also doesn't make the duration longer
well, not stops, just procs way less, like it's in slow motion
it stops dealing damage
so if you TF in the middle of the active
that get affected by TF
one of the weird weapons
rangers is like
<a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753>
SR does...
but prob not worth it?
rangers is nice since to max it you don't need cubes
hmm yeah atk is likely still an issue
but if not then you'd still run dudu
so if you need sirin buffs to deal damage then sure
it's binary either it does or it doesn't
cause more buffs doesn't make it deal more damage to shield
if rangers doing damage to shield tho = already good enough
i mean i guess it might be better
hmm
on rime?
sirin?
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
now beat your past score
nice!
2 hours delay
and it's like
okay i'm sorry y'all, new story chapter is getting delayed. yeah, we have no idea when it's coming, so just prepare for the worst
i like how mihoyo does delays
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
get away from coin diff?
not even boomers
pyramid just press the roll button lmao
not easier probably
i mean it's more affordable than pyramid
you get it
and then when you get skin as top prize
at 4th round
so if you get unlucky, just reset more next day
there's limited resets but more are added every day
but yeah you can get unlucky
before then, no chance of skin
like you need to reroll on 4th round
you reset until it shows skin as top prize
when you reach 4 round
it's simple, you do the first 3 rounds normally (just roll random spots until you find top prize and then go to the next round)
half the price of pyramid
2.4k on avg, prob like around 4.5k max?
half the cost
it's like
idk
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
wait HoT skin is bingo?
i'm sorry for what i've done
we have aster here?
shrek is a gif <a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
gotta make it count
i really like the shrek one
i'm only more confused
every time this is posted i jump around and watch 30s to see if i understand what the movie is about
morbius
\> honkai 2022
\> good for more than 2 patches

pick one
also gives sp on entry
v3 is last version but there could be v3b/v3c
sorry
893
oh i was wrong
yeah
you can 946 kallen with it
it counts as cope second sleepri now
i mean
an AI way
and then try to like make their own opinion on new stuff in like
and regurgitate good player opinion
only watch beta and new release
don't actually play the game
a good 30-40% of maincord peeps
i feel like
maybe more
we got a list of cunny patchers:
- diavoros
- ruby
- hei
- bruh
- char
- inukai
not another cunny patcher
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
v3d
upwards of 20% is insane
that's still really good
even if she's like 5% better than carole
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
but on sss boss it'll be pretty nice still
so the higher uptime on buffs don't matter that much
and most of the time in SS MA, if you're ulting at all, you're killing on ult
she already has heavy timeslow on ult for MA clock
actually not that much
LMAO
don't know shit about MA
because i feel like avg player
but like i hope they're talking about abyss
i meant like
i thought they were talking about MA because they didn't specify which husk (or both) that they were talking about in that post if it was about abyss husk
SW can do it too but needs way higher investment (like 3/4* elf, ss+)
since she can stun husk into not spawning a clone
on RL, HoT outscores SW at mid-high investment
also actually
there's 2 husks tho <:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
oh wait they're prob not talking about MA
after maybe SW
LMAO
<a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
congrats!! that's really sick tbh
but no to both LMAO
and nirv scores would be competitive for her bosses
like you'd think a great coverage, most recent herrscher with fun gameplay would lure people into learning how to play her
<:LETSFUCKINGGOOOOO:857049432587763712>
i don't get it either, global just sucks at HoF i guess
and she will probably not get powercrept on those for a good while
she will cover around the same amount of bosses as any new S-rank
yeah like
realistically speaking tho she'll have her niche
based
fully geared supports tho ofc
with 1/4 mobius
893 on hepha on a friends acc
i remember i got like
is mobius not f2p friendly?
LMAO
but i want the salt
cause i'm not going to maincord
god please get me more context
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
mei herrscher gacha S-rank + ely herrscher free S-rank + ely elf
true
LMAO
to the ones that pulled her
aponia does deal mental damage
so they don't need to make her powerful
that will pull for cunny no matter what
mihoyo found out that there's a type of player
it doesn't matter over here
come to MA
agony 3 different breed
stop balding we might reach 200 disturbance!!!!
lmao
doesn't surprise me one bit
and the shit i see in rl
but with the scores i see in ag3
it's a really low bar tbh LMAO
unironically
i mean like i really believe that people bald more at ag3 than RL
why didn't you top up to get senti
i mean sure if you're going to top up to get skin, go for it
i actually really believe that
ag3 legit just masters MA
people were scoring 92x in ag3 last cycle
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
i mean of course you did, agony 3 you score 850 by sneezing in the wrong way
so ig you can retain RL
apparently mobius scored like 650 on husk
<a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753>
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>

t-thank you?
<a:CarlBonk:924970233373020170>
;_;
carl i protected you
what
or mad over cunny nerfs?
they mad over 7tr nerfs
in what way
so you'll be throwing those xtal to the trash, basically
and pity doesn't follow through
but because overwhelmingly chances are that you'll not get it
not because it's not worth it
i mean but legit tho you prob shouldn't spend your xtal on skin
minimum wage worker excited for new bmw
why are you excited for the skin then
?????
- i'm poor
yes, but consider
i'd think about it
if it was bingo
i can't afford a pyramid skin LMAO
thought i was bingo
nvm
oh yeah cerulean
we're getting skin?
oh wait
for both f2p and whel
still easily the cheapest skin
next time it shows up
idk there could be different bundles
but you'll be forced to use xtal at the end i think
so yeah prob worth it to grab those
on the vid i watched it was only max of 2 x10 bundle for bchip tho
yeah it's very interactive
it's better than xtal i guess
1.6 value
vs 600 xtal for 10
300 bchip for 10
oh i see it here
idr the prices <:deadge:933767520085770341>
and not buy 200 keys
just gotta be not like my armada mate
which is still half pyramid cost
that's at most a bit less than double that
if you go extremely unlucky and go all 16 slots every round
which is 2.4k xtal
33 minus the free one
8.5 x 4 = 34
it's 8.5
i bruteforced to get avg amount of rolls to get top prize on bingo
but you should just reset at 4
by the 6th round it's guaranteed
6 rounds
16 possible open spots
it's like
9.6k is pyramid yeah
it's 2.4k on avg
skill diff
bruh wins
not even playing alone
LMAO
yeah check top left, file 89%, when you complete everything there you get it for free
<:scaramouch_lurk:925161879322624110>
and you don't use ae imaginon to upgrade it

also i don't top score every week <:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
nvm <a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
not molotov cherry
oh main character
literally don't, mine sucks
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
got the name from kiana the bird from hua
i'm kiana and hua child
keilo kaslana
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
my name already starts with a k
past era - man
current era - woman
next era - non binary?
hey maybe
well if you see it that way then nvm
like, past era kiana was barely touched on, besides the possibility that she was HoE
she wasn't important in past era, yeah?
i wonder what's the deal with kiana
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
that fucking sucks i wanted to play the games one day
wait what ni no kuni got into nft shit?
<a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
yeah that's what i remember too
that sucks, hope he gets well
you got fucking 7.0 bp, tet
isn't kora HoF's?
since so much to save for in the near future
prob not for like full f2p or low spender
if you're gearing up lightning team
yeah it's prob still v worth it
i'd use welt every day
who needs sig B piece - mihoyo, probably
welt TM irene B on HoR
freeze huodou was bastet TM newt B on cat
it was in freeze huodou
it's also frequently BiS in abyss too
could be worse ig
welt is like... fine?
lwh is going to be great once we get g4 fire
columbus and irene are okay
fine ig
it's
we do know the rest
wait no
yeah we don't know the rest
<:sleepy:914211439286304778>
i sleep
don't ask questions
one for LE, one for HoT and one for CI
yeah no i remember why actually
i don't know why
i have 3 i think
<:lfg:803114423430545418>
but nice to have both
different fight might want different effect
pulse katana doesn't so it's pretty much always immediate
under certain circumstances
so stig application can get very finnicky
muramasa blades get slowed with tf
nice it's pretty useful
second run kinda nuts still
that's expected
yeah nvm
first run is masters
i got baited
oh wait shit
honkai 2022
unironically every boss is 0s
every boss 0s
literally

that was a great one tet
... heki
LMAO
and glorified mp3 players
which is whatsapp and watch youtube videos
for the same stuff i use this one
i'll literally use it
and even if i get a better phone
this lasted me like 4 already
why?
no
yk
all old phones waterfall down
when someone in my family upgrades
in the line of phone transfer
i'm like
that's kinda based tbh
which according to wikipedia that's 6 years ago but i think that's wikipedia gaslighting me
it's from 2015
yeah
it's like
a j2
even if i get a better one it'll still basically be a worse computer
i also literally couldn't care less about phone stuff
don't get me wrong i'm very fond of it
my phone is glorified mp3 player
it also sucked yeah
cause of lack of space
i had to uninstall discord from it
yeah my phone is only for whatsapp and youtube while i sleep
the issue is keybinds for the attack stack things
but pgr is very unintuitive
i can prob deal with it
if it's something like arknights
playing that on emulator fucking sucks
like i tried
pgr i won't
no
yes, i'm smart
stamina i can understand
same!
nah i can do worse i think
so i can understand this talk
god i really gotta start playing new gachas
yeah it sucks
yeah i'm like don't craft darwin and why are you using LK
oh shit that's not honkai probably
tfs a flamel
so i get automodded
i'll take retardation

wait you can actually get away with that emote in wfp
<:sleepy:914211439286304778>

or like a normal sized message 1 letter at a time while doing abyss or some shit like that
either writing the biggest lore dump in 5 years
swear i dodged that
huh why's the timer still going
LMAO i would do dumb shit like that
i'm that for genshin now but unironic

oh

gotta make sure our server for the gambling anime game is family friendly

oh my god i fricking love genshin impact
wtf
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
oh yeah
wanna gamble and do pri raid

<:E_RaidenSip:882522778769711134>
<:miriothink:959328310033252432>
simple
just make them not want aponia
yeah let them save for who they want
is that mei beach party
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
just got done with mine
when i was freshly exalted
i cleared that with HoR
so they're going to suffer later this patch still lmao
that sidestage is also mainstage for jizo boss
that's unfortunate
i mean i'm not surprised i didn't know then
oh
wtf you can do dk raid with 2 people
Griseo
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
maybe she sent a message too and it didn't get to earth
we don't know if griseo received the message
why does yui only react to you
wait does yui only react if you Griseo
but they're all dead
imagine small griseo crying alone in space waiting for a message back from the flamechasers on earth
that's worse
yeah!!!
why pull for dead people
she's dead
trust himeko isn't that good
save for griseo and new herrscher
but slug is not good enough for xtal competition with broken and flexible stig like turg
like if you get slug for cheap like bp or smth somewhere else then that's great
don't use it there
if you're gonna spend xtal
not a bad set just that
similar issue with shuijing
but i wouldn't recommend xtal investment on it nowadays
like it's very good to have, and if you pulled on release it was a very good deal
since SoS with turg is good enough to retain RL
you don't have many reasons to pull for slug
if you're not nirv player
if you already have turg
they're about same price since they're not set to have promos on them or anything like that
your choice is either turg or slug
you wanna spend xtal on elemental support stig
like think about it this way
but if you pull it rn i don't think it's worth it
if you pulled it on release it was a great deal
it's not very flexible
not great
it's not bad it's just
in abyss you might want the cd reduction from teri origins or avo M
since you'll be putting cross down once
MA you'll mostly use slug
depends on rot
yeah then you prob won't need SoS much
i think rebooting has raven gear
nah i'm just talking generally
i don't think raven gear is a good investment
but if you don't have raven
ofc not
if you have raven
like the thing is
it's pretty cheap since she uses turg + craftable cross
i think SR as fire support is kinda nice
that kinda depends
since you won't have ults up for second rot if you're rotating properly without max cat pri
yeah cat pri is another one, your rotations fall apart if you don't have it maxed
if yours aren't maxed
so you just can't follow ref
like DoS gens more herrscher bar the higher level it is
but some are extremely more important than others
if not for buff then just base atk
dps pri usually want as high as possible
depends
very bad
yeah
PoS extremely useless
PoS only if you're exalted for SoS
for elemental team lv50 is prob okay
if you're using her in phys team for rimestar will prob want 55
depends on your SR
on wolf if you use SpA the comp is SpA SR AE
there's a kasumi strat that uses it, a heimdall strat that uses it
she scores like -1 or -2 without it
meanwhile magtyphoon isn't that important for mobius
some non-rime MA strats also use it
rime is fucked without SoS
SoS probably
and do you have mobius built
do you have raven built
duh
for sss tona
yeah
meme weapon
<a:pepeMeltdown:933941237021569035>
oh god so much money for nyx pri i'm so fucked
i'm fucked
i need to max verne TMB and 2 weapons
oh god
literal meme weapon
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
i can only dream of maxing meme stuff
ice cream, DoV, nuada, 6s pri, surtr, fhd all pretty useless
it's meme stuff
i mean you're at a point where 99% of that stuff is not even luxury
or nyx scythe for tona
i dunno if i'll max eden gun for doom
i can max a weapon
i have 4
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
actually 32
well, will be back at 29 on griseo release
that's an all time low
only need 26 cubes though!
<:deadge:933767520085770341>

good job
can't even imagine how it'd be with unmaxed
the amount of crit bald in that strat
you better max her pri arm
with HoS
i mean if you're doing rime PE
let's fucking go
that's almost 5x as much as i have and this is the most i've saved up in months
i have  3m and i feel like i'm swimming rn
wtf do you mean only have 14m
LMAO
no you haven't
oh
have you see HoS spear auto attack gather?
heki going to show you how to HoS by gathering your organs together
if you're boomer you have no resource issue
coming-from-genshin whales

jumps on the opportunity to suck theresas cock
huh diavoros really
yeah sure
and it's like cool but literally no improvement on her performance cause i'm too poor to 6* her lmao
i got sss like a week ago by now
i want 6* FT
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
but i also need asterite
so i'm like i need those wills
i also need so much asterite
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
yeah no i have none of those
oh okay
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
why you donating then?
t-thank you i'm very poor
<a:KaguyaPanic:701189401148915832>
but yeah it's so bad
and then do HoS bs
until it goes away
you prob need to stay in SR to auto attack it
what rot are you doing
does that really score that bad?
hmmm
yeah no SoS is rough
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
if i can -2 and get a 733 with s2 i'd be happy
it's 840 tho
but it's ss HoF
HoF WD BR
i guess i can try this strat
ig you can try
that makes sense
who are you giving that to
also
idt eden guns deal much damage
probably not
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
even though i really wanted to do SW RC HB on husk
and run the HoF SNS RC on kasumi
i'll prob just do the old SW AE HB on husk
with good enough score on other bosses
prob can top 2%
honestly
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
that's kasumi
but i'm scared of locking dumb shit
i want to run husk sw rc hb too
what are you running on kasumi?
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
it's just true i need 15 hour for each boss to score
i need all the time to get good score on my acc
you see, i like balding but i suck at the game
what do you think i am
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
for HoF ult
that kasumi shield is very low
you can see on fhem ref
only AE refs i see are with BD
something something calculation with overflow of damage after shieldbreak
yeah i think it's elemental shield specific
for some reason you deal a lot more damage if enemy only has a little bit of shield
so HoF ult while kasumi has shield still but only a little bit
you need to balance out damage
it's an annoying run tho
or this
maybe run something like this?
the others are 733
the last 2 score like 626
HoF SNS RC
HoF RC SF
HoF HB VK/BR
HoF SW VK/BR
HoF HB SR
HoF AE SR
HoF AE SF
there's a few options
you're not going to fake me out into it
i already told you i don't read stigs
allan poe T
is this
i mean you don't have to have a lot of friends!
this is my favorite joke i've made i think
like a range?
[2,5]?
yeah that'd make sense
yeah fuck them
but if it wasn't me
don't worry about it
then they prob had a good reason
okay if it was me
you're an npc in my dreams
gotta tell your friend
damn
as one does usually to unlock doors
yes of course
i like this
i jump on the chandelier to collect crystals to unlock the door
good one
heh chilling in there
boss: easy
random mob before boss: hardest thing in the game for some reason
are like
half of SW bosses
literally true, also i like balding bosses, not target system <:deadge:933767520085770341>
i like that
honestly
1. get into a cult
2. dilf
3. die
god i'd take that
<a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
oooh that's a good one
i'm pleb
hmmmmmmm
oh i'm into that
gotta workshop that
hmm i don't like that one
the only cult i'm leading is you to my bedroom
<:BronyaKing:646539680979877888>
so it's kinda worth it as long as you don't do any math
from now on every extra xp i get is coin
also if you think about it
but i want everyone at lv80 max xp eventually
it probably wasn't smart
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
not the donkey kongs
oh no
gotta work on your dorm i guess
better example
i mean i'm not joking
that's non-pri atk
1290 is sad
jesus fuckig chirst
do they get that atk from
where the fuck
ref FR has 1600
at 1400 atk
my FR is ss2
cause no way LMAO
+30 base atk to everyone
i think cn just gives
everyone has atk issue
rough
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
but no crusher on nyx team
they're sniping
for their loss
tell them i'm sorry
oh
who is it
my bracket sleepin
how f2p can you go LMAO
no crit bald
for easy 626
HoS with shattered TM newt B
you can run like
PE HoS SR
yeah that can happen LMAO
NA RL is fucking sleep central
LMAO
on the right boss
CH dps
NA RL you can retain with like
i mean
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
maybe vill-v fire support will make mihoyo shill fire again in abyss
always like that
it'll show up when mihoyo wants to shill
haven't seen it in a while but
i mean yeah it exists
PE powecrept HoF in that regard
so really
since 5.0 HoT SR HoF team outscored her
MA rime that is
DA was dead for a while in rime
not really
i mean
so yeah feel free to lock PE in rime
only phys team afaik that scores in kasumi is FT and it's extremely bald too
yeah for top scores you'll run
aponia or SW team on husk
HoF on kasumi
PE on rimestar
5.1 was jizo tank
5.2 was wolf
5.3 was husk
5.4 was parvati
5.5 was HoD
5.6 was FGO
5.7 was tona
or some shit
5.3 boss
it's like
no it's not
if your standards are really low lmao
prob still works in MA
like as impair source?
i mean it's going to happen eventually, abyss is like powercreep central
and that's the thing about honkai, if you only care about like retain RL, powercreep really isn't that bad
retain RL
but HoS will still be good enough to like
she'll be necessary for nirvana ofc
like even if they release better HoS
they're still going to be great picks for lower goals
that even if they get powercrept
and so well
they do so much
the thing about HoS and AE is that
like the thing about hua
<:RaidenSheesh:880900512084541533>
MA, new support released = one more for the party <:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
abyss, new support released = old support dead
come to MA life
which is going to happen eventually
in abyss, it'll prob die with HoS
in MA it's almost never what she wears
it depends what you mean by powercrept
very very good stig still
insane value
get it through bp or craft?
but shui is not bad at all
ofc you pull paga
like if you're choosing between pulling paga or shui
like it's not worth the xtal probably
it's still really good
i do feel like people severely underestimate the power of shuijing now
especially now that it's craftable
cause everyone has margrave M
but you barely see the like budget not as good options
but it's not that much better than other option
margrave M is kinda of the better option
it's the opposite actually
but i do feel like
like the size of the W for f2p is unimaginable
shui craftable would be SO big
so you don't see it as much
everyone has the better options
it's just that
it's not that behind better options
margrave M problem
it's kinda like
and it's still pretty good
20 versions old
shuijing is literally
i mean
than on rerun
so much cheaper
getting it on release is like
and every sp set is good nowadays
you'll want every good set eventually
i mean yeah like if you're whale
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
i also don't want to roll on rerun
unskippable
and like sp gear nowadays
because catgirl
i just rolled on bastet
since there's more bastet on BB than bastet on RC in MA
i'll prob leave it like that
i mean tbh
it's a great bonus tho
no
quite desperate
i was
i actually rolled that for BB
lemme grab a screenshot
i actually have a sick bastet piece
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
that's why mine suck
mihoyo gives better affix roll for whel
whel
or try to get great sp/s to not use bastet B
go all out on atk
prob would either
yeah if you're running cat dps
roll sp stuff on TM to use newt/irene B
i thought the plan was to
do you have sp issue with bastet B?
wait
yeah i'd keep that
so close
for 42069 affix mats
need another 0
<a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
rare carv bald
yeah lower time farming for AE is prob nice
actually i have no clue if newt B is better than bastet for dps felis
time to newt B?
hakcer acting surprised even though everyone knows it was him
it's probably still good enough
if you have good sp gen
even if you have only eden
can low roll at the start and clear still
makes ER so comfy
yeah the skill sigils actually just carry early game for any valk
if you're running kalpas and eden
it's actually pretty strong
the +300 hp +40 sp one
i actually recommend changing into the one aponia sigil
max sp is actually goated if you're going with eden
lmao i got speedran into wall of sus
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
bald? <a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
who cares about more
if they're good enough for 130d
but it's all about goals ig
i mean yeah ofc
i think plenty of gacha valk are good enough with cheap setup to at least 130d
that's beta only LMAO
i just know
and like
i saw someone sharing screenshot of sushang for sale on random shop
though if it's in the game i kinda doubt it's not beta only
are you giving ideas or is it in the game? sounds p nice
easy
use ss0 4/4 mobius
literally psychopath opinion yeah i think devs should suffer for fun
LMAO
i do complain about they reusing artifact system, but not because of the reuse part, because of the artifact system part
i prefer it if it's small stuff that doesn't make a big difference and makes dev load smaller
i mean i honestly don't care about reusing assets and that stuff
hakcer can't count and i think aoi is complaining about reused assets in different game
that's not as impactful, those are just the valks before break up ranking
hakcer you're going to get the bruh doesn't play the game seal
?
tyvm
only bitches that can't count
LMAO no math allowed in this chat
it's pretty fun
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
and add atk
that's pretty fair though <:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>

<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
MA?
wait
would be nice if they gave us somewhere to use it
i actually think genshin combat is pretty okay
bronya going to hsr PoV
very pretty
<a:peepoTrip:755692813320060959>
v likely that i stay with hi3 for the end of the time
it'll also be pretty short
and if zzz is similar
but hsr will keep me for like a month maybe
i'll play hsr and zzz
i mean
<:sleepy:914211439286304778>
but we're the minority
we hate it cause we want a game that will keep us interested for a long time
it's very on purpose
from mihoyo pov
i mean
got caught up somewhere
trust
my beta key is still coming
whole honkai community would collapse
if she went all out
ninilao limits herself
idk about that <:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
good enough to t100
well, keyboard only
and yeah
me pleb you lao
i'm pleb <:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
maybe space bar for weapon active? then you don't even need to move fingers
that's prob nice
i know some people do shift for evade
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
i use default controls
it's not that bad <:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
since you'll be rolling for crit either way
prob run marco M
like if you're going to use something to boost HoS' damage only
nah that prob isn't good enough
oh yeah paga M prob works
avo maybe?
dunno of many phys support M pieces
best i can think is ppm
maybe? what would you even replace it by though
previous screen bottom right
i would've skipped it, easily
if i had not seen that
LMAO
only for that ref
actually pulled eden gun
i legit
it looks really fun
i actually can't wait
i think that's what everyone's running
you got it taihen
<a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
<a:dalaoexplode:959706477151551498>
hi ninilao
me pleb
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
to translate fhem notes
i need korean dalao
saves 1 point <a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
if you think about it
pre-yassified
leonardo dicaprio kinda comes
i wouldn't call it yassified tho
i kinda see it
why is your emote so small
wanna see kekchad
and missed the homestuck 2 bullet
and then whatever the fuck was the epilogue during start of college
catched up in time to watch the final act drop
i mean i guess not as late
so i was late to the party
yeah i got into homestuck because of undertale
these ruins... something bad happened here
starting to read it and seeing the community it was like
so it was funny
i got into it past homestuck era tho
i'd be the type that would get into homestuck
i mean i think you could prob guess
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
this follows from what i know about from homestuck
<:sus:866768426478862366>
is homestuck
um the only thing i know about star signs
13 mins of cutscenes
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
it's one of those fuckers
every 2 weeks
fucking kallen doom dxy
yeah that makes sense then
that's kinda surprising
whoa
really?
discord ToS?
rip <:deadge:933767520085770341>
main issue with buying rando acc is just getting fucked by someone you don't trust probably
is prob the type of person mihoyo wants playing their game
or maybe way more for a lategame acc
5 bucks on a starting acc
like the type of person who's willing to spend like
unless they're botted maybe
i mean i don't think mihoyo generally cares about account trading
honkai any% retire speedrun [WR]
buy lv81 acc -> UI too confusing -> don't know how to play the game -> abyss too hard -> quit
if you need inspiration
HoF clock
also
like the next step to get good at the game
there's not many guides that go indepth like that
like i'm not saying you should do it just
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
i mean yeah
or do they just want the catgirl go spiny spiny
do 90% of honkai playerbase actually care about that
but then like
understanding dps windows with newt timing and freeze timings
like phyllis knowing when to use bastet B or newt/irene
maybe space for more thorough guides like different rotations, what to look for on rotations, different teamcomps and equipment and their small stuff
i mean like the basic character rundown guides yeah
like there aren't many good honkai guides but also i dunno if the majority of honkai player care to play honkai well
eh idk
good honkai guides is prob an untapped market i think
.. elishuadownbad 
for beta
you're down bad
jesus christ
duh
just get lucky
not like who ticks that, but who actually creates content
i feel like probably yeah
a whale will go down very low to the worst investments since they've done all the best already
and you go down the list
a tier list of best to worst investment
i think of it like
that stuff doesn't change whether you're whale or not
if you know what's a good investment or not
like if you got good base knowledge of the game it should be possible to give good advice no matter your spending tier
but HoT on kasumi is way more bald to cap
both on kasumi are like 733
HoF on husk apparently caps at around 47.2k, HoT 47.4k
you can try on training mode
with HoF
there's some 47.2k
well
run HoF on kasumi and phys rime
i mean that's about as good as it gets
then HoT
what options do u have
yeah they can
<a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
only know balders
can't relate to normal people
well in that case idfk
yeah in that case
like 80% chance they got s2
but player trying to retain nirv or t100 if they went for SW
random rl player yeah prob not
like depends on who you're talking about
eh
yeah but that only makes the gap smaller
afaik
s0 vs s0 is like 600 SW, 648 aponia
she's just easy to skip if you're not nirv retain
so
sss husk sw is like -2 or -3 too
i mean tbf
<:sleepy:914211439286304778>
and still t100
can go like -15 on sss boss
you don't need cap on NA lmao
i got like 16th with -2
which is prob a plus on NA
but i think she's supposed to be easier
she's -1 from mobius with judah
sss andrius is debatable
also both nihilus afaik
but not top score
prob covers other stuff
yeah
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
i think it was just misunderstanding the lore we had
why did they make her booba like that <:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
it's fucked up because i like aponia character
live in ignorance like me
you don't have to look at it
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
infinite 5.7 please
let me save up for herrscher
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
<:C_HuCryge:922426001181507605>
what makes you think that
kinda doubt it
naaah
genshin ruining honkai character?
who
i don't have any tickets but i'll steal your idea
that's smort
oh yeah
all honkai recommendations are pointless if you have hands
in masters abyss
answer to every boss
PE is like
give her phys support
it's like
memorial arena = MA
abyss = spicy MA
you one shot anything with ult on masters
if heki was running elemental team
SS would still be really nice
not for masters
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
run SR
just
you're gonna cry trying to clear lanterns with SpA
maybe?
um
those scores are like 946 -> 893 -> 573s
yeah i wouldn't really take inspiration from anyone not top 2
dw
nah most of them suck
since it's the genshin whales swarming over
i have theory that there's more whales in masters than exalted right now lmao
look at score not placement
it's day 1 rebooting
like n2 score day 1 is
how high scoring is that
well
i ran the numbers
objectively, yeah
<:sus:866768426478862366>
of the 2
MA is the more fun one
cause i prob wouldn't
which is not to say if i tried i'd be able to
like 3-4 hours at most every cycle i'm there?
no but i also don't try very hard
just sleep
don't even think about trying
abyss vacation
i'd way rather be on nirvana
without aponia
and being in aponia shill weather in nirv
i mean honestly between being in aponia shill weather in RL
she's fucking hardcore dalao
nini fucking retained her first nirv lobby
<:PepeHands:909232418211364957>
i'm only pleb
was going to compete for highest score in RL with you
oh okay
are you nirv nini
isn't that the fish
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
clearly not enough
train up those fingers
play a rhythm game on the side
lmao tf is masters
did you roll for aponia
on rime
also it's PE leader skill
yeah you can try
it doesn't anger me, just makes me feel bad
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
skill issue
for a second i went why the fuck are you playing genshin coop
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
still 2 patches away SSS FR and SSS ely here
<:sus:866768426478862366>
yeah i see stuff when i get pinged
thank you <@482139585355448333> <a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
<:letsgo:959910459643944991>
but that's about what i'm doing in exalted
wtf husk is in masters
i have no clue
i mean i guess
cny long past tho
👓
no i actually am from this century
i see
if you don't do abyss and don't do MA
wtf is there even to do in this game
i still have theresa origins equipped doesn't help with you arguing that you play the game
this is not helping your case
and i didn't know what an abyss flower was
well i didn't know she had abyss flower cause last time i saw that stig was when i was lv20
won't hold in court
keep telling yourself that
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
easy
max efficiency touch grass
put next to computer
buy synthetic grass
<:A_HuO_O:812186632584429578>
yeah i'm surprised it fit all in there
found it
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203> 🛳️
oh shit
<:RozaScout:928714351534309386>
where
well i do my best
i'm glad you notice
i always look cute
do i have to bring the ... out?
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
i never noticed it before lmao
wtf teri has AF
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
wake up on better luck day
time to sleep then
oh today is bad luck?
crime crit
only beg for crit
i don't have space on my name for my name anymore
so don't want to waste luck on training mode lmao
last time i got 733 was pure luck
won't bald on training mode
already saved score
but i won't bald rn
yeah probably
hmm i haven't seen any straight people in a few months
i'm 680 rn, will try more for 733/786 later
but not easy to perform LMAO
easy PE pick
as far as planning goes
i literally explained after
i mean
<:sleepy:914211439286304778>
sleep for next
fucked week
scam boss
rimestar is fucking
but i think SK ult is prob too slow
maybe a similar one
i mean idk
nvm
skill issue
oh shit HoF
try this maybe?
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
oh
saving HoF for kasumi?
watcha trying to use?
project X is probably called like
incredible illusive inapt impact
most nirv refs don't use full bastet
don't you have irene B or newt B
i mean
did you check kartolao refs
or after sss LE sss FT
it's different to go for BR +2% fire damage before sss LE
the best i have to do with legacy now
well it's literally
yeah
for SS +2% fire damage
is BR
the valk i'm currently farming
going for dorm bonus s-rank now
somehow
i'm ahead of taihen in farming tho
fair i guess
lmao that's prob not bad
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
ss FT
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i did ER with raven bow
skill issue
cause asterite <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
but still 5*
mine is sss now
FT diff
ss2 ely <a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
mine's the same
lmao
before i level up her bow
tbh my ely is going to be sss
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
i mean in that case then sure go for torus
goemon to speed up handel crafting is okay too
but i'd say like HoT stamps are ely stamps are pretty nice
sure
i mean if there's literally nothing you want
by the time i get there
though it takes so long to get the mats i'll prob have enough lens
i need to craft 5 <:deadge:933767520085770341>
i have 700 saved up but that's enough for 2
g4 from scratch costs 350
but like
since boomer diff
i doubt taihen needs it
it depends i guess
tyvm
i'm calling myself cute
for when i want to be cute
it's my uwu emote
is the question
but is it enough
god i'm fucked
gotta have good chances to 4/4 griseo and 4/4 5.9 valk
max savings
no
<:PU_Feelsuwuman:585931758495596563>
LMAO
with tka
tf is wrong
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>

at the same time abyss opens
you leave work
oh
chibi dragons
<:TeriSad_lum:457883465870737408>
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
there's no escape
we're here forever
wtf do you mean when honkai shuts down
all they do is fight between each other
fractally bald
don't worry about the specifics
yeah, and all 3 people also go by they/them
<a:tailtheobey:949117362920128542>
but yeah i use they/them
<:TeriTeehee:476615023343697921>
that's not a gender, just pronouns
nobody ever asks me my gender <:PepeHands:909232418211364957>
LMAO
like i see the appeal but i'm not over it
mid
okay ass is kinda
i'll take it
....sure
it was a joke!!!
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
if you're going to slander me at least gender me correctly
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
you can keep the rest in
i'm not into feet
i mean i just like older peeps <:sus:866768426478862366>
otter girl is pretty cute too
oh yeah she's hot
bna designs are actually not my favorite prob
dw
that's unrelated
idt
not really
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
to make the transition faster
i can share furry fanart
literally not what i said
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
nini tsun for furries
that's tsun
trust
nah it always starts like that
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
yeees mooore
the faster you get through it
the more you denial
yeah keep saying that
dw you'll get there
... keilofurry
just undeveloped ones
actually she doesn't have unbased takes
see nini might have some unbased takes but we agree on this
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
LMAO
besides like kiana and ely
yeah fair she'd prob be anyone's dom easily
but once you get her into bed she's really shy lmao
i think she's just really good at giving that aura
hmm i dunno
mei is a sub top
but this is the actual lie
people were saying this is a lie
cube diff
can't use her tho
ely is easy to i hear
she is laughably easy in ER
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
mobius
<a:PetTheCarl:846857638943653898>
:/
aw almost?
i went to wfp to watch

i mean
<:PepeHands:909232418211364957>
you mean rangers
rangers
<:Hehe:585924636504489994>
i wanna try that
when you watch those rime strats and go
you know when you're downbad for MA
just run this
like as far as planning goes
rimestar is pretty easy now
i mean
yeah no planning needed
i thought it was the doom kallen week already
nvm
husk kasumi rimestar
oh
._.
i should prob plan my MA week
oh
jesus
LMAO
yeah
D:
else i'll miss it
also you gotta ping me when you're talking to me

cube issue
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
and lv35 bow

<:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
lmao
kinda cope
that's
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
<:shrug:877047647511384064>
i just use default
that's kinda fucked up
huh it's lower chance than s-rank on dorm
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
i wonder what the chances actually are
oh yeah
where the fuck did they get it from
that means they had one piece already
i'm more interested on the cost 12k to complete the set
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
nini uses she
who?
fun boss
i wish i was nirv this cycle
are you nirv
jialao <:KianaKyaa_lum:525488923833532426>
literally never seen it
i really doubt it'll be useful LMAO
but uh
my armada mate got that from dawei lite card this spending event
is how bad it can go
50 pulls
great value
then i'll just use my dawei card
and columbus
since i have everything but zeno
and more than likely it'll be dogshit for me
but if it's dogshit
i'll roll for it
depending on what they run with it
i mean yeah
same with phyllis
and all the newbies are going to ask why we call it 7tr LMAO
and the name is different
it's going to be funny when they announce it in EN
new hot dk
i'm using my second dawei on 7tr prob
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
i'm low spender now
<:sus:866768426478862366>
i bought one
<:sleepy:914211439286304778>
easy as fuck week = hard to place well
bella there's like 10 different comp for 840, some easy 893s too
there's like 12 different comp for 946 hepha
i mean like
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
840 ss3 ely
prob 893
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
but bella hepha?
no one bothers to do MA
= easy 2%
like doom kallen week
<:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
too easy, means hard to get good placement
is going to be bad
yeah week 2
for kallen
since no double sleepri
i might need to still run the mobius/HoF on doom
though hm
easy 840 with PE
oh doom has new strat
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
for tona
to get my nyx up
yeah i gotta start saving up mats
easy answers, don't need to do HoT bs on kasumi
this week is prob pretty fun
just wish it didn't take that long
i mean ofc
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
i've barely bought ely frags while i've been buying out FR frags since i started exalted
from my FR
somehow my ely is ahead in ranks
welcome back roy
<:stare:749304888822857781>
it's prob best if you don't reconnect
or don't want to
and you're not available for that type of connection
i mean if she's still into you romantically
yeah but i'm baby
<:Baby:933888853578768454>

one tentacle in each key
<a:TentacleRight_luma:585631030501834767>
cock diff
f2p pls understand
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
if you keep misgendering me
yeah you'll also be dreaming forever
<:Sip:506622496259178507>
so this is sleep cycle to me
but i also don't have aponia
did i not make it clear
i suck at the game tet
<:sleepy:914211439286304778>
why bother
without aponia
easily retain RL
i mean
LMAO
for HoT team
is HoT PV aponia
topscore in RL
apparently
am just poor
i would love some sp cost red tho
so no sp refund on neb
and using senpri
yeah
issue with first ult
i needed sp/s
nah for that run
i was doing
for the sss fgo run
i needed it pretty bad
sp/s <a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
my HoS affix
meanwhile pleb me <:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
playing well and stuff
yeah all those dalao
taihen!!!
finished
wtf do you mean
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
see he clears it so fast and is lazy of doing it
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
do the rest of your UM
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i'm baby
also your mic is unmuted <:sus:866768426478862366>

i got an eden card too
okay?
for rc
i only did

my sp valks
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
sp cost red is pretty rare yeah
oh nvm
i mean it's better i guess lmao
sp cost red rare
you prob have better increase somewhere else
idt it's worth the mats
you can roll for sp cost red on second line but
oh wow that's kinda insane
yeah that's pretty nice
or use different avo M
so either get rid of that affix
since it still makes her unable to proc margrave with weapon skill
on AE
still bad to use that avo M
i mean
oh
on margrave T
sp cost red
is that
wait

<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
wafers is the affix thing
that's the highest value from there
wafers prob
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>

i just remembered the refs from past weeks
i mean technically i didn't use any refs either for wolf and dxy
yeah looks good!
hmmm i see
<:BronyaKing:646539680979877888>
what are you playing tho
<a:peepoEatpizza:755848007433453688>
i'm eating rn
<a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
*stares at hepha*
well, most of them
they're still hard
with more investment
0s kills don't get easier
no
well
that's the main issue
i also suck
i mean
for the 0s
definitely didn't spend 5+ hours here
yeah... easy....
sounds fun
aim the arrows on each hand to break
i can imagine you can prob like
yeah makes sense
i see
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
yeah? did you attack with her?
give her pulse katana so she can proc her stigs
always HoT huh
no way to know without more info
like if you're different damage then it's some buff you're missing
it's buff diff
i mean
yeah this week is really rough
from ref
completely different rot
you can try but you'd need
same thing FT and BB are different valk with pri
with pri
legit different valk
FR is just
but that's pri arms
also i didn't find much sorry
i mean you can try
no gun pri?
that's enough
you can just say bayonetta
so it was just like letters to us
cause they didn't bother translating it at all to portuguese
the funniest one is xlr8
can you imagine being a valk designer, you pour your heart and soul into making a cute furry boy and they release fucking ben 10 lookin ass
the fuck is up with these leaks
are these guys going to visit the genshin banner in a zoo
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
i will mourn the loss of fluffy tail for generations to come
i dunno tho maybe it's all just furry factor <:caught:1175079388874805351>
i do think his face had more personality before, lighter hair combo with same color eyebrow is cute, the haircut was more interesting
40% at least
like
yeah it looks so sad
like not only because i'm a furry
nah to me there's definitely enough on the old design that has personality
he looks like random wh<:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512> mc from another game
this shit is genshin generification rays
holy fucking shit
LMFAOOOOOOOOO
or else player would get confused
we need 3 year of preparation for ganyu to wear black instead of white
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
how does it even look like that, did they print the png out before taking a pic?
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
this look like early 2000 pokemon leak
jesus fucking christ
if all you know from undead unluck is undead and unluck
i mean it sounds like you got it covered
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
hakcer when he finds out that our undead talk is from undead unluck
probably not undead
i'd be down for unfade i think
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
like sun was just being a bro
i still don't get unfade <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
was that you just <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
i cannot parse that sentence
<a:despairgamba:1114542929625755718>
bet
1%?
cause like i think i'm fine actually
would you want to be a negator
okay but if all the negator bullshit was real
<:jphMinus2:1062420904384135238>
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
<:lewd:959737567119556618>
i don't think he knows what sex is
i'm stronger than that
there you go, you won't pavlov me into liking coralie just by calling her a doggirl
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
<a:NoSpray:765639278147010570>
bad cherry
no dogs
no
do not call coralie doggirl
like 2 week in beta
do we even have official gameplay clip yet?
yeah it certainly reduce the amount of content that cc make a lot
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
we might be able to decipher p2
if we pool our knowledge together
okay
i legit don't know anyone name beside coralie
h3 50/50/50? <a:TheVoices:1143681011272659015>
are you prepared for that <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
that's going to be 4th class
or were they memeing
do you think genshin will ever get the switch port
ps4
that's genshin exclusive
we don't have 3rd class player
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
it only matter for second class player
they look fine though
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
alright
for the gameplay to be press atk until flashing button then press flashing button
5 lines of tutorial
fucking
????
me when i'm going to leak but i have myopia
me too
she worships yaoi?
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
i'd start looking for where my datamining software fucked up
if i datamined diluc skin vfx early
idk what i expected tbh
<a:donoo:1076193550070464573>
<a:DonoWall:825683259610103819>
fire bird? that's clive only
everyone knows phoenix was originally created for clive final fantasy 16
wait i got it wrong it should be the opposite right
fire bird? that's hua only
everyone knows phoenix was originally created for fuhua honkai impact
i should throw a retirement party
cool
i pull cn and leave
week 1 of 6.2
what
<:life:1001518241610485781>
has it really been a year already
i didn't even make an abbreviation for her
if it makes them feel better i was t10 player and i keep forgetting sirin is a valk
i mean not casual player, just more casual than tryhard
if i still cared
it's an awful awful change, i would be like 20x more pissed
and still remoe a lot of info even from the tryhard player
it still clouds info from more casual player
even if most tryhard player can still get core information necessary from leaks
no rimestar gameplay yet
shitter quality too
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
well yeah but it was leaked
even if she's not playable day1 we can still read her skills
and usually we have at least valk kit on beta open
i mean we do fully know now, it's been 5 days since beta open
i'm kinda pissed about that and i don't even care about the game anymore
oh okay then yeah they're just releasing beta info a week later now
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
would beta have already started at this point
and no official gameplay
has it really been 5 days
on another note though
<:ICANT:995593696030507099>
ff16 isn't even a good game why would they even copy it
the first one is giga stupid
the second one i kinda see it
your discord is fucked up
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
they're not muted and i don't have that popup
uhhh
but i never seen new unreads
i have new mentions
??
tfs that
what do you mean normal new message popup
why?
i'm not often in situations where that would come up
not too often
i mean it's kinda close honestly
<:wholetcook:1151659795531710534>
it is to me
i swear i'm innocent
i also stopped being attracted to the 12 yo when she started acting like a 12 yo
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
your honor i was even hype when we got the fake leaks of adult rozalili
please don't
it's okay i was already attracted to her before i knew
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
now that's going to make my huohuo attraction look sus
and i'll keep believing that she is
and she looks normal to me
her splash art and the patch art
i mean all i've seen is like
i'll continue living without that information
i don't believe you
nah
what????
she looks like a normal girl to me
i didn't even know she was short
h<a:uooh:964118021574623243>h<a:uooh:964118021574623243>?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
thank you tet love you
sure
can i make huohuo HoH
can i pick
okay
they're not even that bad
meanie
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
can i make the next one?
wait gsr has abbreviations?
gresham <a:GIGACHAD:999060597247320095> No.
taihen how does shit like that keep happening to you
let's go
bi-yearly genshin skin and it's just a chroma
arknights is supposed to be good too i think
text based skin leak
this will be gi3 in a few patches
it's hot as fuck
it's summer for me
booba
<:jphPlus2:1062420906720366632>
good one cherry
it's okay you won't be the weirdest pedo around
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
did you really
good valk honestly
SA had some sick anicancels
gd is like 20x easier SA
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
do we wanna place bets on how long it'll take until we get official crumbs of gameplay or kit?
also, has it been 2 days yet from the point where we'd get official info if there was no nda?
you don't get it, it would be disastrous if the player didn't know what to press next
it's also i have no bilibili account quality too <:pojjies:1089590694160642098>
it even has bilibili ost
oh now we're talking
i trust you
we should have more tummies
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
meanwhile i go eh alright
and they go there's something wrong i must fix
like those guy see a design that doesn't get their dick hard
entitlement?
i mean i guess to a degree it's just
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
about male valk design
that people care like 20x less
it is weird though i agree
whatever happens to people in 4chan
idk
mental damage
there probably is a market though if you're interested
the joke is just that you're making changes in the design to a sexualised part of her body, i don't really meant any other similarity
but it's fur i like <:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
and it's like fine if you're into that
you know?
i can't say that i've ever felt like an extremely hairy chest but surely it must feel like a balding head
i need the fluffy
it's not fluffy
i mean the issue with hairy is that human body hair just looks like hair
yes
i appreciate the thought process though
no thank you
never
like ok what's the point then
a thing that annoys me a little is when people draw furry but it looks like just tinted skin
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i mean yeah i also go ew when they have skin instead of fur but like i'm self aware about it
i don't think they care
they see a design that look too much like real people and go ew
it's unironically bitchless behaviour
like this shit
...unless?
i mean i'm just joking you obviously are not a 4chan incel
the hair dye thing is probably something something feminism pink hair
this is like the incel thing where they make a valk in a game look more sexy to them in specific
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
are you in the untumblrized valk market now
oooh ok
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
wait in real money? not xtal?
oh shit i'm hype
really?
yeah?
s3 is +15 atk
yeah s2 minimum sounds right for me too, for discount banner
do we have a df?
what that pussy exhaling?
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
like we could have vr2 but instead of valkyrie ranger it could be like vastly retarded
i'm grabbing old abbr and putting 2 in front, the idea is to change the words too, like for part 2 yk
okay i'm bored i'll see if i can come up with something more fun than px2
ffh is nice though <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i was about to be a pissy baby about it
thanks for the correction
2s hrt s0 px2 is like unhinged isn't it
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
i fast
thats a little boring
do people only eat other people out in the us during thanksgivings?
true <:caught:1175079388874805351>
get with the program, tet
dps valk is press all the shiny button
support valk is qte ult
oh you're thinking of support valk
who would've thought that a hua powercreeps DA and the skill level is going to stay the same
<a:NAHHH:1120795949099384963>
surely they won't forget about her as soon as part 2 start
they just need to shill her forever
maybe they'll add like 5 bio fire boss <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
actually she look more niche than v2v
she's 2023 v2v
i guess she's probably going to be discount though?
like it doesn't matter how broken she is
i don't think an s0 px2 will ever beat 2s+ sirin
He's going to HATE her
these are a lot of numbers and a lot of high numbers on stig though <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
idk what the standards is for valk in current gen
i think i played like 6 matches at this point and i find 1 person with non-jp or cn name
only overseas peeps play so you probably can get some sick names there for free
i'm keilo there
if you download mahjong soul, add me
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
no ignite, nothing
no real gimmick to anything besides max hp <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
she has some max hp shit again which i think at this point is normal
i can't decipher the gimmick of the weapon but like the rest looks kinda boring
<:wholetcook:1151659795531710534>
yugioh ass card effect right there

but with [Feather Burning Seal] instead of bing chillin
reads to me like the bing chillin copypasta
like the rest of the weapon active
this translation kinda sucks, no flame though
it's just it's over but also it's not over
that one has no restriction
so i kinda get it
i mean that one is SI-specific
the rest of the effect is unreadable
well the effect lasts 5 second but it also lasts another 10 seconds after it's over
why?
?????
20% fire damage taken on M + 25% tdm (i assume) taken on 3p
the stig have big number tho, idk what the normal is but 2 taken% on stig is kinda nut isn't it
not even trying, who cares
lmfao this 3 piece <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
no
when do you think we'll get our first uncle?
that's a lot of text
nice
it's a sandwich with i don't care bread and love filling
<:life:1001518241610485781>
probably
yeah
honestly
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i swear that fucking clock sp pack never fucking drops right
i do dislike rng tho and some strat were turbo cbt on sp pack spawn
it's not that i like any of them specifically, the fact that they exist at all is what is fun to me
i mean as a game mechanic it's quite stupid, but for me MA is about the really niche interactions
<:life:1001518241610485781>
it was what made MA perfect
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
it's pretty but i wanna see real gameplay next <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
<:joever:1122752199752163419>
<:joever:1122752199752163419>
i see flashing buttons
oh that's not what i meant, i dunno if i could fuck at all
i probably couldn't fuck nasty either
aw that's nice, i like that
so you think i couldn't fuck nasty just because i'm wholesome?
thats not good
heki always turns down all my advances, it's kinda funny
<:lewd:959737567119556618>
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
what you doing with those hands?
fucking goooooooo
lets
scales my beloved....
my abbreviations are understandable even
i'm kind if you think about it
like bk is bronya kiana but it's bk, the next herrscher is another fast food, mcd
he got a fast food theme for herrschers for a bit
mei cuckerino donger
alternative ones for hot are thunder hoe and mcd
yeah hot is big mei, danzai is small mei
but it's not very hard
i mean i do
it's danzai
small mei is a iriya abbr
i tried
it's a lot of work to cap a sinful boss and you don't even get that much attention for it
don't do it nini, it's not worth the effort
yeah all her skins slap hard, just rough that they open with the best one
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
but neon is too good
i do really love summer
like a junkie
so now they're just trying to get that high again <:life:1001518241610485781>
no surpassing it
was the optimally best one
first every skin they gave phy
it's nice but unfortunate
rimestar can GET it
is something i'd fuck
now THAT
we make the same jokes but i make them thoroughly out of irony, meanwhile tet is purely honest
me and tet are like horseshoe theory of hornyness
you know like horseshoe theory?
watch me
back
i can make him come
you think she got a knot?
true
i just like to joke that tet got awful takes cause that's funny to me
i mean yeah i'm partially just kidding, you got mostly good takes
<:life:1001518241610485781>
it only happens once every century
it's like planet aligning
in valk design
me tet and cherry are somehow aligned
in like 30 patches
for the first time
cool
oh shit she got a navel
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
my bad
oh i see
sus?
oh
i think i don't get normie sexuality
are people horny over this design?
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
ok you get a pass cause you're on phone
what's a penacony <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
it's ae and br, it's er gameplay <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
what the fuck are you on
we're different
i'm not
and i thought you were referring to me
also i forgot deer in headlight is a saying
i think that's how all of them look like on valk icon
the valk icon looks like her
she looks fine in other art tho
they cutified her
yeah i noticed that as well, she doesn't look that much like fu hua in there <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the last flamechaser to get her fc battlesuit
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
that's sick actually, i vibe w that
oh shit her battlesuit name is vicissitude?
we already got perfection, it's honestly kinda unfair to expect them to surpass it if you think about it
even if they fuck it up they can't take AE from me
i'm clearly disappointed on it but like i think i don't mind it that much
yeah maybe
i'll just have to hc it
if they're too much of pussies to not give it to us
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
yeah that's what i'm saying man
the outfit tho yea
i'm not fond of it now but i can easily see it growing on me
tbh i kinda like the hair gimmick
cowards i say
and now she got like lil gloves? cowards
the teaser really looks like scales climbing up her arm and neck
honestly tho from what it look like from the teaser it just feels like that's been retconned
i didn't think of the fistability nerf
it does really look like just clothes
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
you think she got claws down there?
i'm down i think
it looks like that's  just how her garuda transformation is like
i don't think it's a shoe tet
oh shit
beach skin by default
i don't mind it it's just a lil weird <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
yeah maybe
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i think
you're thinking of lk2
maybe so it's different from her other battlesuits?
i just dunno why she's so naked all of a sudden <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
she does look pretty though
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
why is she so naked
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
i think i already have 3 sets
sick
trust
if you think about partypls hard enough it'll happen
it's okay just believe in yourself
hey nini can you do this
the only person who gets a pass is carv, he'll be like sinadya was actually always a pivotal character in the story, they mention her in chapter 3-25 constantly and i'll be like <a:Mhmm:1013856139156389989> you're so right
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
of course they'll have bad opinions
i'm racist against new players
so true part 2 SUCKS and it's going to KILL genshin impact 3rd AND mihoyo AND dawei himself personally
she **doesn't even have to farm sp at all** if you finish the fight in one ult
mobius
that just sounds like she can't <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
she can maintain 100% uptime if the fight is short enough is really funny to me
<:BatChest:891596027767975986>
marvelhua
the genshin crossing one is not hard to imagine
genshin valo
i wonder how they're going to genshinfy an fps

everything's genshin?
<:life:1001518241610485781>
easy mistake
must be confusing starting the genshins now, since there's gzz and ggz
:caitlyn:
think 8bit, ruby
oh like the other genshin you mean, there's surely at least some abyss
wait what, none?
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
is this.... your first time?
i mean i guess obviously there is
there's a quest about that?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it's so <:joever:1122752199752163419>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i even hear some stig name and think of the person first
i didn't think i would ever move on tbh but i have noticed i have started to <:life:1001518241610485781>
that's some spy kids shit
:sadging:
superhero shit just sound so inherently niche, that it got that big in the first place is kinda insane
isn't it crazy that it even happen
that's not good
i misunderstood that one <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh
holy shit
like people talk about it way less but idk how much it revenue with normie
is marvel still big <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
i don't get the point of just making the same game like 5 times
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
that's true
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
like outside of story
self insert at least isn't playable yet
you know, that might just be the thing that makes me retire
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
you think we'll get more battlesuit of the new trio
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>

wait what do you mean antagonist
i know
like if you don't immediately shut down furry topic with me i'll vomit out all my fetish before i realise that that's not normal
i'm very good at not oversharing as long as the subject is not furry stuff
you can share more, even
i don't think i've ever felt like you overshared something with me tho, tet
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
tet when she says i did something autistic on the autistic server and every autist goes that's fine everyone does that
where can i get the evil estrogen
hell yeah!
like what the fuck man i'm trying here
and literally everyone i meet goes you were very scary when i first met you
i'm somehow the opposite, i wanna be approachable and friendly AND i don't shut the fuck up
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
we can't have 2 durandals
skirk is durandal
not the durandal claims
nevermind you burnt it
you unironically have something cooking
we send 50 message for her and she show up every 5 minute to answer 1 (one) singular thing
i like how we're talking about heki and she answer it like it's an oujia
have fun
i'm convinced
I HATE RACISTS, person who has normal opinions
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
proof?
could be a 2 for 1 deal
cause like i'm already working on it for heki
do you also have racist prereq
heki if you date me i can do my best and become racist too
oh ok
she hates men and is scared of women
she's like the horniest girl with the most niche attraction ever
what the fuck is heki sexuality
and it's only partially because she makes it furry
i only like hannibal when it's cherry talking about it
HATES hannibal
hates hannibal
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
be honest
heki do you hate me
<:nerdge:980201016853164144>
learn color theory
umm
you make do
green
you know what miku and boobs have in common?
if heki was freud she'd be writing whole essays about how boobs are inherently evil and scary, a duality of motherhood and terror <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
:ltg:
do it now
venmo that shit
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i'm trying to help heki and cheery just come in and go you need a shower
i don't know what i did to deserve that
<:caught:1175079388874805351> my bad
my boobs get bigger when i put them in water for a few waters
oh okay
but they'll get bigger the more you touch them
my boobs are flat as fuck
okay fine
i am very approachable
are you less scared of boobs now
my boobs are huge
heki what if i told you
i read kafka and went bug guy?
my brain really is healing

i guess at the start too
don't they fuck in the end?
....
have you seen
i thought you had like a folder of peoples pfp
oh ok
i top out at 130wpm i think
thanks
did you find that so fast
how
i'm taking it to heart and i'm going to find who i really am
my other self also said i shouldn't try to be someone i'm not
i actually really need it
please
can you really
i'll turn back, i was trying to do that to force tet into becoming readable
okay gimme a sec i need to find my old pfp
lmao google translate misgendered me in that one
what do i do now
wait fuck i lost my old pfp
wait i can forge shit
ma armastan tet
oh thank fuck i can read tet again
i'm really really bad at impressions
hannibal?
uh
forgot i'm underage for asec there
my bad
hey tet
i can see that though
cool you fixed it
cause their color too dark
i have to do it for alice and neko sometimes
i mean i can still select your text to read it
i'm just not gonna bother
i swear to fucking god
i am going to murder you
tet
i do care about you as a person but yes if you add furry words to your messages it'll bait me into reading them more often
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
yeah i'm kinda impress
nice
that was pretty good though
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
do your best impression of me
wait
i'm going back to old keilo
you know what
kys
like i'll glance at discord, read some red message and go when the fuck did i type that
but it is going to fuck with me a lot
i'm not really being serious
i'm being serious i am this <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> close
i am going to end it all
to genuinely fuck with me
this is going
what the fuck
cherry is just me now
who the fuck changed cherrys color
i mean no but if you do i'll read even the ones i can't-
the other day you were talking genshin artifact meta and i just went <a:Mhmm:1013856139156389989>
so my eye just glaze over
anyway i don't actually think that but like a good 80% of your convo without me are about stuff that i genuinely cannot comprehend
the amount of time i'm spending thinking about it
it's actually a little disgusting
after i read wizdom my heart is yearning so much for more furry romance
okay for some reason my eye immediately read bitch yapping and i got a lot more interested in this message
do you want me to say something nice about you to balance it out
b-baka
like not that i dislike you or anything
and then i read it and it's way too horny and i realise it's just you
you know how many times i scroll past chat and see rare gresham message and i go holy shit i gotta read that
just to fuck with me in specific?
why did you even pick the exact same color as gresham anyways
yeah
i see cata say some stupid shit and i gowhat the actual fuck before i realise it's epi
i see the light blue and i don't know what to prepare myself to
do you know how bad it is that cata and epi look the same
every time someone change their name color it's actually ableist violence against me
i would make fun of alice but i realise i remember people here by the color of their name
is it really
i mean sure
surely that doesn't count as sex
okay <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
uh
how is either of these people on their back
the only lotus i know is the one from 999
i'm finding it hard to picture that
girls who get dizzy when they get up too fast rise up?
you're horny over iron deficiency?
i'll never think that i'm annoying you ever again
that's actually really comforting to me
you know what tet
chill out
ain't no way you wrote that

what was hekisaur name before she became a dinosaur
wait
heki i am not a misogynist, you're missing the context saur
i admire the self awareness
so i only get to hate half of cherry?
cherry is bigender?
can't keep up with heki though
i'm very competitive
yeah
that's kinda nuts
heki is the most misogynist woman here, and i'm here too
??????
i mean then ye idk
oh ok
jesus fucking chirst
i don't actually know anything about baizhu
isn't baizhu like kinda mad scientist for that shit
surely he does
to be honest
i don't know
i could fix him though
zhongli forgot how to get hard
sure?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
of all genshin valk
who do you think would have the biggest ball
cause my pc is in the living room
send it spoiler tagged please
but like
sure
was the first thing that made me not want to do that
actually the fact that she's voiced by lilypichu
nevermind
whos the tanuki valk again
doesn't tanuki have like huuuge balls
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
but for the balls
the same boob jiggle physics
did it have like
how
what
obviously not
so based
hey tet i found the target audience for those mods
ooooh i see
tet only got signora as a boss and she never complained even once
you should be more like her
she lost signora and she's not even sad about it
yeah look at tet
maybe when they make a porn spinoff
not my fault, go take it up with mihoyo
i'm just saying man
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
heki even if he was playable
have you seen boo around
chill out
her boobs are not even that big heki
they all do
i mean i guess platform shoes are different
that does look like it still has heels though
especially when everything that shows up has her shoes off <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
kinda hard to see
that's
i'm gonna look up huohuo feet
we need a valk with heelies
so ye does gsr does the same thing then? every valk has high heels for fun?
oh ok
idr the name <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
no like the shoe that make you go tippy toe
that doesn't sound right
high heel?
like big shoe
aw man i don't remember the name
with giving all female valk fucking
wait is gsr the same
oh ok
the mech looks nice
aw she's boring though
the person inside the mech is a person, and the mech itself is another person?
oh wait so like
is that the girl with the pig
i don't know who firefly is btw
THAT big
maybe her boobs are just
they gave him a pair of badonkas?
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
like bronya isn't a bronya expy, it's just bronya

he'd enver
he's so polite
who asked

a who ask emote would be really cute
it wasn't really a make or break thing tho, just an annoyance
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i'm just giving updates in the manga i'm reading
that work better imo
but there were some scenes a little later on
like, not retroactively
oh btw they kinda fixed the mom issue for me in the witch hat atelier
an offense is different than being offended by it though
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
is sexual harassment count as offending?
that is weird
trueeeee
offend me next cherry
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
south park taking that side is just them joining kinda late on a culture war that's already kinda past
the ones pointing that out were the ones offended that it was happening
like, pointing out that diversity was being done for the sake of diversity didn't really offend anyone
idk if many people were ever offended by that
feel like people are kinda over it
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
isn't it a little late?
i mean it's south park
huh
oh is it official?
race talk like that don't really affect me

lmao
police calling so we received your threats, and usually we'd arrest you but we've decided against it in the ground it was really funny
seele is wearing earbuds she can't hear you
imagine beating honkai
lmfao

pooh fit

but whore's is pretty nice
we'll keep coping
one day maybe nyx will get a good skin

<a:catPls:1113921108094242898>
heki do this irl
<a:HUH:1129107980634312724>
oh my bad i thought it was the kid
<a:HUH:1129107980634312724>
vore
oh shit
are you prepare
<@309634550273933314> holy shit baizhu is releasing soon
though i don't know why i feel that way <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
for some reason that feels like encroaching on nahida appeal
weird
hmmm
i don't get furina
what's her personality
<:nerdge:980201016853164144>
ehem occams razor
the message i sent has so little text and yours has so much text so
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
in a way, gacha game are the truest to it's roots
it's kinda eye opening, all the early arcade machine maker started as gambling machines
like, how games started as a thing
like i just watched yesterday one of the most thorough story of game development and it had 21k views
it's insane
like there's SO much high quality content with like 10k views
ever since youtube start recommending lower view video and channel
have you been noticing tho
there's some bigger ones
wait, nah
2m subs
i think the highest subscriber youtuber i follow has like
i'm happy markiplier is so famous
markiplier is a good one though
moreso, fuck fragile, 2022
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but like he's still one of the highest subscribed right?
or is having
like he had his thing with the altright
i mean for sure pewdiepie
pewdiepie still right
what even are normie youtuber nowadays
i guess, still is
to me it was a comemmoration of a culture i barely understand
huh ok
so at most we got like 1 or 2 cameo and i went <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> that's 1 or 2 cameo!
back when i was into normie youtuber i was still watching brazillian ones
tbh i don't think i ever cared
idk if that's still the case
back when i installed, apparently they just hid it visually, so you could still just enable it back on, but it was a matter of time until they actually fully remove it
that one i just installed the plugin thing
for me to realise there's no more youtube rewinds
jesus christ did it really take me 5 years AND you telling me
oh shit
aw man :/
okay guess you didn't like that and never release another skin
people complained about the skin and mihoyo went
wouldn't it be funny if like
march is prob my fav design still from gsr
base skin slap tho
that's accurate to honkai tbh
are the skins fire?
like that that skin is supposedly releasing i mean
1.4?
what version is gsr?
how long did genshin take
wait gsr is getting a skin already
credits roll, everyone claps
damn i guess that really was a path to acheron
and at the end seele goes
us with seele keeps running around
questline takes a ton of time for our group to find her
terf
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
more concept art leaks
part 7 will be a 12 minute animation
:)
so you can share one with a friend
like trio earbuds
my bet is
they can just describe multiple different kits and as long as some of them are kinda right you're trustworthy now
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
they figured out a way to guess infinitely
no
i'll move over there
i literally couldn't get past the second question cause it gave me severe psychic damage
it will give you great harm
i have a great uquiz for you
tet
vriska and terezi are both prospit
oh ok
did you do the quiz to find out if you're prospit or derse btw?
she only did that as revenge, cause terezi sent her a bomb which blew off an eye and an arm from vriska
oh yeah i forgot about that
vriska mind control terezi to go outside and look at the sun to blind her
trolls are nocturnal, they can't go out at day much
this is a funny screenshot
but she wasn't blind by the time she died
i mean, she's dead
i think terezi is not blind anymore
it also worked on homestuck
she doesn't do silly things like fly for fun
she's mature now
wouldn't you?
i mean yea
think so
by hrt she already has her legs back
i mean i'm pretty sure
i can't ping carv in here
<@309634550273933314> what's bronya character arc?
yeah i have no clue tbh
that one was sin mal fault i think
and she went holy shit cool rock
from what i know she found a cool rock
i skipped that story
idk about bronya tho
she destroys her own hope for the betterment of kiana
for mei, her godhood is about giving up herself to save kiana, so she'd prob be a prince of hope
so HoF would probably be kiana's godhood, and at that part of the story she's doing her best to be what everyone needs her to be, so blood makes sense for me
if honkai is the session, attaining godhood would probably be the part where they become herrschers
so it's like the big character development they have to go through
it's meant to signify what the person must become during the session so the session can be successful
classpects are not meant to signify what the person is
in homestuck lore
okay so like
so it makes sense
karkat is turbo gay too
maybe a knight of blood like karkat
blood is the aspect of bonds
she would probably be something of blood
bubble universes are literally just dream bubbles
i've never seen someone say that to a thing that was untrue
like some people get annoyed at people saying this was a plot point in homestuck but to this day
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and then using her thief powers to force her roll to be an 8 by stealing the enemies luck
a lot of her attacks revolve around her rolling a d8
she literally steals luck from others
she focus on the luck part
and light as an aspect, is luck and knowledge
she's the thief of light
it's reinforced quite often too
vriska is very obsessed with hers, and that's a thing her ancestor did too
so in reality it's just a troll living their life that you can choose to admire or w/e
which are the person who contributed to their genes, but they're raised by animals
okay so the real answer is that all trolls have ancestor, which is the closest they have to parents
i really like feferi so she gets a pass
makes it look like her horns
that one is because writing it like that
w)-(at t)-(e fuck
well she has 8 eyes for one
feferi writes all H as )-(
some of them are really hard to read tho
so like she'd write i'm going to b8 some maincorders ::::)
vriska is obsessed with 8
and each different character has a writing quirk
they talk through like a time travel discord
most of homestuck story, the characters don't actually meet
typing quirk
we came first
respect your elders
and like ofc it's tumblr and i should expect it but it still gave me whiplash
i caught someone unironically typing like vriska on tumblr in 2023
now that you have your classpect, you should figure out your quirk
oh if you wanna keep going down that rabbithole cherry
direct murder is kinda rare tho
was to take control of his mind and force him to jump off a cliff
and vriska way to cope with having a crush on someone like that
but tavros is a pathetic, utterly loser fail cringe boy
gay is a sin too right
very bad planning tbh
god is a lil ass pussy if someone i can do can interrupt his plans
maybe god just wants me to kill myself
that's cope
oh cause you're also killing someone who killed a murderer
so it balance it out
but it also counts as killing a murderer
if you did kill yourself tho then yea it counts as killing someone
oh if you failed then yea
not almost
like vriska had a crush on tavros
vriska is 13
combine sin mal and sirin and you get like 20% of a vriska
sin mal is like babies first vriska
and vriska caused both of those
tavros is wheelchair bound and terezi is blind
like we have a few disabled trolls
yeah you got it
most problems
she caused
what's the deal with vriska most morally weighted question one can make
LMFAO
don't do what he did
the only way he knows what not to do is when he randomly find a dead body of himself
the entire session he's fixing timeline fuck up
like, dave is the knight of time
my guys are especially fucked up
homestuck is a story about a bunch of kid who watch their world be destroyed and immediately are tasked to create a new one
i mean
they're all kinda fucked up
so a knight of hope would probably serve on a session that's utterly devoid of hope, and would spend the entire time fixing that
knights serve through their aspect, usually trying to fulfil a deep necessity of the session
oh that's sad
it's definitely a support class
a maid of hope would one who creates hope or creates through hope for the betterment of others
yeah see
like aradia, maid of time, often feels like she's literally made of time
the name is a pun that is used often in the narrative
maids are sick tho
maid prob fits you better
one who destroys through hope or destroys hope
but yeah idk if you'd be a prince, cherry
they could be even more polar cause they're both active class
polar opposites lmao
those are
what class are you
oh i only saw you were hope
homestuck ass part structure
written by hakcer chatgpt
if you loved me you'd say it in front of your friends
2 about to be W H <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
to compete with xiangling and hu tao
just completely unfair
see i even forgot thoma exist
literally sit on your desk 9-5 knowing you'll never make anything better than hu tao or xiangling
imagine having the job to design a pyro polearm
lmao
really removing literally every way you can fuck up <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
she can't qte with it
free ayaka ar42
i'm disappointed on it
furry for cowards
it's like keqing
no
he just keeps doing it tho
like if i @/everyone and got the response he gets i'd cry and never do it again
i kinda respect jayson tho
<:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
is this worth a pin
and sussy leak that eli does not abide for says HoS is SI2
so luna is lightning JK
<a:Smadging:1035205356013494364> i'm not a nerd
we're releasing griseo 2
mihoyo taking the feedback from cunny enjoyers wrongly
v2 immediately valk only valk only valk only
current mihoyo fucking pisses and cries and screams and shits themselves when anyone uses 1 interesting stig on a valk
i agree tho aint no way they releasing 2 set for 1 valk
i mean isn't the leak claiming that she's not really
wait wdym two
like gather shieldbreak bleed support
the weird surprising leaks are false
like i feel like the stuff that surprises us isn't really leaked early, is it?
is that really true?
and then die
you could call someone and just hang out instead
who would you call from underarc
and the puppet goes i'll let you go as long as the person you call from underarc agrees with letting you go
if you woke up in a saw situation
you know that right
eli has never been wrong about anything and i would trust you with my life
sounds good
she's i saw it in my dreams real?
is psy lightning teri like, a leak still right? is it a trustworthy one?
i just go along with literally any leak that shows up here for fun
okay sorry
if you pull after whore announcement then kinda stupid but anytime before that
and it benefit you on every phys boss
HoS rank up kinda cracked
i mean
and it took until i made fun of her for her to look it up
i told her to her face that her definition of niche was wrong
i'm still laughing at my interaction with tet
you gotta remember we have a lot of people here who play story mode
luna is a genshin player
chill
that's fucking weird as hell
they're doubling down on HoS as bleed support?
what?
is canonically the least gay
himeko i think
repeat after me luna is replacing hot hn and hrt, and hos dk is going to hot dpe whore
just make shit up
i'll do it if i can take artistic liberties with the convo
the meta talk isn't that funny
sorry i got bored of doing it
taihen is april may?
can we kin assign some people ac characters for the courtroom thing
(robert downey jr) she loves this pickle
ok
i mean maya
i think cherry said maia
do you wanna pick who you wanna be in ace attorney courtroom
2????????
for a dictionary
downloaded
you have an app?
or some shit
you gonna say you used bing
what
oh god i wanna do that
and then went googling
that's so funny, you saw my message and went literally unironically yeah
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
live your best life
who cares
yeah just keep making shit up fenri
tet after sirin release: now we need a valk with tornados to take SpA niche
you should capitalise every message
good reading comprehension
yeah that was the implication from what i said
just thought to let you know
your definition of niche is different from what normal people use
me when goat
why do we have to replace valks, why put women against women
thoughts ?
and then we run dps hrt teri gd
genshin teams
what do y'all think
i'm not gonna read all of the past messages
just play better honestly
\* not to heki and epi
one braincell we share around*
thoughts on joel?
i thought it was cherry saying her name but funny
wait is chorry a real emote
it looks like shiphtur
i never paid attention
wait is he naked?
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
cunny?
that's a catastp emote
<:Shrugeg:889018134885990440>
exactly
yours is 5'11 and mine is 6'0
mine is so taller
it's just like get fucked and figure out
isn't there not even anything in game saying that JK and AE breach state don't stack?
but like there's literally no set rule
i mean probably not is what i wanna say, replacing hrt sounds better to me too
who the fuck knows
completely arbritary on their end
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
are you a boy or a girl?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
she's replacing GD probably no?
well i mean not really
but yeah lightning sushang sounds right <:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
those 2 have the same name and you expect me to be able to differentiate
i'm fucking dyslexic dumbfucks
that's why you need to say jk and hn instead
LMFAO
i'm fucking stupid
oh
why would you be upset about that
like as in she'll be a cheap good lightning sp dps?
wtf are you talking about
what does lightning sushang even mean
the bleed would be important for some weird strats
maybe if we still had 2s MA
she's just lightning support with a gimmick
i mean yeah i don't think the bleed is going to matter much
lightning bleed <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
wtf they doing with her?
real?
eh?
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
but people keep spending money
you'd think they'd realise after 3 years of genshin and the only good one is hu tao
hah! idiot!
what is a bio phys fallen rosemary
please
stop using fr when talking about honkai
it was like mobius double reacharound of EN cope -> bilibili leak -> retranslated back to EN
wasn't that confirmed false
:korok_seed:
yahaha!
aha
chainsaw very carefully along this line
LMFAO
discord must be held by duct tape
kinda unhinged way to code that
is that it just hides every image starting with SPOILER_
so funny that the way discord works
yeah
i learned that recently
did you know that chainsaw were made as a medical device?
kinda sick ngl
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
it's what they did to whore
just make her a bleed support aswell
?
<:CSMpochitaBlush:649711715625336832>
i would guess normal tbh
or bleed?
normal phys dps
<a:NOTED:805343536412229642>
someone tldr me
what is she then
i vibe w it
she's kinda hot
huh
they're giving out signoras remains for 3rd anniv?
is that a coffin
who cares
just hc it
you don't have to imagine
yeah that's extremely [opposite of strict]
?
please stop and apologise
is the punishment
<@309634550273933314> summarise the above text please
<a:DinkDonk:1086488191546171462>
any readers?
tldr?
uh
why do we drown
so
me when the new warrior cat book releases
<a:aworryFlashbang:897712369843716126>
and it took until tet told me for me to notice <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but halfway through it, they just didn't bother anymore
which was just a xiangling one but with trio replacing xiangling
like the one copypasta that got shared
but it's so much text
i was going to read it to prove it's fake
source?
raven?
Sirin and funny 🌞 Sunny 🌞
that's fucking lmae
what
right ?
pierrot playable is neuvillette
like how scaramouche playable is wanderer
aren't they the same guy?
yeah
i thought he was the fatui guy without the mask
a new guy?
is neuvillette like
wait
when they cum
is that the animal crossing one?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
is that gsr or honkai?
fu hua ....
aina ain't that important
but they aren't important
i mean there are multiple
cmon
i want at least an event
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
what about promare though
but like
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
including the 4.5 and 4.9 one
right?
they're still universes in the tree
cause like they're not non-canon
like anything alt universe i just call captainverse <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
but it is from an alt universe right?
i mean i guess i just use a weird definition <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
4.9 was too, no?
4.5 event was technically captainverse too right?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
promare + nge for half price, on your gacha game today!
so they couldn't get like a bundle deal
nge isn't even trigger's, right?
asuka could just be placeholder for 6.9 event <:shrug:877047647511384064>
and i took a look at files, there is ai-chan assets under same name as other ER asset, so they just assume she would be there
like i remember early ER leak said ai-chan would be important
that kinda leak sounds like datamining and seeing what asset are linked to new event
is 6.9 beta out?
i mean i'm down
should've been kill la kill collab
ignite aka the new husk
it's dollar store sucrose
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i think you need to explore a good amount of dragonspine to unlock the domain tho
yeah a hydro and cryo one
argenti weapon when you have astigmatism
no but i find her hot and she isn't a 5* and i'm mad about it
ningguang
you're pushing the average up sheeeesh
that's a 2 avg
jesus
then she could use hrt power in apho3
if only captain pull for 2s
she's from s0 timeline
L
genshin lore is for fun
who cares tho
that's weird as hell
but like official knight
i mean i get that
rich?
yeah
honorable rank of child
i thought she was like
is she actually tho
no?
you can just say age
that's just default age
what the fuck you mean chronologically
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
the manga i read said they're all over 18
we might have one for genshin from the manga i think
like compare to genshin
we have canon age for everyone?
isn't it weird
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
it is in my lore
i'm not into lore
maybe
idk
even though i wish she didn't
hua still has 15 yo body
cause like
how are they going to explain when they give griseo huge boobs?
not wife wtf
i was roza and hua simp
no
ew
am waiting
yeah
i still vibe w it
yeah scaly probably
is it more sus if i'm defensive about it
i do like their tails tho, but that's because i'm a furry
me but with rosalili
it would achieve balance?
do you think
maybe
if she stops being loli-like
i wonder what happen with teri simp
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
if i'd ever became famous i'd prob want to hide as much personal information as possible
i feel that way with most stuff
is it?
i think i would rather be not known
i'm okay with that
that's the sirin i know
i like that outfit
<a:catJAM:824368853877653515>
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
and did that to this day i think
and then i changed into IO
until like 5.4 or 5.5
from when ER released
i did only HoF
back then i was malding my ass off i think
looking back that is
that was so funny
HoS dies so fucking fast
LMFAO i remember too
husk was sometimes an issue
not really tho
piss easy
everything else
7 had possibility of kallen, and bella was insane
you win the run
if you got past floor 7 8
like unironically the wall
it was on floor 7
er still is random no?
5.0 ER was like that
lowkey tho
they were going to make it faster and less complex eventually in some way
they can't let ER take half an hour
if they wanna add more content
i mean it's inevitable tet
sounds good
<@503044914016419840> i can share right?
tell me how good it is
cmere
anything that's not darling in the franxx, if you see studio trigger, insta watch <:okk:1058108494995263539>
trigger slaps
both of them are made by trigger
anyone wanna join in vc to check if i can stream well?
maybe i can arrange the watchalong for tomorrow or sunday
i really enjoy it
i just rewatched it, it's strinkingly political
but you can easily headcanon it
not canon
where's hua lmfao
cause like
not necessarily in that order
like past the 7.1 valk, they're just announcing new characters
i think past 7.1 i wouldn't believe the time schedule
it's really good
hell yeah, we're doing a watchalong some time soon
so you never see anyone make use of it
it just sucks
she has damage on dodge
and then when i played apho2 i went wow she sucks
before playing apho2
cause i pulled her
sw was different for me
cool
now i have to pay to play her more
i already played her
apho mei is also who cares
i care so little about alvitr and vita it's insane
so
but twins is very far away
sirin is pretty confirmed so i'll be there
the only thing i care there is sirin and twins
even if the leak is true, they could change plan by then
mihoyo don't plan that far
that's like 1 year in advance
gotta keep expectation low
ok i'm over it
i was so happy
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
from dorm
and i got rosa
all i wanted was lili and rosa
same
and by we i mean me
we are so back
APHO ROSA EHOFHOUAHDFNUIERJUBGNHIEDR
i think you might be right
really?
she has a model
maybe that specific asset is new but it doesn't really confirm anything we didn't already know
that's just the decal from her model on story no?
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
not really helpful
i avoid those
please, i didn't get it
explain it to me tet
what's the joke?
but not 7.0
like maybe 7.1
anniv is genshin collab
there's no way
i've never once been right with one of these
6.9 - sp sirin
7.0 - s-rank hua + wt vita + apho3 announcement
7.1 - sp timido
7.2 - apho seele
7.3 - story part 2
hmm?
7.0, late october for us
i'd assume cn/sea anniv
to me, the numbers aren't a problem, it's the concept that is kinda weird
it's like around 30-40% buff tho
i called it a straight buff
no?
then it's just p much a straight buff
which it would be insane if it's not, 300 ore is like too much ore
if it's one time price of 300 ore
like rot timings and element application? that kind of stuff?
is this for like, tc?
i never understand the purpose of these
opposite problem from nini
but i don't wanna go on twitter
i kinda wanna see some
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
i'm betting on a big 7
how similar to genshin do you think it'll look
from 1 to 10
let's make a gamble on it
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
i'm moved
like literally anyone plays barbara on coop
i'm surprised people are actually upset that they're nerfing barbara on coop
c <:omegalul:408829995360714772> - <:omegalul:408829995360714772> p nerfs
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
<:crying:757445037402619974>
it's not funny when it happens to my twink
a skill that long has to have insane numbers to be worth using
if you can cancel it and get either most or all of the energy, that's fine
it's just how long it is
i mean as far as i care, the issue there isn't either of those
it looks pretty tho, but it probably sucks if the numbers aren't broken
like in terms of performance
that looks pretty bad
i think the video is better
can you do vxtwitter
4/5 that's more than what my mom gives me
i'll take that as a compliment
i'm still sad tho
and not make them all look like clown from different circus
and it'll prob help with giving fontaine a design throughline
which is probably fine, since he is a 4*
i mean idk, just the colors and clothe design look very uniform to me
that one i wouldn't mind either way <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
my guy looking like an npc
even if they keep very little
red head + denji teeth was pretty cute
they got rid of both <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
those are the 2 things i loved the most from his design
mostly his head + how his clothes are skinny on top, puffy on the bottom
i mean i didn't expect for it to be exactly like that
the new party screen looks sick tho
idk
that's their default
actually i don't have to ask that
keep my twink twinked mihoyo
this is my second one
:copiumseller:
mimi's coming soon too
sure buddy
<a:KianaWaiting:652262801796104227>
now we wait for the second one
ruined
okay one of the characters i was excited from fontaine
L
so i don't mind that one
i hate twintails
fucking npc core
there's a thread
yeah from the dump
what even
such an insane downgrade man
i'm so mad it really is him
i wish they mc bb it
the guy is cool too <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
oh okay
which is impressive cause yelan's skill is already cool
i liked the girls skill, it's like yelan's but cooler
which one is that?
<:crying:757445037402619974>
carv was right, fuck leaks
nah man i'm pissed if that's this guy final design
fuck this game man
is that what became of this guy
nononono
wait
no one told me that
<a:HUHH:999402772866805770>
it's paid???????????
that's like a 6 month player by my metric
if you login 2-3x per week, that cut down your resource by at least half
spending all your stamina
i'm saying like if you're a daily 1.5-2 year player
i mean i also believe you
like after 1.5-2 years?
lowkey it is
huh ok
i mean you run out of characters to ascend at some point right?
how
what else can you even do
don't you have like giga stacked artis
even if you're the most casual possible, if you've been playing for like half that
like the game is 3 year old
it's just for new player, no?
at this point
sounds worthless if that stun isn't like 20s long
same type doesn't hurt i imagine? just no benefit
so you just always want to have different type
oh ok
<:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
like type a vs type b, they both counter each other?
wait i don't get it tho
<:dogkek:664517636524343344> ok
does it even matter then?
are they retroactively adding that to old valkw
like honkai type?
what's going on
fill me in chief
explain?
what?? that's kinda cringe
i'm not degen enough to recognise just from that, but i've heard the name before
is it oreimo?
oh <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
<:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
is that a leak?
figure the fuck out buddy we don't know either
love this
2d platformer?
is that a like
i didn't think about that, the arc is probably finishing soon no? maybe?
oh wait aren't we kinda close to a new big CG?
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
yeah, weird that they keep it in the files
i don't see any other asset in the file, it must be 6.8 stuff <:okk:1058108494995263539>
it's under sfx
looks pretty cool
i saw that as a texture tho
idk, i haven't figured out how to de encrypt cg yet and i have no clue what the schedule is
oh i saw that in the files
was someone on like, mihoyo food stamp?
what the fuck does stole a pile of information from a poor person's hand even mean?
In case of an investigation by any federal entity or similar, I do not have any involvement with this server or with the people in it, I do not know how I am here, probably added by a third party, I do not support any actions by the member of this server.
agreed
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
oh
<:cry:944955259636285481>
i like the ones that emotionally manipulate others into feeling bad for me
this is the best one
<:crying:757445037402619974>
at least sugarcoat it tho
you don't have to be so mean <:stopbeingMean:870200690956460052>
LMFAO ok
which hua [lists out someone who isn't hua]
<:lfgCatgirlEdition:803114454187114506>
let me know when's genshin hua
why you reallymad over that
it's like me with honkai meta <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
nevermind i won't make fun of you anymore, she rejected me too epi <a:KeiloTheBear:1002644779441598585>
what about me heki, what if i was male cloud retainer?
lmfao rejected
really? i mean i'll believe you, i have bad memory so i can't remember if we ever got good banner leak that's further than 1 patch ahead
i'm not entirely sure about that, we do have some insider leak, the art dump was insider leak
mihoyo prob changes shit last minute all the time
lowkey even if they do, i think rerun is so flexible that you can't trust
my god they're leaking the whole year
yeah i think those are datamine
my standards are low
i'd play for a few days
for mihoyo animal crossing
i'm down i guess
it's sooooo cute
the baggy pants, denji teeth
but that version in specific
maybe same one
this one
the diver one
obsessed with penguin guy from the art dump
oh shit i didn't notice that
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
let them be
they're too busy making genshin valorant
<:shrug:877047647511384064>
i have no clue why they don't pump them out
they don't even need to make vfx ones tho
i guess?
skin could have some issue with fabric
it's not like honkai where all stage is basically flat and you might aswell be floating around
so the model does need a lot of work to make sure it won't look like shit when you do anything
genshin is a game where you have a fuckton of freedom on what you're doing with your character
but a model is probably a lot harder than it sounds
i genuinely don't know about what's the issue with skins
makes me more willing to believe they could add even more in the future
the fact they're actually working on a new model
i mean idk
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
i mean yeah
there's about 10 pics of her
<@309634550273933314> maybe group the captain r concept art?
idfk why you askin me
but i have to trust you cause if it makes rounds on my behalf i could get fucked
i can share the google drive folder i made
if anyone wants access to it
i'll spend the rest of my afternoon scanning my pc i guess
kay have fun!
so i missed it
it's just a part of a very big one
oh wait no, it's here
okay tet i'll dm you
6 soon
this one ain't there tho
that one i did see
i didn't see that one
LMFAO what
yeah these leaks are kinda insane
lonely nahida feet around you
i'm not finding anything on mine <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
did you actually download it from drive?
same one too
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
the message is there in the folder
also <@385655541248163840>
i'm doing a drive folder to share with you
i would delete it and scan your pc, tet <:okk:1058108494995263539>
tet actually install malware in my pc <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
you're scaring me tet
okay i'm doing a very big scan now
???? what the hell
truly <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
idk why you got it and i didn't tho
yeah i wouldn't allow that one
did you download something else? did it quarantine the zip you dl from drive?
idk probably not
skill diff tet
yeah idk i think i'm safe
i'm running more virus scan to make sure i'm safe first tho <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i could do a drive folder and share with y'all
do you want me to do something about it?
but i did send all haitham, there's not that much unfortunately
i didn't spam all i found interesting
okay i skim through it all
i think it's skill diff
my windows didn't do that
am i fucked too?
oh?
that one is safe
the same as i did that you sent me
download it from the other source
can't you just
LMFAO i didn't see he weak ass in there before
i think it's just reference from some other game
brat
there's actually so much nahida
ok
oh
kinda hot
sumeru kaeya?
okay i found some haitham
HOLY SHIT
sorry ur right
it's sooooooo cute
my god
tet look at his little tail
i'm more into thiks one right now
i'm interested
there's a lot of nahida actually
botw nahida?
i'm looking through it btw, looking for haitham stuff nini <:okk:1058108494995263539>
this is for tet
i'll run a virus scan first
gimme a sec
i'm already done <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
tet how slow is your internet
ok
the link or the files?
like there's a bunch of unreleased character
all of them tho? i kinda doubt it
can i dl?
utena ass design
he looks like he's 70% legs
LMFAO
that's very scary
yeah that's what i'm most worried about
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> no one wants to become the next uba
it is 4chan
tet make sure you're not downloading 30gb of klee porn by accident
actually is it? maybe i'm overestimating it, dev client was really bad
they keep outdoing themselves
the closest we had was like the 2 or 3 dev client, and that was REALLY bad and it wasn't as bad as this
i'm sure the big leakers all had access to this tho, insider leak like this is how they tease out the designs i think
it's also unprecedented too, i don't think we ever had insider info like this shared to the public
from the sheer like quantity and quality i think it's really hard to believe it's not real
yeah unironically, it's so much
there's like even signature from people who worked on it
i'm willing to believe it's true
those leaks are actually pretty scary tho
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i thought it was like, people bringing tiktok talk outside of tiktok
that makes sense, there must be like at most 0.3 people on charge of moderation there
oh ok
save it all tet
someone's getting sued
<a:Monka:465018118608125953>
that's like insider leak, actual concept art leak
those ain't normal leaks
those leaks
wait holy fuck
i'm going to kill myself
d wording
hopefully to the death
they'll fight
chibi my
trueing
seele sirin hua?
s+elf -> sp -> wt?
second one is wish you were AE
first one is cunny carnaval
wait is it not out yet?
imagine trying to roll that down in mobile <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i had a for fun game where i got like 100 gold from heist
man that sounds so bad
i'll just stop using reddit on phone i think
i've been using it for like unironically 7 or 8 years
i use reddit is fun, and that is also probably going to shut down
it's getting culled
and also if you use some reddit app that isn't the official one on mobile
for mass moderation
which is killing like 99% of 3rd party software for reddit
reddit is going to make their API cost an absurd amount of money to use, and also limit what you can use from it
r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns/
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and i get why but i dunno how much that works as protest
r/traaa is just permanently shutting off no matter what
so a lot of subreddits are blacking out for protest
it's because reddit is doing shitty things
it's not for any genshin reason
kinda like naruto
<:BatChest:1021180786650648608> i wouldn't know i don't think i got to that part
also yeah i have no idea why anyone cares about stuff like sp cost without knowing her sp gen <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i don't think this one specifies, but it's a domain expansion like MPE, it'll prob stay around after she switches out
from previous leak, no
not this soon
they don't wanna make HoT2
yeah i can't say what it is, but i can say it's not 40s long tf
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
40 seconds of time fracture
okay it's 100% not
LMFAO
idk i haven't read the text
<:HOPIUM:864973200738877490>
it means they're keeping 2s MA alive
just spear is enough
very niche some situation you don't wanna ult
i mean it's probably going to be the same thing as HoS right? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
spear is the impair one before ranks
1. impair is a debuff on the enemy, breach is a buff on the valk
2. impair and breach would probably interact multiplicatively, but that isn't as good as it sounds like, it caps off
there's only 2 differences
it just work the exact same as impair
but it doesn't
impair messes with defence, so you'd think phys breach would mess with phys resistance
for phys, there's defence and phys resistance to mess with
and breach messes with elemental resistance
so for elemental, we only have one number, elemental resistance
no
you can call it phys breach so people can <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> i knew it!!! even though it doesn't matter
phys breach exists but is the same as impair, you can prob call it either
impair is for phys defence, breach is for elemental resistance
we have impair and breach for manipulating defences
like one of those dress your character games
i'm pretty sure that's just SN with flamescion dress and DPe wings <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
she's HoS replacement
we knew that though
yeah she'd contest the one psy boss, HoC, i guess
i just hold no strong opinion on typing, it would be weird to see a seele not being qua but balancing wise i don't think it matters <:okk:1058108494995263539>
and at that point her typing doesn't matter either
the only way she get actual dps performance is if her numbers are broken
well yeah but any typing i think that'd be true tbh
probably? good for melee weather
i don't think any typing alone would have much impact on her performance <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i hold no strong opinions
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
psy phys, what even is that again? MPE?
yeah i guess that makes sense
oh i didn't read that
like in the files?
oh
stayed?
get fucked
and just don't give her a collapse
maybe they make seele qua
weird definition but ok
also wtf does very niche boss mean <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
kosma with SS
it surely will make for new budget option though
in MA i easily believe it actually
maybe in MA but only i care about MA
in abyss
would make it steal the boss from like v2v
i don't think giving a collapse to current phys team
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i think you're overestimating how impactful collapse is
she was neither before <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
both as a dps and a support
she became playable after her pri
that's wrong
HoS was just new gen valk
but i doubt it
like HoS on release
maybe if she's very strong as a dps
meh i don't think so
but i also think it doesn't really matter what she is
i think it would be interesting if she was, having a collapse on every phys team could be pretty cool
i have no opinion on the matter
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
now the only thing i'm pissy about is tft
i thought it was smart
like recriation
hekriation
i do it for hekriation
i think i got pretty pissy at one point
hi <a:Pat:914638151069356062>
i'm still here
didn't work with me
uh
VD is mech
genshin basically add whole game of dlc as new area every year
they release SO much content it's kinda insane
but with time i just believe it more and more
like when i started playing genshin i alr thought that
that is pretty true though
yes
it's either discount seele banner or spending event, i don't think you can have both
gsr lightcone also slap
we need to go back to 2d gacha
actually true
their designs slap still <:life:1001518241610485781>
i'm sent to ggz to retire
when you send an old animal to the farm
maybe i should be like
our scene is going to become bigger than CN
<:Prayge:909232418463047690> set 9 about to be the best set ever
like with ~2k viewerbase i think you can already make a living off of it, solely
i guess that makes sense but that's a lot
that's kinda insane
isn't that like pretty good
4-5k viewers
his worlds stream had like
that ain't bad tho
hmmm i see
isn't he kinda already?
robin works overtime huh
<:Wokege:862486121933701141>
oh shit
i'm not good at creativity stuff
like for items and stuff
can i have pbe stats? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
was it gone?
really look enticing
yeah those 3 pixels
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
she looks fine but i can't really pog at it yet
like same as HoH
i gotta wait for actual ingame
the rare actually lore accurate elf
oh shit
but still
i mean for sure
i feel like she'd wear that no matter what
i dunno if that counts
she went oh shit a theme? i'm dressing up
jackal is the only one who deserves her codename
man if you think about it
how many are they willing to spend?
shiro has to go through the trials before being considered trustworthy of the leak role
<:BatChest:1021180786650648608> seele with a seelie
weird, i didn't expect them to move elf earlier in the timeline
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that ain't seele
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
elf: herrscher of death seele
i read it as
OH WAIT
i was right
veliona really dies?
that doesn't look like seele
okay i'll sell quills
it's like made up by harry potter right
i don't believe in quills
i'll open up a onlyfeathers <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i didn't know there was this much keilo demand
camera open -> <a:Chad:1015573221942251642>
wait why? i think i'm around that age and i'm built just like him
i'm listening
alright okay
even though the game is 5 years old already?
bronies 18 cause one of the doujinshi i read made it really clear and i think it was lore accurate
can i share?
well
can we share?
more expensive than 5 star
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
no one takes my wendy cope seriously
7.0 time for wendy to shine
trust
it's rgb seele
do be rare tho
sns sw
i mean i guess like
i think it's just PE <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
there's no need to have both model if she's just gonna be an npc or look pretty
she's either a boss or playable
to me it's different still, from like the model we have
i guess
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it's been so long
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i guess i was on my way out now that i think about it
really?
wait 6.1?
oh i wasn't there
if they're not bosses, i don't think they ever did that
well, i wouldn't count any of those <:okk:1058108494995263539> since they're bosses
and then she turns yellow winged
the first she's blue winged
like she has 2 phases, aponia
but visual wise, she did show up with her 2 form
like she didn't have her actual skillset
depend on what you mean
<:life:1001518241610485781>
remember 2d ER lobby?
it was when they turned the lobby into 3d
like the other fc don't have boss, so it took a while for them to show up with model
i think maybe
wait actually idr
no
mobius
aponia
not even raven, sushang was like that
we've had her show up as a boss before, way before release
i mean it depend on what you mean by reveal
what is she, baizhu?
that's not how mihoyo does shit
ain't no way they're delaying her release for fun
and if she's showing up in story in 6.7
in 6.7
she's showing up in story
like, datamine mean
but mihoyo ain't like that
the only way she isn't discount is if they move her forward for some reason
then i don't see her not being discount
if seele is 6.8, and she very probably will be
JK was cn anniv
i have something similar too
```
sp         (SNS, CN) -> 
discount s (SW, HRT) -> 
s + free s (PE + SpA, END + flamescion) ->
sp         (RC, HN) ->
s + sp     (DPe + GD, hare + prometheus) ->
sp         (SI, LY) ->
discount s (v2v, ?) ->
gacha s    (HoH, ?) ->
WT s       (JK, ?)
```
you can go further than that too
like this is the exact same lead up
yeah i don't see them doing it any different from last year
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
indeed
6 week?
how long is 6.7?
i can do the timeline thing
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
in the end, we only had 4
the DK are on a weird standpoint tho, i swear that that felt more common than it actually was
i don't think it's fair to make comparisons like that eli
two very different people
and this time it's like
if you look on past schedule, it was an aponia and an eden
actually they have a point
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
bio phys? HoS in the bin?
since it's probably going to be phys elf too
there's like 99% chance it's going to be a phys release
would you really
yeah, not double valk
elf mini seele
trust
discount blue seele normal banner red seele
it's going to be both
she looks like jk signature weapon personified
she looked hotter on the light cone
kira?
they are also from fontaine, and next patch is the last sumeru patch right?
it looks kinda like shit but in concept it'd make sense, the oceanids can have other forms, canonly
i find it believable
<:wendyenvyhic:941923735605235732>
the green one
7.0 wt third seele
and then
do we know if 6.8 seele are both of them or not yet?
cause 6.9 is elf too
like actually
i was just thinking that honestly
<:o7:1099354934320840765>
for a while now
since they've been doing cheaper S-rank for support
i easily believe it too
yeah nevermind, discount s -> s -> wt
<:jaxdd:1112053304474738799>
skill issue
oh shit
wait do i?
but they could just skip the first s
it's supposed to be sp -> s -> discount s -> s
if follow past schedule
yeah idk they might speed the schedule up
wait no, 6.8 is standard
seele discount?
do we think
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:HandsUp:465017146955661312>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
hua's huge hydra cock?
actually i need to think about it
i already have my next nickname
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
oh wait it's a joke

<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> standards
he'll only kinda melt the servers
aphelios in genshin?
that art went through hell
i dunno if i'd agree
what's that button there for
lady button your shirt properly
lc set the standards too high
is disappointing
and then every luka content immediately afterwards
the best lc ever made
luka has like
scream queens?
i guess i would
maybe i'll allow it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
she has paw eyes
hmm
oh diluc
i said nothing
what
unless you're asking about the datamined/beta changes
idk if you have to talk about it in here
i thought you were talking about the leaks for a second
no
to be lore accurate
thoughts?
here's my proposal for a fanfic:
kiana and mei are on an open relationship, they kinda fight, mei hooks up with ely, they make up and mei bring ely to meet kiana for a threesome, but kiana and ely hit it off way more than mei expected and they leave her for each other, and their child is mar7th
i wonder if there's fanfic
kiaely?
yeah kinda
i wouldn't actually, i thought of some and it scared me
i would make cursed combos
why would you think you're the one having sex?
that's like the most deranged way to explain it
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
but it doesn't really change the fact that i wasn't appreciating you
the idea behind that message was that it was for cherry, i told her she should stay cause there was no one awful around, you said something, and then i told her she could leave
well you see
like minecraft pussy
wait actually it does
you can leave
you should only stay around us, there's no one awful here
that sounds pretty bad though
sorry cherry
we were discussing the cold old leaks
i already use some slurs, maybe i just pivot into saying the ones i shouldn't
yeah i'm like a 3s boss
you never know tet
not because i'm racist yet
oh i said that because of his personality
hak prob had a family guy phase
i think we're too gay to have a family guy phase
i didn't think you'd say it
gold experience requiem?
we have like at least 4 nyx
that just sounds like IO fucker though
ouroboros fucker
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
OF
i'd prefer
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
calling the battlesuit veliona fucker doesn't make sense if she's half veliona
what if she's like SN
i mean here's the thing tho tet
would you really
<a:Blushiekissy:795363746339356702>
NA for 🚮
more fun if we actually see them
tbh tho i don't want to settle with an abbreviation for seele yet
deer fucker is nice cause i'm deer <:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
valkyrie cute and valkyrie funny
VC and VF
what's vf?
you can read it in two ways
it's deer fucker
just retcon it to non existance
wait wouldn't it fun if they just forgot about adult teri and garuda hua and just keep on moving with the schedule
LY DF timido
more ice <:lfgCatgirlEdition:803114454187114506>
timido probably?
and then 6.9 is preview valk
if they announce it in 6.8, release it in 7.0
i guess i could see it <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it was like 5.2 announcement, 5.4 release
when was apho2 announcement again?
do you really think so?
since non S-rank barely makes sense on this schedule
i'm like ready to believe it isn't true though
this is the tweet
what a surprise
when something that already leaked got announced y'all went <:pogg:1060649334489743431>
so fucking fake <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
y'all are
i like that she has heterophobia but she's too young for me
and welt expy <:okk:1058108494995263539>
who cares
🚮
not a honkai expy
looks like they were wrong huh
cause there was no more leaks
that genshin was near EoS
i saw someone say
dev hour deez nuts
you know how many dev hour it takes to design those buffs?
you can't ask for much more
biweekly abyss
they're working so hard to give us uh
small indie company guys
and i'm sure it could get whoever datamine the beta client in trouble
either way it is a kind of tos breaking
this is either datamine of open or private 6.7 beta
<:KeiloSit:1101246919789002752> 🛳️
like the ship you are
you just followed along
i did
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
cause even with cherry and tet we can't make you make good decision
so is he better or not than you
woah
no thank you
thanks for sharing though
i'll skip on the rest
i read the first 3 messages and it gave me an aneurysm
that's so cool heki
keep the creativity up
the ningguang in your mind is way hotter than the one in game
but he doesn't really know how to act
and he goes with it
so people treat him like an adult
a 16 y/o who hit puberty real fast
dainsleif is like
19
the oldest genshin character is like
let my brain come up with that shit it's so funny
i wanna be them
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
and they're just stupid in the most funny way possible without even knowing
i put so much work into it, i work so hard playing dumb
i hate people that are so funny by complete accident
i hate that
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
but my sensei sent me the most suss ass vids
it was funny cause like i'm very sure it was definitely into beta season, so it wasn't leaks
like the real illegal shit
hey do you got some uhhh... 4.7 leaks
when i joined honkai i was one of those
or stupid?
are they new and just lucky
bleed gather shieldbreak support
or just straight up schizo shit
like all the stuff he ever post has either been revealed by someone more trustworthy than him before
but he mostly just reposts
like he does post actual leak sometimes
i don't think that's the only thing
that's self selection right there
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
just gotta get lucky <:clueless:973756617109676032>
i have some xtal leftover, i'll pull for it when it come up later this patch
i'm fine the way i am
it hasn't <:okk:1058108494995263539>
can confirm
and then balded husk a bit
i did 946 kallen yesterday
idk if i'd be able to <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
maybe i'm just saying it cause it sounds nice
actually would i?
so i can have xtal to pull her
i'll actually come back and grind
okay so sin mal
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
is how every comp player felt like a year ago
the way you feel like right now
:mihoyoreleaseschedule:
i felt really proud then <:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
kinda sucks that HoS doesn't have a banner right now, i guess she's old and she's probably going to be the next bp after BKE DA
and i said something like
i went back on my messages earlier to look for some vids
FR is captainverse but she's S
so <:shrug:877047647511384064>
even mainstory valk can be sp
and if she's sp, we now have precedent that it doesn't matter
like, if she's S rank, both captainverse and normal valk is just S
it doesn't really matter tho
wt + gacha + elf?
sounds cbt
standard -> sp -> wt?
idk honestly
but maybe it's standard -> discount -> standard -> wt?
i mean i thought it was discount -> standard -> wt
eli gave up
6.8 standard s
6.9 discount s
7.0 s + elf?
so maybe something like
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah maybe
unless they mess with patch timing <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
sirin in herrscher slot is weird as hell
but i don't think dim makes shit up for clout
i won't take it as truth but mostly from a standpoint that they could change it
yeah i trust dim
oh god
<a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753>
rin?
si
doing some hijinks
being a lil silly is all
that's great thank you
- rofl even
i thought you made a face
LMFAO
oh
'-'
i want that too
why your message have lil circle
how did you do that
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
ping @/private leeks when we get tft leaks
i'll
ty
god i love being right
like, what's the source
also do you know if it's 6.8 beta datamine?
<:okk:1058108494995263539> i'll not share the boss model
<@503044914016419840> can i share the seele datamines ?
i just listed 3
wdym no thots
thoughts?
6.8 - discount ice qua seele
6.9 - gacha HoS replacement teri + phys elf
7.0 - WT ignite dps bio hua
okay so my guess is
i think i just don't understand it actually
actually idk
even with PE
MA FGO is still turbo cbt
that's a bad pick
well tbf
<a:sexdd:1109103829754069014>
:dxd:
yeah that's how i feel like too <:okk:1058108494995263539>
actual leak is like game screenshot, usually <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that usually mean datamine
including those stig png
like, when a bunch of asset is leaked at once
it' just from precedent
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
<a:sexdd:1109103829754069014>
even though i was 100% down to go down with you
wow hiding your evidence
:bidenblast:
the pussy blast is real
holy fuck
doujinshi?
like
it scares me
so
and i'm a deergirl
she can fuck the deer
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
i mean i don't mind it any way you interpret that
oh i see
what joke?
there was like something something
7.3?
7.2?
sussy leak for 2.0
what was the like
even then tho they decide to put her as a new valk on the filter <:xdd:1089308231496638574>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
it actually doesn't matter at all <:okk:1058108494995263539>
it's so easy for them not break it
i mean idk
ain't that close
PE equip bonus: do anything and get every buff
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
of same valk same weapon
they still haven't break the rule
what is bianka theatre?
oh i love this game
i could bend PV like a spoon
like PV
is she especially squishy tho?
what if....
like they surely don't matter but....
okay the only stat that don't match are hp and def
i was really desperate, i was like
was DA's
i think the only M piece i levelled willingly
even more cause all my M stig is lv1 <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i actually have no clue what amount is normal for valk
that's wild
by putting hp requirement
trying to make her set not as useful for everyone?
are they like
oh yeah
ik they have a hard on for img but i don't see it
really?
is there any world where new seele isn't quantum
wait does it even matter
am i missing any
bio ranged - SW
mech shield - HoR
psy - 6s
qua - nyx
ima - HRT
help me fill out the ice bingo
uh huh
i said it with better words
because all of them came out recently
ice has the most meta dps
we do though, like
and then now they have a comparable amount of valk, but they all came out recently
ice got ignored for a hot while
like that's true but i don't think that's the underlying reason
hmm i dunno
ice we have like
if she's on 6.8 then it's easier for me to believe she's ice
that's weird
so seele on 6.8
yeah these are datamines huh
very intuitive <:okk:1058108494995263539>
oh.
and he went we call her nilou around these parts
i said HN for the first in time of iriya
i'm like the master of abbreviations
your mind working overtime
yeah maybe
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
without thinking that
how did you even guess it
mostly because she's kira <:okk:1058108494995263539>
<:dogkek:664517636524343344> you got it
it's not game related
i know like tet also likes to play
i'll spoiler the hint in case other people wanna try without the hint
it's not game related
do you want a hint?
the first of each word
you got some of the letters right
well i mean
no
close
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
yeah, i'll leave it to the people who find it fun to figure it out
that's actually really funny that's what i'm calling her
maybe i call her LY
i guess again idk how the shill boss are
does that even matter?
but it sounds awkward to have a comp double dip on the true damage
i guess idk how the shill boss are
yeah but idk
i could see she being phys
really?
if she's discount
you won't get veliona elf
uh
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but if it's datamine, then that's 6.7 story data
if it's not, then maybe
i'm assuming that's datamine though
<a:DuckSmh:1006448360200347699>
seele discount banner 6.8?
wait
<:eavSmile:1083473267668566096>
homestuck?
<:eavSmile:1083473267668566096>
<:eavSmile:1083473267668566096>
ain't hare 9
i could kick him really far
it would be fucking awesome
if they added global chat rooms <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i would log in to both genshin and gsr
god i'd love that
honkai is just a really overengineered battle royale
if you think about it
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
the difference is that nini then proceeded to not use my mats
me too
<:DeerHuh:814547207561936916>
you can do it twice, you just need to prestige and it gets twice as expensive (if you get repeat skin, 8k asterite)
get fucked
different pyramid too
all 4
they're all pyramid
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
kinda look like carole
that style of belts and shit
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153> crying screaming shitting and pissing right now
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153> i've seen the mei skin and it's sickening
[surprised robert downey jr] castration
deez nuts dies
<:Sucrose_Glasses:845784727935909898>
just because i want to punt her off a cliff doesn't mean i don't love her
is that a bad thing though
<:Sucrose_Glasses:845784727935909898>
if that's sucrose they fucked her up
more info to come
@/prileek hoyoverse just patented some names, i think they're trying to rebrand guns girl z as honkai 2?
@/prileek sounds like mihoyo is developing another game? it's kinda like breath of the wild
maybe she's bait, keep alert
@/prileek we've been getting rumours that after the release of the anticipated herrscher elysia, we might get another psy ice
prepare your wallets
@/private leeks apparently honkai star rail is releasing this april
and it's signora
we really wanted to give cocolia a new spin, so that's why we gave her this design in genshin
what would you say if mihoyo went
he doesn't look that good in game
same
i don't need even more mid people
kafka is the one i like the most but idk
i don't need even more mid
i feel like i'm playing a different game, everyone look so mid to me <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
at this rate i'm going to save until 2.0
these all suck
i have no one right now
i love you tet but please put nearer
the only person i care from that is hua
luocha isn't as hot as actual otto
we'll get actual playable otto eventually
yeah he's a healer
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
worse otto
he's literally
i don't get the luocha hype
wild hunt indeed
te i just want literally every character what gives i can't afford it t
yinyue fuxuan 1.3
they're confused between first or second banner though
current leaks say 1.3
L
kaveh is an ass boy
i don't think anyone thinks ganyu is an ass girl though
if i didn't play genshin i'd think she's hydro
is it as bad as ganyu
bocchi wh<:omegalul:408829995360714772>
like at the end of 3.6, we had a fuckton of 3.8 leaks
didn't we already have 3.8 leaks
🚮
what luka isn't top less
hot guy
imbibitor lunae
we have a year of banners already
i'm kinda surprised how many 5* they have lined up
my source is even worse than a noname leaker
just heard someone call him
not sure if that's the right name either
dunno
5* danheng
seele jinyuan kafka bronie yinyue fuxuan
i thought he was playable on beta
is that even leak
i don't know anything about them tho
team china said the 2 banner in 1.3 on the other order
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
before using it again in actual honkai
it would be funny if they used it on gsr first
you wouldn't remember this is a thing
like even if you play honkai
can't blame them tho
<:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
is that jerma
ty
can i share this
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
not rerunning shit valk to not bait anyone into pulling
rare mihoyo W
diona is cute if you play her muted
maybe i'm underestimating actually, yae and yanfei are pretty good
and dori
yae, diona, lawyer girl
i feel like genshin is missing some good pink hair chara
oh
get it? twin tail?
oh she has a twin tail!
if only she were an actual catgirl
rare tet W
poggspin is from somewhere else you were stealing
this server has always been pojjspin
:poggspin:
knpapa <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i forgot her name
isn't lilypichu the same
more inclusive huh
<:PeepoSitFishing:1058108500775018596>
i am specifically baiting her
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
signora so much of a nerd she died alone
who
nerd don't have to sound like nerd
he still sounds like a nerd
:skinge:
me
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
they have tails though
do you also not like the twins
LMFAO i'm sorry that happened but that's a funny reason to dislike tails
<:2D_Hug2:801841021461200947>
it's ok
nini i still love you even if you have bad taste
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
why do they give her lil paw but no cat ear
only when leaker are scared
it's really rare that that happen
and they'd make more money from keep honkai alive and just making a new game
it's the same amount of work of just making a new game
imo there's no way we get an engine update, realistically speaking
and nothing else new
honkai 2.0 could just be starting with part 2 of story
like 2.0 in genshin is just new continent
we can't know what honkai 2.0 means yet
and not just a new OW
but if they were to move engine, it would be on a big version that is basically just honkai 3rd 2
i mean i don't know if it will be a new engine
yeah probably
that i'd believe is new engine
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<@309634550273933314> <:Toebeans:585731577963610122>
neither does shenhe
in specific
just stop saying those words
no not stop talking
i'm happy you didn't ping me but i'd be happier if you hadn't said that at all
that's a lot of ar
dark carv arc
yeah carv didn't say anything before leaving
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
that was 2021 honkai
honkai 2023 not releasing farmable valk with farmable gear
probably not
they're grounded
this channel has leaks which are not allowed to go outside
yes but no
vibe check?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
6.6 : S hare + SP prometheus
6.7 : SP shigure kira
6.8 : discount S adult teri
6.9 : S seele + veliona elf
7.0 : WT hua
unironically just genshin
who cares
just come up with whole new character
yeah sure
even with valk i know how to play
story i just bash my head on the keyboard and skip the text though <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
ER story at the end a good amount
i guess she was in like
oh wait now that you say it
i think i've played SK once at most before i quit
does that happen
what
cool
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
but it would be cool
it doesn't look like seele to me
OW enemy leak
so probably something like that again
during her OW boss fight
it was some enemies that hare summoned
last time we had a leak like that
kinda sick
waterbark
me when i'm a dog girl and i need to protect my copyright
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
teri's the bigger seller though, right?
and then the one we already know what she look like is the big valk of second half of 2023
like looking back it'd be stupid if the one they're hiding the design is the filler discount supply
so it'd make sense if she take big spot
i do think they're trying to hype up seele more
i mean yea i'm just saying, it's not necessarily the discount supply or not that make it a good investment if your goal is t100 pb <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like between HoH and v2v, that statement is way more true for one of them, and it ain't the discount supply valk
i mean you say that, idk tho, that's just on what you value and what the hype valk is
but if i did, their name would start with g and end with resham
like i'm not saying i know player who pulled for v2v who wouldn't otherwise and then ended up whaling and getting her to 2s
like obviously normal s-rank is more expensive to get, but there could be something about how making valk cheaper make people want to spend more
hmmm does discount or normal s-rank make them more money?
i can't watch some of these strats, actually make me miss doing them
it's very cool
if you wanna see the double dodge same attack, kinda hard to see though
same thing
o i mean huodou
they're mixing it up, after the fix you can run HoS instead of AE, SI instead of cat and HN instead of nyx and she deals way more damage
yeah i think they're fixing it next patch
it looks very cool
it's similar to how you dodge the same tona attack on hb and nyx
where you time it perfectly so dodge refills your bar after you use it
is the dodge -> combo on 3s maru strat
i think my favorite thing
it's very very tight on positioning
it's not a senti specific bug
so if you're positioned correctly, she steps over it and it cancels the animation
that's basically the cause of the sword cancel bug, she takes a step forward on the animation and in that specific arena, there's a small indentation on the ground
and also often in open world
it happens sometimes with the tentacle quantum mobs
like if some enemy pushes you up or something, it just cancels the animation
like, you know if you do a skill and then you change vertical position and it cancels it?
it's just a really weird interaction with the stage
that wasn't exactly a bug
yeah LMFAO
she has like the chain cancel which is only useful on 9s strat
i don't think she has abusable bugs
and she's sp hungry as fuck, but that's a more macro difficulty than micro
the 2 hard part for HoS is figuring out how to time the buttons so she actually does what you want, and then half the time she just doesn't anyways
she's finnicky but not nearly as complex
i wouldn't call senti hua complexity
i do think NS is like really really well designed
unironically why ever read if you can just ask someone else, half the time the text is straight up wrong
illiterate player just keep winning <:CHAD:999060564363984986>
i love hotf but she's brain dead
like iirc 2 are useless
yeah, NS is kinda simple
i've actually never read any skills
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
no reason to when mihoyo don't let them shine
i'm sure if i gave her more time it'd feel good
is more like i only have those issue cause i barely play her
this isn't really even a bad thing about px or old hua
can i switch buttons now
that's prob long enough right
uhhhh
spamming a for aaabb for like 3 seconds and i go
with PX i'm like
like AE there's visual representation of what's going on
my issues with phoenix is that i don't know what the move is supposed to look like
yeah keep saying those funny letters baban
me with phoenix but unironically
god i know right
kinda unfortunate
like even with current support she wouldn't be able to hit 75m dpm, nevermind compete with current dps
the meta was so.... undeveloped back then
it's the girl from the first chapter, apparently she was really big on the meta a few years ago
people will be like i get that they're trying to make kiana the face of the game, she's kinda like the amber of honkai though, hasn't seen any use in more than a year, they should just move her to the bottom
just reverse the order really
honkai in 3 years, you'll open the valk filter on valk select and you'll need to scroll for 5 seconds to get to the newest valk
but the only reason we have abbreviation is because valk have multiple abbreviation
you say that
actually i thought about it maybe you're right
just you wait for the next one
and HoS killer is CHKK, or CHK²
HoS is CHK
yeah
sticker is way too big
like a mdpoint between emote and sticker
i wish we had lil bigger emotes
we appreciate you
thank you jayson
a pathly vote on the best abbreviation
maybe we could have like
i like the version of the meme that's kirby
how do you type
da bonya / dab on ya
:dabonya:
HoFin is cute but it deserves death penalty
4 letter+ is terrible
3 letter abbreviation is already ugly
just make names longer for no reason
maybe it's the unabbreviation era
i'll call her flamescion/flame sakitama
sure
i'm talking about flamescion dipshit
hos 2 omegaverse
because it's an h and 2 os
maybe we should just have 3 h2os
i feel like hoo would be better as h2o
some people call hoh h2o
d2, h2, just talking about chess at this point
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but once HoS2 releases, then she'll see way more use i think
cause like there's no way they'll release a valk rn that is useless before HoS2
or stun boss
maybe on ima weather or something
i feel like HoS + DK2 will still have some niche use
yeah it's necessary for ER
new gen wt valk is like:
s1 -> +2% fire damage
s2 -> when you dodge it makes a funny sound
s3 -> lead
2s -> unlock all the skills
will you?
start calling HoS CHK
and tet looks at you and says HoS killer
you're like god i don't know anything about abbreviations, what does HK mean
asking tet about the abbreviation
imagine you're a new player
i actually appreciate HK and NH because like
(fervent tempo bronya)
ftb
and then when someone asks me who i'm talking about, if it's dk i say donkey kong and if it's prometheus i say diddy kong
maybe i call both dk and prometheus dk
HN kinda is
also yea no, no numbers or gear for DK
like DK ult also has black hole, you just never ult so you don't see it
the part that's similar to VC she has, DK also has
she is unironically just 2023 DK
i think i'll wait until i see gameplay to figure out my abbreviations
sweet FA
prometheus giga bait, barely even synergyse with HoS, cheap banner still waste xtal, save for new valk
oh shit we could make up some misinfo
i was told she was bait, don't even synergise with HoS
so catch maincord user crying about skipping in a few patches
yeah there's no universe anyone that cares slightly about meta would skip prometheus
like if i'm predicting correctly, phys is kinda dead for you in a few patches if you end up skipping prometheus
prometheus is giga unskippable
the way i see it tho
hare ch and who else
can we have the family tree lineup
hare is already skippable, she doesn't need a cheaper option next patch to make her skippable
like HoH was kinda bait if you pull on 6.0 not knowing that jk is coming on 6.1
like bait is faking someone into pulling something they wouldn't otherwise, usually by hiding pertinent info behind another patch
bait for whom
it's kinda so obvious that she is skippable
i wouldn't call her bait cause like
personally i think hare is skippable for average player
and like, same
that's definitely true, some valks are worse than others but at that point you're just mad at crit instead of dudu
she is less bait because she has a niche above just being mech phys valk
like what even do you dislike about dudu? cause if it's the crit bald or gameplay, you don't know how bad either of those are with hare
if it's that she's strong, i fail to realise how you think the replacement to the dudu would be somehow weaker than dudu
if for you, mech phys = dudu, then again, i dunno how you'd replace bke without the valk being also mech and also phys
i cannot understand this though
i could also see hare beating s0 vs s0 but that's meaningless
that's almost a worthless baseline
is s0 BKE is already losing against 3s sns/3s TP
i mean the issue with that
like i could see it, but hare is going to have some like turbo giga cock to do it
on non-hare weather
yeah beating like ranked BKE at s0 hare will be reeeeeally hard
and went holy shit it's yoimiya and leaked it wrong
do you think someone saw cat yoimiya skin
with yoimiya
we had genshin collab 2 leak
like 6 months ago
wait
i also kinda vibe with yoimiya cat
even for s0 player, BKE baseline is already at like 2s1+
like it's kinda hard to beat BKE
we don't know that yet tet
looks disappointing tho
maybe i need to see the HoT skin animated
hmmm
the only question now is if she'll beat s2+ bke/3s tp/3s sns at bio boss that's not her weather at s0
at her own weather, there's no chance she won't top score, she has a multiplier no one else has
yea so like
while realistically speaking hare will def topscore
plenty of good alternatives
it's a well designed weather i feel like
yeah
okay sick ty
<@503044914016419840> can i share these leaks outside?
true i did forget
maybe it do be ice time
last lightning non-dps releases:
- elf 6.4
- hrt 6.3
- gd 5.7

last ice non-dps releases:
- jk 6.1
- elf 6.0
- rc 5.6
which isn't necessary to compete with HoS, so maybe they're planning ahead a few years already
they did give the exact same restriction to prometheus though
usually shield can stack, but they purposefully gave that restriction to HoS
but she can only shield if you don't already have a shield up
HoS shield gives buff to team
but i could see it
they don't really need it
yea i feel like lightning team been a while since they got attention
like 2 years in advance by giving restriction to HoS buff
did they fucking plan this ahead
holy damn
they figured out the double phys MA week
anytime you need to use old support, you'll prob go back to HoS
yeah if things stay that way, new HoS will only be stronger than HoS if alongside new gen support like prometheus and onwards
sns tried to be the same thing but si so broken she took the shield break niche too
meta support for a few patches until they release a new one, and then she fall to bleed niche
i mean she was always temporary, same as sns in principle
you can just have a new valk that even if weaker, doesn't compete with prometheus buffs, team damage will end up better
a new valk doesn't need to be stronger than HoS in a vaccuum to replace HoS
like, with prometheus having competing buffs with HoS
i can't even be that mad
true, that's kinda disgusting but also really smart
are the buffs based on how many summoned entity on ER?
but yea, idk if it matters for ER
o i answered that to the wrong message
to me that just means HoS is getting kicked soon so dk2 can have the shield buff
for now they compete for which shield buff you'll get
it'd be too dangerous i think for such a big buff to be uncapped
i mean yes but you could still cheese it out with other valk
gives you a shield if you don't have one with buff
prometheus has the exact same gimmick
and having the shield gives you buffs
HoS has a shield that only applies if you already don't have a shield up
she has a shield
to me, prometheus is final confirmation
i also do think HoS is going away soon
i guess not necessarily, if it was a low number it'd be fine, but it's +20% so it'd be nuts
if it stacked with amount of summoned entity, it'd be stupid
if there's summon, increased dmg for valk on field
no that'd be broken
and she has a shield, but this one is locked behind weapon skill
she has some shieldbreak on kit too
god she literally is just 2023 DK
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
2023 DK
prometheus is literally
maybe not the bleed one so much, the other 2 i think are creative and leave enough for creative other team to do stuff still
the recent new ones, symphony bleed and this one
i don't think so either but honkai is weird
is HoS feather summoned entity?
bring back hb <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
this one i think is really cool, i'd like if they added some elemental bosses with that weather
yeah i genuinely like these new weathers
doesn't look like there's any inherently broken mechanic, just how broken her numbers are will decide it
and then they deal damage for you
you change mode, she has more ghosts instead of only one
you press attack, her ghosts deal damage for her instead
her actual moveset don't look like there's any gameplay gimmick
kingdom hearts?
idk if i can explain why i think that
cause it's supposed to be the weapon skill
like i think it would sound really dumb if her kit was like when weapon skill, do something
but i think it doesn't matter
maybe they could've chosen a better weapon than javelin
idk i actually think this is a cleaner option
all javelin will be like this weapon procs the second form of the equipped valk, plus some buffs
so they made a new weapon type, which every weapon is like this weapon effect is different depending on which valk it is equipped to
if they just gave her a lance and put the effect of change form on the lance, no sig weapon you just literally don't have a second form
while also not locking a valk gimmick entirely behind sig weapon
they're trying to give a gimmick to the weapon skill
i think i get it tho
will be for weapon skill = change form
so apparently the new weapon type
her second mode has some defensive stuff tied to it, she takes less damage and shit
oh is that what tet was talking about, self damage?
but that is absolutely not what that is
cause the only thing i can imagine it meaning is a 3% of enemy hp bleed
i need help figuring this one out
'Hare gains one stack of Bloodthirsty，each stack of Bloodthirsty will make Hare deal 3.0% additional HP draining damage when hitting enemies, which lasts for 30 seconds independently for each stack with the maximum of five stacks.'
actually nevermind it kinda look like all her damage really is summoned entity
i guess some bronyas can detach project bunny
there's like no summoned entity phys valk
it is kinda surprising looking back
true
i'd think it'd be at most something like 70/30 tho
like from a pov where most of her dps is from summoned entity damage
o i see i think
the first half is the weak part no
that's a lot of words
i'll bite though
LMFAO i'm like famously the illiterate here
heki i like talking to you as long as you don't speak
money seele
ms is taken, it's iriya for sn
the rare abbreviation that's longer than the real name
with ourselves and with anyone else
so we can't communicate at all
i think we all should make our own abbreviation
okay i'll work on the abbreviations now
maybe it's a low bar tho
yeah this schedule looks way better than the last batch
<a:douglao:959721392872501259>
one of us
blood vovoide my beloved
what's wrong with skin for dead valk
you put hua in and i'll agree
agreege actually
all rc skins are fucking bangers
is it a bad thing
<:KKonaW:518160138205528103>
cause i was really indifferent and now i really love her
i think out of all of them, kiana is the one that changed the most for me
kiana too
hua grew hard on me so i like her more than seele now
i don't actually hate seele, out of like all characters on solo character design she was my favorite when i started out
her A-rank was also whale valk when released <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
whale valk
keep it like that
no i agree
yeah fuck seele!!!
discount is still better than standard s-rank <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
seele discount supply is probably a good thing for like seele simp right
that's so cool that you think you have control over my choices, try harder though
that said, if you keep ignoring the things i say then you're losing your bff card
i can have more than one best friend
kurikara is my best friend
neither hopefully
ew
utena mei
oh hot
<a:WHAT:1068133759158849567>
me when mihoyo does 2 spending back to back like they did last year
object permanence issue
is it like
literally the same pattern they've been doing for a year
?
that's how valks were back then
she's old as fuck
i think i have the knowledge necessary to start writing the skill desc <a:Chatting:996353943108067388>
like i said
release dodge at right timing
oh the skill literally say
why doesn't anyone listen to me
heki
dk block is quite unique, if it's like that
yeah, it's also different from bb/ft ult cause it acts more like that, though not to full capacity
as long as you get hit while holding dodge, you get the retaliation
yeah, it's different from BKE because BKE timing don't matter
i'm assuming that's what they mean with prometheus
you can hold dodge for a long time, and when the enemy hits, you need to time the release to proc it
it's a little different
DK you need to release dodge the moment they make contact
and it's also not exactly like bb parry
i'm pretty sure it's not what flamescion is but i dunno anything about flamescion
gpt for prometheus
i'm thinking
oooo it's time to make up new abbreviations
like how DK has a similar thing, where tf and shield reapply only procs if you do perfect defense
i mean i'm assuming it's about prometheus kit? it'll have something on perfect defense
does mihoyo really need to care about that
i mean will she though
she already have plenty of bullshit to deal with
if she steal bke boss
i mean
ryan <:pogg:1035066559351226388>sling
did you read the stigs
what does it look like
for like 8 patches
xinyan famously not even shown after
diona xinyan 1.1
besides guess it
there's nothing else you can do
she already is
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i got rizz
what can i say
actually i told chat gpt to love me and she actually said she did so
kinda like a ritual
i was thinking about how like the only way i can see kith messages is through there, so if he pinged me and got censored every message then he could still communicate
yeah it doesn't ping me over at <#1079789802116882532>
true and based
i wanna test something
can you ping me and say MA on the same message
heki
so i didn't really spend the money actually
but i was going to lose the 50/50 anyways
like yeah i spent 100 dollars and lost 50/50
it's  technically for free if you think about it
<a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
rank her up to 9s and she only deals a little less damage than cat <:pogg:1035066559351226388>
50/50 new herrscher or 6s
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
is the one they're implementing on the event banner in a few years
the only 50/50 they're reaching
mihoyo is listening too
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
that the enthralling gameplay they are looking for on honkai
the gameplay is when you qte press attack and qte out
and they for some reason don't want to play the game
that's somehow the new competitive blood
i'm not even joking, player like kith, riku
they're unironically going please we need a support where we play less
unironically asking for easier HoS
2023 honkai player
lmfao yeah keep coping
in actual gameplay they all play the same, switch in press button leave
any gimmick you give them
new era support barely have gimmick
yeah
honestly
HB is the closest one
like IO has some synergy, but the way she plays is just normal dps, she barely has a gimmick
i was just saying how a valk with actual summoned entity would be cool
that guy is what you train against on valorant tutorial
doesn't mean they'll be in ma or abyss
that's just collection asset
that doesn't mean anything btw
isn't she not even geo anymore
or the community being dumbasses
the only fun part is the leakers being fucking dumbasses
lmfao that's what leaks always have been
and he will get scaramouche'd into being playable
my theory is that the one that said would get revenge will be alive
i mean they're doing it for dottore
it's the best case scenario for me, who doesn't play, so i don't care which form is playable, just that there's a hot bulky grandpa in the game
and then during archon quest, bullshit happens and he gets younger and playable
make him a hot bulky grandpa
nah it's easy
did someone else make predictions about them?
that's kinda what's going on with houseki no kuni, i feel so lost without all the required reading LMFAO
i'm enjoying it though, and i hope whatever it is also is an interesting story besides being a convoluted reference to something else
i don't know enough about like japanese/eastern religion like buddhism to make accurate prediction if it's something related to that
my read might be way off
before he moved on
cause kakeru had all the time to plan his shit out after remembering and then actually crashing the car
i dunno, like if it's that then it's not very strict is it
gacha gamer reading comprehension
oh yeah that's definitely reading the diary <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
-> got stopped by kakeru before she could
-> recognised she should go read her diary and maybe show others
-> remembered some awful stuff she did
minako chose to stop herself from not remembering
the way i understood it was like
lemme reread it
hmmm
did she read the diary?
to me, just straight up figuring out facts doesn't feel right to be the one thing
like forgiving yourself and moving on or something
hmm maybe the growing thing
but then shiori kinda did accept who she was to a degree? i dunno
like they're all in complete denial by the start, and some like tsubasa just choose to ignore the past
maybe it's like a accepting who you were and what you did deal?
cause like from our pov they didn't do like good stuff
i'm more interested on the why they did move on if that's the case
it's one of the things that they haven't given any clue so it's just shooting in the dark
i mean that part i don't really care about
yeah
why LMFAO
the only issue is
kakeru and minako moved on
it's like this loop are a test and you just keep doing it until you figure out what you need to move on
a reincarnation sorta deal is what makes most sense to me right now
LMFAO
i mean idk is it?
but this chapter kinda broke it i feel like
theories that could work before this chapter
those are like
hmmm
my working guess is that kakeru is actually related to the family somehow
LMFAO
wtf he's trying to kill his family off
okay we're going to implant memories on this guy about the one time he tried to kill his family off
like negative iq scientist
that's funny
LMFAO
i found it funny
LMFAO i mean that's just tsubasa tho
and continue on?
+ amnesia
and implant memories
you think it'd be like, they stop the experiemnt then
so like, when kakeru crashed the car, the one time we saw it
hmmm
and they're all implanted memory that they're remembering
so like nothing on all iterations besides the last one actually happened?
they actually survived a car crash like that <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
if it was like research or w/e it'd be pretty hard to keep the suspension of disbelief that like
i was kinda sure it wouldn't have a non-fantasy answer
at the point kakeru showed up
eh idk
afterlife stuff is like about the only thing i can think of
hmmm yeah i don't really have a working theory
i kinda trust the author to end it well
takopii was pretty short but didn't feel rushed
i mean i would rather it not be rushed
beginning of last arc
it kinda feels like
i really liked it
yeah
he can still cum, which is what matters
oh ok
cringe
even after the buffs
and my hot take is that zhongli is below average, maybe even way below average on 5* in genshin
my mild take is that zhongli is easily the worst archon
<:life:1001518241610485781>
everyone was so pissed back then, right after zhongli they do another 5s geo
maybe i'm misremembering though
so it'd be weird if he was still on placeholder info
hmmm was it? i remember it being like during his beta though
yunjin xiao support <:Clueless:996308692133761094>
oh yeah i remember anemo yunjin
but that was like cbt1
xingqiu went cryo -> hydro
actually did it? maybe i'm misremembering, i kinda remember it happening on element but actual example i only remember stuff like albedo bow -> sword and ganyu catalyst -> bow
this happened before i think
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
the lights just look fun
yeah my goal isn't actually to kidnap you
i'll be the cartoonish thief
oh lumi was asking where to store you yesterday
arguably by the first
oh no! we don't have design space with this weapon, we'll come up with new bullshit to do with it by the second valk they released
the thing that i was kinda weirded out about chakram is that mihoyo kinda went
i mean i don't mind that, they wanted to do a teri that played differently but they set restriction to themselves that teri always uses cross
with CN now tho i feel like they've actually done chakram with chakram, just took like 6 patches for them to get to it
and aponia could be literally anything who cares
cause like RC don't really use it like a chakram, it could be double katana and it would've worked the same
back when chakram released, i was kinda peeved by it
aponia uses her chakram like it's a catalyst
it's so dumb, literally the second ever chakram valk didn't even use her weapon
i guess it tightens non sig weapon on support but even then, not by much <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and it's not like you're ever using non sig weapon on dps
it's not like the gameplay is tied to weapon like it's in genshin, dev just do whatever the fuck they feel like
i dunno why anyone would care
new weapon is so meaningless in honkai
and i like gorou so i guess i'm down
like she kinda looks like gorou post hrt
yeah i don't hold a strong opinion over her
story of my life
<a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
and not normal enough for people in denial like nini to like
not furry enough for the furries to like
such a weird middle ground
<:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
this bitch just bella
kallen angle
did blank morb from a different timeline
what
hope that helps
genshin has a max of 4 character per team
sorry
and you can't really run kaveh on the second team
i've done the dps calcs
we're not genshin, i don't think we need just the face for UI
i did think it was a weird leak for it to be the face of the valk
if she look like 2023 valk i'll be pissed
she's pretty but i won't be satisfied until i see gameplay
issa hua angle
damn
are they going hard for part 2 already?
tet tina isn't having a good influence on you
that's not even jayson
not ping worthy
he said pin worthy
the literate
gacha player
doesn't surprise me one bit
cn anniv should be in like 7.0
and teri + hua before that
i'd bet on seele at cn anniv
look kinda cool
she got different eyes
they talking about this translation?
cause that's literally what the previous translation already said
is it more like people are dumb shits and are misunderstanding, so i'm going to explain?
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
what the fuck they mean error in the translation and then go on to explain it exactly like the translation did
what
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
is hak also leaker?
wait what's the drama?
i'm starting to hate this discord update
okay
lore accurate
buy this <:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
like it'd do a rainbow sorta move
to me it looks like it's going in an arc
i thought everyone really liked the pokemon
oh my god
that starmi is supposed to be a shooting star?
wait holy shit
oh LMFAO gender is a good one
you should change your name to tet starmi reddit updates
inflantion <a:KeiloTheBear:1002644779441598585>
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> 500 dollars
like hillichurl drop 500 mora
i really like the joke of calling every game currency dollars
expensive baizhu
7 million dollars
he look like a ghost <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
yeah the pharmacy lightning does him wonders
hmmm
did he get paler
wait which is which
i mean i guess i see it
tighnari and itto?
i don't remember honestly
does shield give infinite poise?
right after dehya
SO funny
that would be
of course nini knows genshin cons by heart
which is an improvement
80% would make her a bad character
dehya equip effect: +200% fire damage
poor girl
dehya needs some fucking honkai stigs to be made useful
this death note expansion looking spicy
damn
tf2
trust
all of them are gonna look like elysia
issa dottore deal
is it like dottore
they all look the same
cause i don't know what the fuck it is
that's truly minor
write a book idk
like holy fuck if you're so capable to completely ignore everything going on in front of you for so long, then just keep doing it
runescape has the same fucking shit, they foreshadow something for 5 years and when it actually happens 50% of the community is pissed that the character did something that the copy in their mind wouldn't do
so why complain like you care?
i honestly don't get it, from how much they know they clearly don't care about it
<a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
it's so bad
i've noticed that trend
true, on v2 it's always either a buff, nerf, change or stay the same and then v3 we get a small or big buff, nerf, they make a change or don't make any change
genshin also suffer with it a good amount but it's not that bad since that game story is picture book simple
it's literally impossible to do it properly without help from CN writer team
it's just really hard to translate stuff like that, it's not even translator team fault
all the foreshadowing we get after translation is just when they got lucky at translating it well
not for honkai, other games
for translation
in alphabetical order
i've heard of fucking translating teams receiving a spreadsheet of dialogue lines
yeah i mean you can only do so much with it
but you look at CN and they had that much foresight
like ER had soooooo much of it, the story felt so nearly tight and written
which if i would guess, is because they don't really communicate with translation team to know what are the future plans for stuff
but on the translation it barely comes through
a lot of honkai writing actually makes insane use of foreshadowing
idk who's fault is it but a lot of the translation issue comes from the story feeling like they don't know what's coming up next
but holy fuck
realistically speaking thats prob right
but jesus fuck
maybe it has always been
media literacy is fucked these days tho
i do think a good part of it is how the translation is
and i mean i get it, the game is shit, just point your anger on the actual shit parts
they literally have no justification for having that strong opinion besides they like hating things or are looking for things to hate
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
imagine it on day 1 CN
if it had released in GLB/SEA today half of the player wouldn't understand wtf is going on
act 2 doesn't even have a translation yet, you think even half of the people who hate it right know what the fuck is going on besides superficial description
so they just hate the first thing that come into view
imo i think people are just getting tired of other stuff in the game and they aren't able to actually communicate what they have issue with
i understand if you dislike the execution, but complaining about that as if it wasn't the core theme of the story since 1.0 is a weird take
and i love it
5.0 cg is literally unironically just power of friendship
power of friendship is literally the whole honkai story <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
lots of very strong opinions from the story chapter they haven't played yet
ooo people don't like it
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> even dim
no seele
now i'm on the other side, are you sure you understand what an augment is?
hm
i'd never
wonder how it'd work, something like pull enough past 3s and you get extra rank up?
is it? shame they removed then
i'd be down for a new mechanic
augment? sounds kinda pog
what's that
in a few patch, every valk will be apho valk
what's wrong if it was apho seele or apho teri
is act 3 just the animation?
kinda weak cgs
i don't think both community are that different from each other
a lot of the takes are just v similar
generally tho, learning more and more about CN community it is kinda shocking how similar it is to western community
i mean yea for sure
so i guess i don't really understand or relate to some of design opinion on both western and eastern player
which, i guess, i also don't really relate to
that's not the issue they have, that's an issue that a lot of western people have
not even because i personally disagree with it, i just think it's v inconsistent <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i think the only complaining CN does that i can't understand or relate is about making the outfits too skimpy
like it's the thing that if there was literally no explanation and just a valk teaser in the middle of the chapter, i doubt people would mind it less
A for effort, at least they tried to justify it
i mean i'm not complaining, i just find it funny
that's kinda funny
or our ai chan?
CN ai chan
is it
look who i saw in a dream

- stc
uncle Ai Chan
i thought it was like teaser for future stuff that would happen
so that's stuff that actually already happened?
huh i guess i don't understand wtf were those cg
wait so
nvm then
oh have they
i hope they don't touch on it at all
that she magically looks like 5 years older
how much do you want that explained?
which is interesting
the community makes their own drama
i guess when the game doesn't offer anything
actually
new 5* taking 30 seconds to clear 12-3 instead of 28 and you're really mad about it?
booba powercreep?
i can't even joke about it cause i have no clue what's in the game to care about
but i'm worried that they care about way different stuff
sometimes i wish i could share stuff like that with normal genshin player
the 13 flamechaser were actually 25 flamechaser!!!! eden just didn't have the budget to put them all in ER
we should have FC post-main story instead of APHO
back to the part that matters
there are no excuses
but by now the WS are literally naming themselves shit like owl
like when the first MOTH got turned into furries you could make the argument that it was a consequence they had to deal with
it seems like a welcoming group
if i join ws can i become a furry
i got that idea from a youtube essay about the new god of war games, the guy said something like it's a really cool idea, and i wonder where they're going with it, i just hope that's not what the writers feel like aswell
we are too
the og purpose was oooh aren't you wondering what's up with this mysterious mystery? aren't you interested in the solution?
it's your job to write isn't it? then yeah just add this character we just made up to the story like as if it was always there
and then corporate kicks down the door and goes btw this is eula she's supposed to be on the dvalin fight, figure it out
imagine being a genshin writer, covering all your bases and making a cool and interesting story
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> i loved that musician before he went crazy
just like eula
it's going to be a surprise to them too
tet just because the writers don't know it yet, doesn't mean it's not going to happen
and it's just aether and lumine
every slowly dying to complete the final most important plan
like end of honkai story
SO fucking funny
that would be
genshin girls Z
honkai impact 3rd: the genshening
tears of themis: horny genshin
genshin impact
genshin star rail
zenless zone zero: furry genshin
genshin 4: galaxy
i kinda like the vibe
we'd never have fucking court summons for leaks
these are the emotes the runescape discord servers have -> <:bigsmile:1076309582848196608><a:goldstar:1075953575399792691><a:pfft:1075956932738830398><a:kiss1:1075950009784221786><a:tiptoe:1075950018357375036>
god genshin community is so much more interesting than runescape
it's so much better
thank you for the high quality version!
guys look at my hu tao pixel art!!!!
they're like oh my god finally someone did this and they don't recognise that maybe the reason why no one was doing it wasn't because it was hard or time intensive, but maybe because it sucks
i'm just in shock that
1. people actually do this, look at the end result, and go well i'm gonna upload that
2. people watch it in droves, some openings the 60fps fucked version has more views than the normal version, so it's actually hard to find the one that doesn't give me a headache
3. viewers then not only act like it was really hard for them to make the 60fps version, as if it wasn't literally just click a button on the video editor, they also thank the uploader for uploading an objectively worse version of the op
that's it for me complaining about stuff only i care about
what even do you mean find, they clearly made it given that it looks like shit
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
don't worry, they'll release a skin soon with all the best parts of the old design
IT'S DISGUSTING
LOOK AT THIS SHIT
and that i mean for the openings, all the frame moshing actually makes me irl nauseous LMFAO
its not the high quality version, it's the will make me puke version
where they just upscale + frame mosh
same vibe as people uploading 4k 60fps versions of anime openings on youtube
upscaling can be nice for some uses but claiming it's the better quality version is so fucking dumb
it looks awful
better quality it's clearly upscaled to hell and back
with a passion
i fucking hate when people do shit like this
i'm gonna complain about stuff no one cares about
30% of people here racist
aren't like
is it too edgy
can i call her the slur?
if captain R doesn't get a name
right into permanent though
i heard they're releasing the first 3*
and couldn't live with it
they made bennett
and no one noticed yet
the competitive balancing team quit like 2 years ago
do you think
so it's funnier
maybe i should act like every leak is true
all of the past genshin cat girls have really met our expectations
can't wait for the new cat girl!
<:momtao:996073360490504292>
this pinged me
made in abyss -> PE -> RC -> GD -> trio
yes
i mean yea but like, the only reason why they'd code race in would be for like bestiary stuff
i think that is for the collection bestiary? i dunno if kalpas is listed as alien there
tyty my mind is huge
so i don't think apho3 would have it
apho1 and apho2 didn't have valk type
more likely just post mainstory
by post-honkai, i don't mean apho3
there's alien as a race there too, we don't have any of those yet but they are confirmed to exist
prob post-honkai stuff
hmmm that's interesting
you can retire right now actually
i combined every genshin character into one
it looks like one of those posts
finally someone gave tet a piece of chocolate
that's the break patch alright
lmao into 2 valk
that looks like worse muse dash
but i'm also not in love with a-rank susannah
like i don't really am in love with it
i don't mind it that much honestly
yw
sp
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
and then 1-2 times on following patches
they'll run it 3-4 times during her patch
like it doesn't matter what she top scores
i wouldn't mind much
we reached the break
and that's it
i guess we've been asking for the break patch
qua phys dps though
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
SI is the default
she don't even need to synergize
look
she's magical girl all the time with a skin if you want the boring susannah
that's a skin
:mhcatblind:
that both makes sense and is disappointing
oh it's SP cause she's some magical girl bullshit
so they can shill harder
mihoyo once again throws away all interesting and lore related rules they have
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
undeservedly, i was right
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
then i guess that's all they care about
if so
did it make more money
and they go cool! do it again
it goes down horribly bad
they like test a new thing out
LMFAO
yeah and i hate it
theresa and hua are both holding the same thing
they do look nice though
i mean i guess it could be quite different from how hrt + flamescion + end release went
i'll be really surprised if they
1. aren't all S-rank
2. don't all release in a 3/2 patch streak
and they're bound to be all good competitively
because they can't really stagger them out
announcing a few big valk every few patches is actually turbo awful for competitive
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i still like the game so much, i hate that it hates me
again, glad i quit i guess
yeah
but that's the way mihoyo works
for like competitive player it does nothing and might hurt more than help
yeah i guess for like simp/casual player it's v nice
i know some gacha does stuff like that
if they every 5 patches went out and said what the next 5 patch valk would be, that'd be sick
feels like it doesn't do that much good
but when the info is so half baked
i'd think it'd be great if they actually had a thorough timeline of releases
idk i get that but like
like ok ty
might aswell be them saying next patch will have a valk!
they show a teaser, give no info and no release date
idk i feel like it ain't worth much
that's rough
is this how they're going to do shit now?
and immediately after they announce what's the 3 hyped up battlesuits are going to be
just completely absolutely awful
hrt + flamescion + end release schedule was a fucking disaster
oh no i really don't like this
ideally both i think
and the dick just sucks up all the cum
you just move your hand in the opposite motion
it does work, yeah
and someone else thought it was /unjerma and /rejerma
i saw someone on reddit using /uj and /rj
<a:Noted:914214211138244688>
tell me more
mhm
you two need therapy
it's the lesbian game
why y'all gotta compare them like that
and sp-style gear banner
small spending that gives a fuckton of frags
is like some random S-rank with A-rank on banner
the way i'd think it'd work
wouldn't surprise me if it was double valk patch
though tbh
i dunno how a new A-rank would work
raven was 10+5 and valk was alongside IO
no one here was alive for that
how the fuck do they banner work even
was VG
by themselves
the last time an A-rank released
not like some other character don't already have bugs when burst mode <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it'd be similar to kokomi burst
like HoR burst has a timer
how big of a problem would that even be
maybe mobius is impossible to make it work
just gotta like remove the HoT extra arms during exploration and that kinda deal
i don't think any honkai chara design would not work for genshin
like run around and explore, and combat/burst mode
could always have 2 modes
not necessarily
if you compare some old honkai valk with nahida as an example
is just from the style they went out to do
like they have more restraint, but i don't think is out of restriction from tech or anything
eh idk if i agree with the more restraint part
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
that's the one thing genshin and honkai are opposite
the new character doesn't even have to be good
i mean, it do be true though, if they're making character designs, they make more money on making it a new character than just making it a skin
like they have limited amount of money and they get better return from investing it all on making more gachas than making skins
like there's no way
LMFAO
just shit out cool new thing after cool new thing without improving anything ever
and instead of improving it, they remove it and add a new one
and then they forget about it for 2 years
new cool mechanic that is just a point of being tolerable
it happens in honkai so much more
this is true though, and it pisses me off
like i literally have no explanation for it
and making so few probably doesn't raise demand
i'm 100% sure skins make more money than they cost to make
they're literally leaving money on the floor
but for skins?
like i agree with that
i mean idk
i cannot even begin to imagine why they do what they do
yeah there are a lot of mihoyo decisions which
the improvement from the main movement mechanic from inazuma to the sumeru one is nuts
yeah i can see that
newer areas aren't just more complex, they are more interesting and flow better too
i think they are just getting better and better at designing content
like even for beginner town, mond exlporation is way worse than current content
i don't think this is fair though
and can permanently access 2022 version through nahida story quest 0
like, you can permanently access 2021 version through klee story quest 2
they should've just made the islands permanent content after 1-2 patches through some character quest
fucking mental
and if you miss one, then that's permanently missed content, cause next year's different
oh we won't make them available throughout the year
and then go
they decide that they should grab a fair few islands, make them great
i can't believe that genshin, the game where the main problem is lack of content
i mean i will take it off because mihoyo is turbo stupid and won't make it available LMFAO
it just gets better and better and better
mondstadt < liyue < dragonspine < inazuma < sumeru
i mean, exploration wise the game is just on an uphill
so it felt awful
the ideas and core themes of inazuma are interesting and cool, they just did it in 2 patches instead of 4
if we're talking just about lore then honestly i just think it's a problem of mihoyo rushing shit out
like light years ahead of mondstadt and a good amount better than liyue too
inazuma exploration was pretty stacked
besides main story being turbo rushed it wasn't that bad
my hot take is that inazuma wasn't as bad as people said it was
genshin lore is just them throwing shit around and going ehhh wouldn't that be cool? wonder what happened here!!!
still no idea what it is or how it works
3 years in, most iconic and center piece system of genshin
i think it's funny how we don't know what they are still
but honestly i would still just sell it off
and got mad when that vision then activated for her
she tried to sell a dead person's vision off
that's very closed to what ning did
if i got a vision i would protect my cabbage too
kinda based honestly
you can't just make characters and expect for me to accept it
who the fuck is rana
must suck
cause you can't be made playable
getting a vision and knowing you will die
imagine being born a bitch in the genshin universe
cold and evil = they'll get killed off
there's no other out
or they kill them off
either make your favorite villain into a tsun and they become playable
look cherry, you gotta accept one thing
i see
with xs on the eye
oh the one i thought was a femboy?
i don't remember who arlecchino is
like what else can you even say
besides mihoyo being turbo pussies
no other explanation
yeah i have like
cause the money is there
it just makes me think that there is some other reason they run away from villain character besides money
like if you want diversity and a bunch of options for big hits, then villain valk is an easy thing to go for
unless they're going for only the biggest hits possible then talking like they're just making the most money sounds wrong
but like, villain valk in the past seemed like pretty big hit, even if not the biggest
then i'd understand that argument
just infinite growth
i mean sure, maybe if the way they want to make future valk is to try and make every patch valk the biggest hit ever
you could maybe count IO
she was actually the last villain valk we got
was HoV like a turbo failure or something?
yeah she really deserves it
sheeeesh
like HoV released before pc client
is that a fair comparison though
but if elysia had a plot twist on part 2 where she's actually evil, then i don't think it would've been done properly
if done properly, and i'm sure dorothy could be done properly
oh i mean, not saying that dorothy is boring or anything, the idea of a character like that is interesting too
that feels kinda boring and cliche for the character who is overly nice to actually not be very nice at all!
i do think the current character we have for elysia is more interesting than if we had a plot twist in like part 2 where they went oh no she's actually very evil!
like it doesn't make no sense, but it does feel like it's a bunch of asspull when they have these defined rules they don't tell you until they become important
a lot of honkai lore feels like it's not planned ahead properly
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
hmmm alright then
and she done did it already then? is kiana END battlesuit actual finality authority?
so all authorities is just the most achievable way to get that power?
i don't know what origin's authority does, and why would it be necessary for finality besides we made the lore need it to sell more battlesuits <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
but like, different authority have different power, right?
i know that
is there no reason for that? would it need all authority to make anyone finality?
so like lore base rule, need all authority to make kiana finality?
what does origin even do beyond those? be pretty?
she's clearly not the first one, and she can't allow future herrscher to keep humanity again
none of those matter for a new origin
i always thought ely being hoo was for 2 purposes
1. being the first one, not a power but just a description
2. allowing future herrscher to keep humanity, one time deal thing
what does origin even do
why? because lore?
LMFAO that is objectively very funny
all the problems are solved with kiana right
just felt like it?
yeah, why did she do that even
actually do i care?
like kiana is going super saiyan and shit right
okay so what's going on on the story?
bully the suicidal one!!
yeah fuck her up cherry
so now they get a valk that would be rather dead
that's kinda fucked up huh, all cecilia fan wanted is playable cecilia
damn she sucks
and she's alive too?
she's suicidal?
villv spin top bullshit i just went cool!
i checked out the story so fucking hard
oh so she chillin
yeah who even is hare
was hare ever alive?
is hare dead?
i don't even know what the fuck is the lore right now
like hare or w/e
it's probably going to be more new characters
when is 6.5 stuff anyways
like there's no way
actual square peg circle hole
you tell that to 2020 keilo they'd say that that's too extreme even for hyperbole
herrscher -> support -> support -> herrscher support -> herrscher x2
we're so embarassed
oh gosh xd
did we really release a cheaper psy ice S-rank right after herrscher?
truly 0 care for the competitive community
and all mihoyo did was oops is it really an error? i guess it might be teehee
it was clearly a bug, clearly fucked up
it really got to my nerves
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
when talking about pokemon
he talks a lot about pokemon so for once now i feel like i'm using it properly
i stole it from skype, from blustorm
it's a good emote right
i still complain about the one husk weather bug, i'll bring that one to the grave with me, even though i don't care about abyss
i've talked about how mihoyo treated DPe like shit and how it was disappointing how fast they made her obsolete, even though i didn't personally invest in DPe
because i think having a diverse community is a good thing, even if i don't care about that content in specific
the fun part is that i repeatedly and consistently complain when mihoyo does shitty things to aspects of the game i don't care about personally
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm glad i have you around to tell me what i find fun though
thank you for the 5000 iq take friend, i surely didn't think of that before and came to the conclusion that i wouldn't find it fun
yeah i'm gonna play the mode with no leaderboards and no refs
i'd complain about it, since it's removing content a lot of people enjoy, even if i'd personally enjoy the change since i prefer 2s MA
like if they removed abyss and replaced it with 2s bosses
i just wouldn't play it, like i already do to abyss1
if 3s boss was a different gamemode, abyss2, i wouldn't complain
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
we've gone through this before, the difference is that the addition of 3s boss removes 2s boss
auto play for me please
and then the more you spend money in the game, the more damage you deal when you press x
9s is like one big AAA game cutscene with quick time events
the more S in a boss difficulty, the less you play the game
honestly i'm kinda down
kith when other people that are not him can have fun:
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and all the cons are the stuff that mihoyo is doing
and you know, all the pros for keeping around are all stuff i made up in my head
if i should've dropped the ball this early or kept around for a few more patches
i've often thought to myself
glad i quit
honkai galaxy which is coming eventually
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i think i'll prob play for a few days, not spend any money and then quit before the honeymoon phase is over
you only say that cause it's new and shiny
that was a thing on genshin beta too
keep cope
lmfao
bingus can be me too
when i say we, i mean me, which is everyone that matters
unless you know cn
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
we don't
they still have ggz
i mean
that's a thing that happened
we literally don't have ggz anymore
we got:
- genshin
- the game before genshin that we are slowly turning into genshin
- turn based genshin
- furry genshin
- future genshin still in making
make 5 different genshin, make 5x the money
if you think about it, it's really smart on mihoyo's end
literally just actually turn based genshin
after genshin, they've decided they're making c6 worth it one way or another
sheeesh
sex scene at c6
preg*2?
daily pulls left: 10/10
it is weird that there's text like
kinda fucked up to only share those
oh so it's just extremely lucky pulls?
and those are fucking 9 4*s lmfao
cause it says on the banner that every 10 pull guarantees a 4*
oh it's prob special beta rates?
fucking 13th of march over there
how many do you need to max out cons?
jesus christ
is dehya that bad
it's usually only certain streamer that counts
yeah, just watch certain hsr stream for x amount of hours
there's no way they'll be gone fast LMFAO
physical books, and not job without salary lottery
we had half that stock for fucking books
look
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
save someone from getting it
i wanna get a beta key so i can not log in
anyone ping me when some hsr stream goes up?
no balls
do it
i'm glad i quit
they have v little reason to make a-rank
nah sp just makes more money
i think whatever happens after part 2 will be a soft reset
i don't think part 2 will be a reset
jesus christ
to C-> B -> A -> S -> SS -> SSS
imagine how many frags it'd cost
turbo shill
that's like
god
they could break the rule but when it's so easy to not then why bother
i guess, just as easy
like sp valk is way more expensive
making a valk A-rank or sp is kinda gameplay though
i have no trust on mihoyo not breaking rules for shill though
hmmm if you say so, maybe the rules are a bit more strong than what i think of them
she is clearly part of the main story, yknow?
i don't think it would make sense to make any future A-rank of her SP for that reason
like if we found out that kiana all this time came from a bubble universe
not that she did, but if she did i mean
after she does a bunch of shit in the main timeline and affects heavily our story, imo she kinda becomes part of it
you could easily get away with making her standard A-rank
even though she is from a different bubble universe
i feel like if she had a bigger part in the story
hmmm i guess
didn't that version literally show up in the story though?
people would've explained away easily
but i'm 100% sure if they were standard valk
and CN also being sp valk
like you can explain away the FC being sp valk
it's been getting less and less believable though
it looks so awful with so many characters
and put them all there
and put like flamechasers on valk filter
realistically they should've done something similar to olenyevas
eh i really doubt that will happen
and break them immediately after
mihoyo loves to make up justifications for mechanics
also to answer coffee, i don't think they care about lore reasons to make a valk sp or not
what you using discord on a flip phone?
literally answered but ok
it's insane
before that it was VG in 3.8
last one was raven 5.2
nowadays
so fucking rare
a-ranks are
we need our biyearly a-rank
what even is time
oh god
wasn't raven 2022
we need our yearly a-rank, yeah
cause she already is story playable
prob not story playable
dim is usually right i feel like
i'm interested in that one event
oooh
all days are made up
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
can't have stuff like that out
yeah i'm glad they reset their discord server
jesus fucking christ
how the fuck do they think pussies work
<a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
my bad
oh it was cat fingering
the tiktok
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
cmon don't be like that, the dog fingering video you showed me
<@197871478950068224> come share your dog fingering video
i like this one though
this is like the polar opposite of my reaction from lumi's dog fingering video
i did get really excited from bird play though
what the actual fuck
what the actual fuck
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
okay the ones i found weren't as bad as this one
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
are you like 5 years old
how can your roots be gzz
but denji is like a naked dude with a dildo taped to his forehead
the women have pretty good and kinda accurate cosplay
it's like one of those porn tropes where
it's so funny
have you watched it
upsetting
that's
not the thrussy
me twice?
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
i wouldn't and i couldn't
i'd never
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
LMFAO
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
that's just sex
that last one is not petplay
what the fuck
tet
can you tell i've forgotten the name of like 75% of genshin valks
instead of green keqing
and r63 noelle got abs
instead of yelan
that green keqing got armpits
it's also fucked up
yae being foreplay, signora being futa, keqing being hips, sucrose being fellatio, xiao being edging, diluc being cock, kaeya being balls, kazuha being cum
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
half of these don't even make sense
i'm sure there are sites for that
um
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
the fuck going on over here
i mean i guess i'm down to try it out once
ruleset
it's like that whole thing where they make up rules to make their fetish normal in lore
okay no it's ringing some bells
ooooh yeah
and horny
that means it's probably alright?
so like
i only know that it's supposed to be cringe but the people who talk about it like that are the type who would say anything is cringe if woman enjoy it
to be honest i don't really know anything about omegaverse
holy shit
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
the actual omegaverse or
wait is that omegaverse one like
well i guess it's fine
untranslated though
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i found it on a hentai website
oh
maybe if i look up the name of that specific story?
he only did one though
i see some chapters from 2017 and 2019 issue
i don't think anyone translated the 2016 issue
oh i looked around
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
because the chapter 2 is done by him
okay so i gotta track down the 2016 issue of this anthology
imply, even
curious... like a cat, you'd say?
so like if there's no plot i don't think i'll care much <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah i mean i'm gonna be honest that's not an archetype i'm particularly horny over
luckily it's also the one i'm interested on
and the group that translate it only translate the ones from a specific author <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
this one is a collection of story from multiple writer
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
are they?
how
it would be kinda sick if i was interested in that archetype
there's SO many
a guy half undressed with a furry guy
legit half of furry manga has the same cover art
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i mean fuck it my myanimelist is about to become a minefield

mihoyo hideout
change the leak channel name to like
a lot of that isn't torturing though
i mean i guess i can see it
you gotta pump those numbers up
aren't you the horny one?
less than mine
that's
i think you can do that by not letting the bot see those channels
i mean what carv is asking is more that the bot doesn't put those messages up on the wall because of leak spoilers
oh lmfao
lmfao is this about who even
i'll stay quiet about the other 2
and neither i am for v2v tbh
i am not sexually attracted to her though
i mean she has to to complete the meme
the order would be reversed
if i was the one to make this meme
where they put the entire team in
that's one of those story stages
oh wait no nvm
that's mobile UI
if you can't grown your own, store bought is fine
it's like they always say
there's some for sale

i thought it was a tail
i just glaze over when they do
even some normal school anime are fine if they don't focus too much on that drama
i mean they can def do it well

so much drama that i deeply don't care about
i also feel that way with most school anime nowadays

i dunno tai's age
i'm 21 tho
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
LMAO sorry
taihen is 35 yo

this is pokemon lore that minors can't get to know
sealing them to make a new world
to be arceus and fucking up titans
that sounds like a cool game
you should rest
<a:PatPat:814547161878364190>
oh i feel that i won't make fun of you
carv?
wtf you mean only 4
i'm awaiting the anime arc for it
they've never confirmed it
i mean
it is probably a crime though
whos the one huh'ing now
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
if arceus fucks a human that's like zeus fucking a person, it should be fucked up for him
gods of the universe
and then some pokemon are like
machomp is just a 4 armed himbo
spicy men
some pokemons are just
cause like
okay, is pokephilia a crime in the pokemon universe?
LMAO
it'd do the opposite of help
that sounds like
late hours at blustorm
will take a while
i've done
i have a 100 axis one
jfc
and fucking complains
while he's not allowed
fenri comes on here
and having no way to express it
knowing that 4:50 score is 413
you know how hard it is
<:sus:866768426478862366>

wow kalpas ass is really attractive
but if you're like
if you wanna make out that's prob horny

i really vibe with that but it could be more furry
autism
i'm fucking blind nvm
you should send a message over there like archived or something
oh shit
there's apparently also more people working on similar things but with different methods
but it fucks with AI trying to learn from it if they steal from you without permission
you input your art there, and it basically puts a layer on top of it which is meant to be not perceptible to people
yeah
apparently it's out
<a:glizzy:856275175188332545>
y'all art folks prob will be interested, dunno if it's news or not for you
LMFAO
it's overwhelmingly cute <a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>

hell yeah
8ball are you old enough to drink
i'm down
arcy is making enemies
i'll take it
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
8ball am i pretty and cute
she holds no punches <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i think that means you'll get used to it
do you know what an 8ball is hak
i think this is the most baffling thing i've ever seen anyone do for youtube drama <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and he fucking posted a link to his mom's autopsy report
and one of the excuse he use is that his mother died
i'm watching a video about some youtube drama from this guy who did a charity stream but then didn't make his donation for years
it might have too many neutral ones though
i think having a fuckton of answers works great to keep it fun
yeah i'll look into that later to add more answers
some gifs are really huge
<a:ModCheck:1021871712339505232>
8ball try to nessie out
she should be able to send gifs
let me try
<a:therehego:1183176161996570664> look like he's turbo mad
i thought he was fucking pissed
until i saw him in full hd 4k
<a:Nessie:1164016962595209306>
nessie is so small
holy shit that one is huge
she could send gifs i guess
or is that still not allowed
can people without nitro use animated emote?
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
she's very avoidant today
8ball do you like how you look
LMFAO that's sooooo cute
<:life:1001518241610485781>
encroaching on aka's turf
oh i'm SO down
do you have the item that gives +3 reset?
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196> true
i would actually be hype for some chapter where nothing happen and they just chill out
yeah me neither, the cast is so fucking good
i didn't think we'd see another master rule this soon, and not 3rd
i dunno why even though i know it's udul i expect it to go slower
meaning is a really important one, so it wouldn't surprise me if he was n1
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
ohhh that's pretty sick
rip become double unemployed
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196> true
luck is like 5 right?
yeah that is true
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
tf happens if change dies?
like they can't really kill a master rule... right?
i wonder what even is going to be the angle for fighting them
kinda crazy that luck is one then
yeah that makes more sense
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
it is juiz, yeah
nice <:Okk:1101008973412438106>
you didn't sign up for the bot so it didn't extract that message of yours
unexpected good test case
oh shit
someone please
send a message
arcy kys
i still have lots to do
sounds good

if you know how to do channel id, that would be best
like i don't wanna take message from <#963279962163540038> or else gresham would be $ma
but if you want to, could you make a list of all the chat in here that the bot should make message from?
it might be too much work so you don't have to if you don't want to
saying arcy kys now kills her
arcy kys
can you still do stuff
tet are you around
you're a cunny magnet tet
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
ain't no fucking way
or <@416445660443967491>
<@309634550273933314> can you give arcy <#963613297943412756> perms
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>

good girl
:(
me
nevermind you don't need my advice
oh shit you're in in already <:caught:1175079388874805351>
yeah
well you gotta decide by yourself if you wanna do serious things but if you do and she's a nice lady you should go for it
he'll be like pulling every valk 2s for fun from now on
that is probably just true
<a:despairgamba:1114542929625755718>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
8ball can aqua afford to continue top up 50 dollar per day
makes sense
i mean i'm assuming someone you know irl then
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
okay arcy's on the case
8ball is cherry making up a Her to sound cool?
true
alright
so like i only know her name or something
8ball do i know cherrys crush
is she here
is that like a current crush
:3c hmmm
8ball should me and eli make out like there's no tomorrow
i have no clue who pahsiv is btw
LMFAO
ayo she's my child
i swear the pahsivs are not tied to cherry mentions
definitely tsun
8ball am i worthy of love
eli do this
but like i don't judge if that's all that it is <:caught:1175079388874805351>
it is weird tho
maybe you should make it clear that it's just hc? i dunno tho
yeah i don't think hc someone as different sexuality is bad if the reason is that you wanna fuck them <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
oh ok, i mean that's a little autistc but i would've felt flattered
if they have the slightest jew ancestry
i think israel just pays people to go live there
yeah i think he's using israel funds
oh okay
is this like your answer if i've been a good girl or are you rping what aqua would answer if i asked him
he's got infinite ego when he's like aight at the game
arrogant guy at maincord
goddamn it
ew really?
8ball have i been a real good girl
you're He/Him
you were never he/him
there you go cherry
<a:GIGACHAD:999060597247320095> thanks pahsiv
8ball am i Him
oops
8bal am i Him
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
my bad
i guess you gotta when i'm around cherry
why me?
8ball should  cherry worry this much about pronouns?
that's fair i guess
8ball am i she/her
start trying neopronouns next
8ball can i use they/them for you
oof
arcy got personalised pronouns
to me, i guess
he tells the truth
8ball does aqua lie about his pulls
fuck did i fuck something up
and also even though i know how she works, everytime she answers something weirdly i go
even though i coded her i'm still very invested
it is really funny that like
the fuck does that mean
8ball is cunny just cunny
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i think cunny is just cunny
<:ohnobirb:948935560091807744>
8ball are you sure
...out?
uhhhh
8ball should i date someone
it really doesn't
okay what would those tricks entail
if anyone has ideas i can teach her new tricks
yeah i just started teaching her tricks
it's okay you don't have to help, it's just if people want
also anyone is free to dm me more 8ball answers and i can add to the options, it's very quick
i'll figure out something later when i'm bored and if no one took that up
i'm leaving that stuff first take first serve for now, you don't have to if you don't want to
you heard her cherry
no $
i'll take it
8ball am i going to live long?
yeah one of the 2 for sure
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
8ball is my face cute
i'm a red bird
i do
this is so easy
she doesn't even have a face
got it
no aros in chat
8ball am i aromantic?
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
holy shit my update command worked first try
so true
TRUE
8ball should i unretire from gi3 for px2
the fact that she knows how to speak is my doing
so like everything she knows how to say is tet's job
well
everything she knows how to do i taught her
yeah i'm her mother
i can't confirm or deny
i'll take it
8ball am i a fucking BEAST?
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
they seem to care very deeply about shit like that
i wouldn't be surprised honestly
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
it would suck in a this is extremely weird way
even if it sucks, it won't suck in a this is badly made and unmemorable way
i don't think whatever kojima does can fail at this point though
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> <:jphPlus2:1062420906720366632>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
something else entirely, but like also existing stuff that is new but you already know
and like some game, or not
or maybe less
and the way he was talking about his next game, that will be even more movie
less movie than david cage game are
i wouldn't say it's all movie, it's like
<a:therehego:1183176161996570664>
kinda funny tho, every time someone show up on stage and they don't look frantic about saving time you already know it's an ad
how is best score/music a throwaway award and best adaptation not
like what the fuck <:caught:1175079388874805351>
and then go back to ads
at one point they stop the ads just to rush through like 4 award
as it got closer to goty award i just cringe more and more as they kept cramming in more and more ads for fun
game awards was fucking 30% awards what even the fuck
also yeah that's was fucking embarassing
kojima names fucking slap lowkey
one of characters is called like Die Hardman
and mc name is literally Sam Porter Bridges <a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
like the game about you making connections between people and delivering packages
it's always so fucking on your face too
i think it's definitely charming to a degree from how much it feels like he doesn't filter what he actually wants to do
death stranding is like weird indie concept but somehow he get AAA funding for it <:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
i think the thing about kojima is how he isn't afraid to do some deeply weird shit on AAA budget
and if the reward was to be given to game that release the worst and is now aight it should've gone to nms
yeah, that was fucking wild
and idk which it is for gta <:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
where it goes from this is a very high value game to there is something going terribly poorly in development
there is a tipping point on how long a game is taking to release
<a:BOOBA:825140785820991530>
blue period chapter also dropped
:quoatwalk:
i'm hungry....
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
his cock is so fucking hard for luna in specific what the fuck
<a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
holy shit
LMFAO
oh that's a good amount actually
and they still get 4 line to share
idk it feels like 3 somehow in genshin
2s valk is now like 145 instead of 180 avg
7.3 is alr first ever triple valk patch
maybe 12-13 valk per year
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
just mean that they'll prob release more valk going forward
to me the fact that they made standard valk rank up + gear cheaper
i dunno
by a pretty good margin
they did make pulling valk rank cheaper though
but people think about being able to get sig stig without pulling and they <a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
to me, that mechanic is just bait
but it cost the same resource as upgrading stig
the other change people are <a:Explode:1025665382599630848> about is that all stig is going to be craftable
and it's going to be really bad for later new player trying to catch up
complicating the system for fun
i don't think it's that bad in realistic term, my main 2 problem is just
yeah for people already playing it's a neutral change
i think h2 you can barely afford 50/50/50 on avg
so now you can scale down your investment to h1 or h2
h3 50/50/50 is about same price as 4/4 currently
realistically speaking they just added lower spending tier
so 3 weapon in total, 2 dupes
it start at h1 alr
2 dupes
so it's cheaper for normal valk
on avg
it's between sp 4/4 and normal 4/4
nah
yeah like i said it's just a whole new gear system
but at h3 it won't matter
if you're h1 player you won't be able to afford maxing stigs, 45/45/45 gaming
but you also get a fuckton of dupes by pulling for weapon, especially cause of weapon refinement
so you gotta get rid of dupes <:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
on avg you don't get enough per patch to max all the new stig
and the only way to get it is limited amount per patch or salvaging dupe p2 stigs
so like, they're adding a new resource to level up the new stigs
it's just literally another system entirely
the new gear system works so differently from the old one that it's really hard to think about it as changes though
cause like you could just spend the xtal you save on the next banner with gear you actively want
if we're stuck with offrate, we'd rather them be good, but if you could pull in no off-rate banner you always would
i mean ideally thinking offrate is never really a good thing
droprate on the weapon is the same
the other change (prism + weapon refinement) balance it out, for new player it'll be kinda cbt
missing out on offrate ain't that big of a deal
i mean with no other change, that just makes it so getting gear would be turbo cheap now
<:5Head:783626223204827136>
yes but not because of that by itself
yes
in that banner, the only 4* gear you can get is the uprate gear from that banner
gear from 7.3 onwards will have a different banner
exactly what it says <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<a:therehego:1183176161996570664>
<:HandsUp:465017146955661312>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:buddy:936669824807993504>
yes but he's a buddy
you got like poe minecraft mod?
uncommon wooden pickaxe?
i guess her character arc would end up pretty similar to senti
can you imagine if we had a little shapeshifter valk corruptie walking around
we could have corruptie <:sajj:1067071714518892584>
i think a lot of stuff went right there
i don't mind that retcon cause ER arc is definitely my favorite
that too, ER stuff definitely feels added in later
like apho is just too much content and too much detail for it to not be fill with plot hole by the time they reach that with mainstory
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331> <:jphPlus2:1062420906720366632>
the moment they decide for some reason that apho is mainstory canon
it was already fucking doomed wasn't it
yeah, i don't really mind that stuff too much though cause like
captain is the only negator
oh shit true
yeah that's fucking giga stupid but alright
or is like only the player surprised
wait so are the rest of the planet being inhabited by just random ass normal human a surprise to everyone else in the mainstory as well?
but i mean i guess it's fine probably
that shit sounds like a retcon to me
i never thought about how fucking funny something like
there's life in outer space in this game
oh so aliens?
no
that's funny as fuck i'll allow it
people
the sky people are just
ain't no fucking way
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
and why is earth special
how did they even get there in the first place
are like just human in other planet or what
like is it just normal that every planet is inhabited but all the story happen in earth and we never really talk about it?
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
what's up with other planets in honkai lore
okay
thanks you 2 helped a lot
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
nevermind
no i mean
fake vita
isn't that not even the real one?
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
where she come from
who the fuck is vita
okay anyone wanna catch me up on honkai lore
who
release a boss that is just the valk but she looks better
they're kinda brave honestly
<:life:1001518241610485781>
gaa2 was when i locked in me quitting from genshin
so true
idk where i got the p from
was it the gap event
that's sick actually
is she over the chuuni?
wait did she get any character development
you think there's someone that has legit schizo but it manifest as a twitch chat in their brain
type 1 in chat
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
thoughts ?
after some character development even
could call a battlesuit or something
they should make a better yae, maybe release a new character of her
yeah it's fucking crazy <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
for fun
LE feels like you have +20 ping
and old honkai valk are shit to play
i'm pretty sure early honkai we didn't really have qte ca ult support
does that mean in 2 year genshin will start to get flashing button gameplay
wait if both game start with awkward gameplay valk
holy shit true
you can only ca in certain point of attack string
i mean that sounds kinda sick mechanic if it was lean into it
oh wait actually <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
both hands?
even ants
all, even
most bugs are caused by how it's coded
you gotta like read the stars to figure out how long you have to hold attack for an actual ca to come off
like klee anicancel is just 300% harder cause the valk just won't do the shit you want her to do
like why
to this day
that we don't have a ca keybind
i can't fucking believe
no diff
open a youtube video or smth
just like
is there even a point to mod gsr
modding <a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i mean ye it's not a new concept
probably not right
do you think a no pull genshin thing would be fun
36* abyss is only a challenge nowadays if you're doing some fucked up challenge run like no pull acc
groundbreaking
so much work put into accessibility, if you wanna jack off you can play with one hand and if you only have one hand you can even play with no hand
<a:TheVoices:1143681011272659015>
the most i can do is hallucinate a competitive scene
i'm not built to look at new valk and jack off to her booba
i mean what else are you supposed to do
guess i know what i have to do
alright
or cum?
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
lowkey tho aren't all of them pretty alright
if i see the face they have i would go insane <a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
what if they dropped mora
they're mostly just chillin outside of cities
i mean assuming same genshin lore
personally
would you be fine killing them
if hilichurl were real irl
all traveller are shit except [most recent one]
isn't that always the true
they should let you say no and just alt f4 the game
jiayou's home
that's from café quanta
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
like every event start with you going to the middle of nowhere and someone look at you and go what a coincidence! we needed you here!
i don't really get how traveller daily life work
yeah okay cause that's how it felt <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
like timeline-wise, mostly <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
this one?
<:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
<:poggfrenn:1087713199215886377>
do the lore for genshin event even make sense
it just is the way it is
so sad that the writers have no control over that
you should try outscoring this guy
that blows
there's valk specific achievement?
and idk which is worst
or 40% of His funds is going to coin and valk xp chip
either He's lying and His luck is avg
i said before
i think you're playing with aqua rates
:ta:
<a:RAGEY:1002384343622221885>
tet do you think you could recognise a valk from her armpit
if i grow huge boobs do you think i can get discount on rent cause she'll be too scared to deny
but for heki
these are like firing rent lowering shots
get it? hands up? armpit police?
hands up
<:peepogun:824976159925338112>
i'm the armpit police
i think?
dpe raises her hands
HoF is snapping
like yelan is literally just i'm gonna show my armpit to the world for fun
nah i wouldn't count that as HoF armpit
lots of colors
idk honestly i can't see shit on trio gameplay
oh true i remember something like that
look at the competition, yelan
okay being able to see their armpit doesn't make them an armpit valk
like i see it but she ain't the arm pit valk people are asking for
to me she's like jean for armpit
i can kinda see END being armpit i guess
sounds good
bke parry = ram into the enemy
everyone else is just hold block
and the only parry valk that actually parry in the game
i like her crit bald
let me be
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
those toes look like fingers
i'm a big delta fan
genshin has yelan
we need an armpit valk
old gen feet valk can be hov/sirin
like new gen feet valk
nah in my mind griseo is definitely the feet valk
i could see it ig
but like
hov has some good feet
she's like boomers feet valk
i mean i kinda see it
really?
i mean honestly tho she's the feet valk no
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
they know what they're doing
okay it's even unclean
i have nyx
you should do it on my account
i saw someone going what even is the point of a ceasefire, israel wouldn't benefit from it so they wouldn't follow it
like any big news subreddit is just filled with zionist for fun
i have stopped reading comments on random reddit posts because of that too
he keeps getting muted but he isn't banned yet
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
or He's spending 40% of His funds on coins and valk xp chip
either He's not that lucky
there's only 2 possible world
the one and only i get 4/4 for 20 pull everytime but somehow my topup still the avg amount of xtal for the valk i have
spa was good value and more expensive <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
yeah i mean
oh spa killer right?
what is she again
is it even possible for 2023 valk that cost 50 pull to be low value
lowkey though
hn is the second closest for being dps
this is unironically the only sp valk that i wouldn't blame someone if they skip if their acc isn't setup for it
pushing for people to go all in on the support valk that only support 2 valk
and now he's
is this the same guy that was complaining about sirin being too niche for a valk that you only need to pull weapon
jesus fucking christ
just let me see the fight please
just so they didn't close up on their face every ult and make me throw up
like i would love if all my favorite valk in genshin were a-rank
it's true for genshin even more
they make animation that takes 5 second and go <a:WHAT:1108876595546050610> when it loses you -20 points
timestop is just fixing problem mihoyo created
i don't care that much tbh
i mean
not full i guess
she's like the first a-rank timestop no
oh i forgot abyss existed
i don't really care there's no spending less time than the timestop ult
aw man
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
does she spend negative time
needs less field time than ly ult my guy what
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
when are we going to get the recognition we deserve as an artform eli
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
trying to say everything they want to in 20 seconds
like seeing the people go accept award and see them genuinely nervous
it was hard to watch for me honestly
the first time someone got played off in 20 seconds
i thought it was a bit honestly
yeah!!! like what the fuck man
like it was worse than last years
it was actually insane wasn't it
the actual game that won each award was fine but i think they forgot it's an award ceremony
that sucked
oh i finished watching the game awards!
<a:peepoTalk:989369389281329223>
like what the fuck is even the point you know? saw would be like you've lived a life of laziness and obsession and i'll be like my guy i'm just a random ass autistc 22 y/o you pick from the street this isn't the philosophical W you think it is
i don't think i'd give up but i would be pissed the entire time
saw trap design
cause like you'd send something like HELP and your friend goes haha i was really funny instead of helping
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
nevermind
but they just sent a really funny joke
and sending your friend a message
can you imagine getting murdered
<a:NOOO:844609807675162685>
weird
huh that's familiar to me for some reason
ssword purana mb shui that's moon language
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
maybe them making all stig craftable is to stop people from do that
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
it's the bronya skin with the cute shield but her clothes make me uncomfortable
jesus christ
because there's 40k games of it
is it called warhammer 40k
or abelcore idr which is which
caincore
i just wanted to nessie out
my bad
oops you were doing a thing
<a:nessieWalk:1182778217183068232>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
i odn't understand that
what
especially heartsteel since you kinda need to lose by a little to get those giga cashout
even still tho kinda impressive
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
oh okay
how does game like that even happen lowkey
<:ICANTTAKETHISANYMORE:1154037205082320947>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> you know what you're right
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
did they forget that the game awards is an award show
okay be honest
is the hello kitty game good?
it's genuinely hard to watch literally everyone getting played off the stage
this years scheduling is really rough tho and that one is squarely their fault
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and the kid going up on stage could be prevented but also only so much their fault <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
like last time with the 8 minute speech from kratos va, that's not game awards fault probably
i mean to a degree i think it's inevitable some fucked up stuff
my guys are saying 3 words and getting played off cmon
who thought it was a good idea to give every acceptance speech a time limit of 5 seconds
okay this years game awards is SO fucking awkward
oh new game from ori studio? no furries though
<:jphPlus2:1062420906720366632>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i think i would kms
would you be down
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
also the new game from dead cells dev has some cool furry designs, the bat looks cute
the new-persona-but-not-really looks interesting
some cool announcements on preshow
i'm still watching the game awards <:caught:1175079388874805351>
the only 2 real item are gunblade and dcap there
i've never seen half of those items though
how come i build it every game then
<a:SCHIZO:1042907357249802310>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
sword + rod
it never left?
are we pivoting?
baldurs gate?
fuck yeah
i'll let you know my thoughts as it happens, as if it was happening right now
i'm almost getting to the game awards stream section
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
isn't that leak genshin site a monster hunter thing primarily?
i see, that makes sense
i wanna doomscroll reddit for a bit but it keep spoiling me game awards shit
gsr open world?
so like
was it not already open world
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
yes
i think i would enjoy monster hunter
and it was interesting
i played monster hunter for poor people at one point
cool i guess
oh
modern harfare?
what's mh6
alan wake 2 fucking slapped
is it a given
i'm gonna watch a vod of my streamer
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
nevermind
okay no spoilers
how come i sleep through everything
wait game awards already happened?
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
same take as eli here, i think it's pretty niche
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
<:HandsUp:465017146955661312>
chill out
next week
next year is like
did it bleed?
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
how
what happen to it
that's not good
i respect it honestly
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
aw man
your taxi
yeah i wouldn't know
o ic
i mean i don't think it's an improvement but it changed very little
discord ui update isn't that bad tho
<a:TheVoices:1143681011272659015>
i also do like how in the new equipment page, the stig is way bigger
her stigs are v pretty tho
nice
pure ego
this is what i'm talkin about
<a:LETSFUCKINGGO:1012872161763008602>
idk tho maybe std boss is too cbt without her
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
she might be like the first sp valk which i wouldn't find it weird if someone skip, if their acc doesn't have hn/lk2
ain't si2 pretty niche
that's a lot of mental gymnastics tho
like what
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
didn't he go like i'm bored so i put $100 on bchip
actually yeah maybe
how the fuck is he always lucky but his top up is avg luck
to balance it out
go 400 pull dry on the pull he doesn't mention
does he like
<a:SCHIZO:1042907357249802310>
oh you know
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
do you want me to use my aqua senses
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
oh is he hs
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i'd just leave
for 50 minutes longer
why you staying in class
idk why people got disinterest on him overnight
yeah i'm not sure what happened to destiny, the little i still see of him he's still as bad as he ever was <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
wrong one eli <:caught:1175079388874805351>
i dunno
i don't get it
poki calls someone a broke boy and it's huge drama, destiny could tell a viewer to off themselves and it's a tuesday
the poki cookie drama is the most stupid drama i think i ever seen
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
he could have a character in game
i go that's kinda lowball for xqc
yeah no joke i look at that and i don't go 1 million that's a lot
december 2025
isn't that shit coming out on like
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i'm ace but i would suck y'all dick
i understand that one
i hate elon and elon fan but unironically based
like i get it they're bootlickers but to THAT degree i don't get it
i don't get why so much cop cocksucking
that shit unironically still has me stumped
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i can't it's not right
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i definitely was

<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
i think they're fucking with us
i lowkey don't think december is a real month
oh no they're french
it's okay you're always welcome we love you
oh hi carv

unironically the same image
my guy is high
what the fuck did they do to the add reaction button
like in a good way?
current gender: confused
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
tet doesn't ask
i'm proud of her
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i thought you were gresham
wait what the fuck
still a downgrade though
it isn't that bad
okay the animations look nice
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
booba physics on genshin valk select tho
was really needing that
they added an option so you can see your valk like it's genshin
oh thank god
so you can zoom in at her feet
just camera mode for valk
appreciation mode <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>

what would you like to eat for dinner, baby?
aw that's cute
<:ICANT:995593696030507099>
lumi you're like diet heki to me
i'm down i'll make a sandwich for us
i'm down to tryhard scooby doo mmo
that would go hard
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
you shouldn't believe me idk what's going on on honkai
idk i'm just making shit up for fun
aw man <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
i can't even go in to take a few last screenshot
is the game down then
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
aren't they like removing it for astral ring soon
why is elf even that high
the order is fucked up
oh wait yeah
did it happen already
wait what the fuck
that is probably objectively true though, you're just way hornier than me
60% is gambling odds
60% sure
i'm like
i'm the original one btw
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i'll make sure hbomberguy has a section on you for his next plagiarism video
what is this angle even
ruby post it earlier
like
andrew tate also came out against shooting cops in video games
yeah that's what i'm fucking talkin about <:caught:1175079388874805351>
i think this might count for fetish art
i think that's the biggest booba i've seen for non-fetish art
backproblems-chan
jesus christ
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
shooting cops is bad was not one of them
like 100 possible issue i could think they could have with gta 6
they're definitely hard to predict
you can say anything about alt right weirdo
<:peepogun:824976159925338112> <a:Cops:998961270420160512>
i didn't take oyu as one
are you a gta-er
isn't that lux from set 9
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
<a:SCHIZO:1042907357249802310>
kinda based i guess
?
are you like opinion dismissed you consume alcohol
what
i know that post
she's chronically online but for normies?
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
any translator in chat? <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
gotta give it to Him honestly
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
tf2 having a normal one
ewwww who the fuck are those guys
i wanna get the discord update
<a:PU_pepeHmmMath:850331115637833728>
whenever a new valk release he reads all his kit and can immediately tell how good she is from the numbers alone
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
is a song now
youtube music decided that this 14 minute essay i liked
horse or uterus to tell what kinda person you are
it's like those blob tests
yeah i thought eli was saying that you look like sonic and knuckles child
oh
what
she is a kind lady
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
eli if you're only a figment of my imagination and i love you does that mean you trick me into love myself
uhmm like uh
we all know and love
the person eli that we know and love
eli is so funny right guys
haha good one eli
ohio isn't real either? i could've guessed that
yeah i do think that's a little weird
but no
i thought he would say the first based thing of his life
it started so promising with i'm not a fan of anyone under 18, 21
holy cocksucking
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> it's so weird to me how gta are like real places
no, a more accurate would be
🍎🍎🍎🍎 a coder will ask for apple 3 and get mad at you when you hand them the 3rd apple
:quotawalk:
unless?
and we can't have that
i guess that's fair if it was ymas it could be confused with yurimas
oh nvm then
i forgot the alphabet for a sec
xmas2
i mean ahead
like one letter behind
oh i get it, instead of xmas it's ymas
i'm okay i think
i think i care less about it now
oh ok
or is this xmas special
every xmas
is yaoimas like
spongebob already did this bit
if it's just the icon i don't mind
it doesn't look too bad though <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
oh didn't show up here yet
there's a discord update?
tell score range with every comp by calcing atk what the fuck is He talking about
in my fucking life
i've never heard such bullshit
i can go eepy
it's <:joever:1122752199752163419>
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
nah i have to record a video about it now
it's another android app
i wanna figure out a cute icon for it though
okay i finally finished the project
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i went to check if today was oshi no ko
you baited me
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
head hurts
i need to finish this project and sleep hard
i'll prob end up reading tomorrow
and people try to gaslight me into think it means the feel when
i know like tfw that means the face when
i never heard that before
oh i see
except for valk name but that is so the barrier to entry to the game is higher
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
i write all my words with all letters cause i don't pay per character
are you from the future?
tomorrow?
what if i do
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
oh idc
that's kinda scary
well not because it's a bad name but if it was i wouldn't make it my username
fuck no
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
but then you keep scrolling
professor will look at this and go oh that's so nice she woke up early to do it
honestly more power to him though
<:ICANT:995593696030507099>
i need to learn from him
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
what a beast
holy shit
couldn't he clear that before asking for more
or like anything at all
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
if he has so much on ptr already
i mean like
why do they want more then
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
oh
do you know that many
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i can't think of any
yeah that's a mind racker
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that's kinda sick honestly
<a:elmoburn:645931314155094026>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
ain't worth your time really
dunno if i have more input than just block them if they don't listen to you
i forgot you're australian for a bit
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
that's kinda cringe
alright i'll say it
if anything it's so they can't complain later
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
i mean if they don't care then you shouldn't care either
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
and if they don't you block em
like make an ultimatum if you don't move this kind of convo to a more private chat or dms i'll block you
but there's other stuff you could try first if you want
you could definitely do that
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
to a whole ass server?
like in a group chat?
i dunno why it's a normal thing to say it's weird as hell
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
yes
and like those 2 actions are unrelated
well i guess they could be pregnant
nothing good
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
there's some there i wanna have a closer look
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
:meandyou:
and there's only way i'll give it back
you know who else stole from someone
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
people still kill each other for fun though
but there's none of the social deduction stuff
it definitely has amongus vibes
it's a pretty good stream game, proximity chat and can balance well trying to be scary but also having some memey content
it's from lethal company, new kinda horror game, you have weekly money quota you need to meet by salvaging items from like abandoned factories? in different planets
if you want the full background to it
that's my nightly prayer to keep the heki away
ruby do this irl
fart courtesy of tet i want one
that kinda slaps
:parkour:
oh like a parkour one? my sister play those a lot

until one day i go to the bathroom during online class and my cat raise my hand for me
i was definitely one of those that was like okay i'm sure cats can do some shit but i doubt it happens that often where they send message for you and shit
that's how i type too
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
sad it's not real life
i'm sad about shooting cop in video games too
i'm thinking about how a lot of my favorite games are about doing crimes
<:MAN:994826750515236974>
i mean no he does fucking insane drugs every day
actual inhuman
didn't like doing crime who the fuck says that
even if by accident
god i hate when people i hate are funny
LMFAOOOOO
<a:peepoTrip:755692813320060959>
like keys jangled in your face
shit just keeps happening and you keep being surprised
if you think about it it's all plot twist if you have no media literacy
but okay
like as a term
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> i feel like that isn't helpful at all
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
the only plot twist i could think from chainsaw man is i thought it would be bad and it was good
that's kinda wild
is that really true
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
anyone knows wtf is the plot twist in chainsaw man
and their answer was the plot twist
so i asked what they enjoyed about chainsaw man to give better recommendation
i recommended chainsaw man to someone and they enjoyed it and asked for more recommendation
okay someone help me out here
at least 8th trailer honestly
you need to wait until like

i'll read p much anything if it's good
i just like well written stuff
but i mean i wouldn't say i have any genre or theme preference
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i dunno what's your definition of psychological stuff
sounds interesting
i might take a look <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>

i'm sure that's already a thing
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
wait you think i can make a request for furry manga at r/manga
i respect it honestly
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
do we get commission if we get people hooked on those streams
it's just permanently there, tainted by ff16
and like to this day it never went away
a streamer i watch played ff16 and it put that warning over his stream for mature themes
i don't really get it either <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
there's like infinite just chatting streamer trying to be her at like less than 3 digit viewer
getting there still ain't easy
i mean you say that
10k views?
oh thank god i'll memorise it so i don't click it by accident
holy fuck
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
jesus christ that stream
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
what would past eli say about you skipping si2
is fucking
jesus christ that tweet he qrt

i have no clue what the fuck is going on

<a:PopcornMunch:751417674277322834>
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
and the devs said something like yeah we don't look at that anymore, the information was really useful but it doesn't really change
runescape added a button where you can say if you enjoyed playing or not before you log off
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
be honest do you think anyone reads that shit
irl pogged at this
i need a padoru
i mean probably
i dunno either
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i'm really angry
my mom is definitely the one that wants to smoke the most
like between me, my mom and my siblings
that's a lie actually she wants to try it out
i'd never my mom would beat me up
<a:peepoTrip:755692813320060959>
i feel like they'd pop instead
you think animal crossing character could get high
<a:peepoTrip:755692813320060959>
i hate the smell of it
idk how to help, you can talk more about it if you want, you shouldn't feel bad if you don't want to put more effort in tho i think
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
i see
do you care about putting more effort in?
oh i mean
are you scared of plagiarising right now?
i dunno if i get it
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
is your feet cow branded now
is it like
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
always has been
my mind went fucking boom
when he said that illuminaughti was the one that was behind it
but not really
somewhat
when it was happening
i followed that legaleagle drama
also did you get to the next part? after illuminaughti
wdym <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
it's all fucking marketing bullshit though i couldn't be paid to care
there's also currently a discipline i'm taking where the only words i've ever written for it were chatgpt queries
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
oh i've definitely plagiarised a fuckton for like highschool work and stuff
i'm like half expecting for a section to end and then the next section he goes KEILO <a:terigrabhic:709594728039055390>
i have a lot of impostor syndrome
it's making me a little anxious actually
while trying to figure out why people do it in the first place
this one is about plagiarism so he's just calling out a bunch of creator who plagiarised works
oh his stuff is great, maybe not something you'd be interested in though
i'm watching hbomberguy's new 4 hour video which is kinda about cowards
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
that's also true
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i mean to a degree these kink only really work if you have enough confidence i think?
i guess that's still humiliation though
i think if anything i'm more into humiliating than being humiliated
i mean maybe
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i don't think i'm into it but i find it entertaining
it did look interesting
aw did it?
idk i didn't watch it
which was supposed to be kinda like that
oh i guess there was nagatoro
but i think it's one of the ones
probably not the only one
like something that actually own up to it instead of just having it as a sidepiece
i guess i'm glad it got pick up, i think it's missing in the market <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
oh that's interesting
is this that the one humiliation fetish manga?
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
so <:shrug:877047647511384064>
but like he's also elon musk
i'd say probably since he's rich, someone can deal with that for him
idk
that guy is not fine
and i'm not even joking
there is a non-0% chance he might off himself
and he STILL fucks up THIS hard
just sucking his cock for 2 minutes
the interview begins with a 2 minute slideshow about why elon musk is a beast
literally the chillest calmest interview you could ever get, trying to pain him on a good light SO hard
the interviewer is trying to softball him
you can tell just how hard
if you made a sketch like that people would go haha you went a little far though
it's actually cartoonishly incompetent
okay lemme find the one instead of describing it
at the very start of the interview, elon goes like
wait there is a funnier clip
we have no plan, the current plan is for us to fail. good luck
and looking at this interview and elon is just like
can you imagine being like a shareholder in any elon company
he's fucked up
look at how he moves his head, his hands
like look at him in that clip
there is just no way he isn't unwell
and elon just go i mean you didn't pay so <:shrug:877047647511384064>
and then later the interviewer ask if twitter was purposefully throttling nyt
the funniest part is that elon is like babbling about how disney not paying him is a breach on his freedom of speech
0 reaction from anything he said except nervous laughter from the go fuck yourself part
negative charisma
there's an audience, too
it's actually hard to watch
cutting off the interviewer
and elon just fucking <a:SCHIZO:1042907357249802310> immediately after
literally like elon says some stupid shit and the interviewer is like okay i'll forgive you bestie just please say something reasonable next? like cmon darling?
to butter elon up
SO hard
like the interviewer is trying
okay my bad
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
retarded?
like people have said before on tesla they had people specifically hired to babysit elon
as far as we know from insider info, that's just how he is
maybe both
he actually looks either high on something or having a mental breakdown
a bigger clip from that part
actually insane
did you see his fucking nyt interview
nah
just now?
he is not well
having a mental breakdwon
he is legit unironically
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
why is he suffering on fast 9 meta
wasn't he a beast at going fast 8
<a:NAHHH:1120795949099384963>
what did i miss
just woke up
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i respect it
<a:GIGACHAD:999060597247320095> \*is wrong* No.
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> okay my bad
oh i see
is nah i'd win like weeb marvel quote?
i'm gonna be honest i don't fully get that meme but i think i agree?
she really is
people start to show up as their fate get decided to watch on the last few matches
emily, rayditz and frodan are the usual
they are pretty fun, he just watch party the people about to be eliminated right before elimination
are you watching boxbox bootcamp streams?
he's lower than boxbox
oh no
you got me
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
definitely yuri
not in a meaningful way, at least
i wouldn't categorise blue period as slice of life
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
yes it's about art
you should read blue period <:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
i know you don't take recommendations but i'll still say it so you can ignore it
dreams probably, that's how your pfp and role color look like
i think you'd enjoy it
tet have you read blue period
o i mean ye
i posted the real game <:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
oh that is sick
yeah crush as in i want to fuck that mothman
wait can a vn be a ttrpg? like there's no table <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
oh ttrpg
it's a dating vn i think
you could say something like oh i love your game! i downloaded it through here though 
if you wanna fuck with them
and it's free
it looks cute
i also found the real game
the download link on that site is a link to a file that is uploaded to discord
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
okay i'm going to eat now cyall later
oh thank god i'll be meaner then
porn sfm looking ass
i'll be kinder to you
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
like bully in a good way?
just a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> starving
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> cherry isn't starving to death
he is bing and he is chilling?
what
i guess it's obvious that i'm weird but it's hard to pinpoint how weird i am, i don't think people had those convo around me <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i'm down to try i guess
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
like a cherry ouija board for women?
i think i like pretty hair
see no one asked me this before i don't have an answer for that
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i feel like no one ever come up to me and went what's your type
is that a normal conversation to have?
don't do that either
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
that's dangerous
don't do that tai
i'm special like that
i think i could get away with never choosing
you really think so
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
just easier to leave it open honestly
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
that's kinda scary
can you imagine like having to choose?
i don't think i could have the balls to not be pan
those are my general tickboxes yeah
pale skin, fangs, long dress, chainsaw
i definitely have a girl preference i think <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
that sounds like bullshit but okay
it's probably a full anime if it's taking that long right
is it a full anime? i don't even know what it is tbh
i forgot about that
oh yeah
bosoms
CUM ASS PUSSY WOOOOOOOOO
i just don't have much to add for honkai talk
maybe i should show up more often <:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
we put 10 ace people in a room and told them there's 9 normal people and 1 ace and they have to fit in, this is what happens
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
2nd horniest honkai server after solstice -> half the people are either ace or aro
i believe you though, i think that's more rough than what i have
which is like fair
is that so? i mean i only seen you lusting for like anime boy booba
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333> it's probably fine isn't it
you don't have to answer if it's tmi i'm just curious
do you think you're ace?
you're like ,.. bossbaby but for gay men
<:peepoHandsUp:1002644855593381898>
just end it all on the spot honestly
shoot me honestly
like when you make a great joke and people go lmao and then you say some stupid shit and people go LMFAOAOAOAOAOA
do you also hate that
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
you know i think i have covid
i'm hungry
go for it
honestly you still might have time ruby
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
from my experience, heki flirting is ew, no thanks
it's very fun
i do really love flirting
it's not serious advances either so don't worry about it
you don't have to it's ok
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
like lowkey it makes me a little sad
honestly it's usually a joke but i'm starting to get a little offended by how repulsed heki is by me
<@781539392039682058>
like i understood right until that message
i don't get it
i mean ace and aro are 2 different thing hak, one is sexual attraction and the other is romantic attraction
i guess that's fair
it's not like i really dated before, realistically speaking <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i dunno if i'm all the way to aromantic though, but i mean maybe
don't you have a bf though? is it fine if it's on discord for you? <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i mean i guess that makes it more straightforward
it's even weirder cause like obviously it's all furry shit too <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah maybe <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i mean that doesn't sound like fwb tai, that sounds like only benefit
idk how my asexuality is though cause i like i do read porn a lot <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
nice
you cum and it's like +10lp
can you imagine
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333> yeah idk how well fwb works
like 2-3 maybe 4
i don't think i'm aro but i'm frequently kinda worried about looking for relationships cause i feel like 90% of peeps have some sexual drive and idk if i care enough about that stuff for it to work out <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
there was like a blankie in between our mouths tho so no touching <:caught:1175079388874805351>
my cousin once brought me into a room when i was like 7 so she could train french kissing on me, that's about the most interesting story i have
are you thinking about marriage ruby?
that's not good guys
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
you don't have to if you don't want to, i didn't think about if we're counting harassment or not
cherry is like those sign language interpreter but for how you should feel about messages
new underarc lore hakcer got sexually harassed
at the point i am in my life it doesn't really matter much if i am or not so i don't really bother to think about it i think
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
i dunno i probably am
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
you think so?
it wasn't that fun
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i really haven't

i'm going to get a fucking 100 full clear

<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

okay thanks for the nahida cp lore hak
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331> again
that doesn't surprise me honestly
<a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206>
lets do it as a bonding exercise
share
i'll take it too
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i removed the wrong persons message
OH SHIT
i shouldn't have shared it
my bad

<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
we could plot it
to see how it changed
we should do that again this year
like a day before xmas eve you decided to figure out how degen you are?
tf were you doing
damn gresham got receipts
not a lot of options if you wanna make a furry one
the only acronym with F is sf, fr and fs <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
it's kind of a stretch <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
second-rate furry 2
i don't remember that
okay what do you think of sf2 for her
oh okay, thanks
<:life:1001518241610485781>
shonen protagonist backstory
he is a pussy
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
why did you calculate it in norway krone?
he's italian in israel?
i don't think we'll see Him cook about px2 until like 4 weeks from now when mihoyo release the first official gameplay
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i dunno why i search car first and saw that's not enough and then i went what about a house then
that's exciting
he's like halfway to a car though!
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
he's not really close
6.1m kroner
my current tabs
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
would you?
i mean yeah, it's maybe scary for him if he can't afford it but like if he wants to be 2s+ player then that's just how it costs <:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
you can buy like 2 3s valk
like for the price you can back pull every valk s0
lowkey tho we joke that he spend a lot but that's just how much 2s+ valk actually cost
heavy day of drinking for that animal
that cat is fucked up
sure
He pulled His credit card out 50 times?
i'm so sorry
he pulled his credit card out 50 times?
i mean no one can pull 500k xtal and not be average
so like 2k pull on those <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
if he pay full price for those too
so like another 800 pull for all the gear?
i used to know these number by heart
and then for gear, how much was it for 4/4?
1170 pull for valk
owo math 290 + 240 + 170 + 170 + 100 + 100 + 100
- 2s2 - 290 pull
- 2s1 - 240 pull
- 2s - 170 pull
- s2 - 100 pull

from valk alone if he pay full price for those it's 290 + 240 + 170 + 170 + 100 + 100 + 100
okay lemme pull up my calc
like ain't no way
does that really add up to that much
i didn't either
where's the xtal going?
where the fuck he spending that much while getting every valk in 20 pulls
that's double mine
holy fuck
that's
yeah that was fucking crazy, it's like just for themselves too, i don't even know if anime watcher will get it
<a:xmaspls:1180158163660591224>
but he's really smart, and it makes sense too, obviously he would be
for his personality it would be an easy path to just make him stupid beefcake
true, especially for andy, that's the one that impress me the most
i kinda love how the author doesn't hide the power for too long
from autumn forward it's too good though <:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
next episode with galaxy stuff is also interesting
they added a lot of content this episode, they made the hospital scene longer and that was nice
i think there's definitely glimpses
thoughts?
undead unluck
maybe even a little too much love, they could pick up the pace
this makes sense though, they are putting a lot of love into the show
they cliffhanger right before it
<:joever:1122752199752163419>
we didn't get to galaxy this episode ruby
yeah, i agree, the non fight stuff with hamon was entertaining too
that's fair, i think stand is more inherently interesting too
it's inevitable i guess <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
with the amount of stuff he come up with he has to drop some stuff
i guess that's just how it is though
kind of a beast
there was wekapipo i guess
it would be cool if we had a few enemies that could use spin and stand harmonically
and then forgot about it after it was over
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
cause like he kinda wound down on the spin usage by like the middle of part 7
is it hard maybe to keep up 2 power system?
i forgot about it too
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> oh shit true
we can't blame him
well that one is just because he's the first jojo to live to 30
i kinda think he wouldn't have won against bites the dust by himself
that's probably right
you think so?
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
as soon as dio is dead i wouldn't blame if jotaro went okay no more problems now <:Clueless:996308692133761094> 
cause like the whole of p3 is problem caused by dio
i dunno, i wonder how it worked for jotaro in the time between p3 and p4
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
but they didn't like nerf jotaro
i feel like it didn't work too badly, araki purposefully put him in losing matches to make josuke look better
do you think that was the case for part 4 though?
i haven't read/watch p6 yet <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
the immortal one <:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
it's like between part 1 and part 3 to me
i would probably agree, though i haven't read the manga and i've heard part 1 is quite different
stardust crusaders?
now i'll need new stuff to read after i go through chrom's recommendations
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i finished my furry manga
<a:xmasnessie:1180151139136712704>
yo <@385655541248163840> can you hook my friend up
oh i know someone that can help
<:barack:1154719413682057306>
oh you're not sleeping
<:life:1001518241610485781>
the world is ending if gresham is sleeping on v2v boss i think
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
<a:Panda_thanos:598682299940470785>
that's how it went?
i was watching the start of the game
the girl with 4 horse legs, if that's furry?
you're asking if horse girl is furry?
the funniest ones to me are when it's just some random actor
i don't get it
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
i don't even know who that girl is, what do you mean by real
like one poker for tft
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196> it was in a way extremely straightforward
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
well, maybe not fucked, probably just different
i mean the meta is still a little fucked i think, double/triple prismatic didn't cap that high in past set
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
what the fuck is this meta though how is no tf3 = 4th
it's <:joever:1122752199752163419>
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
i was spared
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
is that why eli gave me mod powers without giving me mod?
oh shit true
<:joever:1122752199752163419>
even gresham?
we should have 85 nessie emotes
so we can ness out harder
<a:xmasnessie:1180151139136712704>
xmas nessie im fucking hype
HOLY FUCK
oh lets fucking go xmas aboba
but like his moneys running out
with elon i'd be like 50/50 between just like there to get paid
i mean yeah i think i'd just end it there
no
let's fucking go
i love thematic emotes
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
for next match?
who the fuck does that
he roll once and saw kayn and went bet
why the fuck did he click kayn
i've actually never seen a more soji game than this
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
fast 10 into dead
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
<@180679257851166721>
he's playing 8bit too?
i'll watch
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
that said
i'm in the middle of class
can you imagine working for elon? have you seen the CEO he appointed trying to do damage control for him?
i saw that he looks fucked up
i don't get it but it's familiar to me
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
isn't it from a game?
what is even this emote meta
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
is that
what the actual fuck
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
he's already out of bootcamp
i mean there's not even any reason for him to tryhard yet tho
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
didn't he climb some yesterday though
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i think i'm having the last class for this semester
i mean sure but any price would be too high for that
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
sounds good? or like maybe bad? kinda expensive? maybe not?
so
have no fucking clue what car prices are
i
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
idfk man i don't even know if there's a way to write hikaru that isn't incredibly stupid
like all according to plan, he wants aqua to show up
i mean maybe he is just chillin
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
oh ok nvm that's pretty straightforward
yeah that makes sense
oh
i mean yeah i think that's a fair read into it, ai and hikaru relationship is probably a very big piece on understanding ai better
what do you think it is
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
like to me that barely matter, all i care is like how she affect other and who she wanted to become
so i guess i haven't even put much thought on the question of who she really is
and the theme i read into it early is that it didn't really matter who she is on the inside? <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333> like the whole lying for it to become truth thing, her inside would match her outside
like my view on her character from chapter 1 is of someone that who she is on the inside and the outside are incredibly different, like not necessarily opposite but just different
aka dripfeeds us stuff about her too
ai is such a fucking wild character that i have such a low read on it
yeah i think that makes sense
oh <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333> hmmmm
like akane doesn't really make sense but it was set up properly long enough ago that i can't complain
i mean yeah those 2 make sense
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
isn't it kinda fucked up that everyone from just reading the script manage to 100% read into who ai is except ruby? and they're all just like fucking with her trying to make her become ai
i just don't feel like i understand ai enough to make it really make sense to me
these talk about transforming ruby into ai 2.0 are like kinda interesting to me in an ideological way but
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and that would piss me the fuck off
for like a few arcs
the only question is if they do it right away or if they drag it on
i mean if you think about it, there's no other path than kana and ruby making up
i'd fucking love that <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i mean yea and i think that's pretty fair and realistic
even like with akane, she only talks shit, when we see her internal dialogue she respects her
i mean like sure, but it always read as an inward jealousy <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>, she doesn't really blame others for it
but i agree that i'm not gonna enjoy it if ruby just goes sounds good
yeah i can see she feeling that stuff to a small degree
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
literally unironically us with Him
the moba spinoff looks fun but i'm not a player
we only talk about the main game here <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
ye
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i'm an artifact hater
the system honkai got is fucking 5000x better for almost all cases
i mean, the similarity are meaningless when the context of conversation is on why artifacts suck
so i thought there was a chance
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
they said something like gi3 already has artifacts, they're just gacha
oh ok
<@370438895965306882> is brokege velvet?
<:peepoHandsUp:1002644855593381898>
<a:KeiloTheBear:1002644779441598585>
i wish carv was proud of me
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i don't fucking believe it even if it isn't a lie
but like
like what kana monologue at the end it sound like it wasn't all lying by kana
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
it is just acting, right?
cause that's fucking nuts this early into the set
did he play like infinite hours of pbe or what
you think they're fixing the lv9 meta?
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
doomed for me
i definitely can't do that
oh okay
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
like how can one person be that good at one meta
what even is his tech

870 alhaitham

<a:DuckSmh:1006448360200347699>

i got bored
there's a lot of valk
okay i'll do rule 34
nevermind of genshin
she's not even the hottest valk in 1.0
wait really? mona at the top?
oh you're talking about most
mona?
i wasn't going to
i mean i can
do you wanna guess
i wanna like see which valk in genshin have the least amount of porn
r34?
where do normie people post porn
wh <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
who
kan
i think that's all of them too
4!
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
and not have pedo lewd it
like can you even design a young girl valk for genshin
master fisher
<:bait:673030223129870346>
holy shit cherry i got 3
yeah i wouldn't say they're lewd, i think there's no salvation
oh shit i got 2 cherry
what now
i got one cherry
cherry is asking for one
<@&963274168705630248> can i get a mod please <:nerdge:980201016853164144>
i wouldn't really but it would be nice
i would unretire if they release a yae skin with perma tail
well i guess i wouldn't count like klee
pretty much all?
a lot of the furry ones are liyue too
hu tao, xiangling and the furry ones is probably mine
that's a pretty good list
<:Wokege:862486121933701141>
latla?
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
they deserve less honestly
i thiiiink i vibe with it? probably not my type though
the first guy looks like lynette the edgy years
oh those are from that game you mentioned
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
ok buddy
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
my top design from genshin is hu tao and xiangling i think
this is a pretty chill design honestly, i can vibe with it
anyway you got me nini? with that mahjong top up?
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
but she is cute
i don't actually need her that bad it doesn't really matter, it's just mahjong
i need her
and then hannah showed up and she alt f4d my brain
i guess that's the one i'm going to pick
so i went
yeah, he was earlier on the valk list
dog guy
the lewdest thing mihoyo ever release was barefoot griseo somehow
sure
the human design didn't really entice me much
not really, there's some coward furry like nekomimi and a dog guy
i downloaded it earlier today
like i gacha opponent?
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333> i don't know what that means
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
i did a legit double take on it, i thought i didn't see it properly
i know right!!! holy shit man
lemme grab the pic of her toesies they're cute too
it's so fucking good isn't it
this is the one i want
as far as i can see, you can't even grind premium currency
it is but it's all skin stuff
yeah that one
the mahjong gacha
<:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
you could top up for me
hey nini i started playing a new gacha
<a:GAMBA:920724874467606608>
i'm gonna pull nyx
maybe the husband can't pull off nanami
kinda mid taste though
i kinda respect it in a way
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
optimally pick the worst character to be your protag
maybe we will get a mirio spin off
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i enjoyed that
the tourney arcs were sick though <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
at the point i stop i can't even remember a school arc <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that's fair i guess
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
superhero shit?
our shonen stuff would be like
i mean sure but like the valk doesn't have to be your age for you to be interested in the story
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
80% of manga is highschool cast
isn't it a little weird how like
and have a blend of those
we should put on a vote for the best 10 people to represent underarc
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
they look a little young for me but sure
cool
oh that's why the furry girl design slaps!
oh yeah azur lane and arknights
i don't remember where i heard that before but i heard that before
it's a yostar game
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
the ones that look like kids do have more skins though
it surprised me how the mahjong gacha has a pretty even split in valk
i wonder what kinda fucked up shit would show up if we had an underarc blend
but there's no keilo + hakcer
there's tet + hakcer songs and there's keilo + tet songs
hakcer joined too, it's kinda funny now
or like fucked in the head
does that mean i'm special?
what really?
yuri mahjong? <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
so like probably not
but i haven't matched 1 person with non-jp or cn name
i was going to say that that's everyone else i'm playing against too
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it doesn't help that i only know 17 steps yaku
my mind is not huge enough to come up with strat by myself
i think i gotta watch some strat theorycrafting
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
i'm a beast it's just impossible to climb
not even my fault tbh
this shit is so unfair too, i got +10 when i went 2nd but -12 when i got 3rd
yeah i don't see any way to get currency through gameplay
<a:swipeboobahic:940613030968963122>
like this
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
i don't think you can pull at all for free
wait
my match history is 4423
<a:despairgamba:1114542929625755718>
i don't have a gacha valk
you know what's the issue
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
losing at ranked mahjong
okay i joined
ain't no fucking way i lost with that hand man
i had a fucking giga hand but i fucked it up but at least i didn't lose
oh thank fuck
nevermind...
i'm actually winning
gimme a sec i'm playing ranked mahjong
it wouldn't be inaccurate
i used it for a good while so
i still have my spotify though, just not premium
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i dunno what that means
it isn't as good as spotify
i swapped to youtube premium
no
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
thanks!
tf they doing
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
youtube got shitty mobile games built in now?
yeah i think so <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i just need to become a beast now
i think i can see it
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
if you're not the one who makes something, no one will
you ever think that like
it's really good but i wish it was more furry <:life:1001518241610485781>
i left nagabe biggest work for last but it's also the least furry
i'm gonna need to find another good furry author
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i am
i'll have to read it
yeah i can't guess it unless there's more rules
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
else you just pick the highest value all the time, no?
card choice only matter if 2 is an option
i guess i'll have to be surprised
i honestly don't even know how it can be that tense though <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
and that sounds fucking insane <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i took a peek at one poker rules
kaiji games fucking slap
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
hmmm i get that i think
is it all mahjong?
that sounds really interesting actually <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
that's kinda sick
i only figure it out now, i saw what look like kaiji character but no one i know and then i connected the dots
is it really? i only know akagi from what you said before, i didn't even know it was the same author as kaiji
this is my furry girl that i'll pull for
R <a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331> L L E D
i'm so bad at this
i got fucking rolled man
nevermind
oh wait it was pay to entry
like if you play fall valks and you lose coins from losing too hard
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
what the fuck i lost currency from that
<a:Panda_thanos:598682299940470785>
i just got sanbaiman'd
they got rotating gamemodes tho, there's this one call doradorara that start with 3 dora
nope just standard mahjong
there's a banner to pull for guy and a banner to pull for girl <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the banner are also gender segregated
it's all just cosmetic though, like ron voicelines, tile skins
<a:GAMBAADDICT:1088508671144759358>
i know what i'm pulling
they also have a REALLY good furry girl <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
kaguya collab
they have an akagi collab
just skin
i dunno why i expected it to not look like a gacha
oh god it's a gacha alright
i like how half of the review are like it's good but the tutorial would probably not be enough for a new player and the other half is it sucks and makes no fucking sense <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> 
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
is it pvp at least?
oh damn it's a gacha?
can you share the name so i can avoid it
ew that's disgusting
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
skill issue i think
i played some with friends tho and i didn't get it
oh okay, actually i think i saw someone post that <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:BatChest:891596027767975986> really?

which one?
weren't there some hot women in there she could've dated instead

katniss just needed someone better then
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
he's so fucking bitchmade in the books idk if they changed it in the movie
obviously peeta is the better one but peeta isn't really good either
i think my final take as i finished the second book was that katniss just deserves better
oh the hunter guy
i read the book and i didn't even remember there was a love triangle
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
who the fuck is gale again?

come watch too then <a:jamm:1062133678542688276>
was it fun
about 70% of what i listen is anime op and game ost
my knowledge about music is really weird
is that so <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
this set really feels like tft2 with how much they're putting into it
<a:djblob:803985193945792542>
that sounds sick as fuck
i mean yeah
that's how that guy is for me <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
you know like when you don't know about something and then suddenly that something shows up all over the place?
i'm gonna be honest idk who steve aoki is

<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
the fuck is going on the story
mihoyo would like cut the set length in half and rotate trait every 2 weeks though
they can prob do a good job balancing
i think if they keep everything the same
i mean i dunno
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i mean riot
someone gotta keep the winrate low so mihoyo thinks it's balanced

hi cherbear
i heard good things tho i think
i haven't watched p1 or p2 anime
well, i think at least
p3 anime would go so hard
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
oh shit
how old is the p1 and p2 anime
there's a chance but whoever pick it up to adapt it to anime gotta have some balls
this is it i think
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
lemme see if i can find it
i think there was like a chapter they had read out by some VAs
ideally you need VA that know rakugo
it sounds hard
maybe no one has the balls
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:SCREAM:1095596218895310889>
make more stuff
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i just need more from nagabe man
yeah same <:life:1001518241610485781>
i mean like sure but that's just a whole different thing
i think they definitely are only my favorite cause they use oneshot format in a great way
wizdom
goodbye eri
my favorite one shot are like
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
there be some banger one shots though
it makes sense though
that was fucking nuts to me
the only show that get dubbed to portuguese are the ones that get past the pilot
i was like huh is that like a tradition?
when i was a kid i always thought it was very weird how every tv show first episode is call pilot
the thing you make needs to be a giga banger for it to make an impact if you release it at once
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
it's almost necessary though i think
<a:peepoTrip:755692813320060959>
honestly i still don't really get how it's even possible to make something like that
true
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i think that's what some webtoon does
unless you take breaks to catch up on your backlog
i mean a backlog is nice but you still end up needing to do a chapter a week if you're posting weekly
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i couldn't
that sounds hard as fuck honestly
cause the batches are so small, especially weekly one you don't get that much time to plan ahead too much
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i mean it's not all serialised fiction
the ongoing one from nagabe is like twice a year <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
monthly even maybe
<a:peepoTrip:755692813320060959>
like all these manga release weekly
isn't that wild though
i mean yeah maybe
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
i just feel stupid
i mean it's not like i'm not enjoying it
i think that kind of stuff is the spoilers i actually care about?
so idk if i wanna look into other interpretation yet <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i'm only about 10% into it
i guess that's fair
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i read it and there's like siren going on that there's deeper stuff for me to get and i don't really get it
more like i can't really decipher the underlying themes properly not smart enough
it's not really like i can't follow the plot not smart enough
girl on the other side
you ever read some manga and go i don't think i'm smart enough to understand this
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
like i thought they had to be online <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i don't even know how those game work too much tbh
are those good
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
if i wanna play a diablo like, i probably should play poe right
is it really that bad

SO many of them
there's fucking
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
for the thrill maybe
i think it was still pretty good for him but it was bis for other classes
it wasn't even his bis, in the end he just gave it away to someone else who could use it more
at one point x just outbid himself for fun <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>

i sounds like horror shit
is it like horror shit
no i mean
you deserve it
you've been working so hard lumi
you should treat yourself
:kessie:
i'm sure you can do that even if you're not nessie
<a:Nessie:1164016962595209306>
those are fun questions
you know, ruby is right
you think my consciousness gets to be my fursona?
that must go hard
?
you down to
if we meet in the afterlife
sure thing
i'll go check it out
<:o7:1099354934320840765>
oh shit true
kinda like the whole simulation thing
i think it has so much unknown that it's hard to even make any single meaningful statement
i mean sure, as a fun like storywriting exercise <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i think i don't really think about it because there's no guarantee answer either way
idk how i feel about counciousness stuff
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
elon musk
we could ask our boy
:meandyou: ?
have you thought about how maybe every time you go to sleep you die and another you wakes up with all the past you memories
really?
like in any meaningful way
does that count as rpg
i feel like anything too much better would make me throw up
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
is that that bad
i didn't think there was that many stuff for it
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
maybe idk shit about vr scene then
i mean i do believe you i'm just surprised
who the fuck is making mmo already
like we don't even have good singleplayer rpg vr
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i don't believe you
really?
no way
really?
what did you mean then
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
is it not
then we already have em
i mean ye if you expand your definition of mmo to account for vrchat
like raiding in vr or some shit
do you think it'd be fun
we ain't even getting new regular mmo, nevermind vr one
like if you want a real mmo like mmorpg, i really doubt it
it depend on your meaning of mmo
<a:aborryPunch:855007511546429450>
i feel like fighting game is like the endgame for me <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
like platformer one like smb melee
i've only play shitter fighting game before
street fighter 6
probably gonna have to install it on the ssd though
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
and it actually run on my pc
i install the sf6 demo
what's up
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
what's it about?
that looks scary
<:Sadge:749389233667702834>
i miss being happy
<a:Nessie:1164016962595209306>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
scouting is so stressful to me
i've definitely had game where i'm playing a comp alone and then 2 people pivot into me for fun
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
you think those changes are healthy?
are you spamming karthus akali
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah, i think that's nice but probably bait
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
apparently skipping a headliner guarantee that the next headliner of same champ gets the other trait
oh did you see?
is p5 stacked then?
oh really? that's weird
isn't kaiji still releasing?
<:elywhip:1002644839248183306>
2 days off is too much time off honestly
twice a week would kill a person
that makes sense
oh i see
i think manga plus is all wsj but i could be wrong <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
oh ok
i dunno how many of those are wsj and how many are just here for fun
there's an ice skating one, mamayuu, a martial arts one?
oh wow there's a lot of new stuff i missed
i can pick up the golf one
i think my mermaid one is getting axed
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
is it wsj?
maybe it felt worse if you were reading it weekly
it didn't feel that bad though
yeah i guess i can understand pacing issues
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
that's fair
lowkey i loved it
do people really dislike the part of blue box where hina is getting shafted by taiki
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i wouldn't pick a fight either
move is too much of a bro
honestly yea i didn't even notice
that's the impression i always got
the family is rich as fuck aren't they
that's just mirah house
union is like a sidegig for him
wait you think he still has his dayjob
he looked really out of it though
just happy to be here really
<:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
like the girl who just fuck you up come to your home and you're just like
isn't it kinda funny he didn't even say anything
if it's the same as union ranking, it's just how many quest they've done, but they haven't been able to do any quests this loop cause of andy
well i mean i guess idk how much the ranking even matter
yeah, 2 is kinda high for it too
i mean she could be justice <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
2 is nun girl
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263> sick
it's an incredible translation, it doesn't sound nearly as unique in jp
they're also negators, so they keep info from lost rules
you think if they killed uma sick, fuuko and andy would lose their catchphrases
it is sick though
i dunno if it makes too much sense actually
just kill all language
that's kinda wild
it was neutralize uma language
wait yeah, it wasn't capture uma language
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
information reward was g-liner according to wiki
he legit looks like a naruto villain
i guess that's fair
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
does that guy look like meaning to you though
yeah i wouldn't find that weird tbh
from ruin
oh wait meaning is another one
peak chapter
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
i'm guessin the other 3 are like religion, fair and justice <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
her best fighting condition is with andy
well, that's her 2nd best fighting condition
like they're so all encompassing that they're stuff that is not too hard for fuuko to love
ain't the master rules kind of a great match up against her though?
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333> that's true
cause fuuko was stuck doing surgery on a leila
yeah i'm not sure honestly, i think they might have more fighting chance than we saw on sick fight
permanently chained by untruth
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
to get him back on union
maybe we could get another feng arc
that one is prob coming after andy
unhealthy maybe
using it with unruin around would be a real gamble <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
yeah, she won't use it without everyone around
though it would be nice to have andy on the team when we meet juiz <:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
we're still missing like 5 negators and that feels kinda endgame
idk if that would happen too soon though
rescuing andy would be the union going to sun and beating up all the master rules, right?
he's staying there for a reason
like it's not like andy can't leave
i don't know tbh <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
yeah that makes sense
i'm getting <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> at all everyone can talk about is shokugeki no soma jokes about these new chapters
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
cause i don't really remember
real ones?
are the flashbacks to them eating ramen
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>

set 9 we had diamond soji
i feel like this happens to him every start of set <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
is it just influencer mode
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
big bro's jazz avg 4.5
what the fuck is that
36% wr
<a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206>
oh that sounds insane
right?
surely it's a mistake for that's jazz to take unique trait
like every step of the way i think
100%
should we pivot into ethnical cleansing to follow His teachings?
oh true my bad
like what is even the point of it
what kinda argument is that
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331> it is insane
yeah that doesn't really surprise me, while i do think it's based to go to israel to siphon off their money, realistically speaking ain't no one doing that
big bro can make anything look balanced
true
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and it feels more common than hitting like some 4 or god forbid 5 cost 3* for free
you can still hit it for free and win out
sure it's a lot harder to hit now but like <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i dunno if i like that they kept the bingo design
<:caught:1175079388874805351>

<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that kinda makes sense tho
oh i see
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
his board suck so bad
oh yeah i think that one was a soji special
there's some sus balancing going on rn

oh
is that suppose to be 0.15%?
cool i think? <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
what are you doing to the rest of them eli

i mean not liquid liquid just more liquid
the fuck you mean it went bad
<a:LETSFUCKINGGO:1012872161763008602>
it's a little more... liquid? than the cream cheese i've seen
it's requeijão, it's like a type of cream cheese and i don't think there's a name for it in english
though actually it's not really cream cheese
that's why i bought it
me too
it's cream cheese i bought from the store
it's not about cum i swear
but it's true <:crying:757445037402619974>

i was going to say i could share some cream cheese
yes run to the store

<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
for some reason he thought there was no cats or foxes
and then half of the chat was like ewwww
his view on it was way off tho but that's understandable he ain't a furry
he was talking about how he finds it weird how some fursona are way more rare than other
i'm warming up to northernlion lately, yesterday he had a furry bit
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
it's probably kinda hard to make me offended
i mean yeah if that even happen again i wouldn't be offended i'd just be worried
so even if you tried i would just take it as a bit
you're like, way too kind to say anything genuinely mean
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
but if i was a insecure it'd probably make me sad
if you want me to spell out how i really feel, i'm very confident in our friendship so i find that stuff really funny and i play into it
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
sure
yeah the social experiement was to bring out that confusion
right here
yeah you did
what assumption, you told me
the way you feel right now, that's how lumi feels all the time
this is actually me doing a social experiment on you
ill change who i am from now on
ill be better
sorry cherry

okay but what if you told her you were a clone and only one of you gets to live
dw about it
i mean the thing im obsessing over
oh ok
i thought i only showed it to chrom
did i show you the thing

she would kill herself

2019 me has no chance
i'm not even joking

owo cash help
hey can you send me 911 tet?
how come
owo cash
i don't even know what owo cash is
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that like steals your discord info or some shit
they send you a game beta .exe
but this game one is just trying to send you some kind of virus
idk if the comm shit has some twist
this ain't promoting though
ayo
@cher
i realise it means i agree but i saw that reaction and my immediate thought was that you were going yes, kill yourself
i think i would kill myself before offering something to strangers
that's wild
that happens?
in any way
okay answer me a question is it romantic
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
just the tip
yeah let eli go
okay you go now eli
i die irl?
what happens if i do 3 strikes
feet pics?
i'm betting: steam scam
i don't skip you though, your color is unique now so i can tell it's you
it's okay

i was even scrolling through this chat earlier and going huh been a while since i've seen cherry!
sorry

i know the game is very inconsistent on input buffer from like animation standpoint <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
like from pause standpoint
i dunno how those things work in honkai actually
maybe if it's input buffer?
pausing once should do very little
for me it's programming stuff <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
16 is kinda chugging
oh i should upgrade mine to 32 too
you should get them to help you

be honest <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
but idk how much he actually top up
gets a card every 10 pull
somehow still 500k top up
i was going to make a joke like
ok buddy

aqua talk more about top up in maincord

i think it's a feet thing
you think it would be higher or lower otherwise?
i think hrt at 5* is pretty fair anw no? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
wdym one of the reasons truth is 5*
not guy
yeah i said guys
same guys who make the CN ER recommendations
yeah that's moonlight center tier list
yeah LY being that high is weird to me too
i think si2 placement is fair there
these type of tier list is main usage is spending prio for new player
which is fair
yeah i think the only reason si2 is that high is because of cheaper on release
okay
is that a team prio list or an example?
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
like how much
i mean i guess
i think it'd have to be an unreasonable amount for me to do it
they never mention it, i don't really push for a number tho cause it's kind of a dick move to try to force them to spill the beans when i'm not intending to sell the username anw
i don't mind either way
to give me good first impression
the one omegaverse one i should read

just wait until himeko

it's lowkey better than gi3
genshin combat is actually really good
the funny part is that
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
is going to break the game
mihoyo too scared that the competitive community from most competitive game genshin impact
genshin player joining in genshin 4
yeah surely
it was so old and well known by the time they fix it
but no one really bother about it
extreme pause gaming was already a thing that people knew about
them trying to fix it is what cause player fucking with mihoyo
the funniest thing is how like
yeah eat my nuts
bugfix
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
immediately fixed
the second it become top score strat
entire community share with each other as a fun fact, niche knowledge
like for fucking 4 patch we knew the cool tech that sns air charge count as combo for some reason
is the sns combo change
one of the funniest thing yet
and will get coldfix if mihoyo get a wind of it
all interesting mechanic tech in valk nowadays is unintended
because of part 2 stuff
is if they are under time pressure and aren't able to polish her off as much as they want before release
i think the only way she become a mechanically interesting valk
lmao
on someones acc
i'm down to play an abyss boss or MA boss with px2
but i don't really find it fun to beat sinful boss either
i'll keep it
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
i mean i'm down to try her out on someones acc
i'm at 0 xtal anw i won't be able to pull her
i ain't playing this game
but yeah that shit, no chance
i have no problem with that
also to check book status
like if i'm trying to help someone i log in to check stig text and that kind of stuff
i log in every once in a while nowadays
i mean it depend what you mean by coming back
fuck no
i got the dupe and i went neat
after you whale enough tho it isn't even something to comemmorate
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
i mean yea it happens
and i had closer pity for next valk
cause nyx rankup don't matter anw
i just gave up
i mean i'm not upset about no card tho, just no frag was annoying
she's still s0 on my acc i think
literally no progress made
without a card or a singular frag
and i legit pull like 60 times
i pull on nyx banner for rank up
to balance it out, before essentine change
i'm not any more or less lucky though
TMBB
and got exactly
like i pull on SI gear
yk?
and i don't remember the avg pulls
infinite banner rerun
but i also pull on like
and like that was sick
and getting the exact turg i want offrate
pulling on banner like first zhenyi rerun
like i definitely remember
maybe she's Her
i mean idk then
have you seen it though? and also, what is your idea of low amount of pulls <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah i don't really believe that <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
just by rule that if you're pulling a lot like that
but it won't happen every time
like i don't doubt that as a person who spend a lot, getting a c6 on such a low amount of pull happen once
especially in a gacha like mihoyo one which have so much pity to reduce variance
after you whale enough, good and bad luck stop existing cause it all avg out
and got 0 uprate
like the one time i pull 80 time on irene focus
to balance it out
but i also have really really unlucky pull streak
my 2s PE was really really lucky
and i got some really lucky streaks
like i spend a fuckton
it's reeeeeeally hard to be consistently that lucky
but once you spend more
variance go nuts if you're not a whale
like getting lucky is one thing for low amount of pull
i don't believe it
it's like about 4 pull for a frag
yeah
more like 80 actually
or smth like that
to get the rest of the frag through essentine for s2
he still have to pull like 40 time after
like even if he got 2 card back to back
yeah that sounds right
then you'll be missing frag
but if you're too lucky and get the 2 card too soon
cause the essentine will make it up
for both
you can s2 if you're unlucky and have to pull around soft pity
it depend how lucky you are
for non awk
if you get 2 in 1 and the first one is unlock, it's s1 5 frag
+ who the fuck even pull like that
that he is that lucky that consistent
i mean there just ain't no way though
it is strictly true that 1 team is good enough to place myriad once
well not really
:euchatting:
where is all the bchip going?
and all of his gear is 20 pull 4/4
when all of his valk is 30 pull 6 dupe
how can he even have top up that much
at this point it's more than half
is his father da wei or what
like ain't no fucking way man
does he think when we say 10 pull we mean 10 10pull?
i was kinda sus about it at first but now i believe in ruby like
he isn't lying
ain't NO  fucking way
okay
more like px2
whore -> fk2 -> lk2 -> si2 -> ae2
ever since whore all we've been getting is 2 valk anyways
you know what maybe it's fine
god fk2 is good though
maybe it's fine tho
cause i'm suppose to only do old abbr2 for part 2 valk
i actually gotta fix up lk2 and si2
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
no like the emoji in specific
but then i just think about ✂️c
i wanna do something that include ✂️
i can't think of anything that doesn't include cunny
for sirin abbr
do you have any ideas tet
+2
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
my guy guess who also is DiP
so we'll call her DiP
they're like we can't call DPe DP because of DIvine Prayer
i have beef with people who call dpe dip
dpe is a normal one carv <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
kinda boring though
or pink
yeah
pc maybe?
i don't have an abbreviation for sirin
oh yeah
but like ain't no way that dpe deserve a spot more than mpe
i mean sure
i dunno
hmmm <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
is she?
yeah
mpe not being there at all is fucked up though
but still maybe a bit high <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i don't really know the meta, i think she's good cope for other team?
LY being that high is also surprising
she's probably only going to be worth it on release for avg player
si2 being that high should probably have a warning though
sirin is a very cheap valk, and if it's for a3/rl being on weather doesn't really matter
i think this is pretty fair, by design tier list like this is suppose to be for new player
it's probably not really ordered inside star tier
from what i remember from those guides, they're kinda wishy washy on order
cheese girl
i'll take
my bad
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
are you asking me about my fursona?
i don't get the question
a furry one?
hi carv
the name yeah
i'l pick vladimir
oh and kusuriya was also today but idt you're reading that one
yozakura having a kind of slice of life chapter after so long with the entire family together was really nice
koguma ani backstory was really nice, it kinda push for the previous theme of using your insecurity and flaw to make your rakugo stronger
i think todays chapter for all of them were pretty good
and fuuko caring so much about him <:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
unburn looks kinda sick
it's actually crazy how author keep giving interesting backstory to who character
i read them all in a normal time for once
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
that's not bread
dracula trying to get into beta testing
i feel like i got read somehow
and she went  <a:mhm:1088510781756276756> from kanto
i showed her fanart of flareon vaporeon jolteon and went those are all the eevee!
i tried to bait my lil sis into <a:Nerdge:960240242114318416> ing me
see what i mean eli
for you eli, you just have to say the word
the same thing
that's
i'm also free
no reason to bring her up to competitive status any time soon either
if you're not gonna use the valk any time soon competitively
i think that pri is very low prio
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i can hornypost about animals you don't even know exist
you didn't even know what knotting was
but furry hornyposting? cmon chill out
you could outdo me in hornyposting
and like i appreciate that but everytime she does she follows it up with some tiktok shit that is completely undecipherable
the only one that can match my furry hornyposting here is heki
pretty please?
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
y-you promise?
can you imagine the utena references
elymei could have had a sword fight
you know
you never know
maybe the bug was into it
trust
and you too can be furry like me
you just have to believe in yourself eli
do you wanna be converted?
i'm a convert just because she's furry
i'll admit it
i didn't care much until they show her design
of those
like a lot
i've seen the spongebob squidward one
wait nvm
i'm not into it but it's so well made
oh shit is it that one really high quality comic?
like tentacle i would put in like outer boundary of furry, like nekomimi
i wouldn't
yeah heki
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
i didn't even do anything and eli is calling me a nerd
but now <a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
it was fine when it was me talking about my furry porn there
you really don't want to see it
yeah i'm a big ketchup fan
thank you heki
and they let me have yours
so i message mihoyo
like one to eat one to keep kinda thing
oh yeah i really wanted a second one
you
i have one already <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<a:PatKeilo:1024979870993895484>
thats me!
i don't remember which bot pets
!pet <@309634550273933314>
wait which one was it
owo pet <@309634550273933314>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
my bad
that you told me about it?
<a:Noted:914214211138244688>
what's that
what
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
but i also wanna take the time to reread some stuff too
it's kinda fucked up for me, since i just start reading manga i still have a lot to read
i wasn't really interested before this
oh i see, i might read it then
like she isn't actually changing the past, just going back and doing the stuff that she already did
yeah that's what i thought the missing memories was implying
so even if himmel does confess to present frieren it wouldn't really change anything, right? cause the rest of the adventure is already set in stone
iirc, frieren said something like she didn't have memories from that period, which imply that it's a closed loop
i don't know if i understand the mechanics of the time jump in this arc
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
yes, ruby?
<:peepoBlush:620449739070111763>
with me
or like how all remedy entertainment games somehow are connected
like kaguya and onk
i think that's cute when author does stuff like that
that's interesting
oh so it was like a last minute reveal?
i'm learning so much today
wait fire force is done?
why didn't i know that <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
really?
wait what the fuck?
and like power evolution
yeah, definitely the thing that i enjoyed the most on soul eater are all the power
wait fire force is from same author? i didn't know that
<:crying:1102186758852050964>
i was just trying to find this one
i wanted this one
i did enjoy it
i watched the anime and then read the manga, while i do prefer the manga i kinda respect the anime ending
nevermind
oh it was called mew mew kissy cutie in undertale
what the fuck
they didn't make it up for undertale?
that's real?
wait what the fuck
and the only one of those that i think doesn't suck balls is soul eater
and then i think it was like sao, mirai nikki, soul eater
my first anime was vampire knight
figure it out from context
you just skip a volume?
like what happens if you're reading it at like 16
and i'm like <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
and then the next one is 14+
the funny part is that like all the manga volume are 14+ except the one where they fuck which is 18+
i think there's a wannabe kaworu
potato salad fucks and i never had coleslaw
like literally post the most horny scene in the first season and go i think it's platonic <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
there was a post like yesterday on beastars subreddit that was a screenshot of this scene and the redditor was like i don't get why so many people think this scene is sexual
what the fuck
penguin boy is also a sibling?
lyney can enter my tunnel
thanks for clarifying
oh ok
wait which one is which again
lyney can enter my tunnel
raiden is the guy who goes RULES OF NATURE
it is insanely good
i get to have hoo -> flamescion
if iriya gets to have IO -> hasekura
it is an abbreviation for me
HoFinality is fucking unhinged
i agree though i was thinking about that while on commute from school
i thought you were going to make fun of my flamescion
USoA is bad though i won't have any abbr longer than 3 letter
shut up
that's not
wait
UoS
we should valk abbreviation countries
it is not always the first 2 letters
i mean you don't have to but you're supposed to
i think i played it before i quit
isn't this event just one of the rando filler one? you have to trade the picture with other people
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
when people were crying about the food delivery event
remember on like 1.0 or 1.1
don't worry about it
12
hak they're like
new jerma flavor just dropped
affinity was right
i'm nessiying out irl rn
<a:Nessie:1164016962595209306>
yoasobi joined the dark side
yeah <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it is the most :bitrate: mv i've ever seen though
new yoasobi dropped and it slaps
the a-plot and b-plot really work together on that one
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah i'll read it all in 1 go, it was kinda sudden reading from week to week but i think it has potential
i haven't read the new frieren chapter yet <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
<a:SNIFFA:1076196403711316091>
unironically just what happens in the manga
<a:SNIFFA:1076196403711316091>
yeah that was really good too
monotone blue
probably one of the short stories in wizdom, there's some really good ones in there
it's not my favorite from his now that i've read more though
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
i liked smell so much that i tracked down everything from nagabe and am reading it one by one
you're asking if it's okay to like smell
we're built different, you and i
<a:DuckSmh:1006448360200347699>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it's not the horniest thing he's done
smell is the only porn he's done and i'm gonna be honest
yes
<a:NAHHH:1120795949099384963>
not yoasobi getting into ,.. catfish
holy shit my mind is fucking huge <:5Head:783626223204827136>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
iirc it's like around the interface where you take a screenshot to share for weekly xtal
okay sleep well
there's a few mid ones but i'm enjoying it a lot
let me know if you want more
heki maybe?
here?
i mean
who
yeah ok
i thought it was like in a groupchat hidden or dms or smth <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh it's just there
do i know his life
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
mangadex doesn't even have english translation <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
my bad read this one
i can find another site
wait is it actually fucked
the eepy takes another one
well, maybe just not for me, i guess
i feel like the baseline default romance for manga is SO bad
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but i only vibe with nagabe writing of romance
i'm a little sad, i did end up adding a few more furry manga from other author
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
L
wizdom is definitely my preferred anthology from nagabe
of this one
+ first chapter
read the prologue
lemme pick a good one for you
make up your fucking mind <:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
like 1-2 chapter
do you wanna read one of the furry short story i'm reading
hi cherry
okay that got me, that's very cute
thanks i'll read it
that gave me psychic damage
that reads like a fucking warning
that's why he look like that
i think he want to
<a:classic:1164190242992033932> mihoyo
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that fucking wording is terrible
<:HUHH:995051382522519616>
yeah not even done
packed as fuck day
i swear some round each of them think like infinite
does it really only last 8 minute
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i can't even get it up in that time
what else hak
i believe you i just don't watch anime
i'll read ebichu if i can
chill out <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i'm talking about manga here
i'm pretty sure its just replace s to z in some words so it sounds cooler
wise -> wize, wisdom -> wizdom
<a:Noted:914214211138244688> i'll check it out and let you know what i think
you can read the rest too if you want but read the 6th one
wizdom is collection of short stories, so each chapter is self contain
read the 6th chapter of wizdom
i might just pirate it though depending on how much trouble it is
i need something to do while i afk runescape
i might be down this weekend <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but like genre wise, vn?
what is it then
oh wait is it not a manga
oh!
i...s it good?
isn't that the nazi iron cross thing in the background? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
thats a dragon
what the fuck
wait shot?
they're very gay
you'd like it i think hak
yes
and then someone commented the only furry thing about them are their look and he took it personally
a lot of his earlier story are human x furry or human x animal and it's all basically just different iteration of people who are intrinsically and impossibly different still find love in each other
i see the poster but i still don't know what it is, its definitely furry instrad of monsterfucker
wicked sick
sick
but maybe
i dont know what that is
<:mereadingwhatbullshitgeneralsays:1103309842963247176>
so i'm reading all his stuff
nagabe is the furry author i found recently
i felt like i had to make it clear
it's not vore
half of nagabe manga are like if it's wrong to eat human, i can just make them furry and it's fine
tfs that
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i'll stop babbling then
oh wait are you watching the anime
i'm dtf solitar and macht
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
i'm thinking about solitar
wait which one are you talking about
no
i'd fucking speedrun that demon pussy and immediately be killed
if i was reborn in frieren world i'd die so fast
the demon girl
i could fix her
i don't remember much about it but i had fun i think
well **i** was a real fan and i read all of the books even the one extra one
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
i'm being force to play the game to play the game

that why she went to world serpent
mei got really uncomfortable from kiana's advances
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> that's a funny one
congrats on your new gender

<a:DuckSmh:1006448360200347699>
i can't believe you forgot some of His teachings, tet
there are NO gay character in honkai

there can only be one Him
you're gonna have to fight Him over it
if you're talking about He/Him
wait if you're talking about he/him then it doesn't matter
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
only if you want to
surely
i think right now it is Him
i don't get your point
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>

it does make me appreciate when i see great female mc like fuuko and akane
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i guess i forgot about her when i said toga is the only one
this one is depressing too tho her design was good
like why
the shit that ticked me off is during the arc with the yakuza/mafia villain, he literally group up all the girls and they have 1 singular scene
yeah i couldn't recognise uraraka but it makes sense if it's toga
it's fucking depressing
i'm pissed to this day how bad the author treat every girl in that anime
oh it is
the singular girl with good design from heroaca?
is that
there's one that heki's in too
there's still a few though
i left a lot of them when i dropped from full nitro to pleb nitro

<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
i mean ye
hot?
and we all done that
like other stuff that is against tos is sharing acc
i'm just making it clear tho that that's the state it is in, i think
it's only enforced or not
there's no more or less against tos
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
i mean
so it's just up to mihoyo if they ever want to actually enforce it
it's also definitely against tos
with changing value at runtime
and also how most cheat in honkai work
yeah, that shit is definitely detectable
so it's probably just alter memory at runtime
and that's a shader debug tool
okay apparently the main way people do mods is 3dmigoto?
i mean people be using them since release and it looks fine
idk what that means
does it mod at runtime?
how does it work then
it's not?
ummm
um
i wonder if you can make a legit team here
and an ely elf skin for paimon
there's an elysia skin for yae
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
kinda bluescreen me
this one is weird
why
i don't mind it that much cause hu tao looks great in everything but like
they really do
genshin honkai nilou
if ever come back to genshin i'll just call nilou ghn
i didn't even know genshin got an hn
why
this was marked as nsfw too tho so they're pretty lenient
literally every single one is something lewd
okay after the like first 10 skin
without the other changes
can i have one that gives him huge badonkas
just give kazuha a pair you don't have to do all that
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
nvm
ew wtf
okay i'm kinda into it
probably not
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>

cmon guys
that's the worst looking mei battlesuit
like
after the raiden boss one

i'm not surprised it exist
i mean sure
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>

5'7, 170cm
i mean, he's tiny for us standard i guess <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
yeah
you should see some shoes he wears
he is tiny and he is very insecure about it actually
but like that's okay
i think you got white man face blindness
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
that good enough?
they's similarly stupid
wait are those edited too? just like very slightly
but then i saw some pic and i went
i thought people were like making fun of him with something stupid
yeah that's edited
that's the one
yeah
charlie kirk
he's like that guy
and make him approve of the newest war crime
to get his attention
to jangle in front of reagan
you brought keys to white office
he was actually baby mode president
it goes like reagan -> george bush 1 -> bill clinton -> george bush 2 -> <:barack:1154719413682057306> -> trump -> <:joever:1122752199752163419>
it's actualy a little fucked up now that i look at the list and i know all of the recent ones <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
one for each
yeah
oh shit they have 2 george bushes
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
the message before that one that i read from you was the i want to suck that dick with my ass or some shit like that
oh i haven't seen everything you said today i'm sorry
and then in 5 month they go to the past and that's the same styx we know
like is this how they start their acc
is styx like a time traveller
i respect it but you need help maybe
lumi you are so horny
i'm willing to officially diagnose anyone who pilot 2 honkai acc that they own as clinically insane
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
can i give advice too
trust
i'm still on corruptie waiting room
okay but
PLOT HOLE!!!!! mei said she would stay with kiana forever but then she left her? are the writers even in the room?
you don't make the cheerful one depressed, what? that's so unrealistic
if you want a depressed character you make a character who's gimmick is they're depressed
that's not how this works
why are these characters like... changing?
what, this writing is so bad
they log in, do 4 story chapter and go
look haha that's a funny trait right? anyway here's the next one
is genshin like keys jangling on their face
actually baby mode
you know, i learned a lot
no other character in all existance is those 2 <:BatChest:891596027767975986>
eula is sneeze and vengeance
good character is when they have 2 traits and that combination of 2 traits is unique to them
extremely deep and interesting characters like eula
yeah <a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
each valk in genshin gets a singular story quest with 50 voice lines
my guy gsr just got sucrose2
while the other games get so many unique characters with so much individuality
HELLO??????
the fuck
?????
glad to be of help
<a:KONhug:872043734638948353>

i mean if it's just a kink thing i don't judge
is it just like infinite ntr purgatory?
yeah, it didn't really feel to me that it got axed, but it still was sudden
lowkey it kinda felt like a jumpscare ending to me
does the ending to ichinose feel like it got axe to you? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

i'm a fan of those that are like one thing with a bunch of compartment
like what if she goes you know after taking my meds i don't really crave genshin anymore
you should wait until after that appointment then

i mean what kinda psycho has an ar50 acc that isn't their main
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
like nabbing an acc that already did all the content from the first 3 region
and i also dunno how much fun that'd be
cause for one, i'm still attached, more to the honkai one under the same credential than genshin, but ye, so it'd end up more as lend than give
i have mine but idk if it's a good idea

<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
i'm watching
so there's a big filter for raids
at least it's hardcore
past wow expansion when they play tho, there's not much drama, they just chill and do the new raids as they can
i mostly watch otv peeps, they joined the guild this time so like maybe
i dunno actually
the drama is going to go insane once they start raids n shit
it's a fuckton of people in that guild tho
so it just work out that way
i dunno actually, for this one i think a lot of streamer already want to play hardcore wow
oh damn soda is marked red by shinigami eyes
idk if asmongold is there, but probably
it's soda's guild <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
oh wait
soda's there
in the same guild even
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
how did every streamer start playing hardcore wow
hey lumi
:ta:
do you think any other gacha company has what it takes?
yeah that's true for sure
it certainly looks great too
with covid
was it lucky release timing?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i don't really know what about genshin made it so big
how likely do you think that is
valo is so big and it's not even out in CN yet
that's fucking insane actually
oh damn
did valo do that before release or did they just wait 2 year before cn release?
would be hard to pass ccp check
oh i guess a game where one of the faction you play every game is terrorist
i think people were just making up shit
do you think mihoyo would ever release a genshin valorant
tof <a:ModCheck:1021871712339505232>
speedrunner at heart
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
half the valk unironically better dps to just not include them
god inazuma releases were actually <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
it was legit kinda scary for him
yeah i was joking, i don't think uba actually went to jail but he did get legal letters or something like that
yeah he just step too many lines
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>

true where's her big hat

carv commented on it so i don't think it is
you're a discord mod?
1st rule is like no keilo allowed or smth
you think if i check tot subreddit
i don't know anyone who plays it
gi, gsr, gi3, gzz

i love that more people are calling gsr gsr out of spite
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>

oh shit true, i didn't notice
i really don't
and that's it?
like i guess same hair color and same eye color
she don't even look that much like jingliu
i don't see anything else anyone is onto
genuinely the only one i see is same color scheme of bella
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
not like He already ain't doing that
i mean He isn't wrong, being a mod there must be turbo hell but like
as if that matter for anyone
oh they think she's a durandal expy because of same jp va
can you imagine if He becomes a mod
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i thought she was gsr for sure
ngl i only figure out now that she's a main genshin valk
<a:BatChesting:903461076614656091>
durandal from the honkai?

unironically reading is a self debuff
imagine reading
they go <a:WHAT:1108876595546050610> the qua dps is a qua dps
kinda crazy how back in her release everyone act like that
just a little weird cause the art style is slightly different from everything else
oh true
why did they use ggz dpe art
i mean i respect it actually
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>

does it do this
you didn't prove yourself to be worth His time yet
i don't blame Him
can you expose him we won't judge
the aqua in your walls is talking to you
they would die i think
<a:ratJAM:794700933144903690>
that one, i mean
just makes you so you don't die from it when you get it
vaccine doesn't make you immune
actually impossible for me not to get it after she did
it was just doomed at that point
and my sister got it first
it's highly transmissible that one
i mean that one wasn't my fault
i still have scars from it tho
i spent a week at home, that was so fun
getting chickenpox was sick
a lot of younger me choices were made around the possibility of getting to miss school because of it, actually
me neither, i just assume they got to miss school once they got it
maybe that was the tech i was missing
i did still wash my hands after going to the bathroom though
i mean but like maybe they were lying and just trying to get us to have better hygiene
and it didn't work
so i went so if i do that i'll get pink eye and get to miss school
so people were saying often, don't touch stuff a lot of other people touch and then touch your eyes without washing your hands first
and we were having like a wave of cases of it
i mean okay, pink eye is transmissible, right?
more like i'd touch door handles
what no, not like shit like that
i also think i have an aura that makes people trust me
i mean i never said that to anyone until now
not very actually
sure
i'll dm you it
never worked though
when i was younger, i'd purposefully touch like dirty stuff and then touch my eyes to try and get pink eye so i could miss school
do you wanna see it
oh i've seen a furry comic like that
nevermind fucking overwatch player i'm done here
i'm still in shock that you're-
write more instead of commenting on tiktok
you're merciful
okay thank god
actually don't answer that
are you out of my league though
i'll ask you out thinking you're a girl
touch grass
tiktok comments you're down tremendous
go write on a diary or smth
just stop arguing with that kind of person tho, it's actually meaningless
it's alright
every trans people has thoughts like that to a degree
like you say that but you're trans
i mean
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
the amount of transphobe i see that goes everyone goes to sleep wishing they wake up a girl, that's normal, you're supposed to hold it down
it's crazy
i worry if i was younger in this society, i would've been a trans man
even jk rowling said before something like
easily 80%+
i'm talking about the people who go out on free time to argue about trans people
like sure that's a little transphobic but like around average
i'm not talking the ones who are chill and if you ask about trans people they go eh kinda weird
i'm talking about the people who are like way too transphobic or homophobic
30% is waaaay too low
no, being stupid and being scared of being gay
like, i'm talking about people like that one tho
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i think they're correlated tho
i think that's a fair societal explanation
i mean like sure
are just scared they might be trans or gay
80%+ of people who are above average transphobic or homophobic
i genuinely believe like
i have taken the blackpill tho
like it's not guarantee but it's so funny if it works
ooo a shot in the dark one is something like sounds cool, come back in a few years once you figure out you're trans
i mean do whatever
and if you're wrong i'll tell you so
okay i'll start listening to them all and i'll tell you what are, objectively, the best ones
i don't wanna type all that
i don't argue semantics, how's the therapy?
the solution to that is just to shit on her
they're bating argument to make you look bad and change onlooker mind
they're not baiting argument to change your mind
they're not arguing any legitimate point
i mean i'm actually not joking
i mean i guess you can tell them to kill themselves
which is why it's meaningless to argue with them if you don't understand what they really mean, they're arguing completely in bad faith
the question what is a woman? by itself is a trap, they will only accept an answer to a standard of objectiveness which is impossible for any answer to hold up to, even their own
they deeply misunderstand the function of language
that one is also not objective, obviously
and then they give the alternative of adult human female, the core issue is just that
the whole argument is that the way trans people define woman isn't objective, which is true
a big part of her deal is that she goes trans people don't have a good definition of woman but i do, and it's adult human female
or the posie parker thing
what is a woman? thing is like either a conservative thing, there was the matt walsh movie
contrapoints jk rowling video gets into it if you wanna watch someone who knows more about it than me talk about it
not yet
and it's just not worth the effort
you won't be able to beat them if you aren't familiar with their arguments
those are the type who just vomit out premade argument
i mean don't bother with it tho
oh yeah that's the usual terf stuff
selectively bred social media for arguing
tailormade for arguing
reddit is like
like how the platform works for argument
i'm talking purely based on platform, not the people who are in there
did i forget one?
discord > reddit > tumblr > twitter > facebook > tiktok/youtube
if i were to rank places to argue it'd be like
that's okay just do that somewhere else
chill out buddy
than tiktok comments
you have more to do with your life

what the fuck is going on
like if you're comparing overall valk dps then you compare overall valk dps
it's still stupid to say it like that tho
like IO don't do shit without ult every rot
i mean i guess that's fair, it's not really true that even valk back when i played always had big and small rot that is forced by the dps valk
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

thoughts?
thanks tet you're the best, love you
that does look better
so you can have a conversation starter with him!
actually if you think about it it's way more likely you only picked the same color as gresham
like you aren't too
as if people would make decisions that don't involve me specifically
i believe you
yea ok
i already confuse cata and epi
cause you know that's how i am
you picked same name color as gresham just to fuck with me
also what the fuck you aren't gresham
that looks very unoptimise
is that a good ref?
what bosses?
oh shit?

i'm trying to figure out how it look
okay it's fine

my sensei only start a bit earlier than me too, like a year or so

is 3280 bchip
the number i remember
i understand why though
i feel like manga/anime have a huge problem with good ending
does it drop like a normal amount?
i watch the first few episode back when i still watch anime and the premise was interesting
dr stone
is that one good?
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>

2 huge redstone addition
yeah it's sick
<:stopbeingMean:870200690956460052>
jesus christ
i think so
yeah i can see why tumblr is obsessed over this
the VA are pretty great and it looks great
i watched the first few minutes and it's actually really high quality
and it's on youtube
i look into it further tho, i think only the pilot's out
so like <:shrug:877047647511384064>
the only clip i saw of the show is the one where she goes i put a headset and now i'm here so i think it's a vrchat kinda thing
the clown is a kid tho i think
digital circus something
oh are you talking about that new show tumblr is obsessed about?
didn't he pull 2s1?
why is his ult on p2 so <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
like if some acc name betterkeilo show up and it just rank above me every cycle with lower rank valk
i think that would fuck with me
and they're kithpilled
it'd be like watching and copying a ref
hurts their ego
yes, ruby?
or like if they're listening to spotify you can see what song

it's literally impossible for anyone that join the game after 2021

no he's a tft special

that's insane
regionals
and it happen on a tourney
like it's crazy, i've never seen something like that
i saw this, holy shit man

everyone rank scams nowadays
i don't think i've even see any s0 gameplay
oh ok
gd damage is fucking nut too tho

i genuinely cannot begin to understand why he thinks the rotation look scuff
do you think i'll be punished for questioning His word
now we wait
i just @ him on maincord about it
what are you on
:iaskk:
okay i ask
i'll ask
i genuinely have no clue
thank god we can at least turn off her qte
ew
she's the best valk in the game even while she's being held down by that old hag eden
yeah
Not only is Lillia as sweet as a button, but her gentle heart is much too tender to ever call me out for eating venison cutlets at the dinner table. You just know that the darling doe will chew on her kale salad and listen to my mastications in uncomfortable silence. At night I could go to bed knowing that I'll have good dreams, because my dreamy doe is across the hall, existing platonically. On Halloween we'd watch horror movies. She'd grab my hand whenever something in the film frightened her, but I'd respectfully nudge it away because we're just friends.
she is definitely hella cute tho

and i open the post and it's locked <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and there was one meme that was talking about how taliyah can be read as a trans allegory
i just look into league meme subreddit
my runes
you're speaking in runes but like
i unironically can understand it now
thanks so much
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
of letters
can you do emotes instead
can you draw a picture?
him her him her him her what the fuck are you talking about <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
i cannot follow
waaaay too many pronouns
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah, they also forget that the nazis very openly said at the beginning that they were taking notes from the US
yeah, eugenics ending up having this strong connection with nazi is in a way kinda harmful cause when someone mentions it they go that's the nazi thing right? they're gone
no, injected with contraceptives
yeah it's shit like that, it happens to this day
one group that famously used it as an excuse to try and exterminate bad genes are the nazis
and people used that baseline as an excuse to be racist
i mean yeah, it started with a really bad scientific paper
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it hopefully does not sound good
and stuff like that
by like prohibiting people with those worse genes to reproduce
eugenics is specifically that they believe that certain genes are superior than others and are willing to act in some way to make those better genes prevail over the worse ones
it's not that vague
that's pretty funny
oh! haha eight like ate
yes ruby?
that good enough?
i'll give you a catkiss
<a:catKISS:825671833109921852>

what
hak

you only need 3
you do 2 dodges with LY, 1 with JK and for some reason a 4th dodge with LY?
and your dodging is a little weird
you can probably save points by getting better rng on mobs
like <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
melon is literally a personification of legoshi's worst fears about race mixing but he overcomes that and stays with haru anyways
when like
i don't even know if their issue is that this manga has eugenics as an issue the main character deals with or if they somehow think the manga is pro eugenic
the manga does touch on eugenics-like themes but
it's like so this character has some things like me but like the story isn't taking their side at every point? so like....
yeah this is kinda what i'm seeing is all <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
this is the rest of it
yea they go beast mode
yes, ruby?
beastars is meant for mature audience with reading comprehension i mean at least they're accepting that it isn't for them

it's just the role color
blue?
i'm gonna horb all over the place
so you'll know when i'm typing for a bit
i don't wanna try turning them all back on cause i did that once and my discord perma crash
my other ones aren't back yet tho
i'm attached
i'm faceblind at this point, i tell who's saying what by their text color
i'm too used to it now
oh thank god, my ugly role color plugin is working again

super jambread winner
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
the sjws
it's a thing like black (preto) is color, negro is race
if you call black people black, it's offensive, like the color black
yeah, in portuguese it's kinda backwards
what about it
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
yeah i do those
oh the candy, nvm
i'm like first off, can you say that, second off, what
yeah that's how i react any time someone talks about it
a direct translation is something like black lady's tit
oh we have something kinda like that here and the name is kinda weird
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
is the better version have kink instad of vanilla?
thanks mom

it's cause i said earlier that the name i'd prob pick for transition would be luna
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
oh i forgot lk2 name is luna
no downsides
you can also siphon the money from the fascists and use it on booba game
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
unironically not a bad idea
aqua income is infinite money glitch from almost dying and suing the military

you could work a minimum wage job and buy LK2 instead

they're both going to jail
not my problem
she fucked my mom
but like in a way that won't creep them out
how do i open up to my friend that i have feelings over them
we're not gonna judge
it's okay
you can just pick the weeb one
any language is difficult to learn
kiss a girl
get a job
idk adult stuff
you should get out of bed
that'd be so fun! i've been meaning to for a while now
like a test
ask me if i wanna watch utena with you
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
you can chill out
it's okay
pick me pick me
oh pick me mom
me too
what's wrong with the pyro guy
yea you pronounce it segway
and i'm going to segue into...
move without interruption from one topic to the next
segue is the one that fucks me up
the rules are bullshit but you can ask someone like carv and it'll kinda make sense while he tells you the rules and then you see it a bit more and it makes no sense still
french is like anime language
damn you're a beast at that then
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>

and i don't really know how that works
i think my first crush in kindergarten was lesbian already
that's my line
i'll do it if it's funny enough
so i did it
but that one was a funny <:seele:963352407365017640>
yeah i don't wanna be weird
you could post furry art, that was an acceptable answer
you're like 14
look at this one
some furry art
the right answer to turning me on was like
one upping tet like that <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
nice flex
okay
i'm so fucking sleepy but my class start in 2 hour and if i nap i'll wake up in 10
yeah i do my best
your idea of what turns me on is weird tet
n-nice?
yeah
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
so it's a buff for some no?
and now it's like 28% max all
like it was 28% fire 21% lightning max before
oh really?
they were different before
it's slightly more for some styles
12 is like a toddler
they imprinted on you
aww
i mean yea that's fair, i think that's potentially a little weird
i'm not that weird
wait what the fuck
like a doggy
if i see someone i like i smile and wave bigly
that sounds like something i'd do
it certainly depends on how receptive you are to it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that's a good one, it doesn't turn me on but it does raise you on my list of worthy people
there's a what?
okay terrible opener
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
do your worse
you have 1 try to turn me on
okay try it
getting turn down by you is very funny to me
like [redacted]
well ok more like, with cishet people it's very obvious to me
it's coming isn't it
<a:NervousSweat:765639934555324486>
but i think lately every time it happen i'm like
it doesn't happen often
yeah
yeah
oh ok
thank you
i do love apple slices
i'll make you unable to flirt with me then
i tell cherry i can't wait to watch utena with you and cherry tells me nah chill out buddy and like what other choice i have than to chill out
it's really not even a bad thing tho, impossible for me to feel bad about it
jesus my bad
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like
your friend confesses her feelings to you and you go nah
cherry i don't mean to flame but you're really great at that
i'm like a rockruff to tet i think
oh it was a misunderstanding i think, she said okay mon
like polar opposite
you're like the opposite of cherry, tet
jesus christ
you can fill it in with your imagination
it helped me realise i'm probably ace
that is how i act too yes and then one time [redacted] and i kinda regret it but it's alright
yk?
i wonder how it'd feel to stab it
i rarely let the platform pick what i watch/listen
so i didn't mind the downgrade on that
but i'm not a really big algorithm fan
youtube music has a way worse algorithm
i only did youtube premium cause i could cancel spotify and use youtube music aswell
i mean that's fair, same
but also it's not like it's going straight to big google pockets
yeah, it's certainly worth it based on how much i use it alone
all youtuber who talk about earning also say how much youtube premium watcher pay them better
i pay youtube premium, i don't mind paying tbh <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
do you live with that
like how
????
nice
i'd rather die
watching youtube with ads is actually impossible
<:seele:963352407365017640>
which one
shouldn't it be like boundaries or
i don't get why it's freud
yeah make cherry work for it
how are you closer to my mom than me
not even i do that
i'm okay with fucking my mom but i draw the line on asking her for mcdonalds
i'm uncomfortable
freudian slip
yeah she fucked my mom
tet called me a pokemon
aw

or your devil....
i can be your friend

god he's so funny on current loop

wait what the fuck even happen to seal in the past loop
he won't let anyone ruin his dream of becoming Him

we should've warned central before he join
way too much i think
i joke but missing some sp valk rank is legit hopeless
now it's coin and sp rank diff
i knew he would do it in the future
i morbed actually
me too
oh
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
impossible to compete
2s2 END vs fragile's s0, but too much dkey diff
somehow it happen a lot to him
that's what one would think
well
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
if he doesn't do you think he'll say something like huh she's dealing way less damage <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
do you think he'll go for 6 lightning line like he had on beta
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
do we know how much He pull for
do you even believe in Him that much
you only pull s1 tho
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
will he <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
4 line already sound like above average tbh
and figure out how much other people have
prob just wait until abyss open?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah, ruby?
that's not what flat dmg is, i do think it is affected by dmg boost
yeah
my mind is huge
were you reading that one too carv
it was pretty great
<:smoge:959781798181736478>
they would never do that for genshin or genshin
mihoyo is so kind for us favorite children
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
can it be not like that
sure i'll kiss you too
ill kiss u lumi

<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331> <:jphPlus2:1062420906720366632>
the other is Unreasonable
one of those is reasonable
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
author is cooking
the pacing of the second line answering all of them
the first message is a good hook, leaves a lot of questions in your mind
good writing
LMFAO
that's not bad
marrying is also not good
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> i don't have a clue what radio shack is
nothing good
thank god
is it still open
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU HAPPY BIRTHDAY
FUCK WAIT
lyri big nessie enjoyer
my bad then
oh
that's the book?
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
i was expecting march
that's fucking great
whoa what?
oh ok
is going to have nightmares about this for the rest of his life
before this patch
the guy who push the demacia change and think easy bugfix <:Clueless:996308692133761094>
when is worlds?
poor guys
they can't just do worlds on a patch behind
like rush bugfix?
man this is crazy, what even is the plan then
be careful to not misclick one of them and open a 5 minute tutorial!
i didn't know that part, what the fuck
<a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206>
you're joking right
no way
what
<:pojj:1067071660081020938> <a:Clap:802373413716623391>
just disable demacia now
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
jesus fuck
this is like the last patch before set 10 pbe right
did they give up on 9.5 at this point
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
is it disabled just like how think fast was disabled on rerolls
scuttle is supposed to be disabled tho no?
i heard that one
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
or a new one?
didn't it get hotfix already?
i can check out her skills to try and and figure out where that damage come from though
<a:GAMBAADDICT:1088508671144759358>
i am actually updating the game cause i heard there's a free 10 pull
yea, ruby?
skills
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
no
it's like 10+500 vs 13+500, who care
then my intuition would be that the actual value barely matter
i mean if the way the lightning affix work is like judah where each different hit proc a +flat amount to the hit
jesus christ <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
<:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
get these
the carv yearns for <#981296993295040512>
<a:TheVoices:1143681011272659015>
🧱
cause they look the same <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it's going to be really trippy now
i think they also mention that they're going to cut in footage from the film from 15 year ago
a lot less manpower needed, cut a lot in makeup costs
true
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
but mem cho?
and like i get the for kana and akane
shit about mem cho also feels a little unearned? like she kana and akane were filming that one scene and someone told ruby you're gonna have to be on their level
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i guess they aren't like fully canon tho
i kinda feel like they're double dipping on the one filler mini chapter that was about mem cho too
long haired kana...
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the latest one tho <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
to see more character study of ai
the one before actually got me hyped
yeah
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
people are bricking their accs
kinda hard tho
some employer will take you with no formal knowledge if you impress them enough <:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
it depends
good luck
i dunno
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
if you write it i'll post it
you should make a tumblr callout post
discord just update and break a lot of plugin
oh apparently my betterdiscord isn't broken because i'm cursed
avians can be beasts
but also,
my fursona is not an avian
it'd only hold me back
i'm already a fucking beast without a physical form
yeah exactly
but i mean maybe
hopefully not
i'd like to have no physical form and to not be perceived
i think so
yeah
i need to replace the circuit breaker
yeah from what i'm reading
i'd rather die i think
so it's fried
and it fries
it was made on the air fryer
i mean
more like fried
i guess theyre not grilled
grilled cheese
extension running to fridge
fucked up grill
okay my phone is charged now
nevermind actually kinda worth
and it got so pretty
woah i did my grilled cheese on the air fryer instead
the worse that can happen is i set the building on fire
okay i'm gonna eat my snack while i watch a 20 minute video on how to fix it
bet
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
so i'm here with my sister and a roomie
i'm at college city
my plan was just to call an electrician
for like a person
do you think it's possible?
for me
i think luna would be the name i'd pick
which one
like
and they go to the kitchen and it's that fucked up
like what if someone wakes up before i wake up
do i even sleep now
i turn it upside down and it's fucked up
i'll take a pic of what the grill look like
it is, actually
there just ain't no way man
my betterdiscord also stop working
this is my villain backstory
there'll be no more kitchen plugs
like for fun
i'm not plugging that shit in somewher else, what if it trips another breaker
<a:NOOO:844609807675162685>
my fucking snack
worst part is
what the fuck man
3 am and i almost set fire on the house
one of the circuit breaker pop
so shit doesn't spoil
so i could plug the fridge somewhere else
and move the fridge
so i had to steal my sister's extension
and half of the kitchen plugs stopped working
it made a pop
and then the plug unironically exploded
on one of these grills
i was going to make a late night snack
man what the fuck
<a:HoVLoading:755152253278617753>
and they went nono, the 3 one
and i went like star rail? that was a while ago but ye
an irl friend came up to me recently and went oh i saw that honkai release recently
share?
oh that sounds sick
oh god i'm hungry
what else are you crafting?
who cares
build bke = craft dante?
i mean
if you think about it
she's autist about a letter like i'm autist about furries
you gotta find the entrance to this park
10 runs ps4
if you spend same time training on phone and keyboard, you'll do better on keyboard
but it's just objectively just a better way to play
i mean yea you gotta get used to new controls
oh shit coffee's there
so it's prob gone
oh, but it was on my old yt acc right?
yeah i think i commented on it
it's why we have canonically vague relationships like raiden i'll gladly become a sinner mei and kiana
so true bestie <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
they wouldn't axe a manga on its peak right
i guess idk how cutthroat jump is but like
but like that arc was soooo good
i mean i guess i can kinda see it, after that i could see having a peaceful ending
wait really?
i think i like the change of structure the story just had, it feels way more chaotic now
i'm a little after seal got introduced
oh i'm done
for now
definitely my favorite arc
yeah it was insane
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
oh okay
they brought isshin back for spring arc, interesting character i think
also did undead unluck author forget about phil and isshin <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
yeah
i also hope he doesn't tho, the way taiki and chi are acting about it is SO cute right now <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
he hasn't really done anything to point to that besides just introduce the character
hmmm yeah
like an actual one, not like the one with hina
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
do you really think author is cooking a love triangle
yeah
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528> lot of words to say idk
glad to be of help
very important difference <a:Nerdge:1010710823037059163>
the second from screenshot is not tdm, it's tdm taken
the ones you said
yeah those
pleeeease
i would do anything
someone leak it
for the love of god
please
i think you can mute retweets and likes
sorry aster
oh.
yeah that's so fucking annoying, why can't you just not be weird <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
it's the same thing as act age right?
holy shit
<:ohnobirb:948935560091807744>
and that's about it
like that it exists
i know about it
the other author i know has drawn porn of their manga is itaparu, beastars author
yeah
ain't no fucking way right
i get the same feeling from made in abyss author
where tet
the 2 cherry sent with no context don't look bad to me tho
this one isn't normal tho <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
aw the sentihua one is so cute
i feel left out
aw man
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
who let intern kun do the animations
what the fuck
me too but this was like purgatory for him
yeah they did that study back when chibi was still around too
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
average autist has 3 points of miopia factoid is actualy just statistical error. miopia georg,
i know him too
did he also guzzle down spiders
astigmatism and miopia georg,
that's actually a misconception
you don't even have to be my friend to tell that one
obviously
i'll do powerpoint presentations if the joke is convoluted enough
they're like if we ask about it she'll explain it for 15 minutes
it's okay my friends understand
i'm just the only one who laughs <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
i mean i definitely make those kinds of jokes in other places, like irl too
like in a gooood way?
is everyone here like acting in the way they should instead of how they really are
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
wait what
idk about anyone else
i can because i am
so you're hiding who you really are
idk maybe she left or smth
40 seconds after she send a message
i like that you pinged her
i don't think i have any friends that do yet
oh it'd be sick if you used neo pronouns
fucking school assignment or smth
cherry's pronouns is like
ok?
uh
oh ok
<:Dank:911882500350046258>
i still don't know if you're fucking with me about cherry so i think i'll just avoid pronouns for now
<a:dankMelt:1093274354801975347>
sounds good
my brain is huge
LMFAO
fucking insane
my pronouns are whichever pronoun you use for yourself
that was pronoun metagaming
did you see the one
that too
sure
it was 100% serious please
i asked earlier for someone to give me gender patch notes and i think people thought it was a joke
wait are you actually trans <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
hey i asked you questions too, chill <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
the trans closet or the furry closet?
you're trans?
what do you me refurrying
i'm taking that one
aw fuck yeah nevermind
oh i'll take the ocd one too
are you trans yet? can i get credit for that one?
can i get credit for one of them
you're like thanos huh
cats
tet do you know what else mirrors
dissolver?
oh
occult compulsions disorder
is that what the c stand for?
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
like idk if that's ocd but that's weird
that doesn't sound normal though
ocd werewolf
are you like
is it your birthday today
the closest i have to shit like that is needing to do something perfectly once
huh
it's probably bad tho cause they don't name good things
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
so i know nothing
and i know just as much from tumblr post that those are not really it
all i know is like the stereotypical stuff like pattern seeking
i don't actually know what real ocd entail
like you know [cursed thing] but not frotting
my bad i do know what frot is, i just thought i'd get a funny reaction out of that
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518> like oral
that's cute
oh to commemorate sw release?
what's that
<:lewd:959737567119556618>
oh god
surely there are
you think there's like cock size quiz?
and compare it with lumi
you could measure it and let us know
<a:TheVoices:1143681011272659015>
feel like they'd get you back in for schizo testing
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
that explains so much
damn that sucks or
are you like
if you get aoad (assigned ocd at doctor)
congrats on the cock, though
i dunno if you actually have ocd or not now
like agreed
i mean that's alright it just sounds really funny
i'll take it
thanks
LMFAO
thanks
and that's p nice of you
you know, that kinda imply i'm not already annoying
<:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512> cd
is that a good try?
i am scared that people will leave me when they find out who i really am
me? i mean alright
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
lmfao
o c deez nuts?
oh no
what's the 5th one?
also isn't that 4?
does that count? is that even related to the initial tweet
ayyyy soros
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
is she doing the fucking military wife thing but for ceo?
CEO partner in life
nevermind
im sure if you scroll long enough on any musk tweet you'll find that
well that's kinda cheating actually
oooooh there we go, i think that one comic is jews right?
i'll give myself half a point on that one
public interest is under control of tiny groups okay that's kinda like jews
my guy what
\> no profit, only pay wages and fees
\> sounds pretty lucrative for a non profit
yeah i guess my instinct was wrong but what the fuck is last guy on
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
i wanna know if my instinct that it's something something jews is right
the blue replies please
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
so i can't read any replies or anything
but i deactivate my twitter
i found the tweet
peepeepedia
hehehe wouldn't it be funny if like, instead of wikipedia it was like... penis
i mean the specific part where he goes
my guy is 12, maybe 13
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
but then i found this instead
cause i get the feeling that the real reason for that tweet is something something jews
okay i went to look for that tweet
for fun
he read that somewhere and just made shit up afterwards
it's like 20gb
like, it is empirically true that the text part of wikipedia will fit in your phone
he probably read that somewhere and spit it out without really understanding what it means
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
\- quote by the guy who managed to lost billion on the social media which is only text
have you ever wondered why the foundation that takes care of everything besides text on wikipedia is so expensive when the text part is so small
not only is he the guy running twitter, he's the guy who has a concerning amount of power in the ukraine war
i have no other word for it
unironically retarted
cute
and searching for pic on discord ate a fuckton of data <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
i tried looking for the ones i had
remember me about that later
like if i make a weird sound
it only happens in emergency
but i don't think they realise they can do that
mine have jumped really high before, if they get scared or smth
damn holy
he doesn't really complain about it tho
or follow you everywhere
oh not like that, he's clingy in the way where if you're standing beside the couch, he will jump into you so you catch him
he wants uppies all the time
orange is definitely the clingiest
idk, so i have 3 black/white one, 1 black and 1 orange
i think that's racist, tet :/
so she doesn't chew the main one
she bought her a separate phone charger for her to chew through
and she spoils her heavily
my cousin got a cat recently
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
i think the orange one i'd be able to
i didn't manage to find a pic i had of one of them
he's eaten through multiple earphones
is the one that likes to chew cables
only the orange one
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198> <a:catPls:1159921785890951198> <a:catPls:1159921785890951198> <a:catPls:1159921785890951198> <a:catPls:1159921785890951198>

only discord is working for some reason
but it's really wonky
i'm trying to usb tether it to my pc
i'm stealing my father's
he got the secret spaghetti <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
yea
like the cable was for my cat?
<a:Panda_thanos:598682299940470785>

<a:AINTNOWAY:1050211099158511626> what the fuck
<a:dankMelt:1093274354801975347>
it looks dank as hell
like for me, as a treat
they should've played a little of befall on sirin patch pv
befall still slaps so hard
does that make sense
but not for the damage
yeah for the mobs
but it's stardust damage
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
we just say lightning
we don't call lightning lgt
stardust?
okay
oh is that what we're calling stardust
it had a symphony on release too, with all 2 songs it had
cause gsr got one already
neglected
is genshin like just
surely genshin story is past the point where honkai got the himeko cg
like when is genshin getting a good vocal song <:Dank:911882500350046258>
also that song make me think about
what the fuck is going on there
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
okay what would you prefer
nevermind
<a:popCat:870449179695145031>
oh wait it's popcat right
idk it's the catpop i have
<a:catpop:971378373790162984>
it has to pop with an enemy around to do anything
i think
cause when you look at around with SI before HoS spawn, the clone is already gone
that definitely popped early
did you turn off clone pop
can't compete
lumi poor f2p player
what's ruby have to do with this

he'd be crucified in one of these

hot pv gd
i'm talking about the old strat
i mean idk tho
if it's anything else, then it's skill issue
if your issue is pv sp, then it's 3s pv issue
you can just try it
3s pv is sp tho
for the old strat, it was necessary for cap
i just don't have much experience in picking my kids up from school
i'm not talking about the style tho

and i go so that's an 893
i'm watching speedrun breakdown and they go this is basically perfect, -0.1s split
honkai MA broke my brain i think
how much do you think she can grind while going on endless tours
i mean can you really judge
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
that's kinda based actually
dealing with trauma by writing manga about it

that shit is legit scary
i mean with reason
jesus christ
beastar mangaka never show up without her chicken mask

which is boring
Himmscher just looks like you're capitalising properly
herrscHim is funnier because of weird capitalisation
i'll take a +1 but i don't respect that opinion
if the joke was funny, they'd add +2 minutes to the timer, if it wasn't they'd remove -2
every time he made a joke, chat would decide if the joke was funny or not
there was a jerma stream where he had to speedrun a game with a time limit
okay so tl;dr
that's a +2 right
when aqua gets a power up, we should call Him herrscHim
i can repeat it
you'd love it tet
did you see my aqua herrscher joke
can you explain it to me again
to me
and two, i don't think the way you explained it before made sense
lumi i've been hearing more of this word i, one, forget what the meaning is
my sister went to college city for first week of classes and she staying home 4 out of the 5 days lmao
you gotta make your own fun for first week
**they're removing pericles and brick**
i can capscore that
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>

i'm gonna be honest i don't think i ever got the 893 before with ft bb ch on dxy
ooh an 893
oooh i got an 840
why the fuck is this the default
these fufcking jp voicelines are going tomake me go insane
god i'm awful at that one

oh shit dxy
i'm following His teachings, i got the 2s but i'm not even going to level her skills
i'm out of money
is this when she starts to get good? <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
oh shit
but my mom said i shouldn't be ashamed of it and i just need to wait for the right lady
damn me too
maybe dpe too, idk what's her state
so basically everyone but v2v
i would backpull every valk with an MA boss if i were to come back
i got a stable job
i got this
it's fine
just take a small loan
it's not even that many valks i'm missing
i could come back and backpull
man i miss this game <:life:1001518241610485781>
jesus christ i have almost all g3 stigs
that not even i would bother to at this point <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
or niche MA stuff
is farming cope stig for fun
like the only thing that matter for you now
oh ok
that's kinda cool
you can craft sirin a now?
yeah it barely matter tbh
you can still do it for vb er
dirac ain't bad
a shui set is prob good to have, some avo too
lemme log in to see what's in there
can't you do whatever the fuck you want then?
god damn it cherry
you broke it
idk what you have and what you don't have <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
do you have all g4 already
ain't that pretty fast
huh
oof bestie
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
and they were prob not lying, i was just watching 2 year old guide
so i crafted them
but they just said they're good stigs for MA
i don't have thales to this day
i probably wouldn't have crafted them either
if they told me they were cope options
no i mean
that's not what my guides told me
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
actually that's a lie, i definitely used sloth in elites abyss
i don't think i ever used any of them
by old MA vids
i crafted them because i was told to
i think i even have wrath
you don't have knight sloth pride?
god 2
if aqua gets a power up, we should start calling Him herrscHim
good writing?
true actually
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i mean he's like a 40 y/o that act like he's 14
diavoros got powercrept by Him and He doesn't even have herrscher in the name
how is it again
powercrept
which i guess is harassment
every time he send something stupid we'd square up
def raised the interaction up
i think he used to be good rage bait at wfp
really?
i can logically see that they're a bad person but i'm like, okay marvel writing
but when one gets this like, cartoonishly evil
i think he pissed me off a good amount at once
yeah that's fair
like Him
his stuff wasn't really entertaining
well i guess yeah
that question was directed to the fucked up ones here
i mean you're normal carv
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
are we happy he got banned tho
definitely the first
that is true
maincord moderation better than wfp?
he's said some shit before
i mean he doesn't talk there anymore but like
is he banned from wfp yet
i've seen it before and i don't like it
i hate that
whose chat is that
<:letcook:1093482053879742474> gods peed
i'm gonna question Him, He probably didn't test her in ER
i like that other guy
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
i have no clue honestly
red 7
we can play right now if you want
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
that's how a1 or a2 felt like on my acc
jesus fuck
this is an example of his scores at the start of a stream
a lobby of tft is 8 player, a game is like 20-30 minute long
k3soju, also known as soji... or big bro, is a pro tft streamer who has recently been having giga lose streaks
big bro rp
big bro can't get a break
that's fair
ain't that way more boring
and not owning certain valk
i knew about dorm changes but i didn't know the level now is what scale the elemental bonuses
<:life:1001518241610485781>
they made it easy mode?
and the affix count as a different instance of damage for that, but not for hitcount shield
where it add flat amount to every instance of damage
maybe it act kinda like judah?
built on duct tape
cool
lightning line on pv did nothing to hitcount shield
so like you had to have fire + ice on pv
back in 2s couatl, ele affix from same type of damage just get added to your total hit damage
inconsistent but ok
that's
is that how it works?
why is it good on lk2?
icic
or is getting just a single one already way more rare than i remember
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i'm assuming having the first just makes the second more rare or smth?
i wouldn't think what you already have in one line would affect the roll on the second line
i wonder how that works
that's interesting
oh hmm
do you have to do the thing where you unlock the second line by rolling into that?
wait how does that work?
oh ok
did i get like turbo lucky or
for 2s couatl
cause i have a zhenyi with fire/ice hit
is it like 2 of the same the rare one?
it's that rare?
<a:NervousSweat:765639934555324486>

<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
can He do this though
the second one is kinda nice
show
is it permanent
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it's how aqua knew hare was going to top score at homies
that's mom that dies in the first episode haircut
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> yeah the powerlevel is kinda stupid
reverse built different
oh that sounds really fun
i wasn't playing on set 6, obviously, so i don't really know what enable flex play before
changing the augments? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
is the way to fix it like
yeah it kinda feels doomed
boxbox played well on the tourney but it was kinda luck base cause it only happen cause the comp he had a lot of practice happen to be the broken one
yeah, it's really rough for certain type of player
wasn't multicaster already like ok
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>

i complain before that i never got in but like
<a:pepeW:950326333009956884>
honkai homework
it's like
that's fucking crazy
i would definitely do the same
they prob get in for a patch, do nothing and then get flushed
yeah, it actually don't surprise me now that so many rando people get in
i didn't think it was that bad
yeah i lied, i didn't make it up, i did hear something like that but it was from like not trustworthy source
jesus christ
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i just made that up
wait that's true?
i heard that in genshin beta test, they force you to do slave labor for 2 weeks for 320 primo

they design a few skin, a few skill that t game can use
t game concept room
yeah
it's where they can get skin and set idea
arcane is a better game than league if you think about it
the other one is a guy called jack
maybe the wiki isn't updated though
nah
poro king is kinda boring tho
3 according to the wiki
t game is enough
well it'd be unfair if riot had 2 good card game
this girl is the one yuumi is looking for
oh shit there's cardgame exclusive champion

i hadn't seen that one before
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
maybe neeko should be in every category
cause she can just shapeshift a bit, if that was a case neeko would be in every category
probably not right
but is she also mommy is what i'm thinking
okay sure she's definitely monsterfucker
<a:ratJAM:794700933144903690>

that's better lmao
she could step on me
i'm gonna be honest i didn't really look at her besides her face
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
maybe if she put on the glasses
that one doesn't look like vayne
yeah okay fair
yeah
the newest skins definitely
but i mean maybe
she doesn't feel vanilla to me
idk, maybe it's the spikes or latex suit
is she?
i couldn't figure out a place to put kallista or vayne
conventionally attractive, very vanilla:
ahri, akali, ashe, gwen, janna, kaisa, karma, katarina, kayle, lillia, lux, miss fortune, nilah, qiyana, riven, samira, seraphine, sivir, sona, xayah, zeri, zyra

mommy issues:
camille, diana, fiora, irelia, leblanc, lissandra, quinn, rell, renata glasc, sejuani, syndra, vayne, vi

kinda kinky:
belveth, caitlyn, elise, evelynn, illaoi, jinx, morgana, nilah, senna, zyra

furry/monsterfucker:
cassiopeia, elise, kaisa, kindred, lillia, naafiri, nami, neeko, orianna, quinn's bird, reksai, sejuani's pig, shyvana, soraka, xayah, yuumi, zyra

jail:
annie, briar, lulu, poppy, seraphine potentially, taliyah i think, tristana, vex, yuumi, zoe

buff:
illaoi, sejuani
i know some people answer would be tristana
look
oh there's seraphine too
true
if you're into morgana you're into some bdsm shit
to cover the most bases
hottest valk in league must be like, extremely vanilla right
morgana is definitely in kink territory
would
oh janna is another one of the classic hot ones
fiora, irelia, camille
there's like, the mommies
i think it's monsterfucker territory
at the very least
you're a sub if you're into them
evelynn and elise are definitely like some kind of kink
akali has the hot tattoo
kaisa maybe
who else
what even is the competition for hottest one? like ahri sure
one more than the other
i respect it
yeah, like sure i'm a furry but she's also really pretty
look at the shan hai skin
is it bad if it's unironically lilia for me
it's definitely lilia
<:nothing:990283279032803338> <:thoughtbubble:990282637270716476> 
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
<:nothing:990283279032803338> put me in coach
try retire
nevermind then
i was about to feel offended
wait i forgot you're my step mom
damn
that is legitimately unlawful and some countries do take that very seriously
that shit is a little scary for them
which is illegal
which looks just like a tweet and doesn't tell you it's an ad
apparently just recently elon enable a new type of ad
twitter is actually soooo bad right now
talking like that's not how twitter is right now
i mean
definitely a name of a book if ww2 happened now
maybe you're the nonbinary of autist
i mean it's a spectrum
ngl it does make it way more funny
already fucked it up
my bad
**just learn to be less autistic**
yeah honestly
maybe i should start boldening every message i sent that is me trolling you
i'm not
i think on avg boss you'd see like 3-5 iirc from abyss player
2 points for 1 dist is already great tbh
damn that's really fucking good
:stairge:
isalright tho you can just imagine them
man i don't have any emotes
:staree:
this <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> close
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
:dankwalk:
:donkwalk:
they can definitely lie, i could probably too but i think it would just fuck with my tachiyomi
they just manually update whenever they feel like
i don't think that's how most people use these
tachiyomi autoupdate on every chapter
i mean, i think it's only an issue because of the way i use myanimelist
it's like really specific too
yeah it's kinda scary right
a lot of what i read is usually when i'm in college city with nothing to do or in commute
it's cause i'm off college
this week i've only read the new chapter of stuff
yeah
i haven't been reading that much these past few day
oh no
actually i guess it doesn't really matter
but ok
that's a little stupid
oh i see
does LE even proc her stig tho? does it need to be proc?
zhneyi for the sp, HN just deal infinite damage for fun anyways
oh that's pretty cool
for the zoomers
you could make that joke but about nintendo switch
good one
<:jphPlus2:1062420906720366632>
yes, ruby?
cool
oh wardylan still playing
last mainstory break was 5.6, arguably 5.5
they're going kinda nuts on that
damn
wait is there ch41 on 7.0?
thanks
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
they'll never use
to learn the skillset of a valk
it's also unfair to put it on new player
but like
it only really stings because new valk ain't like that
to be realistic though, i don't think i mind it that much they made old hua gameplay straightforward
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
so i can't see the name
i don't have access to ch39
can you help me fill this in
actually about that
oh i should've done that when i was on
actually insane
AE -> HRT is the biggest fuck you to micro player ever
so the best scenario is that the ones that already like it quit slow isntead of fast <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
like new people who like micro aren't sticking around
that's inevitable
game had a better balance of the two, and i definitely prefer the micro one
not saying one is better than the other
and they really don't want much micro difficulty, like how the valk actually play
like how you rotate, sp management, dealing with boss attacks
the direction that new valk release shows clearly display how they basically only care about macro difficulty
i can just argue it differently
well, my point still stands though
nvm then
oh ok
did they not? i remember hearing they fixed the ones that make s0 playable
HoF is HoF
they actively fix bug that make rots more skill intensive and interesting, like flamescion anicancels
if it's about developer intention, i think they make it really clear what they want their game to be
and went yep that's how i want it to be
like there's no way mihoyo look at an input like that, which at best feels very tight and at worse feels absolute rng
then that most certaintly is a bug
if your definition of bug is anything unintentional
they'd go what
like if you show half of the shit we do with CH in MA to mihoyo dev
but not uncommon
is probably unintended
or having very specific or weird input timing
game randomly dropping input under specific circumstance
i mean it depends on your definition of bug no
i'm a fucking beast that's what
never heard of felt that happen to me
like at the very start?
i think his attacks can be based on how close you are, yea
sheeeesh
you're my favorite accident
that's kinda fucked up, she's so impressionable, you know she'd fall for it
actually why did you teach that to lumi
<@483689649727078400> why would you make accidents
just play perfectly
why would you make accidents
like for good luck
why would you do a little tap though
if i had it solved it'd be able to give a better answer lmao
but idk
ain't no way it's anything but timing right?
which like, from how i think about stuff
my mind always default into it being timing
tbh i don't really know, i have a lot of problems on being consistent on HoH inputs
i think it's timing
thanks
so based
i can't see the fucking valks chief
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
small indie dev
i'm down to do one of those
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
the game has fucking abilities?
on the board
the non-underwater one, the underwater one is pretty boring
actually a ton of strategy involved, you can do a lot
oh wow this ring minigame is pretty great
i'm so proud that's sick
holy shit
i think i'm too much of a scrub
no luck though
aw man i logged in just to find eli in fall valks
yeah fuck her up eli
skill issue
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
<:wholetcook:1151659795531710534>
yeah he cooked and got an alergic reaction
<:StareOG:859969166480375828>
<:cocka:1112184615281623141>
<a:TheVoices:1143681011272659015>
that aqua was always right
then you'll see
the second a new support replace hrt, a new support replace gd and a new support replace lk2
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
next support is going to make lb2 from the best dps to the best dps in the game
you're right
my bad
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
how does that make sense
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
instead of... the current support being paralyse
lk2 has paralyse synergy because the next support is going to be paralyse?
what
wait that's so stupid though
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
but then he just got worse
i remember him annoying me a lot and then ruby went chill don't shit on him and i chilled out
oh
whos rei
just believe in the heart of the cards
you could get card early there too
maybe not
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
you know if you do that 4 more times....
<:SirinPat:588838587785543702>
<a:duckass:1148861036351471637>
maybe you'll get 3s kmb by eos
keep it up
i'm very proud
like a personified chastity cage
if i was there he wouldn't need to
i don't even remember how
isn't that a fucking moriso joke somehow
oh that's cool
10 runs of s2
10 runs of s1
10 runs of s0
not 10 but like at least 4 or 5, we have
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and then they complain when americans ask for that on their city
they point at a cool, livable city with probably a close community
the funniest part is just how it completely falls apart if you think about it for 0.1 second
when they say americans, they mean the sjw westerners
it's one case where right wing rhetoric gets so fucking unhinged that if you don't have 30 hours of study in it, it's completely undecipherable
that twitter acc is a right wing one, they're obsessed with like old-looking european cities on the basis of aesthetics, the reasoning being the whole thing about fascism beckoning to a great past
oh that's interesting <:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
goals
the premise seems interesting enough
<:letcook:1093482053879742474> alright
like soooo bad
they just deeply want to feel like they're the victim
ok
LMFAO
by western they mean sjw right
the rest is in genshin
call her M
i'll dm him the energy bill
my guy lives in our head rent free
is that why aqua hates her
that does surprise me tho
i'll make my ignorancy somehow not my problem
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i didn't know that
oh is it
like if kiana is only a myth
do you think they'll still release their battlesuit
if none of the old character show up as a character in honkai 4
so like gh + new trio?
cny is 7.3, right? isn't that honkai 4?
what's your bet?
hello
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
look at him go
yea that's why not even eli knows
theater near me?
or in CN
is it out right now?
honestly that sounds like a blast
ngl fall valk is a better name than fall guys
real fall guys or fall valk?
when am i getting a presentation
is it tomorrow already
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
more money for their waifu?
so what does it matter if it's s0, 2s, 3s, past 3s
like they ain't pulling for meta, they're just dumping money on their waifu
i kinda respect it?
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
all dev are working on honkai 4
if it was MA that'd be like -3
that's honestly not even that bad of a score
<a:GIGACHAD:999060597247320095>
i hope it gets better
<:SirinPat:588838587785543702>
Him and the voices inside His head
i'm surprised big bro is still playing
boxbox is taking a break off tft now, i think he's doing a league arc until set 10
that's really funny <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that's on super server right
LMFAOOOOOO
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
is doing dumb things
i think that's her whole character right now
she's pretty
but i do like new girl design
i don't really know either
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
but yeah, LE was the like ultimate one, now you'd need diversity
like carv said
well, you can still run HoT HoT lead
oh shit that's true
sim balders
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
not everyone <a:swipeboobahic:940613030968963122> like you
chill
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
is he just from the future
and also be kneecapped by bad support?
how can she both rotate perfectly comfortably and be the highest dps in the game
i can't wrap my head around a take like that
????
if it was a real server, you'd need 2s2 to beat fragile
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542> NA
after all the drama
but most people just lost hope after 3 years lmao
they did say they were going to keep updating
yeah quite big
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
it's the first update in 3 years
idk i don't believe in it either
<@241051045864800259> homestuck 2 update
it must go crazy
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>

god i hope it's me
i don't even need to read the manga
thanks, keep me updated

today's a good day
<:Wokege:862486121933701141>
oh shit
from experience, they enjoy it, they like the ones who come ask questions and ask for help
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
i feel like most professor like helping others
is your professor especially scary or smth?
icic
<a:pat:969402615538520064>

<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
so i went uh maybe later
but i was in public transport and the first page were <a:booba:815267713298858006>
i was going to start the pervert last week
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
oh really? alright
that sounds about right from what the video even talked about, it said that the biggest grant more or less matched the patreon revenue
this is their response
the ubi one definitely pushed me leftward a good amount
and from what i've watched when i was younger, i remember them being pretty good
the more important thing imo is investigating how impactful those sponsorship has in their bias and if the ideology they're pushing is good or not
like there won't be a hip and cool billionaire for you to take your money from, all of them suck
to a degree, your only choice is to either take the sponsorship and make the video or don't make the video
like, kurzgesast videos are expensive, and it's kinda inevitable that if you wanna make something that costs money, that money has to come from somewhere, someone who has money
i'd more interested in looking deeper into those videos to see what they promote n stuff
yeah idk how well i'll take those claims
when their only proof is that they were, indeed, sponsored
and claiming that the video was made FOR the organisation
there's certainly a difference between asking the question about how impactful the sponsorship has been in their bias
that's weird
the info on it is interesting but the way it goes from
i didn't know it was sponsored by this organisation -> it was made for this organisation
it smells to me of left infighting
i don't like how this video is worded <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i'll skim it <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
it doesn't surprise me that they're liberal
clearly a lot of money put into it tho
yea that's what i assumed too tbh
production wise
like they're reeeeeally high quality
you've seen the videos right?
i mean
now
so maybe they're bad about it
i did stop watching them a while back, not for some ideological reason tho
that's how every media works
yeah ofc
i don't know anything about that
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
kurzgesast videos are usually really good
yeah
wdym the association crown has star
i remember spending like 5 minutes trying to decipher what that means
griseo got wazowski'd
lmao
congrats though, the ER beast
you can do the math though
cause it's a whole card, costs way more aw/al than the handful of frag you get from dupe
value wise it's definitely ch
pretty cool
the ref isn't braindead either, like how HN ref look
actually insane
oh yeah, ruby shared it earlier
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
yea tbh lots of variance <a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
agreed, maybe cause i like girls though <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
1 2 final games lmao
big bro pop off right after it's hopeless for him
poor guys
<@180679257851166721> holy shit boxbox beasted out are you seeing this <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
how's the energy over there
oh shit big bro went 6 8 8
<a:NoUReverse:634202847592054814>
wait i got something prepared for this
completely unrelatable right now though i am going to peel my skin off
that's cute
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
jesus
watch or listen?
there it is
i lost my lilblushy
for me?
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
ofc i wanna see your art
i mean i pinged you wanting to join your art mailing list
yeah
for some reason it feels different when it's something art like that rather than a more objective skill like being good at a game <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but i think i'm too scared to face the reality that i suck really bad at it
i did want to learn to draw
handing out an invitation for me to check out the art exhibition
if i'm pinged tho that's like
and go <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> that's so pretty
i feel like i'm intruding in a space i don't belong if i just hang out there
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
i wanna get pinged though
yeah
so i can <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
so you can ping every time you draw something
you should make a role, something like @art of underarc
actually you know what
do i have to prove my age
even the nsfw one
i'm not joking tho i'd like to subscribe to tet art mail
ghostwriting for eli
message sent by that one guy in maincord
<:distracteline:530821754571194388>
i'd eat it up if it was irl <:damnshawty:803111757475610654>
<:Lewd:984884427979124816>
you sure that's fine?
it's kinda red though
what the fuck i didn't think you'd actually do it
<:lewd:959737567119556618>
and 5 min later they go wrong person and remove me
and then i go <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
i keep getting 12 year old adding me and going hi and a bunch of emoji
i think there's a tiktoker that has a name similar to mine
actually about that
mine are always on
if eli's turning dm off
<:HUH:1004782798277718077>
share?
i didn't know you drew nswf
what's that supposed to mean
<:crying:757445037402619974>
cause it looked like you were vomiting at the thought of me giving kisses
i did feel bad for a sec
okay that's really good
LMFAOOOO
if you come to brazil i'll make sure to give you lots of kisses
<a:terigrabhic:709594728039055390>
you're coming to brazil
no
<:crying:757445037402619974>
yeah wdym no
holy shit bet
like if i ask pretty please and i don't share
you break the nda for me right
eli if you get in
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i kinda wanna see that
i'll multistream boxbox and big bro
okay fine
isn't noxus cup like 6 hour?
holy shit
i think it's one of his first real tourney
yeah his performance on noxus cup been great, he really does give his all
boxbox was doing p well first 2 days
i'm trying to decide between big bro, lil bro and boxbox
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
who are you watching
if anything i'm like guys this child is masking a lot of trauma rn and you're just acting like everything is fine, she lost her fucking mom, any therapiers <a:ModCheck:1021871712339505232> 
but every time they remind me about it, it just gets worse
i mean the thing about it is that i was down to forget about it the moment coco forgot about it immediately after it happened in chapter 1
i did mention 2 negative but i'm enjoying it overall tho, the magic system is really cool and i hope they keep it up
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
<:HUH:1004782798277718077>
yesss ruin his life
i only do because it's the pairing left after i ship haru juno
oh btw if you want small updates on witch hat atelier:
- i get annoyed every time someone mention coco's mom, they're always like and you're so brave cause you care so much about your mom and like, no you don't. you got over it in An panel. the more they remind me of it i just go more and more wtf you're talking about she has not shown to care once
- agete is just a tsundere <:sadge:969030625938014228> she's starting to act more like a immature 12 year old so i'm getting less interested
but like it's v easy to headcanon
it's not canon
yeah
i'll spoil cause idk if you care but he becomes the leader of a black market gang of lions, and to display authority he eats meat even though it's not good for him
he does
in terms of how taboo it is, that's very analogous
yes
there do exist black market for meat
which is the issue with eating normal meat
but in the universe, insects aren't sentient
yeah they're protein
a wolf, deer, rabbit, some lions
the main character that matter are like
look at him go
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
but i assume so
i don't think we see many cats
they all eat plants, carnivores get their protein from non-meat like insects or eggs
humans don't exist
that's a plot point in beastars
that's scary
they kinda have goldfish memory
kinda like trump
i don't think so? i think he was forced to tone down his online presence because of the prison shit he has to deal with
we have some weirdos but none like that at mine
actual fight or flight
she's a tater now
cherry character development
i think
but prob on spending
o idk about on the story front
absolutely
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
sunk cost fallacy
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
aw ok
tft aqua?
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
idk you can autocomplete my joke, i ran out of ideas
after 4 minute in p2 in MA
he just starts doing shit if you let him live long enough
jizo is honkai first ai generated boss
good luck <:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
i know nothing about jizo
yea idk
yeah
is that attack one you don't want?
i'll remember you
i think i wanna be forgotten
are you sure you want that to be your legacy
nevermind
i guess that's what i already am actually
and someone look at me and go it's the fucking bird girl
like i don't wanna get into a meeting
would you really
i would too
scientist just love to give shit stupid names
oh i've heard of that one
this is the more famous one tho
it's what i think when someone says erotic rat
about the mousegirl barista
have you seen the one tumblr post
when it's erp
you do not need to follow any rules
i mean
yeah that'd be the distinction i'd make too
vore is not cannibalism necessarily i think
i mean sure

it's prob my most hated non-qua abyss boss
it's so cbt
trying to skip the awful attacks properly
my main problem at abyss jizo
that was like

<a:peepoTrip:755692813320060959>
we all knew this would happen though no
3s MA clearly superior
using niche gear like avo newt
it was so stupid that we had fast kills like 1s
i'm so glad they removed 2s MA
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
okay that does look kinda sick
i mean that's fair
oh it's touhou
back when i still play, the only valk who get a score that high on their boss on release was PE
isn't that like really high <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>

yeah maybe
now that you say

he isn't right but he isn't lying, he's just stupid

do you think he outright lie? cause i feel like he's just delusional
is He wrong though
sorry
is he wrong though
or like that one mechanic in danganronpa 1 that they forgot they coded in after 30 minutes of gameplay

holy shit, gresnini is happening just like kiamei
like kiana was already feeling really bad and then mei punched her :(
that's what i remember he said
yeah
it kinda implies that liking and waifuing someone are synonym for him
i really like that screenshot
aww that is cute
and it's lk2
do you think he has those like my dearest lockets
we should make a maincord wiki
congrats
you're pregnant
i googled it
yeah i mean the person i would like to date is something of *writes an OC*
like chill <:letcook:1093482053879742474>

but holy shit <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
i did see that, i didn't say anything cause i didn't want to be too mean
and that lk2 is so much prettier and her parents are richer
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
or he'd be sucking hn and hrt dick too
surely it's not about good value
i don't get why he likes lk2 that much
he's lowkey telling someone to reroll their acc with hrt for new valk like lk2 + beginner bonus
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
can't even crit harder

i don't have a solution for that
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
that's not good
i'm guessin
they didn't have the hit count shield UI thing back then
i mean it's just really old is the thing
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
so that it looks like a hitcount shield
isn't it funny that they still haven't updated jizos shield

<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
you don't go holy shit i'm so lucky this shuffle only had a 1 in 52! chance of happening
like if you shuffle a deck
or throwing a dart from a plane, and you going down and drawing a target around it
it's like the difference between throwing a dart from a plane and it landing on the middle of a target
if you're playing a more complicated game where the streak does matter then maybe
the streak doesn't matter, what matters is what you're betting on, which is the very next game
on roulette, you're not betting in any streak
the way to think about it is that the probability only matter for when it matter
if it's a simple game like roulette, then that is just wrong
the 0.0078% is only the cope i would say to try to rationalise the gamble
my gut feeling would be the correct probability which is 50%
yes, ruby?
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
yes
promise you won't share
do you want the tech
i thought you'd be different
the pussy is good i don't know who you are
they always say the same thing
it's always like this
you promised you'd do better
nevermind if it's something my mom said i shouldn't
i test my luck on trying stuff out that's not physically possible
that doesn't work on me, but nice try though
i thought you knew me more than my real mom but i guess not
oh that's a shame
aw man

someone shows a rare drop and goes holy fuck and all the comment are 50/50 you either get it or you don't
they do it all the time
but because it's like runescape reddit favorite joke
but not because it's wrong about probability
that joke annoys me
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i will too
let it go
it's meaningless tet
all i'll end up destroying is myself
i would otherwise
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i can't cause it's not irl
i can't convince them otherwise when their probability knowledge is idk man

<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
you're just a hater tet
her valk is, definitely, something
objectively true
i wanna see these people gameplay so bad
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
obviously
none of those is about her being 12 year old
my interest on the witch hat atelier 12 year old girl is that she's mean, has pretty hair and i'm a lesbian
if you want my real take, is that it's a fictional character, so even if they act 12 and look 12 it's still legal
what most people actually care about if liking that character pinpoint something bad morally about that person, and i think to answer that you need to know what about that character they like, and in what way they like them
bet
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i'll change my mind if she act 12
she's not 12 in my mind so it's okay if i do
be more creative
<:jphMinus2:1062420904384135238>
i already did this bit
i wish she said mean things to me
the one that's really mean
i also really like the one bitch design
the end was a bit rushed
but what i meant is that like, that first chapter could've been even longer
actually felt like the author was fucking with me, it kept getting longer
i was reading one which had a streak of 80 page long chapter
oh not that, it's not too strange for first chapters to be 60+ pages
the art is reaaaally good
the pacing is a little weird, first chapter could've probably been 2
i started reading witch hat atelier btw
sorry i tried to make it sound lewd but my message just sound like yzma

<a:catPls:1113921108094242898>
i'm not doing the math
so forget about what i said
then it's different
oh
the best ones can even go to 1.45:1
cause most bundle are 1.20:1 or better
like just from xtal and card drop is about a 1:1 value, which is not great
xtal are a possible drop
cause you get xtal from it too
it was like about a 1:1 value wise when compare to topping up straight xtal
if it's like the previous shrine banners
an okay deal if you care about the resources
it's like
like a biological response
every time i look at her i just go sheeeeeesh
sick nasty maybe
get fucked lmao
<a:catPls:1113921108094242898>
actually i'll keep the manga part i guess
so i'll revert it
but i don't like how mine looked
i did it
oh
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
it isn't by default for me
this part
to show the manga you're reading n stuff
<@309634550273933314> how did you make your mal profile like that
before i start part 2 now, i'll read witch hat atelier, rosen garten saga and undead unluck
he already fell for it with tonegawa, so he learned from it and it didn't even cloud his judgement much
i especially like how kaiji didn't fall for hyodos bullshit, it's like character development in a strategic way
the last gamble was really good
okay i finish reading kaiji part 1 now
i repeat
a kaguya bocchi has hit the twin chainsaw
it's like the anime!!

gresham if you asked me i would pull v2v on your acc and pilot it for myriad spots
lumi complaining while playing the taking advantage of the neurodivergent game

time to do it like Him
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
just nothing to spend on
we do get spending
i heard they cut characters compare to the manga cause they wouldn't be important until future arc
maybe i should read the manga, the anime was kinda mid
isn't that objectively true?
charlie like moist critikal?
you should give SAO a 1 so we match
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
that's what it means to be close no?
i didn't remeber it being so funny
the op is so fucking edgy
not the main pairing though
i mean maybe it kinda is
it's definitely not
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
true
yakusoku no neverland first season is pretty good
it could be a really good adaptation but at most it'll be a worse version of the story you already experience
i mean if you're doing it for the meme
p much guarantee you'll get a better experience from just playing the game
all the ones i have seen kinda suck
idk how good the ace attorney anime is but generally i wouldn't bother with anime adaptation of game story
i could see it being a kaiji game
honestly that would not surprise me
Gokukoku no Brynhildr - this one has a cool style op, but the actual anime is all edge no substance
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
HOLY FUCK
IT'S HIM
it peaked <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
you already got enough out of the anime
if you watch the first episode and the op
honestly
just because the op was good
and it wasn't really good
completely
i watched this one anime
are some of these only here because the op slaps?
eizouken is really good
it can probably be still good but i felt baited <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
so i just dropped it
one that i'm way less interested about
and then on the second episode, it uncovers to actually be a completely different kind of series
it definitely sets up a certain kind of series on the first episode
but it was sick
i never really got past the first episode
death parade has a sick first episode
but that's the best way i'd describe it
ik that's not a good way to look into things
it feels like yuri written by a man, in a derogatory way
akuma no riddle sucks
i sort the list by score and then see how i feel about it now
and assess the scores better
but i mean i just look at my list every now and then
me too
i really liked BNA but it's more of an 8 or 9 to me
yeah
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>

<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
who hurt them
holy fuck
definitely breeding
i don't think it's close to scat though
it can be related to breeding but not necessarily
it's just it's own thing
egglaying kink is different from both no?
it enables him to push the games to their actual limit
you don't really need a ton of rules to make a game interesting
even those really simple games end up having extremely complicated turns
yeah, it definitely works to his strength too
and it was 4, maybe 5
even part 1 was a lot less games than i expected
that's kinda crazy to me, it's definitely what surprised me the most
well, prob not on his eyes
but that's still a lot
i mean i guess that's less extreme than killing him, which is what i did consider
because of this?
oh shit

i mean i'm sure kaiji will just leave with his 20m yen now and live a peaceful life
i wonder if we'll see more of tonegawa now <:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
a part of me thought hyodo would kill tonegawa over it
even for that one, tonegawa just ignore the blood pressure part
yeah, no trick feels unbeatable, on either side
that something would happen to his ear
i didn't get surprised by it cause i got spoiled by the volume cover
also yeah absolutely
oh by the last trick i mean the card trick he did, with the blood
the last trick was really good
i'm glad i was wrong tho cause that was a better way to end
also i was 100% sure the way tonegawa would lose was run out of time
and kaiji wasn't just shadowboxing
cause looking at it retroactively, we only got 1 where both party actually play the game
the emperor game was pretty great while i read it, but retroactively i do wish we had more turns of the actual game
i really like hyodou from what i've seen, he's a pretty good villain
yeah
i usually take a small break before they explain the rules of the next game
i'm still not done, i just finished the emperor card game part
aw man repeated content?
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
and then it still took me like 15 more years for me to figure out i'm trans
when i was a kid i would say i like feminine things so that people would bully me and say i'm a girl and i would like that
vore?
oh thank god that makes me feel better
i just came like this already
store bought
i'm like
maybe i should feel insecure about that, like y'all are fucked in the head but you have reasons for it
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528> you guys are kinda fucked huh
how much is a burner phone
you should be crueler
you should leave weird signs that someone knows
you, gresham and nini?
you too? is it the season?
that makes it a little bit less weird
was having, for some reason i misread that as is having
oh wait
you'd write a paper about that
if you were freud
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
tied?
so you're saying you're looking for your sister? that's why we're doing all this? did i get this right? to find your sister?
she was probably describing what happened in the entire story up to this point
yeah i bet
you're a boring character
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
why do you think that would out me
how long would it take for you to figure out it's me
and joined here
if i made a new acc
we don't have drama like we used to
they were so funny
holy shit
agree ?
it has a cock and it has a tail
are still my favorite
my collection of youtube comments from moriso drama
<:jphPlus2:1062420906720366632>
instead of the biggest personality that is active in the comunity
he thinks he's just a random player that had disagreement with other random player
i mean i don't think he did it maliciously, i think he just isn't mature to understand his place in the community
fragile and neffr are hardened enough that it didn't really matter to them
her takes are nuclear but she still didn't deserve the flame that was directed towards her from moriso
yeah
this is a screenshot of something from trl
she had some fucking nuclear takes
yeah, i think you know trl but not by that name, ruby
i don't agree with a lot of her takes but she did get a lot of harassment and end up leaving the community because of it
i mean trl did end up mostly leaving the entire honkai scene
and then moriso made a call out post to like random player
yeah, he made a tier list, it wasn't really good, some people shit on it
yeah
like actual unhinged behaviour
i just lost all faith with the fragile/neffr/trl thing
i mean maybe he is now
i think moriso doesn't act professional enough given his size
yeah i'd agree with that
the bar is really low cause most people don't care
you're already easily at top 10% of overall community
if you care to spend more than 2 hour per abyss
like 50% of that is already people that log in for the day
if you're talking about overall community
nah you're prob thinking of like competitive community
you're better than aqua mechanically
obviously
i agree with the aqua stuff though, it's not really a high bar to be better than 90% of the community, cause 90% of community put in 15 minute of game time per week
he owned a server and he nuked that too
he's just immature on that end, like the type to leave discord server to want attention
he nuked his discord acc
yeah, the part that pissed me off is when he later implied that others were somehow cheating by all knowing the one well known trick that everyone shared around and taught each other how to do, while he actively avoided that info
it sounds like tit
hehe
TEEEEEEEEEEEET
you wouldn't get it
it's SEA accent
it's also true for a lot of abyss boss
like you remember kith? doesn't really matter if you're a beast, if you're not willing to learn from someone else the trick for a 3s boss you'll have an awful time
also yeah i definitely value knowledge more than mechanical skill
his end point here is right, you shouldn't invest in HoF in 2023, but his reasoning is unhinged
don't worry
cata ever since aster went on vacation this server is vile
how many aqua per server = how active it is
you gotta take the aqua quocient
gresham: i can make you better
me and tet: i can make you worse
cata training arc
i can teach you how to be more dishonest and arrogant if you want
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
aw
we just make shit up for 15 minutes
that is what happens whenever we talk, yes
is that like supposed to be a big reveal
we're like fighting for t1 in a3
like huh
do we all suck
the average toxicity of the population is 11.4
wai what
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i don't even know how to describe it
<:letcook:1093482053879742474> evolved to a whole different meaning to me
me neither <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
aw it's so nice to see how we're all fucked up but in different ways
i think my most often answer to those questions were <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
oh you're more toxic than me
i'm probably t1 dishonesty yeah
that's actually a fitting question huh
am i t1 arrogance?
oh shit i'm more toxic than ruby
i'm aiming for severe
what score do i need to pass
you're stuck doing them? doing those tests inside your home? homestuck?
stockholm syndrome
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
so when they inevitably leave you can still laugh
isn't the most important you liking having yourself around?
i didn't know it was this serious
i gotta prepare my wedding gifts
do your parents know already?
holy shit kiamei?
sometimes others find it funny too
my sense of humour at this point is that i completely forgo everyone else and i just do or say whatever makes me laugh
l-like a boss
<:trollface:844673430728081449>
it's still hip with the kids
hey
idk if i ever thought they were funny, most often just entertaining
so like early 2010s
rage comics
my era of memes was
i'm not going like i'm so old, i only know cause i like looking into older memes than my era <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
i mean sure but it's older than me too
hi every1 im new!!!!!!! \*holds up spork*
is anyone even old enough to remember the spork meme here
my sister only uses a spoon though so maybe it's in the blood
but there's other people like me <:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
in brazil it's like really normal, i'm basically the only one who eat only using a fork
oh bet alright
99% of the time don't use a knife when eating
is it weird that i like
no fork
<a:KONhug:872043734638948353>
oh bet
<a:duckass:1148861036351471637>
like by myself? or like my pillow? or like
<a:catPls:1113921108094242898>
i already ate it, cause it was my favorite
i don't have my favorite food in the fridge
oh okay?
100% was expecting kill yourself, i'll take misogyny
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
you can tell me what to do though
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
instead of cooking
i know i'm not aka, that's why i'm asking
like step incest
is your earlier dating retroactively incest
yeah ok so like if you're dating a guy and then you break off and he starts to date your mom and gives you a step sibling
tet's best hits
incest, ntr, mpreg
really hitting all the points huh
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
chill
reading too much oshi no ko
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
how much is the ticket to get into gresham harem
oh shit plot twist
he has ruby though
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i haven't read the new oshi no ko chapter yet, i'll finish kaiji part 1 first
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
yea ok bud
meanwhile you push them a bit MA doesn't even matter
new valk is avg at MA and she's good at MA!!!!!
EVERY 3head is like this
just stop playing at that point, why bother
honestly i'd retire
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
okay chill
bet
oh you did already
add me
<a:catPls:1113921108094242898>
<:elywhip:1002644839248183306>
get back to it
but not for me
it's efficient stalking
oh i can also automate stalking my friends
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
holy shit
you can stalk me reading manga
damn
that one is really good
some of them did kinda pull it off
i think the very first halloween emotes were trying to be actually scary
oh damn actually
all big bro chat spam now is wawa
no actually
thanks
that's an answer that makes me happy actually
that one is really good
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
7tv team is pretty good honestly
they even have halloween stamps
i'll take that
like a discord cougar
i'm aiming more for like an early 30s
okay sorry i lied
i'm aiming for a 19-21 vibe
how old do i act
covid made my 3 year degree into a 7 year one
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
i'm big hair fan
that's very pretty
a lot are
most of us here could be in college rn
it's not really honestly
like if we stumble around in the street like ofc not
i'm pretty sure i would end up being friends with most of you
like if we were all in the same like college class
like how are we saying met irl
cherry took the kids and in 5 minutes cata is already i've never had children wdym
kinda heartless of cata actually
taking it well i see
get in the line
hey tet
break up with me too
holy shit free childcare
i mean yes but that's not the point
i'm miserable
it's ruining my day honestly cherry
yeah alright i'll play along
oh you want to ruin people moods
it's okay i don't mind it
so cruel to me lately
cherry is just like
ok
you should make one
so it's always stuff some of you watched
the fun part is that it takes the songs from your and your friends myanimelist
anime music quiz
if you knew about it
you know, this fucking server would get highly addicted on amq
cause we used to play amq a lot together
i know the op and ed
i have a friend who really likes it too
not this hard
i've been turned down before but like
my bad
okay
jesus
so i can watch utena <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
which is why i wanna watch utena with you cherry
nowadays i only watch anime on watch togethers
maybe i should plan watch together for it
i'll prob restart it when i watch it
idk i don't remember too much about it, it's be a while
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and i was like ok i can't do this right now
there was one episode that just open on like straight booba
my pc is in the middle of living room
yeah i kinda know i will, it's just hard for me to watch it
literally the ping pong anime <a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
same art style
did you watch the ping pong anime?
it looks soo good
i was in love with the animation tbh
ooh sounds like a good time
i think devilman crybaby did something like that but i didn't finish it yet
how many big story even does that
that'd be kinda gigachad tbh
it's not really similar to anything else mentioned before and it isn't really gay
frieren is just an extremely high quality story that got a pretty great adaptation
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but jesus christ there's a lot of stupid shit
i'm not done with season 2 yet
oh link click got brainworms on me
it's not gay but the anime is so good
nini you should watch frieren
the second one might be leak still?
2 different chapter i think
sure <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
who cares
skip the anime and read the doujinshi
honestly nini
from what i gather from skimming spoilers, gojo died and then megumi (sasuke guy) died
i would say very low amount of people play like that though
or ma pb
that's a pretty sound strat if your goal is big myriad pb
i think the biggest thing you always have to ask yourself is what is your goal
i'm resident jjk hater so i'll shut up <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i think the fights look nice in the anime
he just have crazy fucking arguments about it
yeah
or other real support cheaper valk
i don't think it's better value than hrt
i mean i agree with him that lb is a good pull, good value
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
ok buddy
it's fine to bench a valk for 1/2 patches
what
you just can't leak it
i can dm you the new valk right now
what the fuck are you talking about
it's a skip patch cause many people skipped it
what the fuck is His definition of skip patch
we don't know about anything
not us
ask Him
do she die
like <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
why does nqn hate hak in specific
but i'll be awaiting for it
i don't know who kyodo is <:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
so many manga has these like wild moon logic
that's so important for me on strategy manga like this
the twist never come from a secret rule kaiji didn't know and didn't plan around
like there's not one point where i went well that's unfair
they're like very logical and stuff you could figure out by yourself reasonably
the linchpin for me on the rock paper scissor arc is how good the twists are
debt is too scary for me
the other 2 i don't have the balls for
i think i'd be down for the first bridge maybe
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like he removes p much all the strategy and it still feels extremely like gambling
yeah it really comes through from the directly second arc
i'm in the second bridge
i'm past that
the rock paper scissor arc had some pretty great moments of strategy
i'm in the middle of part 1 kaiji rn
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
i'll add it to tachiyomi
oh that sounds sick
name is familiar i think? but not really
granny tet...
holy shit look at him go
<a:catPls:1113921108094242898>
i guess SA was already out tho
until it start to set in that going forward, support can also deal damage
iirc it took until like hb/pv release
but HoT? <:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
like i think we said that for phys with HoS
is that even a thing anyone back then say
<:peepoJoker:757304326967394324>
yea you're right mihoyo no rules <:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
some new non awk valk get pretty frag too
wait no that's wrong
awk valk gets pretty frag
normal valk gets normal frag
it's pretty simple for valk
me too
holy shit your hair is pretty
<:life:1001518241610485781>
<a:Drake:945136375882211358>
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
That's all, primus out
like if you share acc with someone and they cheat you can't go i didn't cheat, just the person i shared my acc to did or some shit like that
it's one of those they don't ban over though, it's only there so it can't cause them trouble
yeah sharing acc is against tos
aqua's presence just make ice this much powerful in the whole server i think
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
doesn't mean placing myriad, to me
i mean, playing competitively just mean spending the time and effort to plan your spending and balding score to go the highest you can according to your acc capability, right?
is that person playing by clicking every ability?
<:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930>
a little incest for apex?
i'd take it honestly
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
ruby we should practice it before hand
is aka really going for it
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
hmm i mean idk, playing 1 acc competitively was more than enough for me before i retired, so i can't imagine actively building another team on CN acc so you can play competitively there
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
sure i'm down
as opposed to just like getting early story
are you trying to like actually play the game in your CN acc?
that everyone who watch just goes 🙈
the one i did mean was the weird sexualisation of children
i'll catch up on the manga eventually
i hear it gets worse though
oh i haven't watched the movie but i did read the manga for what the movie covers
i can't think of a second thing tbh
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
you do need to be able to ignore the weird kid shit though
it definitely feels extremely thought through
i really enjoyed it, it's one of the best world building i've ever seen
that's what i do on nahida too
tectone is definitely the worst tho but like
ngl otk looks like an org of brand risks to me
like dream did with nightmare
cherry if you become really edgy will you rebrand to sour cherry
i think conventionally is the word you want
that's for sure
no one make it big on streaming by working normal healthy hours
but it's really hard
yeah, i think you're p funny cherry so you have something going for it
<a:Streaming:1039019999811088414> ❓
do you wanna try streaming
was it a good faith question tho
it was doomed already
it wasn't the honkai tho
no
me when i'm making chicken:
he's a fucking beast at streaming and making events
it's definitely not undeserved either
Source: Supply
yeah
anyone can spend thousands on it and like it's impossible for you to feel bad about it right?
lowkey though those charity auction are really smart
LMFAOOO <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh wait he did both? <a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
so he did go with the trophy
oh yeah i was there when he was talking about what he was picking for the charity thing
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
jesus
that's not my truege
what
<:Truege:983477411985358851>
should i pull neuv just so i can have the cum valk
it's like my monthly quota of reddit comedy that make me laugh
cock and balls and cum post
did you see the zhongli aether neuv
you get it cherry
yeah exactly
more like if someone show me their 160 pull HoS
not like that
it's kinda like lying but i don't have to type the words out so it feels better
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
i'll just send an emote instead of let them down
like if someone is kind of a dumbass but is expecting me to be proud of them
not only for low social energy tho
emotes are like my cheatcode for when i don't want to talk either
i can't just like turn off stream for 10 minutes to chill out for a bit
and like on discord, a break like that is expected
and come back when i'm less pissy
like if i get a little sick of y'all i can just alt tab for 15 minutes
i spend a lot of time on discord but it's broken up time
i definitely run out of steam if i go 3 hour straight
nini stream time
maybe you're just built diff then
cause like i'm done done by 2-3
can you like actively hang out with your friends for 8+ hour straight every day?
i mean even if you think it's that laid back
it's actually like jester medieval torture at one point
especially if your stream isn't you binging the one game you would be binging otherwise
like there's no way
i think at one point, no matter how outgoing you are, pulling those hours must get extremely tiring
you think so?
cause i'll run out of social energy eventually
i'm on pc for that long but i don't even talk on discord for the entire time
i mean same but it's different when you're performing all that time
pulling xqc hours sounds like torture to me
those 2 are comparable hell to me honestly
1/5th that is more than what my parents earn <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i would easily do it if i'm guarantee an amount like that
like there's thousand of booba streamer but not every one make as much money as the top ones so there's certainly more than 0 skill involved <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
they're also just coomers
they pick someone like asmouranth and go holy fuck those coomers make someone like that famous because all they see is the booba meanwhile they're also just reducing everything that that person did to only booba
i don't even know if they're wrong they just piss me off from how not self aware they are
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i don't like it
they're so fucking weird about it
but i know it's not redditor's take
idk what's my take on the people who do that
congrats on the baby nini
did it have like a sayori reveal or
i didn't expect them to have the balls to add suicide to it
honestly while i played mihoyo story felt so toothless
<:HUH:1004782798277718077>
she does what
so i just log off instead
and it looked really long
i started the quest with them
a frog
if i touch them i would guess it would feel like
they're prob scaly right
yeah
the fountaines one, idk their name
pets are furry chief <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
actually are the lil bros in fontaine count as furry or scaly?
is it the one with the furry painter?
<:cumm:1080924783027433573>
<a:HUH:1129107980634312724>
yes ruby?
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
<:peepoSit:1009060765887647846> <a:cumTime:1004274798823739474>
i also focus my adv task to those
wasn't there a daily that gave those
i have some furry ones if you want
<a:NessieStroll:906371971946782750>
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
the real beta tester hide that HoT is secret t1 until live so mihoyo only hit 3s heimdall with the fixed bleed bar not reducing incoming damage enough bat on the patch after
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
though you might be confused by aqua gameplay, he uses the second one to stroke his ego instead
i hear they both even have 2 hands each
what do you prescribe
my bad masturbate expert
you're stuck in NA (no aqua) server so you wouldn't understand
human chat gpt
he's just insanely over confident while having none of the skill to back it up
you're not in your right mind
lumi you need to masturbate for a sec so you can give a real answer
be honest
would you have a threesome with aqua if he asked
cherry on top? <:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
the frunny?
i mean me too but i'm a little insecure about it so i ramp it up a lot so i can claim that it's on purpose
i'll 100% believe whatever anyone tells me because i just think it's really funny if i do
i'm willingly extremely gullible
me too
cause they lie all the time
you know maybe lumi's issue with knowing when someone is saying the truth or not is not the autism, it's just projection
\> highest grossing movie
like ok buddy go off i guess
owo avatar <@197871478950068224>
owo pfp <@197871478950068224>
it's hekatet's
if tet makes tp pri
and it works most of the time
<a:stripp:1157061089104777226>
what i got down is that i just do one of these
yeah
with that obviously
now that you say that i don't really know how i'd make her worse
i was going to ask for coaching
nqn just hates hak in specific
<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492>
i can make her worse
i mean if it doesn't matter what you say then do whatever? thoughts?
those are the rules
if i dislike it i'll block cherry on all my acc
of the witch hat kind
yeah
and then i'll figure out more after
i think the plan right now is kaiji -> witch hat
i'll add spirit circle to the list
okay
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i'm down to just read stuff i'm recommended by people whose taste i trust somewhat
like just grab random shit from reddit or w/e and test it out
but right now i'm not really looking to read like random stuff that might or might not be good
besides furry stuff
i don't really have genre/premise preference i think? like i have but it doesn't affect what i choose to read much
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> how important is that info though? like what i'm understanding is just the setting up that there's still bubbles that are completely unrelated to the stuff we care about
wtf you on
nvm maybe i shouldn't give hak a chance
if i don't like it i won't trust your taste
if i like it, i'll trust your taste and accept more
i'll give each person one recommendation
<a:GAMBAADDICT:1088508671144759358>
like with money, i'll still play tft tho
and i already feel like i don't want to ever gamble <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
they haven't even started gambling yet
there's not that much left on my list
i'll add it to the list then
oh bet
5 secret chapter your doctor doesn't want you to know about
oh ok idk why the other one had up to 163 then
but it could be shit
also thought on undead unluck? i read the synopsis and the premise looks interesting, i'm also drawn to female mc
mangadex says it is but the one source i had before had up to 163
is 158 the end of part 1?
he looks like the type who would
that doesn't surprise me actually
<:ohnobirb:948935560091807744>
and i don't think he's going to kill his debt soon and play poker for fun so
i see that there's like 500+ chapter ahead
it's more like
i don't think i'd say it's the actual manga setting that expectation right now for me
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
same for blue period, but portuguese instead
it must not be true though, i know there's shy chapters that are translated to spanish but not english yet
for some reason i always assume most portuguese translations went like japanese -> english -> portuguese
that's fucking weird lmao
like it's the only one too for some reason
oh it does
also it'll be annoying as fuck to read cause my source is just missing random chapters
well, i wouldn't say than what i expected, cause i guess i knew that it wouldn't be hopeful, but it still surprise me
pretty interesting premise, the vibe is a lot darker and more hopeless
btw i started reading kaiji
my girl cannot get a break
it'd be the same shit as last time <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it would be fucked up if she started liking kyo cause like
i love hina tho
yeah i really don't think it'll be hina either
i'm enjoying the 2nd couple stuff a lot tbh
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
without fucking up the main relationship for fun
they figure out how to keep having a will they won't they on the story
blue box author cracked the code
huh really? i guess i don't have any other example of ip game, good or bad
like how do you even find out you have that quirk
who knows
i mean you don't know until you try right
this one i can do tho
and now it's
start off by punch strong
what the fuck
are like jojo stands
these fucking new quirks
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
wait she's dead?
oh i see her, she's kinda hot
and that's insane
like for the whole manga series
i read somewhere that he hasn't taken a break at all
i'm not one for graphics but that's a weird move when doing a game where all profit is from outfit
but it kinda looks like shit
now they have a battle royale one and it looks like it controls fine
i played the gacha for a bit and it was really bad
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
any theory why all the games suck ass?
i didn't get that far so idg like half of that <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
might be another reasoning for giving him a ton of more ability for fun too
but when he started to be actually able to handle more of it, i think it lost a lot of depth
i enjoyed the early fights where he had to use it strategically cause he couldn't handle it all
my enjoyment of deku screentime decrease the more he started to being able to use more of his power, i think <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
now that you say it, mirio feels like a better realised grown up deku than deku ever did
that's very true actually <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i think it steadily decline in quality from first tourney arc
i stopped watching after the yakuza arc
what did he bitch out of
boku no hero
the anime got really mid but it's not like, bad
what's with heroaca and getting shitty cashgrab games <:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
<a:Wave:995380866832420994>
<@309634550273933314> hi
at the manga, that is
i'll take a peek
<a:Noted:914214211138244688>
most of them are next week i think
i thought frieren was the only early one
oh are there more anime starting right now?
holy shit
<a:stripp:1157061089104777226>
el dorado was really good too though
which is my favorite arc
we'll prob end right at the mage exam arc
rumour for it being 28 episode
it's 2 cour somehow
but i'm still not sure if it fits <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
it slaps though
i was scared for the direction the anime would go
like it set a completely different atmosphere and vibe than the manga is
the op scared me so much tho
yes ruby?
<a:Panda_thanos:598682299940470785>
to a degree that it's kinda hard to even say it's the same story
like k-on
the ones that match or surpass the manga have to change a lot about it
you can't really go much better than this tbh
but like as far as you can realistically expect
it's probably not better than the manga
it's definitely a great adaptation
btw eli, i'm finishing the 4th episode of frieren
gsr hunt?
like
cause that's cowardly
it's not like it's technically there but you can't see it
like you can still see it tho right
oh that sounds fun
fuck yeah
oh there's still a tail?
what did i do
is this like a punishment
so you pinged me so we could talk about specifically something that is not a fluffy tail
what???
i'm so fortunate
fluffy tail ping
holy shit
and it's like half of it are anime op
i'm only asking cause they just release a teaser to their new EP
that's kinda sick actually
oh i see
<a:HUH:1129107980634312724>
i just now figure out a song of theirs i was jamming out to is a gundam op
wait does yoasobi only do anime op now
<:Dank:911882500350046258>
kinda looks like dank
i'd feel bad no one else might
i'd buy it if i saw it
that does look cute though
wasn't i sonic?
good luck
you gotta pick between the 3, the red blue and green one, and they all have that much text on them
new, i think it's a few season old now
that's just the new jungle starter item
they look like a tumblr user
and your choice of starting item is this
you pick jungle
imagine start playing league
how can you ???? me and say that immediately after
did you dm hog
you cap score according to your acc ranks and gear
i think p much everyone uses it as the first meaning
fast
spend the xtals
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and the rando fangirled over my nirvana emblem
i remember one time i did coop
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
and he's moving on to day 2
he went vanquisher line every game day 1
boxbox got the tech tho
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
he got like 1k lp too
idk if it's just luck cause he was already 20/20 forcing xayah before xayah buff, so he knows the lines
he actually went p well
i catch the last few match of noxus cup on boxbox stream
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
transmen after voice training but before getting hrt
to make dupe sleepri
just craft balmung or w/e it's called
are you past crafting hell?
morb?
orb?
that kinda shit only works in NA (no aqua) server
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yasuocore
<:lookUp:1048431538511020063>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
aponia was just already Like That
griseo is like a normal ass child that got a lot of trauma from honkai
actually so funny
these were already fucked up tho
and then it gets to v2v and eden and it's like
it starts off as like look at what those people were before the awful stuff happened to them
it's actually kinda funny
i'm rewatching the epilogue of the elysia cg
it's a little fanservice but it did make me tear up
<:Cryge:862486122038558740>
god that epilogue to the animation
that's cute
but honestly i'm down
i never saw mobius klein as romantic
<a:TheVoices:1143681011272659015>
AI that poses as a character
for some reason i thought you were talking to those like
oh you're talking about the boss
lore accurate
and i had so many questions
somehow i read i'm pregging solstice
god
which is ironic now that i think about it
actually i think i've seen some booba on the fu hua subreddit
sorry
yeah i did
and i've actually never seen any honkai porn
i play this game for almost 2 year
you know what's crazy
is that proof enough for you
what about the doujinshi that i read
but it's pretty clear
it's hyperbolic
well i know
what's more concrete than that
while dudu and rita are on a date
kiana literally says this is a story about love
on the part 1 cg
ain't no way i'm not counting dudu rita
with the end of part 1 cg
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
and it filled me with rage
and it showed me fucking gsr shita
but i looked up honkai characters
i was going to list more
okay we can do
seele seele
seele bronya
kiana mei
dudu rita
i'm sure you could do a calendar
🚢
or
like actual ships
so pretty
it's a really good one too
liu qi i do
yea i wouldn't count those
i was thinking about jk set for some reason
oh
do you count liu qi
it's sad
pericles -> alladin -> collodi
it's like
<a:BOOBA:825140785820991530>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
that's still not new character design for me to gawk at
even if they have their crush as their stig
is seeing cool new character design on the stig
i mean the thing i care about
we're getting with brick
cecilia
cause they just keep doing main story character
i just think they're so rare now
i don't think the new stigs have worse OC in them
i was about to say
i think i prefer stig kafka than genshin kafka
so true
some older stigs are really hot
i could easily see a wave of sp valk getting timestop dk
with ly having time stop
lowkey they probably will
they can just release a dkey
if they want to powerup an sp valk for fun rn
i think it's objectively worse for us player on gacha valk
is so big, that it p much wedge the community there
the jump in spending from pull 1s and pull 2s
only if you get lucky with double card or smth
no one really go for that though
like sure you get some stat from going s1
same with 2s
like abyss and MA before was no bullshit, p much anyone with S-rank before had equivalent playing field to you
well, work well for mihoyo
for s-rank it work well cause it incentivise spending more
no
<@309634550273933314> <@197871478950068224> check on 3:40 how the old break up ranking screen used to look like
like cause they only had 2 break up before 2s instead of 3, they just made one not increase stat instead of rebalancing how the attribute increase
it might be only on old valk tho
me neither
apparently s3 doesn't get any stats?
cursed information
so like my pea brain would go surely they wouldn't introduce two huge changes in the same patch
which was already huge
i wouldn't have guessed 4.6 tho cause 4.6 already introduce timestop ult
i knew it was around there
it was actually on 4.6, i didn't know about that
it was honestly cooler ngl
do you remember how they used to look?
yeah i remember that
and aka
for when SN got her break up ranking
the rentry still exist
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
that they didn't level
just added a whole new skill
they finally found out that the break up rank that release the same patch for DA
and after a lot of work
magery was balding for like 5 hours on a DA boss
that happened to DA
they just made up a whole new skill for s1
when they retroactively turn it into break up rank
like if they had 1 unlock on 2s
like SN got her extra evade charge from that
they even added extra skills
yeah
maybe HoT, DA definitely got hers retroactively tho
i think the first they release with it was HoS? iirc
they started retroactively adding to some valk
yeah
all valk used to be like that
and you don't unlock anything before next rank
you how like A rank just have little stars until next rank
<:life:1001518241610485781>
break up ranking didn't exist
yeah
like the more expensive and end game it is, the lower impact it is
but that's how most valk work? and how general upgrade in gacha works
i think that's definitely true
none of this shit
it was s or 2s
when we star playing, break up ranking was just starting
can you think about it
yea that's fair
ooo icic
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
really? like i think pb worth is low but is it lower than whore ranks?
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
who pull for rank up before elf
you might be the only person in the game
ask him
<:waiting:1027534309298544640>
i'll wait my turn
true
you know what
swear there's like 3 of you in every game
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
oh <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the oshi no ko one?
i'll dm you some cute tigh art
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i can't believe you're also into furry boys now i'm so proud
did nini find salvation
holy shit
is this omori
<:life:1001518241610485781>
and i'm still here
damn you slept and woke up
certainly felt like they understood the point and appeal of the manga
<@416445660443967491> i only watch one episode of frieren but it was pretty good
10 games of 7 bilgewater
10 games of 5 bilgewater
10 games of 3 bilgewater
instead of hang around on discord
ain't most games like that? you gotta, like, play a lot to improve
actually <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i feel like tft is the kind of game you can only talk about for so much to improve
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
you're asking if it's 1 or 2 cour?
the high effort ones are always great
LMFAO
or do they just work that fast
do you think they prepare before hand
holy shit
reading part 2 as it releases is definitely a different feeling, i can't wait to reread it once it's all over to get the bigger arcs
part 1 feels like a snowball, it keeps picking up speed
and then later arcs feels like he's doing what he actually wants to do
to a degree, those early chapters before katana man feels like fujimoto is setting up the things he's supposed to set up
and while they're still really good, they're definitely weaker than the next arcs
you're like, at the end of the third arc
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
and it manage to introduce my favorite character on part 2
chainsaw man was already my favorite manga
isn't that nuts?
yeah she's part 2 main protag
i love her so much, you should read chainsaw man so i can talk about her furhter
no utena?
oh
jjk yeah, i read through the leak thread
they're full on cope
i got myself spoiled on what's going on through the subreddit
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
but it sounds like you're talking in runes
i do want to read it eventually
okay i bought discord blue
<a:lebronJAM:998604876898635796>
yours is better quality
<a:lebronJAM:1045743664925777920>
but it slaps
it doesn't really fit frieren if i'm gonna be honest
have on their contract that they only make song for banger anime? or?
does yoasobi like
they all have op and ed
released in a batch
it's just 4 episodes
i'll make fun of everything i haven't watched/read and is famous
idk anything about mushoku
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
it's okay cause the elves like it
i don't think i've read one of those slave ones
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
so they can be less insecure about liking games
most gamers just want games to be more like movies
not even the intended audience treats the artform with the respect it deserves
but the fans are gamers
they can be genuinely incredible
it sucks so bad that the art form i like the most is games
it mostly cares about the social aspect though
netjuu is a pretty good one
<:ohnobirb:948935560091807744>
game genre is just scifi isekai
oh shit
and then i won't be baited into giving it a chance
just make it a random isekai like you want to already
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
like why even bother then
and how they actually work
that's like the thing that pisses me off the most, the only explanation for why they're so badly thought out is because they don't give a shit about games
they must not, right?
like there's an atm you can sell your currency for irl money
doesn't ggo have like unironic bank in there
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> true
it actually fucks me off from most of these series
yeah, that too!
yeah, like my point is that the writer just doesn't get what the games are about or what it means to actually be at the top
like even you could be this good if you were shit but found out about this broken strat?
is it like so it can be self insert?
like why can't they just be good at the game?
yeah exactly
like ok buddy
so he can pvp a bit to show the watcher how good he is at that
he just randomly stop the race
yeah that's the point
like huh???? what about the race to level cap you cared so much about you lost sleep over???
so they can show us how good he is at that
and then the next day, he just spend like 2 hour fucking around on pvp
mc just spent like 12 hours on the first episode to be on the top rank players to get close to level cap
people stay awake overnight on new server open to rush levels
i watched one with coffee which the game was basically suppose to be a wow ripoff
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
what if it is honkai
oh shit
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
chill
this ain't honkai chief
they characterise the ones who are good by they press button so fast wow
or mind games
it's always either muscle memory from a lot of training
reflexes on any competitive game, if they're making it about that, are almost never an actual thing
like ok buddy you haven't played a game before but i'm glad you tried
like half of this anime is like if you were inside a game and then the entire arc is all about reflexes
it's really easy bait for writer who has no respect towards the artform
and i feel like it happens with games a lot
i'm really annoyed when writer use games to define the setting but they don't really care about how games actually work and how it feels to play those games
but after i read better media about games, my disgust towards sao just grows more and more
i think the main thing i enjoyed sao when i was young was just the fact that it was an anime about game, and i was a gamer already
like at one point surely it's easier to just write a dnd campaign right
that takes a lot of work
i can admire people who have that energy to hc everything about that work though
if i wanted to write my own character, i'd write a book, not read manga
i'm definitely not the type of girl who makes their own fun on media
or just like thinking about how bad they are amuse you or smth
do you enjoy like, headcanonning them as better character?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i'll watch the anime later to tell you if it's nearly as good
yeah the manga is nuts
like i watched it and i had a good time but it wasn't something that would stick to my mind like some other anime would
like you know when you're young, you can't really say what you like or what you don't, but you clearly gravitate towards some than others?
what do you like about sao? when i was younger i definitely watched it, but i dunno if i'd say i enjoyed it
different letter in the middle there
i don't think that's cooking i think that's coping
don't watch the later seasons of flcl
all the things i like are great because i have impeccable taste
can't talk about homestuck in the open
literally 1984
rude
okay eli
<:PauseCat:1002644852850298960>
it just is, for me
and i can't really call it anything else other than homestuck
homestuck picks to do everything and somethings it does well and something it does poorly
i find it easy to call it good
like chainsaw man chooses to pick one thing and it does that incredibly well
i can't really judge it in the same standards as i do literally everything else
where it's doing so much at once
i think because homestuck is the only media i've read which is like that
sorry
i'm not really in tune with the mainstream chief
yeah those
i don't think i've read many Classics
idk
because it does a lot of bad things and a lot of good things
i find it really hard to say it's good or bad
like homestuck is just so much
yea but that's just semantics, you get what i'm saying tho right?
but how it's told changes a lot
the premise of homestuck doesn't change that much? it evolves and uncovers, but it stays true to itself throughout
like, to me promise is almost meaningless compared to how that story is told
yeah i would say bohemian rhapsody is a song that's a bunch of different songs like i'd say homestuck is a story that's a bunch of different stories
it's way more important to me
actually, nah
to me though, how you tell the story is just as important as the actual events
yeah i'm not saying it's not connected
i mean yea that's why i said you're prob misunderstanding, cause i'm just using the terms more abstractly
i think for the general meaning of story probably not but for me it does
well yes but also not only about that
like it effectively changes genre and storytelling format entirely
when i say it's a bunch of different stories, i mean on the second way
you can separate the story from the things that happen from the way it's told
well i guess you're just misunderstand what i'm trying to say
they're definitely connected and heavily linked
i mean yeah, i'm not trying to say it in a bad way
early homestuck like act 1-4 about figuring out game mechanics feel extremely different from later intermission with meenah fucking around
some of them are really different from what came before earlier
and some of them are great and have great ideas
it's more like a lot of really long stories tied to each other
i wouldn't really describe homestuck as one long story
i mean i agree
it has a lot of bad parts too
homestuck has definitely great parts but if anything it's not is consistent
idk if i'd compare it to one piece in any way besides the length
kinda like homestuck if you think about it
yeah that's how i use the terms, i just thought manhua and manhwa were different romanisation of the same term
i'll keep using it my way
i'm glad i have that knowledge but that's a worse way to use those terms to me
i call avatar anime
yeah i know manhwa are mostly korean, but i would call any vertical manhwa/webtoon interchangeably
but ok
that is not how i use cartoon and anime
like manhwa is vertical reading
i thought it was style
i didn't know manga manhwa manhua distinction was where it was from
that i didn't know
it's different?
wait
but yes
i never seen it written as manhua, only manhwa
can you imagine....
manhua.....
i have some pathetic ones
does it have to be a hot one
<:joever:1122752199752163419>
i'm not gonna answer next time if all you'll do is point a gun and tease me about killing me
position properly to get the sp bags from not taking any hits from transition
and just gaslighting us into thinking it's honkai
playing a whole different game than us
i swear hak is like
the
if you wanna pinpoint why i'm like this it's not the trans furry, you should ask me about my relationship with my parents
at most they're symptoms
baby girl i may be fucked in the head but those are not why
you're the only one doing them
my guy
you guys are fucked in the head
what the fuck are you on hak
<:joever:1122752199752163419>
not ban him from central
you gotta bribe maincord mod to unban him
if you wanna pay for more aqua cooking
and he got shut down p quickly
yeah i think he tried to test the waters with his cooking earlier
<:PepeLaugh:637096187270529035>
game trying to fix your skill issue
that's kinda crazy
i never had her parry instead tho
yeah the gc dodge timing can be annoying <:okk:1058108494995263539>
well, same score, dunno if same ref
oh that's the ref i was running
maybe hn ref is fucking unhinged
cause i literally have never have that happen
are you doing hn shit?
on jizo?
what the fuck are you talking about chief
and we battle it out to figure out which is the best one
each one of us gets gov assigned religion
like different ones?
but now i'm vibing
usually i'd recoil in disgust
i'm warming up to french songs
she come to share the pretty song she heard
yeah i feel bad for nini
her voice is really good tho
i regret typing that out
that one is mean
actually her parents are really thoughtful, she can't take cock so they gave her her own
she's paralysed
oh shit
and a part of me thought he was going to follow that up with her surname is cock
40 seconds in he says unfortunately, emma has a rare but terrible disease
you can't say that
i like the explanation i made up better
sounds sus
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
why are you hugging people that are smaller than you though
like normal people
me and my buddy hugging
like the 2 arms connecting?
but who the fuck hugs like that
i literally said i made it up in my head, and i didn't pass it off as otherwise
okay don't call me a liar
who the fuck
that just what i always assumed
i mean i'm not saying i'm right though
and the o is the kiss cause your mouth goes o
cause your arms behind them go x
isn't x the hugs
instead of lili
you say bb and i thought about death stranding
my brain is healing
what about whats wrong out of the ordinary
okay
what's wrong with a girl being a chad
i think you're just being misogynistic actually
wanna watch utena
<@483689649727078400> are you awake
is that a compliment?
so i didn't bother
it was lower score
i didn't even touch hn
i'm talking about triple support
oh idk about hn refs
instead of the nothing
so you need to position properly so that charged hits the real jizo
but by the time the damage come off, the clone will be dead
like whore will target the clone with the charged
yeah
try to copy those 2 thing from ref, where the camera is looking at and where whore is standing before the charged
getting the whore charged to hit both is a matter of positioning properly in comparison to clone and camera position too
just really annoying
pay attention to that on the ref, it is consistent though
i think it's in front of him
but it's always the same based on where the main jizo is looking
idr the specifics
that didn't look like the person is thoroughly hating their time there
i don't think i've ever seen any jizo ref
fuck jizo tbh
is she on the negatives?
probably not
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
i'm still 1 over you on jizo
hehe
huh
that makes sense though
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
when you explained it to me offhandedly yesterday
yeah tbh i only actually understand how hp loss work
huh
i didn't even know that was how it worked, i just gambled on JK helping clear the hitcount with charged so i could kill normally
you can kill the boss through hitcount with hp loss, right?
i wasn't <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
you're doing the boss properly
i mean
okay keep bragging
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
i mean yeah i still love people but i still gravitate towards furry games
i guess i'm assuming tho
i didn't think this game would be big for gay men
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh ok
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
idk if they'll let him get away with it
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
is this what the berry is code for?
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
sherlock figured something out about how this game works
okay we're getting a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> cooking
1984
yeah
he's acting like he belong right now, idt people like kyo hang around on maincord to call out on his past behaviour <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i think he's pulling lk2 tho
he's just complaining about getting banned in maincord
the only thin i remember central for is that it was the server where aka hang around
oh really?
you should read the chapter where she takes denji out on a date
asa is my favorite character, she's so pathetic i wanna flush her down the toilet
SOOOOOOOOOOOOO GOOD
she's
who's that
to make space for their next child
if people don't like you enough, your parents will kill you
i mean i wasn't going to but if you're offering a reward
you gotta nibble the paws and head off first
so we have the same thing but for them
here
idk if it's a thing in other countries, we have lil chocolate turtles
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like He'll smell you
sorry
like he'll smell you
huh how
my mom said i'm really special and that's why i gotta take different classes
i'm already really cool alright
<a:Smadging:1035205356013494364>
tet unironically the person who says my joke but louder rn
no one told me thales g4 has a rapper name
i guess i am but i was just being a shitter
what the fuck
haks real name is henry?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and i quit while still in cube drought
i played for almost 2 year
wait are you two post cube drought?
respect your elders smh
she's like a 3 year old valk
but like cmon, lv40, lv45 zither
i get that SA's not useful
man
you should keep it forever so you can forever be ashamed of your mistakes
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
save a cube
you level it to 50 and use it for pri
when a new cross valk release
keep it
i'm assuming it's maxed
is it maxed?
you could turn it into a pri though
yeah no
if it's torus, i wouldn't do it
what are you trashing zither for
how good is dupe hekate tho?
that's kinda based tbh
was really scared for a sec
i'm glad i got a ping clarifying the issues are not permanent
have you ever made a review to an app
isn't she nut?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> overvalued?
:peepoBrazil:
from discord
i've been banned
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i don't
<a:stripp:1157061089104777226>
are we on halloween emote season already
oh shit
this is me on pc on cold days
<:comfy:959706453965430874>
at that temp
from bedroom
i would bring a blankie
that's too cold
because of the heat
i wasn't being able to sleep more than 4-6 hour at once
but after the middle of the week i'll take it
it's a little colder than my normal though
yeah i'm chilling
i thought she said a very nice temperature cause it would be 69
close though
you made me look it up
okay
the heat finally chill out
pretty chilly night
that's not true actually, it's 18c right now here
15 celsius is colder than our winter in my city
okay that's unhinged
the seasons still exist
but i mean
no snow, no losing leaves, no flowers blooming
there's no fun like special gimmick
our seasons here are just weather
so i guess that's fair
seasons are meaningless
i mean i'm gonna be honest, some years here
w-what
like we are
shouldn't you be start of your season?
but i don't get why they're desync
i get why the season are different
i'm gonna be honest tho
it's early spring
like pepe eugenics?
what the fuck are those
i either call them a dumb fuck or i pretend i didn't see
same thing we do in here i think
do you think they self shit talk in there
that's fucking 5head
Sure
i'm a degenerate
sure!
a really useful term <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it's actually
if that makes sense
because it makes all the options the same
when you use them against an enemy with no resistances, it degenerates the complex system
like you can imagine 3 different attack, a fire, ice and lighting one, that all deal the same damage
it means a set of terms/options that can be reduced or simplified but only under certain circumstance
it's a math term
can you believe i only today learn the initial meaning of degenerate?
talking about lolicons and incest
it was an accident <:Cryge:862486122038558740>
even though it's been so long
i hold some bad feelings over lumina still
yeah ik i'm just being a shitter
is it lumina
follow up question
big distinction
or is it an aqua shit talking server
is it a shit talking server
is he saying genshin has a low amount of patches? when they're as often as every other mihoyo game?
tbh i don't even know what more leaks than genshin patches
aqua among us
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
who was it who leaked
do you really think it's about us
you remember when like literally every day
damn, people are good about leaks nowadays huh
we also don't really share leak outside of the leak channel because of carv
we technically have a thread, not a chat <a:Nerdge:1010710823037059163>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
is the spinoff the good one?
great balls honestly
thanks
oh now i do
it's kinda hard from over here
can you come closer
<:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
mangasee?
this one would make more sense
wait probably not
<@483689649727078400>  this?
the amount of meme you see on like reddit where you open the link and it's a discord link <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
we use them on discord, but some people used discord as the file hosting for like stupid shit
and for another, they must be spending so much money by making those files available to like random sites
cause it's like for one inevitable, so the longer they take the more they fuck with people who were depending on it
it's kinda incompetent of them to let it go this fucking long without cracking down on it
and that's not even what discord is <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
but like, filehosting is expensive as fuck
a lot more work <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
by uploading them somewhere else
we should start the quote renaissance
yeah
but their code base, prob takes 5 weeks to do anything <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
i'd say i'm surprised it took them that long
tbh that one i can't really blame them
yeah
would be funny if the only option was to test them out
i'm assuming try is your currency
there's a hutao one
i like me plugins
i'm not
is it permanent?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i mean it better fucking be
60 tet bucks is how many usd
how much is that
that makes more sense <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh it's cheaper because it's nitro
oh
discord crypto?
nitro bucks?
what the fuck are those
bet
i just woke up
that's funny
if you tell me to read it i'll read it
holy shit <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
atelier is such a good word
is the manga good?
anyway what was i saying?
maybe i'll rewatch it
oh there's a little furry in there
<:life:1001518241610485781>
and someone will always be this is the best anime ever
it can have 30 views and 3 comments
you look up any anime op
it's cute tho, like
it wasn't really good
i watched that as it was releasing
it has atelier in the name so i thought you were talking about that
wait no i found the one i was thinking of
and i thought you were talking about that
there's like a series of games i think that's called atelier something
and i kept thinking you were talking about that
something something atelier
i think?
there's one series of game/anime which have a similar name
i thought it was the like
is that good
i'll dm you the credentials
that's the main issue, i can't get the sms thing
but i lost the phone number
i do have the email address
can you help me recover my bilibili acc
taihen since you're here
hewwo
<:owo:1118835638976913448>

besides that she has paw feet and 2 tail
tbh i don't even remember much of kirara design
kirara porn? <a:modcheck:875816674308280320>
wait i'm interested now
lumi keeps breaking my heart
;_;
but i'm not necessary anymore
i was typing up a lot
oh ok
is mostly about positioning and camera placement
the transition, after you get through the bullshit that is the dodging for sp
i don't fucking know either
i'm gonna be honest
as always
-1
i'll do lk2 datamines later
that's easier tho i won't have to annoy tai about it
time passes so fast
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
wait is it in glb/sea already?
yeah sure actually, i'll update my CN honkai
oooh ic
i think i'm interested <:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
is it the first time it's available? were the enhanced hua suit not on beta?
oh
lmk what you end up thinking about it <:okk:1058108494995263539>
that sounds really funny
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
LMFAO
i know about it, yeah
but i don't think i'd say the exorcist part is much deeper than just aesthetics and theming
definitely wouldn't say they're forgetting about being an exorcist manga
i think i get that tho
i haven't read many exorcist manga at all
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i see
it really feels like they all genuinely enjoy each other company
it's probably one of the best manga i've read for how comfy they portray a friend group
yeah i'm loving it honestly
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> actually idk, idk what it is that you dislike about exorcist manga
ik you don't like exorcist manga but it's pretty good
you should read dandadan ruby
aqua hikaru will do an 1v1 and if hikaru wins the manga will be about him instead
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
what do you do once they kill off all the good characters? <:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
doesn't nobara also go poof?
kinda brave tho
the point i stopped didn't really feel like they had the balls to kill a real character
maybe it does pick up later on huh
oh shit really? that's interesting
what happened? someone died?
oh ok <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and that just get me suspicious about it
some people are calling it the second coming of chainsaw man
i'll read it if you give it the go through <:okk:1058108494995263539>
<:Hmmmnoted:1087849484358275195>
i downloaded the first 2 chapter but haven't gotten around it, i'm hearing good things tho?which is surprisng to me
<@180679257851166721> are you reading kaguya bocchi
just guess harder
luck diff truly
i mean i asked too <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
cool actually
i would just pick it honestly
would be really funny if someone reroll lucky gloves into lucky gloves
not like that tho, he reroll lucky gloves first and then went wtf wasn't this here before
it happened to big bro earlier today too
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that's pretty creative actually
is it like a heal debuff? you gotta heal that bar before your heal go through
i cannot tell what the mechanic is supposed to be from those pics
great question
either 7 paragraph message or a 3 word one that he's writing one letter at a time inbetween artifact domain
<a:TheVoices:1143681011272659015>
it's a story about a bunch of schizo
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like it's funny premise but i really don't really care about how or why aqua and ruby got reincarnated
the thing i've been like god please don't make an arc about this is about the magic stuff
i'm split, i'm excited for the movie arc
she's just a fucked up girl, the crows just gather around for fun
isn't that really fucking funny now
that's partly why i was what the fuck
me too
like ??
and she acts like that about it
but like from all we've seen i find it really hard to believe that she get reincarnated and get the chance to see her children
we don't know how ai really acts? i guess?
like there's no way
it can't be ai right?
they went look at this cool stuff that they're doing! anyway back to regular schedule
the interlude chapters felt like a slap to my face tho
i mean yeah, that's partly why i'm getting excited from this chapter
i think what i enjoyed the most was when they went in depth with how the business works
tbh tho i don't even know what part of the plot i'm most interested now <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
honestly i feel the same
wild that that's what you take from the chapter
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
you know you wanna do it
brick it
weird how that works
suddenly i care about neuv
i know right
actually one of my uncles divorced so he's staying over a lot too
think it's been 1 or 2 years now, so not that recently but it still feels a little recent
because our grandpa died sorta recently, so having someone living with our grandma is nice
yeah, and now it's at a point our close family is glad she hasn't married
wanna see the otter neuv pics?
is this clearer
i do think there's maybe a higher expectation of independence in the US than in latin america countries
doesn't really mean you have to follow those expectation tho, whatever you're fine with is fine right?
this is fucked
i mean that message's about scheduling your appointment
doesn't really mean you have to follow them tho, whatever you're fine with is fine right?
so like i do think there's maybe a higher expectation of independence in the US than in latin america countries
yeah like what???
and that's like reasonably normal
my grandparents had 4 children, and one of them still lives with them
that's fucking mental
like i see some people talking about actually kicking their kid out of their home when they hit 18
US is fucking unhinged about children tho
i mean i'd believe you
oh ok
wth
i didn't know you were from brazil tho
idk i think so?
what?
you're from brazil?
i think for my age in my country it's very normal
and they were appointments that my parents just scheduled for our whole family
i don't think i've gone to more than like 2 appointments in the last 3 years
not really actually
like for what
what the fuck
i can't say i'm not interested but
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
<@180679257851166721> what the fuck is aka cooking
but every time, 10 minute into playing it i immediately go this shit is fucking cringe and demote
cause i had her 2s so i wanted to play her
back when i still play i was always hype for BKE boss in abyss
<:life:1001518241610485781>
that sounds a lot worse actually
the last thing i wanna be is horny at 41 degrees celsius
i'm melting
and i wish it was the furry kind
i'm fucking delirious from the heat
i'd love to, actually
i can test how accurate that information is
i can check for you
can i check
maybe it did get worse then
idk if it's worse or i'm more affected by anime bullshit now
but the amount of paimon meddling actually got under my nerves
which was reasonably interesting
but i did the start of world quest
i didn't remember it being that bad
<a:GAMBAADDICT:1088508671144759358>
the latest arc in blue period is sick tho, can't wait until translator catch up further
i did end up reading the last chapter after i catch up with blue period
ooo lemme see
i think i missed the yelan
so i'll wait more i guess
but there's not really
for some reason i thought this patch had fun banner so i would pull the 10 pull i have
oh shit new record
lumi type three letter properly challenge
hows it going
<:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
<a:TheVoices:1143681011272659015>
you think his mom bribes him to take a shower now and then
more like rumi right
like fair but i think you misunderstand the assignment
so now you're bragging about perserverance and dilligence
so i can destroy them with facts and logic
any other point?
cool
did you try to beat my scores?
haven't you beat every score i set on your acc you tried?
can't wait to come back in 3 months
that was fun
okay i'm bored of genshin
you're kicking my ass on every boss actually
the furry animations are kinda bad tho
her clothe has a little hole for the tail.....
i think paimon is racist
i'm just that nice tho that i would never flame anyone
it's not like anything i, the washed out retired player, can say to affect your self esteem
i mean i know i can
but you might find out later in the run the cd don't line up because you didn't stall a bit there
idk tho like you can do that
no flame tho
but like with not fucking up as much
like what you tried to do on your vid
i do think it's prob better if you time it so just your follow up hits kasumi
oh idk
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
idk what you're talking about then
they don't need sp
save time?
but it really was that interesting, that's so cool
either it was quest only so i would get nothing of value, a teleport like the one to the abyss isle, or just a rando cave
i was like this is a cool place visual wise but i'm guessing if i go there it's not gonna be that interesting
damn genshin exploration is SO good jesus chrst
okay this is awesome
oh shit!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
gimme a second i'm jumping into ei's ground pussy
what a continet
and ei's ground pussy
ei's sky pussy
yeah
what's she trying to imply
why is it in sumeru then.....
yikes...
you can't go there?
wait you're fucking with me right
whoooooa what the fuck is that
i don't care about neuv wrizz
but i want yelan/archon i think?
i think i'm near a pity
yeah
<@197871478950068224> what's the next banner in genshin
maybe it's reddits fault
wait....
don't get why so many of community of works i enjoy are so bad
i should stick to tumblr
god the chainsaw man reddit fucking reeks
the robussy must go nuts
yeah she can spawn there if she wants....
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518> wait what
the fucking stop :donkwalk: to just go
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
i don't think it does?
<a:vibee:1080958006298148995>
i actually vibe with that a lot
what's wrong here?
<:GalaxyFpsScum:1002644841148198932>
<:fpsscumhic:959744049546416148>
i'm prob misunderstanding your question though
empowered active starts the next one at 1 mark already
qte auto fill 3 mark
i think the way it works is that 1 charged attack fills up a mark
and you get the cool weapon active when the enemy has 3 stack
3 stack mark
there should be a mark above the enemy head
like the passive with the 3 hit?
they're getting what
they're optimising how long they have until a 3s valk
some people optimise farming
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
sherlock tet
freudian slip
i've never seen a match history so grey
and he just went 8th
big bro is suffering
yoimiya creepypasta
doom
yes
only tongue i'm twisting is yours with mine
i'm a doom doomer
2s MA is dead
the day fucking doom got a braindead 946 with HN
new
i mean
homie is definitely the hardest boss of those to 946
the first one surprised me tho
boring as hell tbh
those look
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
oh shit lemme take a look
idk wtf you mean with 7.0 when i mean 4.6
<a:pogTasty:887689830052556831>
<:life:1001518241610485781>

<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
that tf coverage is kinda nut on support team
it wasn't +20% before
oh i see why i thought 760 was low
really? huh
idr how well hoh scored
760
is that a good score
what she said
yeah slap the whore
give us the 5 minutes of UR torture just to get a 2500 score
do it
he's working on another plane of existance than us
shesn't
LMFAO
mlp ass name
apple tart
gambling's scary
you kinda have to love the game if you're pulling those hour
xqc was prob the same for overwatch
i feel like all biggest streamer of their game are like that
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and throw every game they are on his team
he would add them to his list
so every time someone annoy him in league for some reason
you've prob seen him too
and he is giga toxic
tyler1 is probably the biggest league streamer
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
tet and cherry have a notepad of names they'll run it down if they meet in abyss
we're making our own tyler1 list
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
but overall i would just rather not
there's a lot to unpack there
like who the fuck is gonna prove you wrong
just say you capped all 3 boss honestly
<:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
only person in the entire server without CN gear or trio
you might be cap aka too
i mean who knows right
and i would go weird i wonder why i did that when i log back in
and unequip all stig on my valk
you could log in right now
stig sherlock
oh okay
like are you behind me or smth
wdym you saw
i think if you had 2-3 business days instead of 5 minutes to clear the boss i think you could clear p2 too
it cleared p1 pretty fast
i did cook a hare run
i don't think any of my tries were that pace
lowkey
1:19
score?
nothing felt playable
what did you even do
yeah
what's your score
no i've seen enough
thank god you kicked me out i was getting stage 5 depression
i was playing
ayo
okay i give up
doesn't help that idk how to play half these valk
this is hopeless
it wasn't there when she release
you see the particle that is hiding her pussy
yeah
bke
i have a dupe m for affix
i have 2
wdym i do
you don't have margrave?
i know the t-
this shit is deprssing huh
but i still want right now
i know myself, i know that i'll give up in 5 min of trying to come up with a rot
i just won't for long
i mean i want to
dw about it i'll give up real fast
i mean they did want to make jayce a good carry
what about yours?
can i try on your acc for a sec?
it's doomed, reroll the acc
you don't have spa either right
IO?
what score are you at
you're fucked lmao
fire dps?
what valk do you have
if you tell him he'll fix it
i think it was a pure honest mistake honestly
his server his fault
i already told you, ask gresham
how hard is it
and i'll come back to simp for a bit
give me a crumb of good character in genshin
that's me though
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it would not surprise me if it actually affect gsr somehow
also trio check <@197871478950068224> ?
uncap fps
can do that for you
oh the collapse client
we talk about hrt and whore
we never talk about bronya or seele
that one is fine tho cause like
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
instead of the hi3 site called honkai guide
and some stupid gsr shit show up
that you look up honkai guide
you know how sad it is
woof
are you talking about me
idk honestly
that one is also really funny
LMFAO
honestly maybe not
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like i'm fucking retarded
what skill issue is
and then he proceed to explain
was the if you're dying to huodou or heimdall, it's skill issue
the funniest part for me
and he has 30x more ego than lumi
that run is more than aqua ever achieve
isn't it sad
i mean in MA that's the highest achievement there is no?
kinda crazy
you have x 0 0 rn
you should get a real score on aka
i think you went faster than ref <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that shit ticked down so slow
you didn't get an 893 you got a 900
holy fuck tyhat timer lumi
she retired in the end of 5.0
as far as i know, at least
no
she was my inspiration, took many t1s in MA before she retire
from blustorm
celine
and now i'm retired
before she retired
<:Cryge:862486122038558740>
and nothing more
that a little weird, just like abyss in MA?
going
i remember me and hime
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i only ever cap 1 3s boss and it was a piss easy one
you're officially better than me
that's fucking insane lumi
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
holy shit
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
it's my go to
do you wanna see real jumpsec
i wouldn't call that one a jumpsec
wdym also
it goes yiff i think
yeah the kira ult while at :57 dunno if possible
oh wait that's styx with 9s nvm
L
the rest is braindead no
that's like you're past all the hard timing
i mean if you got kira ult on p2 at :57
if you got to that point that sounds hard to lose the 893
did you like blunder or
even the :57 p1 i got, it tick down to 56 by kira ult on transition
yea that's real tight
that's kira ult at :57 on transition
oof
so you can prob still cut some time on transition
i've gotten pretty close to 893 without :57 p1
i've seen closer though
yeah maybe, that's pretty close
why
not really
like inside or
<a:DuckSmh:1006448360200347699>
that's what you get going to +16 at once
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
furry connoisseur?
is it or is it not furry
give me your answer later
he should tho
i don't think he uses the face chainsaw that often
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
chan
and it's right
i mean you add some blood
that's only slightly wrong
i lowkey think the new A-rank will have sig gear and will be a usable team
that's nuts
damn you really think they're doing 3 A/B rank + a normal release?
and then maybe they go back to normal release?
my guess is they're releasing the new trio as all A or B rank on that patch
i feel like 7.3 is going to be a break on the normal release
well is it?
yeah like guessing valk is kinda hard
give me a sec lumi i'm taking notes
holy shit ok
cool
wait since when do i have looking
<:Looking:1154847280529162260>
i have no support or dps gear, is my team fucked
are you really surprised
lumi,...
you know how sad i was
31940 xtals
one time i had
yeah i guess that's more endearing
like a ghost with speech impediment
bboo
you startled me
oh shit
i... ate her
i'm a static bat in the background
she has no legs and you're making fun of her
and you're making fun of her
i just spammed IO and pray i get it over fast enough
to have an opinion about any of those take
i honestly don't give enough of a fuck about ER
i think he's thinking of genshin
10 er runs with s2
10 er runs with s1
you think he also did 10 er runs with s0
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i'll post the entire thing so i can ping <@309634550273933314> and she can laugh about it when she wakes up
<:TouchGrass:949110672338350130>
literally unironically touch grass
drives me crazy
i get irrationally mad
cause if the take is really bad, and if it's on reddit so i know it's not a joke
therapy maybe
i gotta do something about it
yeah i feel that honestly
the funniest 4chan post ever
okay i found it
LMFAOOOOO
it boils my blood
maybe i'll bring you to my gamer hater rabbithole later cherry
ik it has sea branch
idk if solstice has eu branch
you talk with him
if you have any problem with solstice or solstice emote
but he's our solstice diplomat
he's high ranking in that server cause he's lead of glb branch of solstice rn
i don't mean it too literally
his rules
his server
idk ask gresham
what i assume naruto is like too
that's
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but you can post it and ping me and i'll answer later
i think i'm going eepy right now
<a:Noted:914214211138244688>
that's a good one
LMFAO they called dick gumshoe dênis
lmao may is aline
phoenix in portugues is fênix veríssimo i think
idk french but i assume that's a good localisation?
phoenix wright pt-br localisation is stacked
and i have not gotten into bed yet
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
i looked at it harder and no
maybe i'll pick it back up
the premise was ineresting
didn't get too far though
i watched the first few episode
<:wholetcook:1151659795531710534>
do your thing <:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
if it's going to fuck with your productivity then we don't need to, neither utena
but if they don't have a good plan for it then <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i mean obviously it would've been better if they can pull off the continuation
yeah
<:wholetcook:1151659795531710534>
it went off the rails tho
neverland beginning had some cool mind games
it's hard tho
i thought it was related to borderland game
i've heard it before
i only watch stuff on watch together nowadays
i won't say i won't but i probably won't
also different from what i imagined
that's
instead of grow
your list shrink
who would know when you start read stuff
<:life:1001518241610485781>
my list is thinning out
i'll add to my list
cherry wanna watch a few episode of utena tomorrow?
yeah that makes sense
i feel like i would end up knowing that info with how popular it was
i said it partly joking, it really surprises me it's an adaptation, i didn't know that
oh ic
yeah a show
wait it's a show i think
i'm down
no actually, is it actually what the movie is based on?
so idc
so they end up killing wh <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961> s
in general i do think leaving them alive bring better story
either writer isn't willing to kill off good character, which is fair
the issue with most death on the media i read/watch is that
i think a good character death will probably hit me hard
nah i get ya
like among us squid game?
funny squid game?
squid game?
from your posts
i feel like i'm getting a really wrong image of what the show is actually like
you know
hazard warning booty shorts
you know those like
bet
if i make myself laugh
should i +2 my own message
okay if i'm giving +2 to every message that make me laugh
love you too buddy i'm doing my best
like ?????? okay
and they fucking roast me
i wanna feel loved
lumi comes here
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
i'm a bad person but i'm real nice

remember honeyhunter
to show appreciation
i'll give +2 to every message i laugh at from now on
+2
it's almost 4am i guess that's what i'm doing
you know you could just not sleep too
or are you just hanging around for longer
lumi do you want attention before you sleep
cow....
so we can fit in your polish AU
oh is that why i'm a hedgehog
tets asleep
have i ever made you laugh lumi
not really i don't have a clue wtf that means
is homestuck
that too
huh
have you thought about that
yes
what if
<a:DuckSmh:1006448360200347699>
they're leaving
just because it's furry hours
coward lumi
based
i feel like that's probably pretty hard
that's really cute, you're pretty good with feral animals
damn that's really good
LMFAO
i'm really not
i'm over being normal about it
thanks
ever
like
for every furry art
you should ping me
yeah
2 days late
<- knows nothing about warrior cats
they didn't even make the names into valid warrior cat names
weak
yeah the 4th one
i only understand the moriso point in there
i don't know any of the words
this show up in my tumblr
thoughts ?
maybe his feedback is not gay enough
like look at that
you know maybe that's why i don't watch normal show with normal people in it
why do they look like that
bigger?
big slut
um
slut?
like
i love otters
but i didn't want it to sound like i was calling you a slut
oh i was going to do fox or otter
what animal do you see yourself as cherry
i wouldn't
lumi behaviour
she can still teach
emperor
hmmmm
you're a penguin to me
i got it cherry
and every time you gotta fight the urges to not go will my nuts fit in your mouth or some stupid shit like that
like you meet someone and they go nice to meet you will
imagine being named will in general
you'll never know what it's like to hug a dog girl and feel her smooth fur on your skin
you see in the end this is the truth of being a furry
my bad
lemme think about that one
imagine having no responsibility only dog
you get it right lumi
that's me being pat by cherry
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
no i've watched like 3 movies in my life
are you telling me to roll over so you'll pet me
<a:bulbaroll:891085983485927455>
<:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
what about me lumi
not the aesthetics much
i dunno i guess i only like the being treated as a dog part
no
girl kind
the
<:BatChest:1087075069139898528> dogecoin?
or a dog
either a doe
in my mind i'm definitely
any mole
or just
that one in specific
wait fuck i'm about to get 1984'd again
now you get discriminated against
that was my trick to see if anyone know anything about sonic
hah got you
none of the other ones from sonic are
i just didn't know it was a real animal
i'm fine with hedgehog tho
damn that is lumi
or else they'll block me
so i get a different one right?
lumi took the sonic kin
no chill
sonic kin assigned me
my girl fucking
nevermind forget i asked
jesus christ
if you're not tied to birb, since my pfp is birb
no i just wanna know what's cherry opinion of me
can i be something else
damn that's tet
i go
every cat video i see
ground bound
you could be elis sibling
you can do whatever you want tho
sleep well
lumi you're the kind of person who watches unusual memes weekly
literally unironically 1984
and they changed it to like whilst thou suck
they redid that commercial for the remake
breakfast samsara
they're conjoined
i have the misogynist nintendo ad
we can trade
they have no soul
that's irl accurate to hare lore
i wouldn't expect you to understand......
it's okay lumi
hares are not bunny
i'm pretty sure the second one is a hare
no flame tho
it's weirder than gay cannibalism
lumi whatever the fuck you got going on
cherry-o
will you be
which honestly i support
oh i thought you were just on your transguy arc
+2
she's married??
i'm not stealing yours
don't steal mine
i can do 3
there u go
犬
oh wait i can do one more
dog cão
i can do 2 language
lumi is really touched by your worldliness cherry
that's what me calling someone a dog is
i'll call you a good girl and pat you all over
that's a compliment in my books
you know me
like you can improv p2 and still 880
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
you can do whatever the fuck you want
it's more that like
like it's not even that it's easy to match input well enough to 880
i don't think i ever saw a ref with such a disparage
no flame but like what even
880 is the freest shit imaginable
still you're a beast
i suck, so you surpassing my bar is not hard
it's not like you're aqua or anything
i mean keep your ego under control
go off
but ok
literally my major
that's ram usage, no cpu or gpu
i mean that's different stuff tho
it felt a little easier to :57 but i'm not nearly as consistent as you are
i don't think so
i still get bottlenecked to 80-100 fps when a lot is going on
my pc isn't good enough to fps scam
issok i got bored tbh

oh i think it's mostly on ulting with ly
cool ok
either it's that tight
and i'm kira ult on :58 on p1
comparing run, i'm 3 frames slower
idk if it's possible without fps scam
i don't fps scam
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528> i'm recording some gameplay to compare with ref
<@309634550273933314> ruby wants to talk with you
okay i'm -1
okay i'm -2
so it's 866 888 893?
<:elywhip:1002644839248183306>
get back to it
i would say no it's not
for fun?
why is your aka score so bad
can i log in then?
nah looks boring
wait do i really
oh i wanna try that....
do you want me to stream attempt?
not really doing anything rn
sure
me?
is it up right now?
stockholm
3s wardens was pretty good as far as 3s boss goes
if anything i enjoy was wardens
lots of annoying positioning
that boss is kinda mid i think
cool
oh the whore one
what's that
...couatl?
+2
that's a good one
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
at a certan point you gotta question why they get 2 update out per year
discord is held up by duct tape
i mean
still pretty bad tho
that makes it slightly better
there's a betterdiscord plugin
check harder
dumbass
i can't type there
lmao wrizz
there's a fake aqua and a real aqua?
yesterday?
or did it already pass and i msis it
wait isn't today v3 of lk2?
number is how long the patch is
first date is CN date, second is glb/sea date
do you want it carv?
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i have a spreadsheet for that
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
i'm digging him is all
i retract my statement
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
same but it is a dig
if they did
i mean they could probably get legitimately sued
the accident
some call me, a beast
with my hands and arms
myself
i built my one
i don't think they can just fuck off with it
so
with real money
i mean bridge is a thing you can buy
yeah probably
optimise these
like if you add it all up i mean
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i've stared at that screen for so long
like, man
and i'm attached to current
it look a lot like genshin
the valk select is w/e
looking at your valk rn feel like you're home
that background fucking sucks
makes a big difference
not having the real bridge
damn yeah
easy right ?
more hot men for harder cock
my cock only gets hard when i see hot men
wdym there are none
<:RemHighFive:752716894544330812>
more men more men
aren't they on your side
don't you simp men
are they wrong tho
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
i'll list out a few critical thinking questions after
every time i make a joke
try again
persona 6 mc looking ass
pi plays pokemon streams?
are you also getting recommended the
it's probably just really good luck
and this is what comes out
i just come on the computer and smash my hands on the keyboard
i haven't actually learned english yet
she's being tsundere over being tsundere
no amount of hatred you have for me will ever surpass how much i hate myself
that's cute
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
can you imagine genshin with 2s MA
<a:HUH:1129107980634312724>
the enemy and endgame design is pretty bad
the exploration is really good
the characters are mostly mid
yeah
i would still be playing genshin to this day
if genshin had honkai MA/abyss
are... you trolling?
what were you asking about
it's what i'll give you when we get married <3
i don't think it's a bug
i don't remember it by name
maybe
like <:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
but it doesn't pause the timer on intermission
genshin boss design is just 3s ma boss
unironically yeah
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
just nothing to do with it
genshin probably has the best combat of all mihoyo game
i wouldn't mind genshin gameplay either
i mean i don't mean genshin
but if they can make them good i'm down for it
and each character will get 5 line of characterisation before they move on to the next
i'm very scared it'll be just genshin
i'll give it a chance
idk i kinda vibe with it
<:life:1001518241610485781>
but yeah
i already do
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
and them going
and level up points
i mean yeah but it's cool telling people about coop levels
like the coop levels n stuff
do you think they'll keep support for weird system
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
making up a new gimmick and using it on every new valk for a while
honkai already do that constantly
but that just sound like a new gimmick
i'd find it weird if they retroactively add it to old valk
i mean
doesn't look like any core change
the gameplay they show just look like new valk
i don't really get it <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
what's even new tho?
like the entire tft event tutorial is still there
there's still a lot of old event files in the game
less than what you think probably
carv we have max friendship level irl i think that's really sweet
doesn't matter for me tho
i'm attached to the old one is all
the UI looks fine
cut down the spending by a half at least
i might quit over these changes
honestly the doomposting is fair
yes, tet?
no longer 😭
they should give her skin bloom honestly
that one is pretty funny to me
yea probably if we're talking about intent
is it for men? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
gotta look at her more to know why tho
she looks a little weird to me
wait wheres ag?
timing looks tight tho
or jk ult too early
then you're either jk charged too late
so if your qte goes away, then your jk reproc it
qte proc doesn't refresh
yeah iirc
timing looks rough
and stall a bit so the qte goes away
she proc qte early
yeah i think so
yeah
<a:duckass:1148861036351471637>
wait
:duckpls:
they're what?
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
are you going to fight me about it
so what if i'm a dog girl that's into degradation
i'm only misogynist
well, not me tho
very explicitly so
icic
see?
actually lumi can say it cause she's yellow
lumi racist arc
try pressing button faster ?
oooh ok
oh ok
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> he's not even busting out a move
are you like
i cannot tell wtf you're trying to show with these pics
wake up nqn
<a:dinkDonk:1002463636591218688>
L
<a:Jammies:854425479334199336>
super jammies
don't worry about it
spam attack
it's going to be like
i mean
and then they did and it looked pretty cool
can you show me actual gameplay now
that's cool and all, you're jerking off genshin player
like  the first half of the gameplay i was like
is anyone saying that
yeah
like you think you'll quit for 2 year and come back to 30k xtal or what
obviously
how are you on the wawa meta now ruby
<a:wawa:1118831924509675530>
or something like that
like GD was golden diva, but gd2 could be giant diddies 2
it could also be different words from the older abbrv too
to see which one could make sense
so i gotta read all part 1 abbrv
i'm stealing a part 1 abbreviation and putting 2 in the front
cool but i'm doing my own thing
lemme come up with the abbreviations already
uhhhhhhh
that's uhh
she's on earth fucking seele heavily
there's no chance you won't be able to start at p2
they could update the tutorial and it give you the B-rank of new trio
yeah
new trio
7.3 prob have all three release at once?
i'll prob log back in to test it out
i vibe with that tbh
damn so new MC ain't playable?
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
hak is WHAT over the UI still not update
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
press button faster
that's skill issue
if you're matching damage but still -1
if u don't u don't
if u match damage u match damage
i mean
that's how it works for all HoH boss
cause it's HoH
the rest is autoplay
like there's 2 hard timing
heph was always kinda free tbh
i mean not scorewise, just on -1 status
oh fuck no
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
i balded that one quite a bit
i was active on heph release
...yeah?
i'm so proud
you matched me
holy shit <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
your teri is in another genshin
i think her ult just someone show up for fun
oh idk if it's duo ult actually
duo ult?
that combat gameplay looks wicked
okay can't lie tho
with part 2, everyone abbrv should be an old abbrv but with 2 afterward
it's good i didn't name anyone 2
i gotta rename lk2
okay wait i got it
i suggest you don't throw them tbh
hn2?
a red head who dances
holy shit
who cares
we're all fucking weebs
then say the japanese name
wtf
newer than opm?
one punch man?
it's sooo fucking finnicky
i can't not love it, it's too good
but if you stick around it becomes something you get stockholm syndrome
it's the kind of thing where it scare new player off
yeah everyone does
it's still sad though
realistically speaking i do prefer for them to move on rather than make the story longer for fun
i just wanna say though it is a lil bittersweet seeing how the honkai i loved and spent so much time playing is actually truly done
i missed the part 2 discussion
woaaaa your hair is so pretty!
is :Holy: new meta?
LOVE WAS CHANGIN THE MINDS OF PRETENDERS
continuing on
that's a great point, tet
yes, tet?
nice
oh it is night!
like holy fuck
his example for singularity should be his own ego
this is too much for me
and the L one opens linkedin
the T one opens microsoft teams
do it i'm still stunlocked that it's a real thing
tell him to try out the ctrl shift alt win L trick
next time aqua talk about his no rank sp no rank jk
wait wait i have a better one
did you know? if you press ctrl shift alt win T, you can open the software that gave me endless anxiety attacks
then he can boast about his dumb project making tests on humans now
hmmm yea maybe
like he saw all the tests failing and somehow on his mind he's like sick let's take it to the next step
it's actually depressing how delusional one person can get
oh i didn't know the second part
kinda unhinged ngl
pv as f2p option for lightning support is
the DA one is a joke tho yea
so they know as much as we do, or at least publicly so
they want good standing with mihoyo
moriso doesn't really deal with leak
i'll catch up to the stuff that's ongoing when i finish that
i'm binging blue period rn
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
what the fuck did they do to the furry girl
moriso
this guy plays with 5 fps
one of the chapter is just named penis
m <:omegalul:408829995360714772> ris <:omegalul:408829995360714772>
you ask avg honkai player they couldn't name 1 top player besides maybe keeb
does he actually have delusion of grandeur
<a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>
if you're 2% on easy week you're a beast
then 2% will be easier than on easy week
i mean if aka is turbo cbt
that's funny
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
huuuuuge
holy shit
poes law
<a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>
smh
yeah you should feel bad lumi
2027 we get our first quad elf
unless they make trio elfs in the future
fire and phys/ice and lightning will never happen
if you think about it, if they keep the schedule
that's ice lightning
kevin elf
how is it more weird than fire and lightning
you think they'll double up again
yes sire, very good sire
is that he wanted to stream until he had enough lp to make it to next day
yeah the reason boxbox streamed for 28 hours
that is absolutely true
he doesn't need the bootcamp cashout, so he's just leaving it for the more in need
he's already the biggest tft streamer
honestly he is so kind
really setting the mood
i have no clue
<a:wawa:1118831924509675530>
why the fuck is big bro chat obsessed with wawa
how is aphelios and xayah so bad when they're so cool
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
give every valk 2 of those
they should make a set where that's a main mechanic
you know, riftwalker and the boss is so cool
24/7 stream until set 10 pbe
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
give hof zhongli cons
<:peepoSit:1009060765887647846> 🚙
yes please
have you tried running WD
<:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
honkai deez nuts on your face LMFAOOOOOOOOOOO
there's a honkai section yea?
if you go to wfp
it's uh
i can't actually tell if the other ones are in japanese or not
oh that makes sense
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
why is star rail logo there the jp one?
+2 even
marg is prettier though
he was at 350 at one point, down to 170
i think boxbox promise on stream he only stop streaming when he hit 400 lp
actually inhuman
yeah idk how he can fast 8 that fast
<@180679257851166721> boxbox pulling big bro hours
you're unstoppalbe now
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
transphobe lumi
<:life:1001518241610485781>
the day has come where i don't understand wtf is the point of a 2s MA ref
thanks for the hard work lumi
knot curisu is that an order or
we should never have doubted
fucking beast he is
no accomplishment of yours will ever match what aqua can do in EU
rolled wrong country to be born in, and now you're playing on story mode server
i think you're just unlucky on that ruby
idk if he actually realise how much he's actually spending
also wtf
damn nvm then
was that after he start spending?
he won't skip any valk
with how much he's putting into the game
trust my word
you are following His teachings afterall
to be compared to Him
you should be proud no
like everyone else
just run ly then?
aquapilled
how fucked is your fire
i should've honestly guessed she was a furry tho she kept saying like back when i was a puppy and i can't quite put my claw on it
i got fucking jumpscared by a furry dating game
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<@781539392039682058> i'm watching a marble video and my girl just stops halfway thorugh to promote echo
what
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
it's not permission that is the issue, i feel weird about talking about someone i know behind their back
i was trying so hard not to be mean and the question wasn't even for me
oh
i get easily annoyed
there's a what
i also have another home but i neglect it often
this is my home
nice to meet you lumi
<:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
or else i'd know who you are
clearly not
<:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
i've never seen this pfp around here
who are you
cause alternating season we get new WT valk on bp
we only get 3 bp valk per year
man i never thought about it
yeah....
3-5 years?
yeah mb
oh
do you not have her?
nyx is like next on being added to witch orb tho i think
with the current system i don't think so
and we can get like 3 or 4 valk per season
i mean maybe they rework how bp works soon
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and i worked really hard to achieve it
your honor it's girlstink
hold still
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
i thought it was like 2s/s2 hrt > s0 lk2 > s0 hrt
oh really?
s0 hrt, she'll get some use as support too
i do definitely think lk2 is a good pull for eli acc tho
doesn't sound like a good deal to me
to get pe card
like spending 22k on backpulling
yeah
owo math 76 * 280
brick is what, 76 pull?
yeah i really wouldn't if you're skipping lk2
you're like, skipping the best deal and you have to make up so much to backpull
i honestly dunno how good of an idea going for spending event is if you're skipping patch valk
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
so you're pulling lk2 right
damn
first i love ely
so how much do you need to spend? 30k for pe card?
nice
do you have to pull? can't you buy 25k bchip for the apocalypse?
like an ice cream
can't you just save and buy something else
why do you wanna pull again?
like look at this
us 3 should talk more often our colors are so nice
:you can complete the emote with your imagination:
oh sorry
you can complete the emote with your imagination
pull this
that's a great emote tho
<a:howody:1143461710150250557>
jesus fuck
what's wrong
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
so hak is the type of person that actually come back to playing with the book event
because of weakpoint i guess?
maybe his heart misses the d3 streams
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
but bet
i didn't watch adventure time
so that's sick
i'm going over my su phase rn
holy shit
thanks so much heki
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
holy shit
huh??????????
???????????????????
thanks so much
thanks love u
can you record some for me?
i don't have tiktok
i would cry
OH SHIT
someone hotfix cherry gender and no one announced
we need some patch note rundown for shit like that
oh is that only in maincord?
wait cherry you're he/him now?
i never watched star wars but that's what i imagine the one old guy arm to look like
that back scratcher looks p funny
which genshin is it
oh this looks fun to do
put litter in its place fuck yeah i am
i love the name of that official emote
🚮
just ER
herrscher of rebirth: E
genshin i think
that's just how australia is
fine
they finish out the story, leave australia for the first time and the rest of the world is just
like kevin is like i will kill everyone or smth and kiana goes naurr
can you imagine austrailian kiana though
thanks for the trivia
idk what you're talking about
most languages use commas i think
?
it's at least partly mihoyo fault
i mean the fact they didn't put a space between the comma and the next number
that was definitely meant for both of you
can confidently say that you are though
mobius has it too
between 5 and 5000
i think that's a range, guys
i mean i'm not judging but i hope he can afford it
oh ok
the 25k bchip he's saving up for when EoL, the game become singleplayer and you won't be able to top up anymore
right?
and no cn gear
cause he was s0 hrt
like recently i mean
how much did he spend
h
tell him he should be proud about being the only t100 with unmaxed gear
gaslight him into thinking M piece isl ike 30% damage diff
do it
fragile simp, even
tet if you beat up fragile can you also give him a lil kiss on the cheek and say i sent it as a fragile fan
anyone know any good fighting game?
to get Him back
we need to retire fragile
okay so the master plan is
you think this is enough for Him seek therapy now?
lmao his M piece on cn isn't maxed
i didn't know fragile was s0 hrt too
holy shit
if His confidence is from delusion, i can't imagine the hit from being just thoroughly skill gapped like that
fragile is prob s0 END outscoring His 2s2
very little excuse too
if i were to guess he just got demotivated from not being able to score well this boss
idk what you're talking about, the biological ones were never new
no, there's the natural and the weird ones
what will we do without Him
god uses them too
if you think about it, it's just vanilla neopronouns
His* confidence, His* ranks, carrying Him*
sorry
is his confidence being affected now that his ranks aren't carrying him?
first stardust valk will prob be a-rank
where is the last arc
did they delete the last chapters?
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
he's just making his own ,..aqua711
chill
aqua is playing 5d chess
pay 200 dollar to lose 1 coin
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
ngl i live for that stuff
<:lewd:959737567119556618>
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
i downgrade my nitro to save money
i'll see if i can afford
<:NOOOO:889014281826369607>
but i mean i guess i can give it a chance
it sounded fun until they kill off the fun character
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
and i think the only one i'd read if i would is one piece
i haven't read the big 3 tbf
they're like i love x character and i'm like that character had a single scene on the first season
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
i talk with people and it feel like they read something different than me
yeah i really don't get it
just weird that i never expect it
i mean that's fair, i don't mind weird release sched from spy x family, it's still more often than half of the other stuff i'm reading which is monthly or worse
<:ReallyMad:930908505890770954>
and tenmaku gets culled at 20
how come jujutsu get to stumble around for 60 chapter before it start getting good
tenmaku was going so well honestly
i'm kinda salty
tenmaku got axed <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282> and spy x family has weird release sched
oh i guess that's normal
only 4 manga i'm following have update
did something happen this week
always catch me by surprise
and they're using default name generator
i heard that the random name generation from tumblr itself just slaps that hard
apparently these are not tumblr bots who are good at naming themselves
<:wokejj:1118547247567745164>
casually omit that all testing was done on rl boss
2s is not worth a lot cause really i had enough damage at s2
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
are you saying there's one 9s guy in eu who don't give a fuck and you can score above him?
like what are you talking about my dude
consistently?
it's like destiny urf
so you can minmax cap your fps according to game necessity
every keyboard comes with an fps knob
the year is 2040
not the fps
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
they take about the same avg time to make a move
honestly yea
actually letting normal player have fun for a patch
he's actually so nice
aqua plays honkai like it's chess
like even in eu
can s0 hrt even t10
+2
people feeling bad in a vaccuum don't affect me in the slightest
their emotion just influence it
but in the end, it's still about my emotion
i only feel guilty if someone else feels bad if i care about the other person, and them feeling bad makes me feel bad
to me, it's always about your own emotion
as an emotion, i use guilty as a synonym to regret
like a word definition thing?
hmm
it looks like it's from a doujinshi
what would you do if you find out i'm actually like 10
<a:peepoCrybabybottle:756569224746631219>
maybe i'm 14
i mean often time you can just know from how the person act and ask question that they don't actually want advice, they're just insecure and want confirmation on what they're already doing
just so i don't feel bad about it later when he fuck his acc anw
i'll give actual advice the first 2-3 times
that's me with crystal
fair
he would not listen to you
i mean
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
just less people tried
the bosses were just cbt, i didn't do that well
because like
my t10 was pretty anticlimatic tbh
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
i'm proud of my own improvement rather than performance related to other
i'm always more proud about how close i am to cap than position on leaderboard tbf
so i can't actually flex it much cause it sounds boring
i sometimes talk about it but i don't think i even took a pic of it
do.... you?
so is any achievement worthy of building confidence on
aren't we all NA back when i t10
that is absolutely true
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and i don't have that confidence
cause like i t10 ma in na
is that even understandable to have such confidence with a t10? like on any server besides maybe cn or kr
it's actually insane
yea, nothing wrong with being stupid, the unwavering confidence on it is unhinged tho
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
and he spent 3k on 2 months
i think he's unemployed
he is probably spending money he shouldn't be tho
i mean maybe but that's not the issue, it's just the overblown confidence while having pretty mid to outwardly extremely wrong takes
you've been forgiven of your sins
holy shit
my guy act like he's the best player on the server
and is more confident than keeb
he's like a young whale
that's a bit vague
i saw 13 on the day of acc creation and the day of joining the server and went alright that's the same day
oh wait i'm fully dyslexic i guess
what the fuck is the smart ass planning
wait what happened?
always surpassing our expectation
maybe even buff
so mort don't nerf those aug
yeah it's fbi insider job
<a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
not even himself is confident anymore
if he secure down a 4th i'm p sure he's above avg for that aug
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
i'm watching it <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
he was training other trait so when bilgewater get nerf he can finally climb
it was a training arc you see
<:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
is the ass fat or is she missing 40% of her waist
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
wc 2s do you even love her
affinity made the mistake of doing it way too specific
affinity was right all along
garuda hua gather shieldbreak stun support
is extremely funny to me
dan heng eating a burger
LMFAO
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> thanks steam!
oh shit
that's why i need another mei M ig
was a good week too
i almost cried one week where i somehow manage to lock both mei M and 3 newt B on the same boss
L
game telling you to get v2v
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
why did you ask taihen and not Our Lord And Saviour?
<a:Winkheart:634510215395409921>
;)
what about my face? i'm gorg
you can tell if someone actually bald if their HoS ult is the stage or a black orb
that's it actually, the implication of making fun of bad graphics is about the best joke i can make about it
i'm allowed to make fun of bad graphics cause that's how i played the game for the entire time
LMFAO did they change LE's lead to this?
what anime is 500 day since announcement?
whoa
yeah surely it was a mistake the past times it happened
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
i'll be mad if the all the actual story happens in books game has all the story in books
and she did
cherry: i can make him worse
i could do that instead
oh
i'll keep asking everyone my position on their underarc tier list, and the second someone asks for my tier list i'll immediately kill myself
how high am i in your list
h-he scales i swear
<a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>
honestly i'll take fourth or fifth
i was ready to hold down the last spot
oh i thought it was a trust tierlist, not a flirt tierlist
so it doesn't affect your judgement
that's the point, yes
i'll leave my guess in spoilers so it doesn't affect cata's judgement -> deez nuts
what place am i
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
have you seen his gameplay
yeah he has patience alright
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
still hasn't downloaded the patch
late game streamer
chill he scales
nice
the ones with girl pics are p boring tho yea
the no pic ones always have entertaining names, they try
it's different types
i've been getting some pretty good ones
<@309634550273933314>
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> i was there for that game idk wtf he was cooking
cool
oh she's out?
30 pity
sp type supply
yeah like
gacha valk + sp supply
i'd just stick with low rank, next patch is expensive no?
unless you have like a set budget for each patch and have to spend it all
dk diff
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
and you kill in the same number of attack
and you match all damage reqs
wait so you're running mimis ref
meanwhile all newer and a lot of older valk can be veeeery lenient on early input
i think it's just cause you can't do it any early at all
idk what's wrong with it
like why
for fun
is so fucking incosistent
HoH input right after you take control of her like from qte in/after finisher
it's not just me right
<@309634550273933314> have you seen the garfini
tet doing math on the discord
owo math 11
yeah
we should email it to him
is there a small chance hi3rdguy has seen it
did you ever post that outside of here
before and after schariac pussy is still one of the top 5 messages i've ever sent in this discord
different people did certain edit to it
i thought it was a group project
no
oh was it cherry that did it?
that looks like the most low effort pog on earth
first yt video you open
like was it first google search or
how did you even get that image tet
i would ask if you like open your hand in there but then it wouldn't be called fisting
or do you just put it in and sit there like <:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
do you like fuck the person with your arm
so idk how it works
i actually never watched fisting porn
he's about to unfist you
to you
doctor on the go.
go to the doctor.
sign up now
yeah :baiting:
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
max mpe pri same score
mitternacht on pv was actual paper weight
for a while there bows were so trash
no more butts allowed
fuck it christian pivot
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
why do you always have to make it sexual
mpe doesn't use chakrams :/
so true bestie
foundry bow sucks so hard
i don't have proof but my gut feeling is no question about it
s0 mpe with bow deal more damage than 3s 3/4 foundry bow (surprising!)
mpe bow too strong~
they should've done the same thing with elysia release
oh ok
and then international team was because overseas tc figured some alternative changes and then it was like cn tc with overseas tc = international
i thought it was national team because it come from cn tc and the game is cn
is national team because they're all liyue?
wait
not my job to tell you lmao
if someone asks you just answer figure it out dipshit
just iriya it out
so we can't have a whore twink team
your real complaint should be that she's not phys
you still can if you're not a pussy
same
really wish you had the option to turn on whore like ok
got whiplash from someone else using whore as her abbreviation
i mean the point was it to look cooler
if you wanna stare at your valk for a bit
you should up your graphics a bit
she bought welkin merch
holy shit
that those people do that
i don't think it's a bad thing tho
instead of looking elsewhere
they squeeze it out of it
and when they need or want something that that fandom doesn't provide
there's a certain type of young person who tie all their personality to one piece of media or fandom
my real theory is that
just paw off to normal skins
draw porn of it? how creative
like what are people gonna do on the porn game
i think it's just size of community and unmet necessities probably
and noelle with malleable booba plates
was pv in lingerie
when i start genshin, the 2 thing that made me stop and go what the fuck
for genshin it certainly is for me
especially when the rest of the cast is like, p fine
i mean other things being worse doesn't make pv less bad
it's insane isn't it? like why
and the twins
which is how i deal with pv too actually
but with skimpy clothes like that and a body that looks like she's 15 my eyes just gloss over and i go k not interested but the colors are nice
like idk, it's not that i dislike hrt
idk i'm not gonna lie i do really prefer those clothes on a design closer to SW than what we got
isn't sw just bronya milfed the fuck up?
that is true
weird
and bronya did not show up
well i just looked up hrt on google
if you say so <:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
that's SW eyes no?
i mean look at her eyes
idk i never really paid too much attention to hrt
SW on hrt clothes?
i don't mind that tbh
<:Oldge:1125538916838158396>
and then maybe i'll pick it back up in the future
i just have a lot of plans and i kinda already accepted that some times i'll just drop stuff for a long amount of times for reasons not even i understand
i mean it's not like i'm not planning to do it
yeah.......
yeah....
like everyone talks about like the standard is really high
teacher i've talked with real people online that wouldn't pass the turing test
and it took so much out of me to not say
today my class was about AI and my professor talked about the turing test
turing test passed
that's most leaks
we could watch a few episode weekly here
wanna watch it together? i never did finish it, i got to the middle of black rose arc
LMFAOOOO okay that one is S-tier
my ss bosses :crying emoji: :crying emoji:
i wanna steal that but change n to r
so you just go hahah that's not what they'd do but that's a funny meme
and it's like only kinda close to what they'd actually do
there's no drama, there's 3 type of content, fanart, insanely deep literary analysis and those posts where they paste funny tumblr memes over a screen shot of certain character faces
2. small fandoms are the best, it's insane
and
1. utena slaps
cherry i was on utena tags this morning on tumblr
but what's wrong with not being self aware, why can't i just be cringe?
isn't it weird tho? like acting like that stuff is only good if it's self-aware, if you're tacky knowing you're tacky then you're camp, we rename it to a different thing to make it feel better
that's most guy teenager right before giving a group presentation
i'm proud to be tacky
is that a bad thing?
the one mimi sourced
i'm friend of the tet
i'm like proudly showing you to others
why would take it any other way
like those weird tacky golden dildos very rich people have on their table
you're like
that is true, i have you
unhinged but also i wish i was you
which is why it's simulation
i just bruteforce it with programming
but i'm not smart enough for it
you could math it out probably
i did
these
i taled about them so often
what?
the site?
don't you remember the pull simulations i did?
what??
yeah my major is in coding
every time i write i go sooooo true
so some pieces of code look like this
i've been coding in kotlin and some kinds of expressions you return by just stating the value instead of saying return x
i have no fun sex things, sorry
i do not have a buttplug
unironically true
stare deep into your eyes and you mind cum so hard you collapse
i mean idk they could mindfuck you or something
there's not even 2 genders to be bisexual, stop coping
asexual would encompass it, because it encompasses every way that is not sexual
i mean the new way sould still have to be sexual or asexual
true
and one of them is really hot aliens
do you have those lists of like, okay to cheat on
would your bf be fine with it
hard stuck diamond, soji fell off honestly
my guy is not having a good time
same person
oh my god it can happen to anyone
for fun
i must sound unhinged cause i always divide every message like 12 times
does it happen to me
his car needs to have precision down to frame perfect
it's always they making 500 mistakes on an MA run and then they look at you and go yeah i can't score higher without frame perfect input
honestly looking back it's so funny, everyone who ever says the word frame perfect for honkai is always talking out their ass
frame perfectly, he saw no sp, and he decided to move on with his rot instead, not noticing the sp coming in a few frames later
true
sp issue with 3s hrt on rl boss
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
fucker still play it wrong somehow
they make valk the most braindead ever, button flash when you need to press it
i mean maybe mihoyo is kinda right
this is why i'm so much better than you
by the time i'm at 3s you've not even awake yet
sigma grindset, i wake up at 4 am, 10 runs with s0, 10 runs with s1, 10 runs with s2
what the hell
karate kid ass routine
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
wtf is he doing on the other bosses
that the only boss he thinks is a plushy with no hp is ignite HoV
that's scary tho no
i alt tab once during ly ult on a good run and came back dead
trying to balance out the odds
<:ICANT:995593696030507099> thats actually so fucking funny
LMFAOOOOO holy shit
it really does i felt awful blocking it
cancerous proposal
just blocked my first banger bot name on tumblr
probably possible
what score you're aiming for?
get husked lmfaooo
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
i downloaded it already
<@781539392039682058> goodbye volcano high is out
he is the manliest man
you know you're right
isn't yone a pretty boy?
LMFAOOO
i think
pet her
with lillia
oh
be happy
idk like
so like what's my unrealistic goal then?
zoe too right?
yeah i don't get that tho isn't it harder to get to the stars
or like a lil bit more realistic, reeled in
is that supposed to be like further than the stars?
that sucks
damn
is he like a third wheel or smth
i thought varus was the two gays
wait what
my legit horny is at most getting stepped on <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
idk chief those are the stars for me
cause they keep making more ionia valk
i think riot prob agrees that ionia slaps
noxus kinda sucks ass if you think about it
he is too cool to be 4.8 avg
<a:NOOO:844609807675162685>
anything but aphelios
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
okay that one is more horny than my thoughts <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
I wish that when i die, i could reincarnate as a tree on Runeterra, because then someone would eventually chop me down, and then i could hope that Lillia would eventually rest her tight little deer ass on me while she stops to sit down, and take a long (emphasis on long) rest
where is the lilia copypasta
yes
busting out the moves is what she's doing
i feel like she'd be into pegging
i would fuck fiora
showing your true colors there
that's the wrong one hak
don't call her liliya
i don't think i would bang ahri
who doesn't (for the second one)
it is
honestly i think those are a lot more league than piltover zaun
ionia would be sick
neuvillette sounds like the small version of the real valk called neuville
like piltover start into gunner zaun
isn't that pretty possible too
holy shit <:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
oh ok apparently that is misleading, it took about 2 year to make
didn't the first season take like 6 years
that's first season of 2024 right
winter 2024 is turbo soon tho nno?
just no release date
i mean they confirmed it was going to happen right after season 1 end, no?
ixtal reroll is suppose to be broken
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
:looking:
ay wheres my emote
:looking:
get over it
anything after HoS = new to me
it's new because you didn't max the skill you unlocked from 2s, dumbfuck
kys
i mean me hating every new battlesuit is par for the course chief
let's make hb again but a lot more annoying
and then they went like
i like how people commemorate when hb die because her stack mechanic was annoying (even though i didn't think it was that bad)
that's fucking insane
woah
holy shit nini is like nienie like stephanie?
because she's a cat
using rc over her is based
okay as much as i don't hate ly for fun
are you also kira hater
+2
dumb ass
it's 270
you got it wrong too
yeah show us your moves
this much left
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
i skipped it yea
i hate kira because she sounds like a highschool bully
sorry the real reason is cause she laughed for a little too long
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i am also misogynist
so true hak
and pick a mid character to hate for fun
i think they spin a wheel
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
releasing qte?
toddler routine
i'll chill out once my class ends and i eat something and i take a nap
sorry i'm just being annoying for fun cause i'm bored and hungry
check weapon
it's probably gear if i would guess
<a:DuckSmh:1006448360200347699>
but if a MAN says that to a FEMALE then society is all up and arms about it
i tried to own tet and i very quickly self own
my bad i'll shut up
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
wait nvm that skin is paid right
and then using the skin you got for free
imagine paying for a valk
the definitely not underage one barely narrows down gacha games
okay that description is less clear than mine
azur lane is the shipgirl one right?
and then we can move on
rework those
remove all others for now
when has C-rank boss ever been competitively viable?
yeah we should start from the beginning
<:elywhip:1002644839248183306>
get to it devs
rework it back to 2s
i also want a rework
settle for 2nd honestly
if you think about it we're team aqua
achievable goals
set real goals
i mean no but like
focus on the 3s ones, they have huuuuuge rewards (20 xtals)
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i never doubt him, that's fake gameplay footage he made to throw off the ops
<:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
a lot of the input can be cleaned up too, some places you could be pressing buttons a lot faster
when you could do another active before ult
some of your rotation choices are a bit weird, like on p2 you do qte -> weapon active -> charged -> ult
both on micro and macro
yeah there's plenty of room to improvement there
that's how my first run when i'm still looking at ref look like
not flame tho
every input he takes like .3s to process and think about what the next thing he needs to do <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it's not even worth it to bald further
but when he play to score, his performance is close enough to frame perfect that honestly
the gameplay recording are sloppy
schrodingers aqua
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
did they just not bother to balance that one in pbe
jesus christ wtf, how long has it been out
i can only assume its tet
a tumblr cat blog is serial liking all my reblogs
<@309634550273933314> is it you?
ill watch and play when i get home in a bit
LMFAO im just entering my class now tho
misty TMB more like misty Tits Melons Bosom
she could crush me under her boobs
stop dreaming
dreams are heavy because they weigh you down
it's a metaphore
elysia is a hologram
and then i got disappointed
i scroll past and i went beidou in honkai?
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
buff hua
she needs therapy probably
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
it kinda gives ammunition to what some transphobe think of trans people when there's one in the community doing just that
yeah, it feels especially bad for the actual good faith trans girl in the community
she's taking advantage of rando lonely guy online while probably actually being trans
from my pov the most reasonable explanation is that it's both <:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
true
i lowkey don't know what to make of it still
it's wild to me that it works to this day
eh i guess i do
genuinely don't understand what's her deal anymore tho
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
unironically yes
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i cannot read
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
you think they're getting boosted there too?
<a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>
i'm a great slut for money
sign me up chief
ninis a pimp?
30 minutes of matching pfp like for what
holy shit wtf are those prices
when i finally fully backinvest on my acc, i started slowing down spending and quitting a lil after
i didn't really get to the point of upkeep an account
yeah that's how i understand it also
it's like 1.5-2k per patch for max spending right? 3s new valk and gear n stuff
that's probably not true, but it's comparable
i think he's spending more per patch rn than styx does
unlike actual big whale
isn't he at p much top spending too
saving up for EoS, cause he won't be able to buy more bchip then
he feels a lil down so he goes i'll look at my bchip
like an aquarium?
my guy is paying netflix subscription to mihoyo for +8 atk but isn't doing dk raids
how much is 250 bchip again
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
oh
than have to scroll to link something to your chat
if that's the purpose then thread is way better
a thread would make more sense but i feel like people don't notice those
and i went literal monkey hear neuron activation at newton be
streamer is playing a game without gravity and someone said life before newton be like:
time to game the t game <a:Gaming:1090937687000760330>
true!
i get genuinely mad at some type of take
but maybe not really, i need new hobby tet
i get you
oh no
is that where she's being replaced?
or some shit
tht last show up in 4.8
the fucking lightning tona boss
FR going to be replaced on what
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
do i wanna die on that hill now
and i went like i dunno did i
i skim your message and i thought you were asking if i was the one who said that
i'd also talk big if the entire competitive community of my server was actively talking there rn
they're like holy shit the whole gang is here
actually maybe i get it
they roleplay harder than we do
it did not age well <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
wait i know which one i made
i made one of those, idr if it was the PE one
like for RL or w/e
and it's fine
can't you run turg on END on trio
okay am i going insane
i'm proud
jizo is a high ass scoring boss
hoyl shit that's a hard week too
<a:cheer:585545022930419712> <a:Pat:914638151069356062> <a:cheer:585545022930419712>
you can do this carv!
that's kinda true for normal human too, if you go underwater for long enough you can live the rest of your life there
i'd ask are you a lil baby? a crying pissy little baby? do i need to get your mommy?
cause it's not really a skill you learn, just a fear you get over
calling it knowing or not how to swim is kinda counter intuitive tho
yeah okay i get it now
that's on you chief
well
if you do nothing you float
cause like don't you just chill and everything work out on their own?
i always assume people are just scared or exaggerating
is that really a thing tho
oh
idk what people mean by can one swim
i mean not professionally
i'd find like a public pool probably
oh yeah not really
i guess it depend on the friend group too
i guess i would
wouldn't you be worried of being judge more if you're alone?
i'll prob just fuck around tho, no sport for me chief
i mean that's fair
huh?
i wonder how fun going to a pool would be if you're alone
probably honestly
i can just go if i want
wait i'm a fucking adult
it's been so long since i've went to a pool actually
man i could go for a pool <:life:1001518241610485781>
maybe the country is fictional too
regaining popularity now but def not the biggest anymore
he fell off tho
when i was a kid, biggest runescape youtuber was lithuanian
oh it's near lithuania
you're seele
i can remember that
yeah ok
ooooooh
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
and it's my activity line
i was like what's this random line beside my name on tumblr
what luscious hair
oh
and i think it's my fault cause i just forgot
i legitimately don't know at this point where cherry is from
i guess i only know one other horse
wdym it's the horse
are those upside down ovaries
what the fuck is that emote
i don't mind no blankie if air is still
so i don't feel a breeze on my skin
even if it's really hot out i grab a blankie
like in a good way tho yea?
i'm fucked in the head i think
i'll actually feel sick
it's not even like a preference
keilos reaction to anyone* doing anything that keilo doesn't do*
if it's 40 degree out and my sibling turn on the fan
i can't sleep with like a breeze touching my skin
actually i can't judged, shit's wrong with me
unhinged behaviour right there
have you figured your last will already?
that might be lethal tbh
the only honkai reddit i'm subscribed to is r/hottestthingthereis
so true
or maybe dollars
in reais
how much is a house in your country
and people go there just for the meme
isn't his restaurant like extremely mid too?
that's like even extremely normie know it
saltbae got really big tho
so you prob get it right, idk how big it actually was overseas
98% white
<a:HUH:1129107980634312724>
huh
and then just randomly he start show up on-
he's a reasonably big meme in brazil for years now
o i mean it's just that
it's actually a brazillian meme that broke containment
me checking how normie is the shit i'm referencing <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
ny normie check i mean not me checking how normie you are but
yeah
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
do you know who ricardo milos is
normie check
i'll try more later
nevermind i don't get it
i think
there's like 2 girls and yuri
i'm starting to get the story
oh i think they're gay
first thing i did was find the nearest hole and throw myself on it to see what happen
it has perma death and it doesn't tell you it has perma death
it's a game made to counter me
it's like a prank on me
i reached a checkpoint and it told me do you want to rest and i said sure and it fucking closed the game
i don't know what the fuck is going on now
i was on a story cutscene stage thing and i touched a button and it said some shit like do you want to remember the truth and i held the button and it fucking skipped the story
everything is so fucking flowery language
i'm playing this new puzzle game and it feels like a fever dream
gru of nostradamus
i know
disgusting
they're offsync
just went from sailor moon op to card captor sakura op
i'm jamming to old anime song

cum
free thinkers in discord when someone send literally anything:
lol
s<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961> hrt
meanwhile lil bros be pulling 2s2 end s0 hrt
capped out 9s team to aim t1s, that's p good
for that price that's p good
like you end up with 3s HoS, a 9s team to have fun
for you it end up a pretty good deal tho no
to be put with those guy on the has aladdin dupe group
how does it feel gresham
do you think Him is maxing out college loan to swipe or smth
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610> they're treating it like it's a big deal
and now they're like
older generation made it look like such a big deal
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> kinda based tho no?
if i wrote that for a story i'd go nah way too 1 dimensional
they self sterotype
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
not my fault i wasn't invited formally
those are two unrelated sentence
that make it sound like i didn't expect you to look nice
your hair is almost cherry colored tho
you look nice tho, not what i expect
holy fuck cherry mask reveal
they ain't good
i mean i can imagine
and it's usually very explicit but also very vanilla
fanfic of yn / character
and the only shit that show up on it now and then is
i follow some dead tags of some anime that isn't popular anymore but i still enjoy on tumblr
this post would be a hit on tumblr
it's too easy but also it's too hard cause i'm not a fossil
what
he'd be scoring 900s on every boss by now
with the amount of experience growth he bolster
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
can you imagine day1 aqua
even the beast himself
you can't really hope anyone that enter the game after 2021 beside me to have the right MA opinion, unfortunately
but ok
that's stupid
well, different issue tho, both make it pretty bad
for 3s i think it's both
my 2s io barely match s0 io from ref
i was so atk issue it was insane
like cause i always use to run s0 ref with s2+ valk
i've def felt that issue before tho
yeah if you're running reasonably right ref that won't be an issue in 3s ma
need a different ref every 10 atk on HoT <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
look at kasumi
shit like that
like p2 cd won't line up
then you won't be able to follow it
if you run a ref where you have way too much damage
i mean that's true for every MA boss
yeah i agree with that
and i coach her on how to spend her like birthday gifts on it if she want
my lil sis does actually play some gachas, cookie run kingdom the most
what would you do
for battlepass
and ask for like 15 bucks
and they start playing honkai
if you have a child
that family is in debt
that's worse
crystal parents or smth
he must have like
250 bchip weekly?
my guy is paying mihoyo rent
that's fucking scary
<a:Nerdge:1010710823037059163>
i mean the conclusion isn't wrong, just the reasoning imo
o-oh...
idk it's the message aqua was answering to on that screenshot
i genuinely do not understand the amount of confidence this dude has
no one doing damage chart avg out damage from counting the damage buffs, that's insane
isn't s5 wrong
that's awful returns
yeah for dorm
xp chip probably the one i had the last issue tho
and i had issue with literally every resource
i was MA whale, so i invest in all valk and all gear
well, i guess it depend how one play, maybe it isn't that fair
but as a new whale
i mean it sound like he's maxing all valk for fun
nah that's fair
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
<a:Gaming:1090937687000760330>
grinding out inazuma or smth
i think i was like
how was i when i was lv60
<:life:1001518241610485781>
nothing cool about that
valk are shit, boss are shit
back then i remember qua as the shit one
that's kinda 3head no
now i'm p confident it's true tho
i was a lil bit sus on the third time they say it
words from someone who is definitely 18:
and i've been on reddit
that's a lot of self jerk, even for my standard
holy fuck you think his cock get hurt from him stroking it too hard
like the sea things?
it's so hype, seeing the world around akane responding to her actions
holy <:life:1001518241610485781>
akane is going so great
oh shit this akane chapter was sick
didn't think so
is it really spending if you're not doing on dorm and just getting the buffs from spending bonus?
oh is it time
he's Him, not us
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> does he need our permission
woody absolutely no chill
probably cope
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
a new damage type would be kinda fun right
do they think it's a new damage type?
woodyLTG
the one from the game
woody is a fucking menace
have you seen the lethimcook clip?
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
oh idk how that shit works
full hp bar?
beast king the king of beasts?
i think i got warned over that once
i forgot about that
oh yeah
why is he hiding all his message <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
bringing out the thesaurus
we'll prob get an ad-hoc support like eden was for aponia ok buddy
it is
it's a rock
kinda respect it
scarlet
until you got to a color
so you were just saying the dictionary
what color is s
like 12 y/o scifi oc
that's exceedingly cringy
LMFAOOOO
that's why i'm asking
i mean yeah hopefully
like in a metaphorical way?
what's to kill a mocking bird about?
(50k, slow burn, enemies to lovers)
so i stumble to them every now and then
they also do dataming stuff
idk much about them <:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
is that camelva?
you just got old testament'd lmao
so you are not ready for His cock
your age is not on the clock
you're way too old
lmao
Him?
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
so thoughtful
mine is the size of my cock <3
i thought it'd be something like that's why i get so many bitches
i didn't read the message before this one and the version my mind made up was way funnier
lumi be like i have a confession \*thinks really hard about the confession* thanks for listening out y'all
like a hyena kinda thing def a punis yea
it depends on what it looks like
do it pussy
what of it
i am transphobic
yeah fuck it
that's why you're not Him
tet
you put on auto mode and then watch the game play for you?
wyd
why you backseating auto mode
<a:erm:1124793753752838255>
that's the keiloest one can be
@/keilo
i'm <@148145559897636865>
why did it mute my alt
?
is that available info
i mean true but
that's my alt
the wrong one
that's
mute the baldest whale
try me
i mean it did not say muted role cherry, it said it muted cherma
if you say a slur i think you show up in the wall of fame in this server
wait actually how does it know
you wanna invest in the team you have a chance
if you're trying to pb in myriad
i mean that's prob the move tho no
i think he just retroactively uninvested in her for me
i just logged in to my acc and my gd isn't there anymore
what now
uh
waiting for a qua (valk)
gato like <a:meow:798014387478331402> ?
vs?
italians are sluts?
is that a sterotype i don't know about
how do you have access to it
oh shit she's genetic sequentioning
100 days is like 2 patches cherry
yea that's his whole thing
i think i usually did valk frag
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> is a whale of your size get free elf? on cn anniv
who was theorising genshin was getting near eos
did you remember that one guy on reddit
unlucky
or just better luck next year?
you think cny will be free then?
<:life:1001518241610485781>
no free new elf?
so no elf?
it is, right? that's why free da n stuff
wait is 7.0 not cn anniv?
i miss azir/lux
riot never really did anything better than set 9
what if they're like
that's potential cursed knowledge tho
how much in the future we talkin
oh
eh maybe not though
i feel like that'd just make me enjoy less the games i'm playing
like if i look up future game update
idk what i'd do
if i travel to the future, with the expectation i'm coming back
<:dogkek:664517636524343344> that's fair i think
new items look fun to learn
can't wait tbh
i thought i just warped
oh tft
there's a new layout?
chat's having a normal one
perish the thought, i never said i wanted to meet His standards
<:life:1001518241610485781>
one day i can also be a beast
and giving my best
guys do you think if i keep trying
nvm
oh you don't either
not even i have sn pri
for real weapon
in the presence of Him you can only be humble or act out in envy
honestly mods are just jealous
what kinda shit
what did he do
tet look at this
one of my classes we use linux and the amount of \*\*\*\*\*\* we \*\*\*\*\*\*\*\* is insane
unironically true though
i can try
is it called a joystick because it brings you joy?
like a joystick?
maybe i'll start playing again then
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
is she a bad girl?
are they related to our vita?
w-what
or is it like a different personality kinda thing
actually different people
are the <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> vitas like
what a kind and merciful beast
he fit right in
what did he even do to get muted
you're using HN tho
you can call it f2p ref
if you upload ref
isn't that good
but not by much
ss was better than sirin asc dirac
back in my day of senti dps
only if shield iirc
i mean yea then, you'll prob still need your HoS with ss for whore dps and bleed
agree ?
you only get the brick once you brick your acc
senti dk is from event
fuck it
but i mean
prob not smart to int sswords then
and that's probably not going to change in 7.0
i mean the only place you use senti support rn is seele dps right?
is new stig also support tho?
yolo (you only live once)
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
and it's also general knowledge that those help rather than hinder the games
the reason why company lets people do it is mostly because the backlash from player would be too big if they start taking down all gameplay vids
idk about sending to jail but
as far as the law goes, game walkthrough is p much guarantee to be copyright breaking
i mean they do
yeah that's nuts
that's a scary precedent
nintendo takes down gameplay videos quite often, but never went all the way to sue wth
how big is the company? i kinda assume it was some fan game with a name like that
<a:pepeMeltdown:870437577042317322>
that's not good
oh shit
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
HoF definitely reference all of past kiana suit too tho
the one with reference to all suit is HoF tho no?
END is not more kiana than HoF is kiana
well idk about always, but at leas for now
i mean yeah to me HoF will always be ultimate kiana
was it?
fuck him up
so
it was a banger tho
he was just jamming to it and the lyrics are something like FUCK THAT PUSSY FUCK THAT PUSSY
the other was just a legit playlist of brazillian funk
one was some weird like lo fi kinda song which might not be from an actual brazillian musician
unironically tho it happened twice already that streamer i watch started playing brazillian songs and it surprised me a lot
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
da baby, da event reward, da login
all those message just sound like da baby
<:monkaHmm:891600801804472380>
i feel like they could
have they tried?
they're all paid if you think about it
so prob
i see 30k there
have you not been capping coin weekly
how
wdym you're poor
s2 no
maybe there's a chance here too
like you know those people after they say they went 99 before hard pity and you go you didn't and they go well there's a chance
i'm just that unlucky tbh
yea that's why when i did jizo on lumi acc i also suffer to cap
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
clearly not, ruby
the value is just too high compare to the price
if you still care about competitive, it's p much unexcusable to skip a valk like sirin imo
thank you sherlock
6 patches late
that's like
shield heavy boss no
that makes sense to me
this is the list of all bosses sirin top scores
damn sirin is in the list a lot, curious
hof end sirin what a weird state we are in
same lmfao
did triple takes like
oh those are the different options
kys
those don't count for me tho
i forgot about those
oh yeah
all orange
do the ugliest pumpkin ones
true
i mean i'll take it ig but i'll be happier on good characters
do them for good characters please
no
they were so good
man they should do halloween skins again
how can it be summer kafka
it's not even summer yet
my starrail oc deals one bagillion damage and is so much hotter than kafka and also has huge booba
which are humanoid
cause like 80% of fursonas are anthro
that's an awful description
yeah
humans are still animals
cause like
aren't ocs under fursona
if you think about it
fursona assigned
me too
one can't have enough broccoli
but caulifloer is fine
i think i do prefer broccoli
i like the texture
i like it
it's p good
cauliflower is just white broccoli right
shshsh she's starting a speech
speech
speech
speech
i love the crunch
it's pretty good
but no one actually follows
everyone talks about
i just assume it was one of those things
i mean i wasn't there
not just any children out of 2 people unmarried
and the child that come out is a bastard
someone married cheat on their spouse
like as in
illegitimate child
i thought it was like
that's surely not the definition
were you really
what are you a cop
nunya fucking business pal
they just make shit up over there
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
that was 2.3 actually
yeah easy mistake to make
that was during 5.5
you should estrogen NOW
trio ltg
the trans trio?
last time you were outside cherry
my guy is playing bingo and going it's fine ig it'd be better if it had more skill expression
that's the game you're playing
baby boy did you not start like 3 month ago, wdym little to no gameplay variation
he can beat people with 5 S more than him
that's why aqua is so good
too much power, tet couldn't handle it
<a:peepoTrip:755692813320060959>
just put everyone at 3s and go
that's what everyone does in their first beta tho right?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like my 2s io
it's good cause i pulled it, and i'm a beast so all i pull are great investment
like she's ignite dps with busted rank <:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
don't we all know what there is to know about sirin tho
yeah i guess the cooking will be fun
oh ok
so that's why i suck, i never got into beta
or cn lk2 beta?
global sirin beta
wait is it
why
probably
must be my age
i didn't remember it being with dia tho
i remember that
oh yeaaaah
does he dislike sirin? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah, completely delusional and making it our problem
like everyone knows he's talking bullshit but i'm 100% sure he believe it
it's insane
the fucking mental gymnastics of like retroactively making up reason for buying twitter
<@309634550273933314> are you following the starfield pronounce shit
so is he really anti semitic?
and the rest >50% of value decrease he isn't blaming on jews
it might be worth 0 or even negative right now
he's blaming that 50% on the jews but
i think that's misreading the tweet
that one is weirder than ruby aqua imo
kana x akane is unusual ig but not bad weird, i vibe w it
ruby x aqua maybe a little
are they that weird?
we saw them together very little in the manga but mengo's hc has potential
honestly i kinda vibe with it
LMFAO
true in real life too
it makes more sense for transgirls right
wait should i pivot into erectile dysfunction jokes instead of premature ejaculation jokes
that's more reasonable
oh okay
normal even
like finishing the run sooner is not really that bad if you think about it
surely
upper record?
like
just like real life
if you pick bad race that's just skill issue no?
that makes sense why it's getting so much praise
oh ok, but no procgen bs?
i'm very out the loop on gaming stuff, only early today did i catch up with the starfield pronounce drama
like a tabletop rpg roguelike
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i for some reason assume it was like procedurally generated storyline
so how does baldurs gate even work
but yeah this one is the one i was mostly talking about <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i guess i did catch it right as it release
oh you didn't read this week's yet
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
that'd be sick <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i'm caught up now
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> thank you
go read takopii
good taste tho
oh shit i'm interested
LMFAO you're talking like it's a soap opera or smth and i'll just skip the last 2 chapter
i'm catching up on the last 2 week of everything
i haven't read the latest 2 ichinose tho
3 manga 1 cup
maybe it's a meta narrative
any of them by itself is fine, it's just real weird especially because it doesn't feel like they finish one before moving on to the next
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh icic
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
meanwhile ichinose in 40 is like 3 different manga
i dropped jujutsu by chapter 60 cause nothing happen
yeah i was giong to say
i'm enjoying it
also this week chapter of shibatarian was good
or is he making each weekly
do you think he made them all earlier on the month
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
but taihen's too close to hentai isn't
wait so how is that name allowed
they kinda feel like they're from an AU
these onk interlude chapters are so weird
child vita belly hater
what word would you pick to salvage that name
something wholesome for sure right
child vita belly what
what's the rest of that guys name
maybe there's a little aqua in all of us
maybe i do have it in me
i wish i had the confidence to be like that
honestly aren't you kinda jealous?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i'm humbled, honestly
do you really think that highly of me tet
<a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
like i t100 in NA before but do you really think i could make it on the real ranks
the EU badge of honor?
i want it tho
what you trying to imply
why the (EU)
probably konosuba
well, or konosuba
so it's not even that weird
rando who join will think it's oshi no ko
make a aqua simp role, it's genius
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
i unironically bought a few too
can you imagine his coin issue
110 day old acc, in exalted, pulling 2s+ valk
so like.....
like people keep saying genshin is easy but i play only amber and i don't like to farm artifacts
is he wrong tho?
<:life:1001518241610485781>
he is, that's why his sirin score is so bad
outscoring higher rank in EU, i genuinely couldn't
wait is he EU?
my god he's such a beast
playing blue archive like
that's why he's doing so much more damage
rita is an old hag so he's not jerking off while playing SpA
wait i got it
that's more than other valk nowadays tbh
yeah just that would be what i'd think about
but it was probably the turg cat
actually idk, like i remember her rots being really finnicky
SpA does actually have some tricks tho
the one mihoyo doesn't want you to know about
he figured out the forbidden tech
it's like an mmo and you've reached lategame so they're just repating content
it was a fucking worthless class tho, some of the later classes of my course feel like padding
last semester there was one where one of our group members dropped out, i should've told them chill i'll do it all anyways, just take the credit like the rest of them <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i've definitely done full group projects by myself and went so this is what they did
tbh tho i'm too nice i cover for everyone
that's wild like what
i don't remember it
:alo:
:aloo:
what the fuck i'd be pissed
it's like a horror movie
i haven't finished one with the full group intact
i feel like for the last year of group projects tho
we literally both look at each other yea we ain't doing this and we both dropped it LMFAO
last semester there was a duo project
they're like <:peepoSit:1009060765887647846> so how can i catch up
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
there's some classes where some students only who up in the last 2 weeks
people've done worse
you're in college who cares
which is not great
iirc it's like around same value as topping up xtal
i remember doing the math on it
i'll let them live their best life
i won't bully them
the video has 1k views
this is what i imagine every 2s MA hater is trying to run
^ what mihoyo fbi thinks the average player is like
i should do that
does aster backread their own mention? hi aster
the messages take a lot longer to write when i have to pause and look for a cute kaomoji LMAO
is that too much stepping into aster niche (⁄ ⁄•⁄ω⁄•⁄ ⁄)
what do you think if i start using kaomoji ⸜( ´ ꒳ ` )⸝
i didn't know your poly group had that nvm
oh god so it's like dating drama?
and where am i standing
what's that ranking for
<:Truege:1114141621022375997>
got it too
<a:sexdd:1109103829754069014>
man
there was a fucking huge cock in the front page
last time i search sexo on alias search
nsfw ones
there's some
i'll make an exception actually
o i offer to watch but i can't rn, i'm in the middle of class
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oooooh
because we call her punny
so i just read it as pubby
i just realise i don't actually know what pb means
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
share ref and stream some runs if you want and i can try to help
but if the ref is 2* pb
that's the damage diff right there chief
i mean yeah if the ref you're following is 3 or 4* pb
you're either doing something wrong or running a ref with more gear than you if you're that off
not 20% off
5% off
then you'll be like
besides like 10-20 atk
like if you're matching everything
are you like missing a whole elf or smth
too much damage off
that's
<- only did s0 refs with lumi's s2
ooo sounds like skill issue
me next?
can't you run the GC SI WHORE rot?
wait don't you have GC?
i feel like with a score like that u could
are you t100 MA?
yeah lets switch
you'd backpull spa instead
if you're a real chad
the budget queen
wdym
to bed?
uh
and i'm not joking
than cap an 856 ref
i'd rather 856 by running a 872 ref and -1
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
so idc
but the cap is lower
most of my issue was just positioning tho it matter a lot more than i thought it would
it took me so long to beat lumi score, when i matched it i took a screenshot so i could tell her that i deserve the leaderboard spot <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like jesus fuck
and end up not even score 47k
with TP
i spent 30 hour on jizo
first time in exalted
jizo is my fucking nemesis man
yeah
on what boss
i got a -1 through blood and tears on lumi acc
it's awful
but yeah it's just positioning and camera placement
it's so bad
and still the worst transition ever made to cap
jizo is the fucking first 3s boss
it's so fucking annoying
you just don't really get boss like couatl anymore
that fucking second rot on p2 like holy
<a:Clean:738491103740952646>
like that exact ref is what i ran on that couatl, the AE movement is fucking clean
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that ref
i ran
vriska
heki aura
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
heki hates herself but she will never change
they will never
why
do you really wanna tlak there
well you can still read
are y'all banned
really should've skipped her
my PE got an awful score at 3s BKE
honestly he's so right
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
maybe if i'm lucky
you got the right idea eli
the easy way to remember
kmiafrk
8.0 <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
hare adv is like
wait you're right i didn't even think about it
there u go
heki and epi are our maincord and wfp in underarc, respectively
that's them but unironically
where we said our stigs in the most confusing way for fun
remember when we did that bit
in hindsight it really wasn't worth it, like i'm happy i did it cause it was worth it but it costed too many crystals so it wasn't a good deal
make up your fucking mind
thank you, i was worried no one would get it
LMFAO
the one they call the Death Threat Sender, Watch out for her
tet 2, the 2nd tet, lying hidden somewhere in this discord server...
what
me too
because of teri
actually if we average out all honkai valk, puberty is along 25-30 i think
they don't really look older, maybe mihoyo think growing older = booba gets bigger
like apho mei bronya
then yea
if you count apho valk as adult
i mean
we'll have part 3 and they're all middle aged
maybe after part 2 honkai
i don't think we realistically have any milf in any mihoyo game
not really
but like
closest is like ning lisa
cougar is an older woman that especifically go for younger guys
i mean they can look similar
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
milf is not about actually being a mom
yeah kafka is not a milf
like yukong and a chroma of her
isn't there 2 yukongs?
the two genders milf and women
true
milf love
ml is
il as in i love?
asking questions about the wrong honkai
we have wfp at home
epi is our fucking
she can top me alr
bronya's tax documents
i'm gonna be like
wait loli vita in specific? <a:HUH:1129107980634312724>
seat or underwear or w/e
i think that's more cringe than being their like
kinda seapilled
ask tet lmao
the fucking mental hoops my guy is jumping through to defend the take he clearly did not think through before posting
LMFAO <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
thoughts ?
they hungry
what about my theory:
holy fuck she does
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
that's my confession of the day
and i also don't get vore stuff
i don't really get the micro macro stuff
i fucking despise <:PepeSmile:966629532943650836>, i think this is the first time i ever use it and it's to hate on it
i still <a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206> and <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>

cringe
fahrenheit is fucking made up
hell yeah
in the US they use monopoly degrees
or monopoly numbers
do you use real numbers
climate change
<:ohnobirb:948935560091807744>
it's 23 here
their number font be mingin
kr sp number font looks so clean
yeah maybe if you don't expect it to be a sex thing you'll go oh no
i guess a little
but tbh is knotting even cursed?
it's really not the cursed knowledge the thumbnail makes it look like <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that's what whump is i guess, putting your poor little meowmeow through hell
and i'm happy when my favorite character suffers
it's like a tumblr post that goes i don't want my favorite character to be happy, i want to be happy
i won't find it
lemme find something
oh it's like
it's either something terrible or something chill, no inbetween
okay i'll take the hit
that's a new one for me
should i look up whump?
what's with you and UR lately
that doesn't really make sense but if it's kink i've learn to accept it and move on
like in a kink way?
ooooh
why gods speed?
why not gods luck then?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
do they mean like go real fast
gods speed
so when they say
so mental deficiency?
like hell yeah we do
LMFAO i was so hyped for a sec
!vanish
you can just
do you need to ask for permission?
you do that multiple times per second and then your girl will cum in 1 seconds instead of 2
tet gets me
yeah exactly
gonna do that irl with sex
it's so fucking stupid <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
what the 893 kasumi actually look like
did gresham show y'all
📸
yeah lemme capscore sex
<:PotFriend:947188517153439784>
ok
like she uncaps fps or what
wdym
that's kinda nuts no?
a 700 score with NS, i'm kinda curious what real valk scores
she's a fucking beast, NS neva die
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
holy fuck
<:Truege:1114141621022375997>
i feel like we've been seeing ksante bullshit more often lately
LMFAO
!vanish
it's really entertaining tho
some other streamer i watch already had that
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
new option unlock for gp
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
LMFAO
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
she lived forever
wtf you mean fail miserably
ok
i have no clue what our dist is at
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
wait is out dist comparable now?
living the good life
i mean why not right, if you can pay it back
now that lk2 is releasing
you think he's still paying back the loan
their bank acc is stable even
i know someone who could help you out with a loan
<:Truege:1114141621022375997>
i mactually balls at ma jesus chirst
good job
make it look especially big
and the animations
yeah i think the cloth on top of it
like jesus fuck
it's insane is it not
it is quite pretty
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
the only guns a2 has are these <a:peepoSTRONG:762078238213799936>
but yeah no, no one use guns, they got lil turrets that follow them iirc
what
huh i didn't know that
well i mean gameplay wise
from what i thought the game was, yea
wait a2 don't use a gun? that's weird
what the fuck
enormous
2bs ass is fucking
holy shit
just play trial and go wow the booba is so big
does it even matter if you pull on them or not
i'd rather die honestly
i'd say definitely worth it but consider other options too
a good amount but like not a lot a lot
like pretty big but not very much
it's called -1
we already have that
like genshin shit?
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
tfs an abyss
is that non+20%?
is that a possible score?
positioning matters me thinks, def some rng tho
i love that fucking line
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
she deletes enemies over time
<a:NOTED:805343536412229642>
would you pronounce copy differently than coppy
or do you want another one
is this a good one?
just need to pull 3s whore
<:HandsUp:465017146955661312>
BN is back
yesssss
yes
if u want
i can make an acc and trans my steele
<a:hacker:998945514894671912>
you can see the code
why don't they do that for huodou instead
2s parvati is so fucking boring
that's wild
woah what
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
idk wtf is wrong with that elf you mistime it by .5s your damage goes poof
at least in MA i swear
from experience that's literally all HoH ref is
that copypasta is so good
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it doesn't replace the emblem one right
that looks interesting but less fun than the emblem one
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
now i realise <:KEWKCONE:1090964012906315886> is all around us

i guess she's a robot
that must be uncomfortable right
that looks depressing
biggest booba
but they don't have DoR either <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
to see if i coul scam it somehow on lumi acc
i just went looking for it <:RozaScout:1061941250175008819>
oh 840? yeah fair
crusher was a good alternative
you mean kasumi right?
wait are you? even before i quit it wasn't already i think
i still don't have mine
i'm jealous
bri pri is a sick one tho
mine, and i'm 99% it's the actual first, was blood embrace
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
and then i bought KoR from bp
cause i luck out HoR from dorm
i think DoR was my first ever meta weapon
oh
like isn't outliving BKE a better show of age or smth
why DoR runs tho
<:life:1001518241610485781>
good luck
it does not matter
epi it's genshin
should've expected it, it is kasumi
a lil more tricky than it looked
okay got the 840
but isalright
you're not supposed to use on metal
i opened some boxes that uh
holy fuck i got it
it's not joever yet
wait actually
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
gresham can i try on your acc
okay and i ran out of upgrade mats
aw fuck my gd pri is lv50
holy
my acc is running on fucking fumes man
okay figured enough mats
but i think my hrt stigs ain't leveled
cause like i have all the gear
lemme check the ref again
i think
and try it
i can login to my acc
actually
that i suck?
how does that work
but can't cap any
like unironically i can -1 literally every strat
and 3s -1s
i honestly dunno what's with me
but 3
<:jphMinus2:1062420904384135238>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
-1 -1 -1 rn
i'm literally
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
it looks easy too
and i could do the 840 HoT strat
if lumi had 3s LE
this would be a t14 rn
<@370438895965306882> <a:Wave:995380866832420994>
i'm never cappin
i'm the -1 queen tho
holy fuck
this is so hard for me
eh i see an 872
if punny is this good
this might be low scoring
i have no preference
doesn't need to be that high
highest you can find
or well
<a:peepoSHY:802373413058117652>
can you find a 888/904 dabber ref gresham
um
idk what's the big damage diff there
wtf
lumi's s2
wait
s2 ref
that's a fucking
oh
mine is before bar is like half filled
like their clock ticks to 58 during the charge
i'm so much slower than ref tho
i'm not doing nearly as much damage
fuck no it's a one time thing
what inputs for this on the opener
anyone wanna teach
idk how to play whore support
she didn't look like that in game
who cares
valk don't work for me still -1
holy fuck
i'm a fucking BEAST
and JK charged hit the right crystal
i think i just got lucky
it is just dealing 2 hits of damage
o nvm
i got a 720, so that's an uh -3?
in pleb numbers?
760?
what what was the ref again?
that killed it
o wtf
where is it supposed to come from
<a:NOOO:844609807675162685>
i dunno
forget to turn on the ice damage on my skills or smth
did i like
not a crystal with 2 hits left
would leave a warden with low hp at the end
i'd think the atk issue
like in my puny mind
oh hi gresham
so in canine anatomy
uh
it's uh
nvm
is that a knot joke
but someones gotta do it yk
i don't like it like it
like huh
but is 30 atk really the difference between 5 hitcount and 3 hitcount?
like i get it if the damage is not enough to kill the warden
are you like she seems to like killing puppies maybe we should watch the puppy movie
are you invinting me to a date
i'm uploading clip
i'm not even breaking the crystal tho
wait
they're not that bad
that's insane
for the hitcount shield
you need high attack
?????
1460
there is no secret sauce
and some bs that just works makes the charged take 5 hp?
i just ult and hit the crystal 3 time
what is supposed to work is
<@370438895965306882> so like
this is what i learned to rotate
is that like a skill tree
rotate stuff in your mind
how much work is it for you
it's a different delivery every time
it's so entertaining
i listened to that for like 20 minutes
i was crazy once
crazy?
didn't you ss it with your mind
can i come in
anyway abyss is close did you see myriad
tub tub tub
tub
hell yea
so like
well yea but the due hour is a minute ago
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>

go do your homework
like 11:58 you'd've gone
if i said no
wait what would you've done
i got 7/10
yeah
<:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
lmk when i can come back in
that means i have a chance?
i'm already in fontaine
oh wait
sheeeesh
back when i played darius was monthly bp only
ooo
probably s0 yea
cause i tried that and it didn't do that
i didn't forget about this btw i'm keeping you on call when i get back to wardens
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and not because his cock gets hard looking at them
that's a lot of text, i think the real reason he wants lolis is cause they're lore accurate
this is my nowaying now
<a:NOWAYING:1120799446733705277>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and the person got warned, but not diavoros
and diavoros answered yeah
one time someone said diavoros be like i wanna fuck children
i don't think anyone ever reported but like
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078> adult vodka sisters
meanwhile i'm over here
least pedophilic griseo fan
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like bke mobs
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it's mobbing
but then the issue isn't gd
on like mobbing
i think i only ever had issue with gd qte
like she's cute i guess
literally no gameplay
can you even like/dislike a support valk nowadays
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
<:jphPlus2:1062420906720366632>
more than me probably
and if you get the elf timing, 80% of the time ly cooperate with you on intermission
p1 is all in the elf timing
it's not that bad
i can teach you
not a lot of bullshit
but the intermission is really chill
i thought warden would be reeeeally bad
like definitely better 50% of 3s boss
it's fine
yea
did it like a sec late
p2
i missed the charged
it wasn't really tho
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:952287130812571758>
not anymore
nvm
i'm in a good run
wait a sec
login whenever
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
and i have homework for today
irl daily reset is in 1 hour
you can login
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
oh
and it kills her?
and then she charged attack on it
on the one i'm watching, ly ult clear 5 stack
like the very end, clearing the crystal
anyone know how the end of the warden ref is supposed to work
griseo #1954093 looking at you, crying captain, w-what's going on, where are you bringing me as you load up your gun and go no crit
elysia #50072 is gone
oops alt tab to answer discord
oh that's nice
or does she remember the hours and hours of purgatory, doing the same actions on repeat for strings of 5 seconds
our valk memory is wiped
every time we reset a boss
do you think
<:peepoHandsUp:1002644855593381898>
ly when i let her stop for a sec and she sees how hot the wardens are
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:952287130812571758>
gave up on shooting
and she just fucking
oh shit i alt tab during ly ult
that's kinda goals
love that you pinged yourself and said us first tho
i sound really mean
when you say it like that
LMFAO
keep up
no, i just said she's an angle
what
<:angel_hh:784859792187195442>
my mom can't be a circle cause she's an angle
i'm the one asking
yeah i'd fuck the wardens
i'm not happy with that
like -5
693
i finished a run
for transition to go well
p1 needs to end perfectly
yea that's the hard part
and i can respawn now?
danger all around
so i'm in a world of blocks
okay
marvel ass line
damn writers striking affecting even your bf
it's one of the easiest ones tbh
i got the transition for wardens down pat btw lumi
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
but why don't you just run hoh on kasumi
ik wardens is ly
i was like
LMFAO
damn
i ulted so fast
holy shit i'm a beast
and i was like
i forgot ly auto ult
braindead except for the extremely specific elf timing for fun
is every hoh ref
question
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
is it not back yet
they just score overall lower cause they lock something there that would be better to lock on 3s boss
sometimes some player do score higher than styx on 2s boss
mb for misinfo
LMFAO what the fuck is window dragging
oh shit really?
<:jphPlus2:1062420906720366632>
not too much bs as far as abyss goes
like with that setup about avg
poorly
uh
doin it
ok
but not 3s le
getting 2s hov
you're
.
what ref is it
i'm always down
it's 2s ma
i mean
yeah
<a:NOWAYING:1120799446733705277>

that counts
<:KeqingBedge:972436906539352064>
qingque more like quequing am i right
i vibe w it
and i thought it was just a booba out cover <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>

oh shit her booba is out
i retract my statement

ikkitousen was so good <:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
schrodingers keilo

<a:NOOO:844609807675162685>

<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>

:thinkegg:
LMFAO <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
what
you said you were happy here so
idk, proud?
which is fine
most of our pedos are only ironically pedos i think
and ask why people are being horny and talking about lolis
you come to the server made because people kept getting banned for being horny and talking about lolis
cata do you really need to ask
too young but i kinda get it
eh
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
me too but no one calls me ad og
i'm immeasurably disappointed
wait a dog? i'm listening
where you start to get sus
a % of lolis in a game
what is like
do this irl
bulletits
are those bullets out of their nipples in the room with us right now?
lumi's idea of nikke is so interesting
oh i do have it
i don't have it either
damn roasted
even the most unlikely members are starting it
i'm going to do my phd on the cunnyfication of arc city hiddenbase
hope that helps
like clop but for people i think
i mean sure me too but i like cata
i thought cherry was just sending death threats for fun
like rot as in rotten
ooooooh i get it
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i don't mean to offend, it's all about me, i just wanna feel special is all
i wanna feel special but we make the same jokes
god it makes me so mad tet has the same brain as me
not if you're a fucking coward
i feel like if you did this to iriya he'd point and laugh at your score for 2 minutes in the beginning of his abyss video
idk what's so hard about it
i agree honestly if i had the money i'd be always t1
yeah that's the if i had styx acc i would get better scores than him
honkai community we have people with such a ridiculously small claim to fame and i'm still <:LilBlush:679815015007780884> it's the mimi from the youtube
thank you so much mimi
yessir i knew that
honestly tho if mimi goes it's this person i'd be like
LMFAO wh <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
i didn't know that
are you?
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
you can prob afford it
just do the math
you're chillin
it 480 and 480 and in a few days monthly reset for 210 AW
i feel it in my bones
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
FT
<a:PANIC:1069826466889605201>
no time to save up
like overnight to global server specifically
another 200 AW they can put a down payment on a new car
wait maybe they should save
they don't think there's enough so....
LMFAO
they're free
and then it ended
the start was eh but it started to have some good bits
the angel idol one in shounen jump
it got axed <a:KeiloTheBear:1002644779441598585>
i just found out yesterday that one of the ones i was reading was not, in fact, on a very long break
<:wokejj:1118547247567745164>
oh
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
full commitment 4 years needs luck to get into nirv
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
LMFAO it honestly started pretty good until VKE HoV made the list
fpeetea in nirv 2?
nirv or further?
eu player
if they're pink in maincord they're a protected species
you can see by their name color
hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
yes please
any kaveh wanna log in in my mind and delete my mental illness
before every match really
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and seeing which each student picks is actually part of the assignment
it'd be like the cool weirdo experimental one
i imagine if some professor does that
me too
if it's vague enough we could have an entire book series with all the same name but each volume is about something completely different
do you wanna read my lgbt discovering myself novel also called investigating questioning
wanna read my detective book it's called investigating questioning
that's such a funny name for a piece of media
i heard of it before but now that i take my time on it
bts maybe?
dammit
i found one
i mean it genuinely tho i'm just low energy
it was on part 2 where god goes that stuff is not canon anymore
no
damn that's wild
or do you think you'll reach a day where you'll go i don't know what to pick anymore
not being to listen to a song you miss?
okay so like is the bad part
you expect me to read the bibble
well yeah
in the bible canon
yeah
canonicaly i think there is yeah
yeah if you start with the bad ones you're not finishing the bad ones
okay but what part of it is the bad one for y'all
i live in brazil
what do you think chrom
i just think you're underestimating the amount of songs that exist
well i mean
you won't live that long cherry
like it's not like you're running out of songs
what do you mean all the bad songs first
do you think you'd survive
if you had to only listen to one song every day, and you can't repeat past songs
<a:uooooh:1113467321890115765>
we hve the emote in here
i think there's a saying on that
irunny?
hell yea
did you have fun
that's why my HoT blows
that's true
like if you went i was wondering why she wasn't critting that's one thing but i think your HN just sucks chief
what do you mean i was wondering why her damage numbers were so low how is that a sign
what
isn't deepthroat a good enough word already
i dunno that's why i asked
is it like a sex thing
i'm sorry
jesus christ
i should follow my own knowledge i'm a beast
like i always say you shouldn't read
that's why you never read
and it made me second guess myself
but i read the effect
that's how i believed it worked
yea that sounds right
my answer is i don't know <:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
single target only
i don't think it is actually
is it?
wait
yes lumi
hi lumi
actually maybe they're into it
don't tell mihoyo that
nvm
you should tell mihoyo that
oh shit
it's a shame mihoyo treats you 3 like this
the eu players should demand better servers honestly
and he went oh no D: my condolences
someone went to recruit him and said do you want to join our clan? your clan leaders are dead lmao
new guy on my clan is kind of a himbo
kaveh 2
you forgot sirin in the sirin event
we wanna make an event and we're bring a bunch of gambling addict for it
do you think riot manage cheaper bills by saying that
now that you say it, yeah that's kinda nuts
that sounds like it was a blast
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i don't know the context for that one
<:GENIUSMODE:1128932498987036744>
<:MORONMODE:1129084109885542482>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
so all the art we make is about that
human is the most social species that exists
<:life:1001518241610485781>
the moomin op makes me cry
yea i think that's just fragile
the drama maybe
if you think uncle hot sex is his equivalent
your idea is way different from mine of marisa
the one notepad guy
isn't genshin marisa just
you know how little that narrows it down
LMFAO what's with the dance
as far as i'm aware you don't either
idk what you're talking about
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i don't think that counts tho, i watched like reviews of nickelodeon shows
i guess i lied when i said i only watch anime i do watch a lot of youtube
hell yeah i think!
oh
like from sam and cat?
gooning?
that's not good
well
oh
i kinda respect it i think
hammered as in hit with a hammer
you'd like getting hammered so hard you'd let them maul you
like
but that works too
i was asking what's the anime black mirror alternative so i can watch it
sure
what's the black mirror anime
i only watch anime
blindfolds + a partner with a hammer and patience
like blindfolds and stuff
i'm sure you can figure out a way to do that
very easy to replicate
not that i'd kinkshame tho that's kind of a sick kink
:suss:
like i wasn't thinking that but
um okay
or do you start enjoying the pain
like you stop feeling the pain and start feeling good
also sorry what
and you see futa furry or gapingslut or some shit like that
most you get is you walk around and you right click someone
nah i wish tho
and now people are named like
so you couldn't say penis without getting 3 day banned
runescape is such a weird game cause when it released it was very kid friendly
like i said fuck
i could make a dumb reason
if i'm going to lie i could just go all the way no
i mean
and i think they think i'm a good person
i would've had to tell my clan why that was
i would only feel bad if i got muted
in my defense they were being giga asshole
and i told them to kill themselves
someone stole my spot in runescape
i wouldn't be able to live like that, i'm a dick online
that's so many people
that sounds awful
holy fuck
like ANYONE?
?
in specific
making me feel bad
well yeah i got that
i guess i don't really need to know
oh okay
well you do get to pick
what even are you, non-biney?
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
that was planned
yeah
uh
i guess that's a little transphobic*
sorry
oh
too used to 2023 valk
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
yeah it's not exactly hard but the game doesn't do it for you
you just position so it hits the clone
from my experience
yeha i don't think she ever purposefully target her clone
target her clone?
inabakumori
my bald ost was a lot of ibm
i haven't listened to lana or taylor swift
i think
that's just a different style from that tho
well ok
i guess that's a little sexist
idk like taylor swift or lana
that's so uncharacteristic
that's what you listen to while balding abyss?
idk how to describe it it's really enthusiastic
my favorite is french rammus
i respect it tho
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> ok
i'll be fine
i think i just need to eat and sleep
thank you i feel like a toddler rn
well, when it happened one time idk how common it is
i was there on robin stream when this happened i think
LMFAO
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
future me problem
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
oh it's tomorrow
do i have homework
wait shit
and i don't know why
god i'm so down today
god leave me alone
i only murdered him judge, he was going to die anyways
famous words from innocent person
i only made it happen
i feel you tet
i mean i'm not saying you're wrong to feel that way i just don't think that's relatable
\> is the direct cause of the drama
most people prob get uncomfortable over that i think
i think that is only you
i dont have to do anything else
i'm like alright then
and if someone is just an extreme dipshit on my replies
like on reddit, i bait a lot of arguing
tho i will just let it go if i feel like they're owning themselves
nah i love arguing
yea i'm agreeing with you
while not caring about nirv
if i manage to get 3k trophy
i do think it's a failure of honkai competitive state
i was going to say tho
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
in 36 messages
you'll get a 4 paragraph answer
see i don't have that problem cause i don't have the attention span for that
oh it's here
the toggle button is gone tho that's why i asked
lmfao i can turn it off here if you want
oh ok
can you see me typing?
i think this isj ust how lumi is
no more artifacts for you chief
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the fucking domain tree just going poof
LMFAOOOOO
sounds fun
i'll watch it then
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
but damn
i guess it makes sense
oh shit this soon?
item changes are so big
honestly i think it mght be a good change, removing all aura items as craftable
oh shit items got reworked too? not only these ones
i did remember mort talking about how there was a big change on midset that is unrelated to the midset
instead of replace
did they just straight up just add a lot of champ
yea like am i wrong or
cause i never build them <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it took me a bit to do the math and figure out what these items are
oh it's just all of them gone
zeke chalice locket
yea i did notice they got rid of a lot of them
oh ok
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh
🦀 zephyrs gone 🦀
wait is zephyr gone?
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
sheeeesh nice
yea the HoH one is kinda brainless in comparison
the most cursed of bosses
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yes please
is the 840 with hot hrt cool?
damn!
what
oh damn
the 3s bella before 3s bosses
literally a different ref every rank
i remember like the HoT strat
kasumi is the weirdest 2s boss
so it deals a lot more
cause for some reason, the overdamage from breaking shield is broken
yeah you need to leave shield at 1hp before ult
o isn't that strat turbo cbt
what boss is it
maybe even 100% without the 5*s
i want my version of 100%, which is 100% without gacha
i'm autistic like that
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
no it isn't
they never rerun shit like 1.2 sword tho
that's nice
like i checked it on sumeru release and it had like early 1.0 stuff
i mean yea i remember checking it and it had some stuff
if they're permanent yeah
so meh
event weapons and event gadgets and stuff
but now i missed like
for a while i was actual 100% besides weapons
now i can't tho
i did it for everything besides weapons since gacha
like everything
do you also try to 100% archive?
i can afford it <:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
so i'm at 50m mora
i have cause i'm a beast
and you haven't done the leyline thing
it's so expensive
idk
it's so expensive <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
catch 100 animal thing
did you do the
maybe if you figure out the 37 missing, it's easier
you're only missing 37 tho apparently
the rest you just mark all complete
cause the only one that needs actual work are the hidden ones
no but it's really not that bad
kinda make me want to grind out achievement again <:life:1001518241610485781>
sounds really useful actually
apparently this system was added in 3.0
but if you want to, we added this system to make it easier
it's like we don't want you to grind achievement, we won't tell you about how to
i like how mihoyo is kinda gamefreakpilled in this
i also kept notes on a discord server
yea i used paimon.moe back when i was serious about achievement hunting
3.0 aren't those sumeru ones?
so it isn't really worth it to skip on early cycle since you'll need to do a bunch of cycles anyways
like, some comm you need to do like 4 times in 4 different cycle, like chain comm
for it actually benefit you
you also need to be kinda careful apparently
like the pokemon
nopunny?
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
to me the issue was always doing like 2 month of comm to get tea storyteller twice and get it wrong both time
oh huh okay
oh ok
so you don't have to finish this cycle before you get it again
and it goes back on the cycle
you can not finish the comm
and get someone you already talk to
if you get unlucky
so like
yeah
where you need to get lucky on who he ask you to talk with
like okay, you remember the poetry liyue comm?
the game has tons of special comms, and you get one of each before it reset the cycle
no it's more complicated than that
why the fuck do you think i would care about lore
yea tech theory
twitterpilled
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
yea that's why it took a while for me to link it
these 2 posts
for the post i saw it in
ya i'm looking it up
cycle theory apparently
it could be if it was about homestuck
is that not the real name
wait really?
did you read about bucket theory tet
the 1k achievementer
sheeeeeesh
that is the only state nerds are at i think
merdge
i thought it was the sun
huh
and dox me
and check which one was 36C yesterday
you could get a list of all brazil city
actual torture
but yeah yesterday was 36C
it's opposite of y'all up there
i think
well we're starting summer now
you joke but it used to be like that but climate change we actually get cold seasons now
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
send help
super hot? like as in summer in brazil?
threesomes?
gotta be different so you can have double super hell
it's in the bible, you kiss anyone and it's incest and you go to double hell
you shouldn't kiss anyone
yea absolutely, it's incest
well in that case
they're related?
idk how that works
<:sadge:803115920092430346>
is there more from the author?
<:Lookge:1078503171107848292>
i'm down tho
oh i never read/watch gintama
fast romance?
not done with that one yet tho
i'm down for a new one
so many small decisions are so great
i'm reading the fake marriage one and i'm loving it so much
what if the author goes they see themselves as siblings but like, in a sex way
fucking a woman is kinda gay tbh
ruby x aqua is fucked up in numerous ways and the incest one is the least fucked up one
that's neat
item changes
that was what mort was talking about big new update on midset
ooooooh
so
and they're already fucked up children
i mean incest is only wrong when they make fucked up children right?
nono let him cook
is about how it isn't selfcest
the entire sentihua arc
red seele would steal those i think
she has feet tho, not paws
really?
i'm down
oh sick okay
oh okay i'm down
nvm
is that the dog
oh wait
wait we're losing aatrox?
she's going to be farmable like LK right
she's hot tho
i have no clue how honkai is doing <:okk:1058108494995263539>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
is this leak?
per frag
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
why do you think everyone else is saving AL AW up?
just wait until she gets added to WT
actually beat MPE
isn't trio like the highest value team they ever made?
LMFAO <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
<a:Smadging:1035205356013494364> NA is slackier
thanks
<a:Smadging:1035205356013494364>
like :madgechatting:
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153> but crying
where's the fucking
actual brainrot
or doing something wrong
and not knowing if i'm getting unlucky on crit
trying the same shit for 3 hour
and some strat are crit baldy as fuck
eh idk like my pov is from SS MA
AN player
it's just not too impressive when 1 of the 5 EU player is actually good, that's still an player
i mean EU still has good players
unironically me though <:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
yea that's a SEA-only thing
i think the one time i t1 my lobby i didn't even t50 myriad
yea, after the changes in NA you can often retain without hitting t100
myriad was almost guaranteed before in NA if you gave a lil shit
i've t50 before on old nirv and not retain
in NA, it completely change cause we have less players
t100 is what matters now
like not even close, nirv is a fucking sleepfest
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
you used to be able to slap random shit on valk a few years ago honestly just reads like i used to not care a few years ago
isn't END just use turg?
but then they do a few more for good measure
dps + support is normal cause they're doing support that heavily synergise with one another
yeah kinda feel like we have seasons
holy
oh shit i'm logging in
like huh
FK, not even use an abbreviation for griseo
those abbreviations are kinda unhinged
heard the tasks there are really quick
pivot into samsara
funding his collection of weird items
least sweaty runescape player
i love the hina shit, my god
the latest chapters of blue box have been all soooo good too
i'm vibing with the romance manga i'm reading right now
the latest chapter was really good too
the imagery is really cool, i'm more into the romance than i thought it'd be
i read the exorcist one, i really enjoyed it
bet thanks
i forgot to save it
<:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
the fake marriage one
<@180679257851166721> what was the one manga you recommended me
<a:pepeW:950326333009956884>
<a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206>
my guy has a hard on for a letter
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and he made company called xAI
did you see on the article when it talked about when elon started getting into ai
i'd rather kill myself
cause i have a superiority complex
we should call honkai genshin0 tho
p2 is probably closer yea
so probably mid/late next year?
i think we got 1 zzz cbt?
usually they do 3 cbt and the last cbt is v close to release
how many zzz cbt did we get?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
which one do you think is coming first tho
we might get genshin 3 but at least the ost jams
i forgot the music slaps
+2
that's funny
should've bullied him harder
LMFAO it has a suicide helpline pop up here
oh ok
cause i thought they said they're adding rat too <a:ratJAM:794700933144903690>
or are they changing valk around
oh are they making zaun into a vertical trait?
oh you weren't joking, he really is back
am i immune
what if i change my name and tell no one
okay so
yeah
like if you write someones deadname
do you think the death note is transphobic
yo i have a question related to that for y'all
two?
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
it wasn't really i don't know your acc tet
sorry that was me
like it's genuinely depressing, i didn't make the connection he actually could hold this much power when he's this pathetic
actual manchild
i'd be scared of that
or amount of words used
amount of words?
like that vocab % are like
LMFAO
unless?
haha jk
do you want to train me like a dog?
i might be a dog like her
me too!
took me years to learn how to dance on two legs
woah
i'll give you dog feedback
good dog
good thing you cho
like 5+ years ago
all that stuff was a whiiiiile back
i guess that's probably just how emulators are tho
idk what it was about them, some ran fine, other were awful
for some ds games
yea that was a problem for me too
cursed for me
and it wasn't, it just reset my game
first time my ds stopped working, then the one emulator i was using i didn't save and wanted to take a screenshot and i clicked the snapshot button cause i thought that was the same thing
yeah idk man
and i get too annoyed to replay the entire first case again
for really weird reasons
and every time i end up losing my save like on case 2
i've started playing like 3 different games
i mean i know it's good i just have issues with it
:(
what happens then
idk the lore
has he
you have like 4-5 years to spare?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
unironically prob a lot of terfs
i'm misogynistic and turns out
yeah, it works on other things too
like no question
ben shapiro FOR SURE has taken some cock before
<:clueless:973756617109676032> for sure
do you think he got a dm from elon after that
trust
this time he'ss going to be balanced
isn't he hot tho? i'm down
are they doing that again?
<:o7:1099354934320840765>
that's too low even for me
i'm a slut but i don't think i'd suck elon's dick
unironically yes
that's a lot of money but idk if i would
lowkey you could
just slob on his knob and he'll do what you want
probably cause the alternative is way easier
i have this saved tho
i should save stuff more often so i don't los eit
nah i don't
i think i have a thing saved like that
LMFAO
> On the phone, Musk said that he was looking at his laptop and could see “the entire war unfolding” through a map of Starlink activity. “This was, like, three minutes before he said, ‘Well, I had this great conversation with Putin,’ ” the senior defense official told me.
and he's retarded
it's fucking scary how much power this guy actually holds
they got a hard on for privatisation
well, capitalism
and like, any of those private companies that are run by elon musk, he himself is like the linchpin for doing shit, gov officials gotta talk to him specifically on like, spacex matters as an example
basically, us government defunded a lot of public program like nasa, so they privatise and rely on those private companies for a lot of shit
reading this shit actually makes his delusions of grandure more understandable
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
this is what elysia died for?
that's all musk is, he is pure ego
he supports whoever strokes his cock the hardest
he has no spine, he has no morals
obviously not
it's a lot worse than that tho, it's about how the government has to babysit elon with a lot of political matter, like back when he decided to back ukraine last year but then started consuming russia propaganda and cutting off that support for fun
well i think it's the same article, it's a nytimes article about musk
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
oh i'm reading that article right now i think
<a:peepoRun:820028507370815508>
cute
wild, they did it for tft too
oh they made a game based on the autochess?
<:life:1001518241610485781>
yeah i remember
having a thing like that
i remember dota autochess, the one that started it all
o wait yea i was about to say
what's kunka <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh that looks interesting
oh yeah i forgot reputation in genshin was a thing
i uninstalled
fully immersive experience
and then she unlocked her phone and it was open to pngs of icecream
yesterday tho my sister got an icecream and she told me she was really craving it
i always thought they were like, referencing a funny made up guy, and that people don't act like that irl
you know posts like these?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
once the manga isn't looking at them, they cease from existing
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and i assume the rest of the found family
same thing happened to sota too
apparently in this universe no one cares either
i'm fucking gone
i'd leave highkey like what
lowkey?
that's an insane bug <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
bugs feel better than last set tho
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
how are you feeling about this set now?
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
last midset ever
do we have info on it already?
what did shurima cup do to him
<:Sadge:749389233667702834>
big bro is not having a good time
save it up for honkai 4
oh shit more drama?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that's fucking great
LMFAOOOO
and now he's really sad about it
some intern show him number of how many people have him blocked
the theory is that
good luck using anything but TC
they'll just release new boss with 8 qua layer if she does that
like you reeeally don't want that
you really don't want that
when is that btw? 2 weeks?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> big bro wants to make midset streams more exciting
beidou_under_da_water.png
there's so many valk nowadays
i wonder what's going to be gsr's yearly reinstall
genshin yearly reinstall for new continent
honkai yearly reinstall for the book
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
like actually really insane
i'm surprised he isn't getting nerfed
it's out?
what you doing with the other hand
<:monka:969065665573027841>
why? the disease?
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
so you're the dog
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
take dog? is that like a sex thing?
reroll
your acc is fucked
then you did
if tactical training not inactive
well
did you unlock tactical training?
got it <:okk:1058108494995263539>

<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722> ain't no way
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
i was told is next week what the fuck
wait huh is book out?
woa what's going on?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
jesus fucking chirst that lore master tho
and that clip is insane
i watched the clip before reading the comment
i was kinda hype
they deserve breaks but like
aw man
maybe i should spoiler that one
you do the konami code on the pussy and she cums instantly
she was doomlike
yeah
and you were done in 5-10 seconds on avg
old MA used to be 3 valk with strap on
that's what i'm saying
why?
hot
she can go all day as long as she's not involved
voyeur
fhm is like
i was thinking margrave
i mean they call her lightning for a reason ig
holy shit
kiana has hua <:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
mei's cock is so fucking huge but she has erectile disfunction
here i'll do it:
you could've just asked me to recreate it
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
i guess
is it untrue though
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
not because i don't trust, i just already know you don't know anything about the matter
yeah i wouldn't believe anything you said on the matter, so don't worry
i dunno, from the voice clips they use to make the songs i'd believe it
is he just a really horny streamer?
what's the gachibass lore
you're stuck here forever
it's really low isn't it
trying to make you look at your xtal amount
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i think it's the same on honkai btw
gonna be hard to beat release revenue for a while
gsr*
sorry
and i learn her banner was like this week
like i swear it's been like 8 honkai patches since kafka is supposed to release
is hsr release schedule in dog years?
my guy does not let up
rei baiting ruby is a fulltime job
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
wouldn't people just agree?
going to the retard room and pretend to be stupid
is that even possible?
PE adv is up
gl tho
idk how those valks work
idk
would have to make some sizeable rot changes
looks pretty hard with current rot
it's my channel
i know very little of those valks but i don't see much issue <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
anyone down?
<:KeiloSit:1101246919789002752>
omg hiii
maybe that
oh wait
yeah it's our huge brain and iq
and at that point that's not even abnormal
probably a teenager
well
which is fair i think
that's true if you're agender you hate everyone
it actively makes you a 3head
prejudice is unironic brain cancer
yeah hopefully it doesn't make me too dumb <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
just pick the one with least people ig
probably sexist then
same for sexist?
yeah can i pick the race i'm racist for?
can i pick the race?
that's a hard question
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
and wait forever they will
i mean
that's how those no gear t1 show up in the leaderboards
if you give your valk infinite attack you can one tap stuff
yeah
0s fgo <:okk:1058108494995263539>
but if you wanna blow up your acc i can help you with damage hacks
i don't think that kind of hack is possible
trust
until she comes to bp next cycle
but if you want a PE and are willing to swipe, this is prob the best deal we'll have
i'm not saying you should do it
then <a:swipeboobahic:940613030968963122>
aint's that sick?
like 100 pull 2s
adv is better than normal i think
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
no one can get a good score in 1 try
i mean it's not about sucking
and went <a:WHAT:1108876595546050610> i scored lower?
you like missed every skill on your first try
so funny
okay i can watch for a bit
without 1 ult p2, i think cap is around 960
i wasn't able to 1 ult p2
dunno, show vid?
that's p harsh
for a3
but like
ofc i didn't interact with the mechanics, i ran a normal HoT team
like took 2 minute instead of 30 seconds
i had issue with it on a3
nvm you're right
oh wait yeah
back on release, it was hell without PE
yeah this stage was always the worst
and i'll never learn
i don't know how to charged after ult on PE
ayyyyy
husk cap is treatment for the mentally sane
that is fucking insane
the HoT one?
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and 2s MA is basically just opener
3s MA kinda has 2 opener per boss
:feelsopenerman:
pretty good
that's
she is pretty
i'm always right
if she doesn't see 650 on her bank acc then she's scared
i think lumi is like, a toddler with no object permanence
and then you'll have enough to buy the book on d1
so you can spend at most 850
<:KleeKEK:984883553315721268>
or else the book wouldn't unlock
i mean we get at least 1500
that's why i didn't do it
that's what 3s bella does to you
but it won't be enough to buy it out
they didn't mention how many you'll get in total
maybe more, depending on how much extra they give on the day of the reckoning
so you have 850 to spare
and you need 1500
well book is 650
yeah after i retired i kinda am on my heki arc
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and it just bought
i clicked buy so i could check what's in it
i said idk why i bought but that was a lie
yeah i also bought the box
1035 is max tho no
eli's a fucking beast
there should be info around about max amount of currency you can get
last one we couldn't
?
which is the right acc
is aster going by lyri now
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
let's fucking go
besides abyss
i don't have to login this week anymore
wait
can't be fucked
i did 3s fgo 2s bella for bp
i didn't even do 3s
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that's going to be awful in a3
oh
what's the boss?
but might aswell ig
yeah doesn't really matter to me
i'm also getting to RL next cycle
so i guess i can't complain
is 140 more than i thought i would get
which honestly
i got 140
yea ok
aw man
are you around the same eli?
i'll keep the box
that's a thing normal players think about
oh yeah
<a:aHoVLoading:992648674318487623>
i need nothing from it
why did i buy this
top 1 most xp player
no one in rank 1 of any mmo is ok
that's for rank 1 stuff
most sane runescape player
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but maybe if we knew that ornn avg 4.2 and something like caitlyn avg 4.25, people would be more willing to try other stuff out
i'm not like top player is actually wrong, i'm sure they're right
yeah and like
just trust what they're saying <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
but rn like 2 big player can say ornn is op and it's 8/8 ornn every lobby
if at least we had some stat to show that some off-meta ones were still playable
like our community is so eager to completely degen into 1-2 legend
i lowkey think it does them way more bad than good to keep it disabled
or is that still locked
did they say if they're enabling legend stat now?
i kinda respect it
i mean i guess they tested it, got a result, and backtracked it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
...why?
oh shit really?
<:life:1001518241610485781>
this one?
i have no context
his faction was always the one causing trouble
streamer rust server
the old like
now that you mention it
that's absolutely true actually <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
buy my xqccoin
it's like crypto
kick brainworms
or did people cut connection because he's unhinged now
like did he become unhinged because of the cut connection
what came first tho
if anything that's lowballing it
i def do agree with the therapist thing tho, that'd solve like 80% of twitch drama and i'm not joking
yeah that's not good
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
is it the gambling? maybe drugs? something similar happened to train, but i know p much nothing about him besides very superficial stuff
he has that one really clip about cancelling which is really fucking funny
yeah idk what's with him, i used to really enjoy what i saw of him, though i wasn't a big watcher or anything
i've watched it now <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it's so fucking bad
and that's not even close to the worst of it
and i'm gonna tell you, it's like 1 hour long
this is a clip of said debate, xqc is the blonde guy
so that's xqc owning ethan after the fact on dms
while ethan cornered him on every point
and he basically just stand around and scream like a child
well, he went on h3h3, ethan's, podcast to discuss the issue
like initially his position was i get it, if you dislike it you can just dmca my video and get the money from it
and he p much just went joker mode about anyone pointing it out
like he'd react to a 15 minute video by letting it play for 5 minute, pause for 30 sec to go woah chat that's sick and keep watching
and the current drama is that a lot of cc are getting upset over his reactions being very worthless
most recently, of react content
and now he streams infinite hours of variety stuff
he got big by streaming infinite hours of overwatch
which one? xqc or ethan?
but when it's in dms it's kinda depressing
there's a bit of hope he's playing up how insane he is for the stream
seeing actual dms is actually mind blowing, like
<a:sentiflap:1002466955770462298>
i'll take it
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
which half?
how many?
i awaited for the day, i knew her not before she was famous, before she came to be
i read the prophecies of her birth
you met her when she was young?
aw that's cute
<a:modCheck:820069730030714890>
wow so lucky tet isnt even my friend
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
found it
agree ?
we should be our own celebrities
why should we enshrine people who don't deserve? people who have done no work here?
why should we make people who are not here our celebrities?
honestly nah fuck it
I'll be the one to hang myself <:okk:1110244301184696360>
that's good
truly
mods cunny and dia
and it's literally
like you look at the right on member list
he's tainted this discord permanently
like we actually have shrines over him
the biggest celebrity here is probably dia
char <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
is he a celebrity?
but ain't no way rei is danny devito
like lumi could be the crackhead neighbor
yeah lumi is definitely danny devito
which is which?
also why are you like this
yea agreed
like i don't give a shit if they donate just because it makes their dick big from being t1 on the funny leaderboard
and push a trend in society that being up there is a good thing
i honestly think we should make a leaderboard of donations
as long as they are i'm fine w it
i don't think it does any good to make sure the people who are donating are doing it out of the goodness of their heart, i don't give a fuck why they're donating
to me it's kinda important to separate the intent from the effect when we're talking about systemic issue
well yeah but it's not like that 10k is doing any bad if it goes to the right places
i'm not disagreeing with you in any point there
obv they should do more, but that doesn't mean that what they've done is now bad
bad people can still do good things, kinda deal
no i agree with that but like
but it's still a good thing that they did
i don't think they are good people if they donate 0.001% of their money
obviously i don't think billionaires are ethical to exist
i mean sure but that's another issue entirely
like obviously i'd rather they donate then not, just don't think they're actually giving a good amount of money out of their kindness of their heart
as long as you take it as what it is
i don't think that's a bad thing
i mean even if they're a billionaire and donating what is basically meaningless to them
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
like yea thousands sounds like a lot but when you do the math it's like less than what pennies are to you
but not a lot of their money
they donate a lot of money
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
only the ones that were smart enough to not let you know how lame they really are
we never had cool wealthy people
and he stays on twitter the entire time
meetings that are about briefing him specifically
they talk about calling him for meeting
i've heard stories from people who work with him and allegedly that is unironically just true
like holy shit
do you really think so
i think he actually believes that the x thing is going to become bigger than what twitter ever was
i think he's just completely delusional and surrounded by people who will suck his dick his entire life to the point where it warped his view of reality completely
and now i gotta suffer through that guy destroying his own property that sucks
oh noooo i got paid 44b$
like in what world is the creator caring about that
i burned my nikes in protest
like unironically the
there's no fucking way though right
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
that's how he's making the 44b$ back right
nvm he's pretty smart
oh okay
jesus christ
repost? fucking really?
he's fucking taking away all the tweet branding
oh my fucking god so like he's actually doing
only the small one that i don't know the name of
that's kinda wild i don't think i ever saw a mountain like that irl
he just acts like that
though that's a dumb thought cause he's been around for a while
i thought he was like 21-23
oh i guess he's older than i thought
i didn't even know he was married
what the fuck
divorce???
i guess it was such a shit fire that you can say it's a separate thing at this point
the debate was about content stealing
<a:SCHIZO:1042907357249802310>
the only recent one i know is the content stealing one
oh ok
cause like i can't even imagine what kinda leaking you can do about that, besides i was just playing a prank on y'all by being unhinged and seeing if you notice
is this about the content stealing drama?
wtf does that even mean?
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
idk what's the big deal tho, HoS was fine in a2
lmfao ok
this is what i'm at once i complete the 2 tasks i'm behind on but will catch up in time
owo math 885 + 30 + 120
what's max book currency rn?
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
<@385655541248163840> 
cause like it didn't used to score this high right
is it the removal of the ninja?
did they do something to sk
my friends needs to do abstinance
any ER guiders in chat
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the only 2 players in EU can't find each other
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
:iasked:
sorry i'll be less pissy i think i'm just hungry
that's why i rushed the story
i thought it would be this monday
as long as you get it by 21st
but it doesn't matter
i mean sure
you could start next week and still get it
so who cares
right ?
like the last task is 5k moon stone
why am i even bother with daily then
<a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206>
like you'll fucking catch me dead before i do more ER i'm 100% serious
i'm doing another week of ER
like ain't no fucking way
you're fucking with me though right
like the sound cows make i think
what even is monday
book not yet right
oh yeah gc exists
i'm a2 too
oh you scored higher than me
fight for who deals the most damage for the 5 minute duration
dirac sea
i think some bosses at 550d with current 9s valk would be like
like how is that even going to work, CN nirv1 510d nirv2 512d?
cause right now dist is insane
if they want to make new tier, i think they'd do abyss 2 and mess with how dist scales
honestly idk if we're ever getting a new tier
LMFAO
i'm going to have an aneurysm
who cares mobius is still insane op no matter what
any knower in chat?
what the fuck
holy fuck what did they do to mobius
my desire to do ER is so little
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
do you think we're near the end?
huh interesting
like i get not reading for fun but i thought most people would go so there are a lot of resources pinned, i'm looking for resources, i'll check pins <:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
and resources
80% useful stuff
it's like
.
literally pinned
he's so unhinged over this shit for no reason
idk what's with him
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i literally cannot comprehend a single word of what he's saying
idr who it was that started to try and get into the drama and they watched a single clip of xqc and went
yeah that's fair
oh okay, that's a relief
it's like the spoken format of typo therefore i win
like to me ethan's being mean but he's not like ad hom all arguments away, which is what xqc is coming off in that clip trying to worm out of all substantial stuff just to hyperfixate on a small thing
huh okay
like they're both just insulting each other
is that really the way ethan is coming out there?
or is that what ruby tells himself to not have to deal with it
is rei actually baiting
on what
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
the deposit is late
that's on nini
i don't have her
<:5Gkms:831613117388816408>
twice?
i need to do abstinence
i'm not a3 yet <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
even though i'm behind on tasks, i'm in
damn
<:PenguinTired:814486747303903282>

eli
reliving the draven day
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>

37 38 39
new story?
literally made the rank just for this trial <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
6* reset your shield on evasion
dunno if it's realistic without 6*
yea i couldn't do it without cheesing it
spam the active cause it gather and interrupt enemy
run soe with a lot of weapon active cdr
do you have soe
inner demons
you just don't get it
competitive integrity, cherry
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
competitive integrity is on top of mihoyo's priorities
you see, ER is a great competitive mode tied with abyss and MA
cheese off a week with old week's shill modifier
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
why close er for 6 hours for fucking fun
they could just force finish every run on reset
yeah but like
they added that alongside auto complete run
exactly i have no fucking clue
i'm pissed now
why the fuck
i forgot this was a thing
god fucking damn it
i think i've met one of those in college
thinking about it
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
aren't they also western?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i kinda respect it tho do your thing
that's fucking wild
they're legit living another reality
yaoi beginners
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
i'm saving my ER juices for next week
<a:pepeW:950326333009956884>
i'm almost done
i'm on the last stage of act 1
trust
the next 3 are so fast if you skip the text
you know listening how much tet hated this experience, i don't feel that bad anymore
won't someone help her
aw no veliona is stuck in the liminal kitchen
whatever that leaves me at, that's where i'm stayin
i'll do half an hour of story and then i'm done done
i'll do a few more story stages, fine
ᵗʰᵃⁿᵏˢ
ʷʰᵃᵗ'ˢ ʳᵘⁿᵉˢ
oh shit sorry
what's runes
where you don't have to do that
can't you just do the first stage
well i mean
yeah ok
oh wait you've been doing it for 3 days
i thought that was kinda fun like a kid drawing in the sand
okay y'all hate this way more than i do
alright
oh so that's what you meant by next monday
<:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
when is the day of the reckoning
any spreadsheeter in chat
i hope they don't
shut the fuck up
sounds good that's future keilos problem
yeah okay
in 39?
forcing me to go slow, even if it takes same amount of time makes me infinitely more mad
even though it took a while i was chilling cause i was running
i guess it's something like monkey brain
that one i didn't mind as much
i'm like holy fuck
the fucking owl slowly walking 60 meters
felt like they were fucking with me
some sections of 37 38
man i swear
oh okay that's what i wanted to hear
i didn't do finality
or is that you saying
you should do it right now
is that you saying
i hate it here
i did 37 38 today
that's future keilo's problem
<a:pepeW:950326333009956884>
the story goes all the way to the 15 rn?
that's max for us right?
i think there's overall 500 limit
and 1 (one) support for it
really appreciate them giving us ice dps as an option
thanks
boob score
so you don't get alts/friends to boost your moon rocks
actually it makes sense
that's weird as hell
is randos only?
wait so the support shit
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
no one's clicking that
my whispers are dogshit
yea that's not happening tho
backpaincore
nigguranth's boobs are kinda huge huh
<:o7:1099354934320840765>
then we're both like 3 days behind
oh ok
like treat me like a vegetable please
can anyone explain to me how i can get them in the simplest terms possible
in main story
what's the moon rocks
okay so
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
shounen jump is kinda ruthless
that's so sad
aw man
is it not making good numbers?
i was enjoying it so much
wait really?
i'm honestly just letting it ride, i'm kinda lost
yeah same
now that it's closing off
i really enjoyed this arc of akane
<:peepoAvenger:756228412435333250>
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
you're indecipherable
you could get anything you wanted
but very few actually play it
like a lot of people know about it
yeah in brazil it's def turbo niche
huh i see
so nice
oh you left the correction
>:(
i'm down
cause y'all didn't make my feet one into one and i'm very glad about that
i won't make it into a quote
legit did the hardest double take i've ever done
LMFAO
maybe dnd genre isn't as niche as i thought
i'm still surprised it's this big tho
well i believe that
i thought it'd be a little more niche
everyone be playin
i'm surprised it's so big
local slorpglorping hater
i hate that emote
they call him fastest 8th in the west
kinda chad, can't deny
you're welcome gerry
if opening now or opening later won't make a difference
just do nothing 4head
well that's easy then
what are the options
like pulling with xtal?
yea hos wedge
it's not unprecedented that elf doesn't match valk
i think elf is guaranteed
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
new to me
elf stamps?
needing to own elf before buying frags?
yeah you didn't
hell yea we deserve it honestly
same
oops
SAME
wdym there's no 2s2 hoh s2 jk refs <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> 
it's kinda wild to me that you still act surprised whenever you can't find refs that match your unhinged setups
lumi
ly has infinite time on timestop sounds potentially boring
is it fun tho?
i don't have kira
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
cause is the only one i can cap
but bke is the easiest
idk how the hrt ref is
before trio, he got 906 with klein s1 hrt
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
where he has 2s hrt 4s kiana
yeah on the new ref
patpat is a beast at HoT and he only got 906 tho
oh with 2s hrt 4s kiana maybe
i don't believe you
idk if i'm willing to learn that
apparently you can push another second if you run hrt <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i'm actually updating the game so i can do it on my acc rn
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
bke is literally the only 3s boss i can cap
i mean alright
oh okay
can't decipher that
are you really that horny over that -1
well
why are you like this
o
idk how to play hrt
i can do the 893
player is really mad they don't have MA coins to buy valks on the MA shop
LMFAO
so you gotta wait a little bit after it gets 3rd charge to get most damage
and it reaches full stack like .2s after 3rd charge
she has an sp skill i think which makes it deal more damage the more you charge
no, it's a similar thing on buff not lining up the way you think it would
sns 3rd charged <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
not the first time tho
lmfao that's so troll
i like xl too
actually true hu tao slaps
tet be pegging
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i won't put any thought into it
the hair is cute
oh i like that design
fuck
i mean things
genshin players will get horny over the fucking smallest feet
lmfao
trans childe?
i'm listening
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610> my history of bad choices gave me a reputation of someone who makes bad choices
epi be like
okay buddy
it's like among us
but then i read back and the second reading makes more sense i think
that's what i assumed first
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
i did start salvaging for cubes once i had 3k torus
oh ok, first chapter looks captivating enough for me, i like the characters
what the hell
it's a genre?
yeah
the mermaid one
ruby did you read the new manga on shounen jump from last week?
yeah mihoyo could put a gun to those type of player head and they still would stay on HoF for an extra 30 seconds for fun
idk
though actually, maybe it's important for casual players
for very little reward
it's probably like a lot of work to make the tutorial work on all fps range
it's one of those things i wouldn't blame them too much
instead of a seele busting it down
just a sad seele
why is seelepls
you would thrive on 2019 DA meta
frame perfect to tet has .5s of wiggle room
planning ahead what you're gonna do on the next frame
you're actually playing it like a tactical rpg
20 fps man
i don't suck that bad, it just awful to play on shit like <30fps
playing with decent fps fix so many of my insecurity
and got it first try on my sister pc, which could get 90 avg
i spent 5 hour trying to do the opener
similar thing happened to me with wolf, my pc couldn't even do 30fps consistently there
and said it went from 1/10 tries on opener -> 100% success rate
and tried 120
they were at 60 until they were suffering really hard on 2s bke
that was magery too
thanks for sharing with class
idk where it's originally from <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i stole it from somewhere
<:GalaxyFpsScum:1002644841148198932>
then it's 100% fair to blame fps
if you can't have even like 60 fps stable tho
was a good run honestly
we held the line for a while in global tho
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
is it the uncapping renaissance happening on global?
wait really
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
game doesn't work for me
on some other tutorials, if you spam some stuff really hard you can make the valk do stuff
so if something gets unsync, they just keep pressing the same buttons in the same timing even if it doesn't match anything anymore
i've had stuff like that before, i think the tutorial is just a string of inputs the game forces onto the valk
i'll do it later <:okk:1058108494995263539>
thanks i'll say i'll do it later and forget about it
!ar list
may i?
i want more actually
!ar add
L-nya
okay mommy
okay mom
nvm
oh wait yeah i forgot about that
she's barely furry
why does everyone even call her the furry elf
gotta say it's working
what even are pronouns
or can i just login tomorrow to d ostuff ?
for the book
or something
login daily
do i need to
i won't say she wasn't a bitch but i won't say i don't enjoy a good bitch
or the girl in homestuck?
like the girl in victorious?
maybe 2 more from recognising their surname but i'm not sure if i actually am thinking of them or thinking of someone else with the same surname
i know 3 of those
did they ask for a source?
come back to tumblr <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
you could do it throughout like 3 days on a weekend
do you have to do it all at once tho?
and that just happens to be right-wing nutheads rn
like he wants the site to be populated purely by people who are willing to suck his cock 24/7
idt elon cares much about politics tho
come to tumblr <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
that's fair and i think normal
we haven't been to a proper place in years
my whole family cuts their own hair
so now i'm on the planning phases of my first indie game
and he went sick you should do that
and i was like fuck no but that sounds awesome, i'd love to do that
and i talked with my professor about some ideas i had and he misheard me, asked me and your initial idea was to make a game?
i have this one class where you're supposed to make a project and it can be any programming project
i'm even becoming a game dev i think
i do check all boxes huh
yeah i was thinking about it
and they didn't delete them even if the user deleted them
so anyone could view all user generated files
they didn't set up permissions for read, only write and delete
like if you went to the, the analogy would be, the parent directory
holy fuck they allow anyone to just read all the files of all the users
that's not good
they did just literally access the kick cdn files and uploaded their report there
oh take the quotes out of this one
getting?
this is one case where doing exactly what elon musk asks you is actually the optimal way to bankrupt elon musk
o you mean x ?
it pays in crypto, the biggest streamer there is andrew tate's fanboy adin ross
it also fucking sucks
people often hold contradictory feelings over it, cause while it is nice to have potential proper competition with twitch
it's a streaming site, funded largely by a gambling site
<a:Drake:945136375882211358>
apparently some other group did a security write up and just, used a security flaw to host it on kick actual servers
maia is the girl who leaked the airline no-fly list with the famous quote holy shit, we actually have the nofly list. holy fucking bingle. what?! :3
maia did a security write up on kick <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<a:ModCheck:1021871712339505232>
i heard it became infested with furries so i want in
any bluesky code havers? <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
<:ohnobirb:948935560091807744>
wait fuck i'm a1
i haven't done story yet
already?
well the point is that i want to lie for fun
you really need them to score decently
yeah LE KMB the queens of MA
you think if i said that, anyone would mind?
yeah
play both
<:ohnobirb:948935560091807744>
they figured us out
i like them both
oh shit that's kinda sad
i'm going back to agony mines
<a:pepeW:950326333009956884>
fine
i'm on agony ground rn and i know they can get baldy over the last few points
not doing anything more than this
yeah that's spank
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
<:jerrydd:1123980111557972120>
no one is balancing this shit
<:xddFishinge:1079720213890748456>
:dxd:
many xdd anthropologists exist
that kinda blew my mind
you know, i found out recently that it's a rat, not a cat
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
wtf
there's a galio carry augment?
fischl is purple
you think i'm balding sinful 2
and i remember doing pishacha
but if you tell me the boss i'll remember if i did it or not
i'm asking cause i don't remember if i did abyss
i don't even know what those are
stfu
okay thanks
<@197871478950068224> what's abyss
what's abyss?
that sounds like genshin player talk
it's his armada's fault
ask gresham
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
they're just quiet
i think there's a lot
sounds like a good marriage
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
lmfao that's wild to me
now i know why bingo is such a popular type of event
the other goes that's nice, i got a 4yr old and a 10 month old myself
she's 6 days old
one of them afk for a sec, goes sorry had to check on my baby
joined 2 randos for something
i'm playin a boomer ass game
man what's with runescape and being parents
morning
what the actual fuck
jesus fucking christ
why is blue buff that good on lux anyways? radiant that is
i think i saw one of those on soju stream the other day
holy shit
that's one of the funniest clips i've ever seen
LMFAO
you never know when they put the entire trio on WT in the same patch soon
american behaviour
saving for honkai 4
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:peepoDumb:756789041164320850>
they see that 3s is far and then never start
yeah that's a lot of people unfortunately
just not on sp frags? i guess?
they been spending
they have 18k asterite
i mean
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i have no words
what do they even use asterite on
this guy has a lower score than me, point and laugh they're using lint and scraps as gear
what's that supposed to mean
i won't spread
ty tho
the illegal shit
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
more mobility for cleaning i guess?
<a:mhm:1088510781756276756>
yes in a maid outfit
i'll let lumi do it
agreed
i'm fine using few words
they made different words for people not like me
i mean yeah it can mean that too
same thing ?
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
that's everyone else too right
she's just pretty
i don't want to fuck her
like when i say i'm horny over hua
which is a very normal and respectable definition
horny doesn't have to be sexual in my definition of horny
do you want me to answer that
i really do
i mean but tet did it cause she was horny for the 9 y/o
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
who's pulling dps valk without budget to pull gear tho
cope
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
you're just doing something wrong
both of those are cope
skill issue i believe
then that also limits how much your farm can output
and mobs
cause if they're loading areas
are there other people playing, is the question
i mean yeah
if the farm is built properly, that should be the limiting factor
going way up is supposed to unload all mobs below you in caves and stuff
these are heavily capped by mob spawn cap
is it in a server?
it shouldn't be too hard to look fori t
or something like that
it's like removeblockedusers
my god
the fastest 8th in the west
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
33% chance <:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
wt, or discount s
so she's either a-rank = sp
because sp doesn't mean anything
that's true
<:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
have you not seen it?
20% of it
but the battle pass part of the spreadsheet is only like
i mean i did indeed do that
oh yeah
<a:NOOO:996348845803966524>
battle pass log?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i can only assume it's field testing
he spends some time in maincord
aw lmfao that's so cute
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
i'll use it
i don't mind ornn being strong, i like ornn
yeah, feels like they got legends in an okay state too
oh shit <:Wokege:862486121933701141>
thanks
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
i can play for pride and accomplishment
i just got the genshin bracket
forgt the 1v1 bracket
sounds good
hello?????
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
she might not top that but she can top me
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
abyss closes today right
ah fuck
stat contraband
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:HandsUp:465017146955661312>
LMFAO
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153> if it were me tho it'd be very balanced
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
like some items, the difference between trash and op is 5 ap and they aren't willing to give it 2.5 ap
even worse when they keep the numbers kinda low
this game must be absolute hell to balance
relearn the game every 2 weeks
yeah it gets a little tiring
and it dominate the patch
but then they just buff one thing to an insane degree for fun
idk tho, i feel like 95% of patch change is pretty reasonable
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i'm sure some people with dev api key can still gather the data and use it/share it with close friends
i still don't like that they banned stat but it's not unenforceable like i thought
but then they can just disable it if you're breaking tos
you need to apply for dev api key which lets you request way more data
apparently normal people api key can make requisition like, 1 match every 6 seconds
and the plan isn't as stupid as i thought
i learned more about how the api work tho
<:UHM:1058108578700992562>
and they banned it by asking the api user to pretty please not make it availabe?
is it just augment avp + winrate per stage that's banned?
i still don't fully understand how banned it is tho
that's fucking wild
<:HUH:1004782798277718077>
they say people won't use it, get like 5 5 cost 3 star for a funny yt video and forget about it
i believe it but they give the exact opposite answer <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
practice mode to find bugs easier
tft need to take notes
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
also wtf is that <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
they added tft to honkai?
was it?
that's not what you said
what no
no you said your stuff was for jizo
abyss ain't even open dumbass
is abyss open?
can't find anything wrong with that
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
not even an edit
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
you can do it
congrats carv!!
i was watching that game <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
but i decide against it cause my GC ain't leveled up
i was going to do it last MA
maybe they just have a boner for mech phys
everyone thought mihoyo had a boner for bke
that's not that uncommon i think
first time we've ever not had a new 3s boss
yeah it is
where there's no new 3s boss
but that's kinda wild, no one made a big deal of the first patch since 3s release
i guess that make sense cause i would've seen it if there was one
<:HUH:1004782798277718077>
pretty please?
3s boss name?
cause it's so obviously placeholder that you'd just assume they know
i'd be surprised if people even reported it
if the process is complicated enough, you can think about how everyone could individually go okay that's really obviously placeholder, the one in charge of that will fix it by release
tho lowkey that kinda of stuff doesn't surprise me too much
that's wild
not that they fix that either
you're supposed to report typos and stuff
i mean glb beta is localisation beta no?
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
<:TFT:1005183711869947996>
<:Shyggers:1113819313145659422>
like renekton
we have so many bangable characters
t game is perfect for you then
play hots
unless you're <:orrngamer:1124840269922189372>
you need to go back to buy
yes but not from a distance
just scroll enough to the 6.8 datamines
<#1041761709410484334>
just play t game instead
last words
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i'm just a name
is that even a jk
non-2s jk
for me that's unironically true
yeah that's the other mech valk
HN for chill good score
triple support for bald max cap
they play honkai like mort wants you to play tft
well i laughed at them
i'm extremely scared
<:monka:969065665573027841>
<a:danse:1004047242493186179>
taric was half a unit tho
invoker <:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
they end up doing that
so by fixing it not showing up in reroll
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
i'll wait until jizo
jizo or husk?
i'll record a yt video
pick the valks then
with like weird valk
do you want any sinful refs tet
do this irl
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
75% impair in genshin
i'm not measuring cause i'm not an incel
i still think mona's bigger
<a:BOOBA:825140785820991530>
is her butt that big
geo really is just phys2
compare to nahida team with dendro number going brrr
cause like it could be strong rn but it'd still be boring as hell
maybe giving phys a gimmick would make mihoyo more interested in giving it attention
to me tho, the real problem is that the whole game design is around the cool reactions
but noelle was always a thing
neko mean when every geo valk had a field object
and like everything else isn't weak to phys <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
they're not the stuff that is actually hard that you see on f12 in abyss
and those are fodder now
yeah i can see that, the enemy archetype that is weak to phys is fatui too
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like superconduct? shatter?
it doesn't suck cause it needs a new gimmick, it sucks cause mihoyo doesn't give a shit
like inazuma and sumeru doesn't have a single phys release
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i don't think it's an inherent design issue, like what even was the last physical release in genshin? eula?
or do mihoyo just not release decent phys chara/support
but is it like inherent
what even is the issue with physical in genshin
it surprises me how much that changes from 2-1 to 3-2 tho
that's interesting, i guess that makes sense
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i always just used overall avg placement to make decision
were specific stage winrate that important?
oh that's not that bad then i think
sinful more <:wokejj:1118547247567745164> than RL rn
so all augment stat is gone now?
<:gone_but_thanos_doesnt_come:973224175479193630>
🦀
nice
so you're still above average
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
what's the avg spot from that?
that was the strat for husk
back when i joined
<:joever:1122752199752163419>
and rats make me crazy
a rubber room
i was crazy once
crazy
i know how to code in that
php?
like yeah just so it feels a little better to play owo
it's funny how mort talked about it like it's just a small qol change
yeah that shit's insane
i forgot about that part
oh wait yeah
cause there's some bugfix there which are just straight nerf/buff
on what goes on bugfix and what goes on buff
i'm very confused on riot thought process
jerry robotic arm fix is actually insane tho
and that got nerf
idk how good she is outside of the azir lux comp
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
is that lux buff too big tho?
yeah i watched it in bed before sleep
<a:pepeW:950326333009956884>
actually disgusting
and i almost beat with zed 3
had a game on my NA acc on low as fuck elo where someone hit yasuo 3
zed kinda my jam
i'm getting back into tft
<a:lebronJAM:1045743664925777920>
i like hu tao more
clickbait harder
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
cause that mean they could've clickbaited harder
idk if i'm mad or not about it
and they had 375 + 14 card
it's like exactly avg, it's 385 avg for valk
that 105k went all on valk, they top up later for gear + elf
it's like very avg
oh wait no
that's insane
and they got elf and gear for that?
just valk in 375 is 26% for 3s
turbo lucky?
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
not right
that's
owo math 105000 / 280
oh it's in s2 i think
if you're using around the right stuff you're already scoring like 800+ on most boss
i feel like in RL it's really hard to even have big score diff
how good is turg hrt tho <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
cause i saw pv and thought huh you're playing genshin?
i must be high or smth
but it does have mechas
like it's not really about the mechas
so yeah i guess
i mean it has mechas
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
2019 valk is still meta
it's honkai
wdym woah
but if we're not having collab character
like idk how
hope they do 3 skin tho
i feel like it's definitely not going to be free
i'm just turbo procrastinating
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i still need to put the watchalong info up
sounds good
did you enjoy it?
did you watch promare nini?
with new fire vfx
there's no way lio is the free one
and HoF lio
are ai chan galo
if the only 2 skin
oh
maybe
this is all what i remember hearing for other player, better ask like ruby for confirmation
iirc
yeah
i think, i wasn't around
you got both tho
pyramid i think
the HoR ones were paid
my week is ruined
but not it's fucking <:bejj:1067071810853679194>
like if it's going to be a 946 doom at least be dank as hell
the ref is boring as hell
the worst part is
you can remove the spaces
where they retained in sinful with a like 950
anyone remember the one CN screenshot
my day is ruined
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
there's a 946 doom
<:GachaPlayers:976191636415602738> <:TheLiterate:976191666564247612>
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816><:theliterate:959737715564359740>
if next patch is just 4 cost meta again i guess i should start gaming right now so i can have a little of reroll
yeah i see, that makes sense i think
<:Shyggers:1113819313145659422>
kaisa really was turbo broken
very early on c-patch i didn't notice that much change
was that solely enough? that's interesting
that's kinda cool
did the meta just shift on it's own?
and since it became reroll meta, i assumed it was a new patch
i haven't really been playing cause i didn't like 13.13 with azir/lux yasuo/kaisa meta
i thought that patch happened this week
wait what
b patch?
next week?
jesus christ
taliyah is busted
when i'm the one playing it
yeah, i like it tho
isn't there one ryze that also knock up?
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
just a bg tho
i wasn't that weak but just out tempo to hell
i did double trouble 2 that game i think
huh ok
<a:pepeW:950326333009956884>
i actually roll until stage 5 trying to 3* my stuff
5 people had taliyah in their board
i pick it once and i swear
is double trouble 3 the only good one?
i should learn how to play reroll
<:dogkek:664517636524343344> ok
are you the akshan whisperer now?
okay
<a:lebronJAM:1045743664925777920>
aw
i'd be sus as hell, they're way too excited to dogsit
lowkey tho you ain't even wrong
yeah i'd end it all on the spot i think
yeah as much as i shit on them, in some aspects they care a fuckton in each game
which is stupid when the answer is money
i think people are genuinely fighting over what game mihoyo cares more about
i forgot today was sunday
oh yeah
<a:mhm:1088510781756276756>
asking your mom another 100 dollar for LY stig
can you imagine tho
if he's not stealing moms credit card that's the most we can ask for honestly
it's his parent responsibility, if they're fine there's nothing we can do
toddler even
he's a kid
it's probably fine then?
what part of the body is good?
huh
or does he go out every day and buy some gift cards?
at 14?
a credit card?
and he has
i see
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
my parents would sell off my pc
if i spend 200 dollar when i was 14
then <:shrug:877047647511384064>
like if he spent 200 dollar before on genshin and his parents didn't lock his phone away
that doesn't surprise me but
so it's not the first time?
but he said he also spent on genshin
i honestly have no clue how he's managing to spend in honkai
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
you run out of bundle, 100 dollar is like what, 30 pulls?
gacha game gets expensive fast
cherry
big whale, playing way less nowadays, only plays MA tho
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
LMFAO
i have atmoer
wait
i'm so glad to be a part of this
haha and here's mine guys
i should eat more local stuff
what's wrong with bread that's a lil sweet?
yeah it kinda slaps right?
kinda slaps
like white sliced bread
i'm a fan right now of white bread
like white bread
y'all like bread?
maybe
idk
isn't it more racist to make a big deal out of it when it's kaeya and not when they mod mona to be ass out
cause in canon everyone is sexless and bitchless
doesn't the community do that with literally every character
cause like
is that even close to valid tho
that explains it
i know cause i'm white and i'm a slut
dark skinned people can't be sluts
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
<a:PopcornMunch:751417674277322834>
why tho
that doesn't surprise me
i didn't know you liked kaeya
<@309634550273933314>
<@385655541248163840>
<@483689649727078400>
tell me how good it is
join stream rq
yo cherry
me too
lumigpt
idk how hrt works
i'll stream later for advice then ig
but i tried very little with her
IO looked kinda sad on my setups
probably not
just waiting for her moment
i always thought liss was kinda sleeper broken
that makes sense i think
oh i see
i didn't even know she gave sp
i never played her
i don't fucking know
tf you mean does hrt give enough
i'll try more later
i gave up for now tho
for a 993 score
yeah i wanna 0s ult with PE/IO
like there was a type of player last patch where they just force akshan uncontested every game for fun, but now they're gonna have issues
i kinda feel bad for a certain type of player
is the runaan thing that made akshan this broken?
this like, just circle the broken valk baton between everyone is kinda <a:pepeW:950326333009956884> huh
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and without double trouble
and double trouble board
running taliyah 3 taliyah 1 taliyah 1
i saw someone get a first with taliyah
how much sp is that again?
that's smart
oh
i could try more with beet b maybe
bastet has to have an enemy for me to freeze
cerulean has to have an enemy for me to hit
both of those don't really work tho
yes
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
oh i'll be here to watch
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> lemme see what time that is for me
boss spawns at 993, so i'm -3
ideally something i can proc really early, i'm trying to do a 0s abyss kill
HoS feather is annoying
is there any valk/gear that can give 10sp to team?
just kill it?
i don't get what's the issue with this boss
mine is a bird
get fucked
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
i have 2s GC
oh not that shitter
maybe i can t1 <:omegalul:408829995360714772> <:omegalul:408829995360714772>
anyone have a shitter dpe ref?
that wouldn't surprise me but i don't remember it on HoS
but maybe
never seen it on HoS
agree ?
close enough
okay i manage a -1 without bug abuse
if you don't have ft pri don't bother
newt t is ft bb ch shit
3rd newt b is way less niche than newt t
i don't see them doing any special input or anything
what even is the bug?
for 3s hepha
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
any non old ref with s0 jk
ok
same rank and shit
anyone know why my jk switch cd is 2x longer than ref?
ngl i play the same way
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
but it is really cool actually
i wanted to say no
i read it as ai instead
every time they talk about ai in the manga
i'm gonna be honest
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
i think it's a cook away
i've played worse odds
me with nahida but without intent of changing it
it was like 3-4 tries tbf
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
it p much dies on ult
easy as fuck with 2s i just learned
<:yaesteponme_limeria:944430492806164530>
<:Shyggers:1113819313145659422>
and you can get 2k score, 0 frame kill
just ult on IO at the same time AKA spawns
you can do it too, in training mode
that was cool tho, even if C-rank and also really easy
cool
so 0 frame kill are bugged
i click next stage, and it just did C rank again
but it doesn't count
2k score
that's a 0 frame kill
it doesn't work?
oh shit
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
they feel like the bare minimum to be called a burger
so i'd go with ramen
but i hate them
idk how much you like mcdonald burger, or if they're better over there
<:Shyggers:1113819313145659422>
so i can be below you
actually i'll go do it rn
when i did it
i got 5 extra combo
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
like 30 min ago or smth
we just got confirmation that we also get book on 6.8
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
quitting on the day of book announcement tho
sheeeesh congrats
or just do w/e is new next patch?
so i need to clear story rn to reach that?
<@385655541248163840> you got me?
sounds good
cause i'll just be logging in twice per week for abyss i think
besides abyss
do i have to prepare for anything else?
that was on the second lowest rank
idk wtf that was
i have 50 trophies
for the book cherry
why did i login
abyss ain't even open
in preparation
what do i care about? abyss and that's it right?
okay any knowers?
given the information we had, i still think that assumption was the right one
i never claimed to see the future
alright i'm logging in
even maybe whole posts?
like do i just lose whole comment threads if that person started if i have them blocked?
i think that is a thing i could do but idk how it works
it's on reddit enhancement suite, i also only use old reddit, idk if it works on new reddit
if someone say something exceptionally stupid, i can just mark them forever to not care when i see them in the future
reddit tags are such a good system
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
or right now on pixiv if you look hard enough
next week
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
yeah i actually really like it
but he acts like it's a bad thing
mostly because i think it's very entertaining and maybe actually helpful on calming him down/getting better at the game by writing down his rants
the one thing i'm very confused recently is robin's notepad arc
that makes sense tho, i'm sure it's all very played up <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i wouldn't be able to read into it like that if i didn't see him offstream
oh huh okay, that's cool to know
i respect it
ok
or is that just how he is
is his mental just turbo fucked?
but looking at his stream every now and then
i don't watch much of setsuko
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
<:AYAYA:961871113950998528>
that death animation is pretty sick tbh
but that looks nice
cause all her skin kinda suck
i was wondering what they were going to do for the skin one
i saw the splash art for normal gwen a while back
i can't wait
and apparently you have to buy dlc for the characters to wear clothes
he's gonna play this next
but i guess they were just accurate cause jesus christ
i kinda assume the memes were like turbo exaggerating how those people are like
or keyboard warrior over any small complaint the streamer had during the playthrough
like when he was playing god of war ragnarok, the amount of people that show up just to shit on the game because it's on the playstation
whenever he plays a new release tho, people outside the community swarm in and it's actually insane
which is usually some really dumb weeb shit
and he mostly play games his chat forces him to
a streamer i watch is like reasonably sized, 1.5k viewer on a good day
call of duty 45
they wanna pretend that they actually have objective measure to explain why someone else is wrong in not enjoying
my main issue is when people act like that but they're too fucking coward to admit it
kinda based tbh
that is unironically how most gamer act and i would respect them way more if they just owned up to it
like ??????????? thanks
how good does the game look? specs say i need a 4090
is that even a review
if you're literally just quoting the pg rating
is it?
they must be fast as fuck to do too cause there used to be so many
and that you can easily tell the quality of the game from those measures
that there's these objective measure of game quality
i think to me the thing that makes me hate it the most is that it kinda imply
i can't even explain why, there's so many and i hate them so much
oh wait i found one of the ones i viscerally hate
you keep me in check any time i feel like i'm chronically online
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
that's a lot of cdmg
jesus
the n word drop really takes you for a spin huh
?????? it's entertaining but i don't know the source so i'm bewildered
more than it did before
and i feel like this sucks
i remember seeing something like this before
different before?
was it
i just looked it up
i do like those
there's a name for that?
they're fine i guess <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
they're not as bad as i remember
i'm reading some steam reviews
so who cares
i just mean they're both shit
i mean i can probably too
and really weird reviews
50/50 cynical jokes
when i read them it's like
but they feel the same to me, so i can't care that much
like logically i can see the value of a shit human comment rather than a shit bot comment
that's fair i guess
really? i feel like they're pretty bad too, most i've seen
that shit is a nightmare to me
facebook livestream, chat is just like real people with real names and photos
facebook is like dystopia for me as far as i care, like forcing you to put your real identity and then they want to move  the whole internet there
like huh???
and the twitter replacement is just link all 3
but like the fact facebook owns insta
i don't use either of those
current internet is so depressing
fuck no
just for the comments to be like that?
imagine like spending a few weeks making something
nty actually
but seeing community reaction be like that
i kinda want to make videos
hehe that joke was really funny
and the top comment is like
like i watch a 2 hour video about a game that goes in depth about the story and mechanics
yeah youtube comments, especially on bigger videos, are so fucking milquetoast
is it awful
maybe it's always been awful but man
like on yt/reddit/ w/e?
anyone else think comment quality has been going down?
kinda related but not really
i wonder what's the community feedback on that
do you watch porn and then go
<:Shyggers:1113819313145659422>
you know exactly why
Just take it off
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
and it went perfectly
it's what i did
and then ask baban to pull for you
you can uninstall
sick right?
did i tell you tet?
it's what i did to finish gearing my hrt
you can use patch xtal even
just wait until 7.1 and get her on expa select
do you even care that much
is she even tho?
if it takes all 100
i don't think heki is getting END
i think you just lowered your expectations for the last 2 bars
uhhhhh
like uh
yeah lemme just ask you to compare your damage with the other DA boss
that's fair <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
= ton of resistance
if you're hitting half as much for fun
= ton of hp
like if you're hitting like normal but the bitch don't die
just by looking at pure numbers you deal?
should be easy to figure that one out tho no?
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
you can imagine if every boss had 1 hp bar, how bad it would be to figure out how close you were on damage from ref
it does make sense to give more hp bar for more hp boss, so you can more easily compare how much damage you're dealing
i don't think the amount of hp bar is the issue, mihoyo just probably give boss more hp bar if they expect them to have more hp
iriya talks about how boss with more hp bar somehow scale harder with dist
i think it might have some effect
cause that definitely ain't true <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm asking if that's what you were assuming
like, comparing different bosses, they all have the same amount of hp/hp bar?
yeah that's definitely not true
i always assume that never mattered
like number of hp bars?
wdym?
i swear dist just works differently in some boss <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
what boss is it? pig?
<:seele:963352407365017640>
it's probably my favorite augment in idea only
this is so funny tho <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
it's not bad but i doubt that will make the avg go up by much
deadeye and that's it?
what does that even affect?
it's a pretty fun augment
yeah, honestly i do too
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
look how pretty the traits are
ok i recooked
actually perfect for this patch since kaisa is dead
this is what i came up with
but you probably just treat it as challenger heart right?
i'll see if i can come up with something
oh god
5-7 times per day
my cats every single goddamn day be like
ok mom
children in africa that you can save by donating only 0.99$ per day be like
i'm actually so offended you'd say that to me of all people
i'm not a monster
like i'd ask anyone to touch 3s boss
???????
2k, 4k, 8k, 16k, 32k
the score actually double for each rank, if you don't know
do 2 more pussy
so i just set up the kill, and like HoS chains kills it and i'm like ????? i broke the game?
yeah cause i don't realise i'm doing that
i get jumpscared from that
to do some 2s MA thing
every time i log in to my acc
and start 3s people for fun
so you will catch up
like they don't release valk fast enough to WT to make it impossible to catch up
you'll get there tho
actively don't spend your resources for some reason
unless you like
if you play long enough, you will
i assume that's max value
what the lead skill is at lower rank
the wiki doesn't even say
then idk
white bg
that's a lot
oh it's absolutely HoR if you have 3s
i say, not knowing any of those 3 lead skill
yeah
me too
who
using GD at her intended team didn't even cross your mind
so funny how we're all aponialess
free ayaka at ar42
ok buddy
what valk do you not want 4/4
are you talking to us from 2019?
epi
this is the one
is that what dm means?
i guess i can take a vacation
alright
as long as like, you have a good amount of previous good investment, you can live in RL for p much forever
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
on phys abyss
without HoS
like you can genuinely promote RL rn
honestly i don't think it's possible to brick an acc anymore if it has a good base
<a:peepoLeave:802372023300259861>
nvm
those are valk sp supply
oh wait
how do those sp supply work?
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
i'm pretty sure in MA/abyss you just use kira, there's some other valk who have direct hp loss but idt it works very well <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh wait is that in the event?
hope that helps
there's your problem
>  without kira
that's nice for him <:life:1001518241610485781>
oh ok
is that what soju is doing rn? <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
first time i was stunlock trying to figure out wtf riot did on this 13.13d to make the champ look like that
had to watch it twice
now you have
have you heard of hatesune meanku before
put them all around same power level so we have 13.12 again
just buff zeri and nerf azir yasuo and it's a fine patch to me honestly
i don't know if i mind any of those changes, i think petricite become a more interesting portal and i never played warlord's so idk
wait is that d patch?
long distance pals?
traits?
is the ad from training dummy for like
i prefer something else right now
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i did actually lose to krugs my first few games when i was learning, so the meme is really funny to me
source?
60 generations is like 900 years if they keep having sex at 16
in my moral compass, when it's that couple, it's less weird than both of them faking being babies for a few years
i would honestly be fine if aka actually goes the incest route
oshi no ko 2
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
i do vibe with that tho, kinda edgy but i like it
a lot of past official art can be spicy if you want
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm down
or did we already skip the week?
wait there's a chapter this week? i thought we were skipping a week
that's already how my phys valks work
i'm down
that'd be way too confusing for fun
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
there's like 2 cycle which i didn't bother, assaka was one of them
that's a sleep sim battle cycle for me
there's a reason why almost all top player are hard on themselves
if you don't think you have anything to improve, you'll never improve
yeah absolutely
properly
like i swear some 946 are so many inputs just so she does like 2 things
my fingers contort trying to do some shit with senti on 2s MA
she is probably the easiest hua i think <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
even worse since my discord looks like shit
i can't read shit
without glasses
yeah if i'm sitting normally on my desk
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
bugfix ice and physical resistance
the bugfix was on JK boss
which is pretty fucking insulting to me
that one was just undocumented change i think
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
the coolest nini
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
powercreep for like 90% of player is really not an issue
<@309634550273933314>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
and i doubt she acts like su
she looks more like dollar store FR to me than su
or is it weird how everyone just calls vita female su
huh is it just me
unironically true, right?
you can run 3 shurima 3 noxus earlier
i think it's cause it's good for early game
aatrox?
one of those is her home i think
idk if it's her or the comp tho
and i feel like if that's the aim she's heavily overperforming <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that kayle 3 at 9 should feel like slightly more powerful than 4 cost 2 star
mort said on last patch breakdwon
there's a saying about that
but i'll never forget ionia
demacia might be my home
you know
i've never seen the copypasta in english
on your public twitter
and you just post a public link
like a friend discord
that's wild to me
is it like honkai community friends?
how does that even happen
i'm scared
<:Baby:1065389081112096898>
prob getting giga fucked by coin
their acc is like 2 week old
they're lv86
the mobile tft moba spin off?
oh
world record?
there's no salvation
as far as i care, they either have to make legends really bad or disable them from ranked
they log in for like 3-4 game of forcing something cool they saw
i assume that's what casual player is like
it makes it easier for them to force a funny comp they saw on yt
i think they're pretty good for casual
and then your legend get picked for op -> absolute trash
not even that i like ezreal, must feel awful to be like a casual player who really likes one legend
but man
like i'm coping the nerf are only that big rn because it's like, better to just destroy it on midpatch and then actually balance it later
i hope they do something to ezreal next patch
it gets stronger the more people are playing it
it's kinda like draven, no?
it's a scary one tho
that's the one i was thinking of too
wanna place bets for what's the new broken one?
just trash them, it should always be worse than poro at like masters+
i'm surprised they haven't just fucked all of them up
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
that's a thex
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
i didn't know it was that much gold
i knew there was a bug for selling 4 star
oh shit
that's pretty bad
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
i think most bugs rn are related to ionia <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
is the zzrot one still a thing?
to be causing so many bugs
ionia looks very messy tho
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
yeah that's pretty shit
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
we get c patch
and then we not only get b patch
i like how mort made the tweet
that makes sense
i guess if you get bursted hard
really?
unlucky on not getting remover?
how do you not have 100% winrate?
thank god they're working hard on those bugfixes huh
oh.
i'd prob immediately leave when i figure out that the stuff i used to run isn't even highest score anymore
i kinda miss some bosses <:life:1001518241610485781>
i'd log in for the HoT ref in 3s pig
aw
is it 3s pig?
someone had that username
back in my irc days
oh
i don't know who that is
brazil patch notes?
oh shit brazil
cause you're so hungry
lemme try another one
oh your bait worked but mine didn't
from the real <:lul:660020195347398656>
it's the original one
<:omegalul:408829995360714772>
like that's going to solve anything
and now she's going to sleep
she's hungry
<a:HECOOKING:1089227410899214428>
yeah what's another 45 mins
i feel like those would spend a lot of time in the kitchen
are you like forbidden from the kitchen
how old are you?
wdym you wish
are you going to eat?
i thought fishing was green for you
ok
oh like a peepo
like what
1. <@483689649727078400>
all the cherries i know are orange
aren't cherries orange?
no one else tho
you get the rights cause you're cherry
you know what, sure
americans have so many opinions about food i have like 5 times a year
<:dogkek:664517636524343344> true
cherry citations
thanks for clarifying
oh ok
did you read my second message?
ok buddy
i hate it
mcdonald fries are so skinny
mcdonalds suck and burger king is the only other one we have
wendys doesn't exist here
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
some foods taste fine but i hate how they feel in my mouth
like texture
and it definitely affects other parts
taste is only one part of the experience tho
the taste? no
it's just pasta ma'am
who the fuck knows 800 kinds of pasta
yeah fucking exactly
what else could it be
what the fuck kinda question is which pasta who the fuck knows that
idk i had to go look in the fridge to find the name out
i like the ones with cheese filling
usually i have capelleti tho
no i'm not changing how i live i just wanna push lumi's ideology to it's limit
does it matter what kinda pasta it is?
<:HandsUp:465017146955661312>
is breakfast pasta fine at 9pm?
so some days, i'm eating breakfast at 9pm
which means my schedule just moves slightly every day
i work on 25 hour daily cycle
okay what do you do about me lumi
not out of dislike just out of custom
like a rando sandwich? if i make it i'm not putting mustard
i'm not normal that's for sure
yknow
but like
oh i mean i'm not tested
i thought that was clear tho
oh obviously
i've had it in some food and i liked it i guess
like, by itself in a way i could discern if i liked it or not
i don't think i've ever had mustard
yeah
fuck yeah me too
do y'all like ketchup?
i'm heating up water for ramen
i'm like a toddler
i think i'm only pissed because i'm hungry
actually
i am hungry
sounds good
<:dogkek:664517636524343344> ok
scout and make sure you're weaker
what do you even do?
i'm definitely not on challenger lobby, i think they just suck
i'm getting better at it i think but man
that's like literally every piltover game of mine
yeah that makes sense i think
ori kinda slaps tho so i guess i should've just not done that
the only thing i had was ori 2 which i could've not had
no item slammed, ekko trapped
i had a game where i won as piltover on 2-2, actually tilt me an insane amount
is this patch fun for tourney?
play more?
what's the move?
i'm tilted on tft
like i swear that guy has no chill
husk slaps man
sick ty
anyone know what's the name of the thing that replaces chip space this patch?
emo lumi era
<a:PepoJS:1097418433139834940>
group projects will be my undoing
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
that sounds like a curse on her
right?
there must be at least one more out there
what about the hot sexy girls who call her END
already better than my acc
go on chief
that's what i did
but if you do
i don't trust that you're actually quitting
i mean i vibe with that
the day after
and then quit
i bought 6 month of welkin for keqing skin
i think i did the same thing on genshin
good for her honestly
i mean if she quits
<@781539392039682058> can you repeat what you said back then
can't i just get heki to repeat for me
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
that's a lot of text
i don't wanna backread
oh
the new ichinose chapter?
i actually really don't mind those laws
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
oh i see
road to 420
<a:PANIC:1069826466889605201>
we have all 3 people in the server right here
you're asking in the right place
they can avoid some lawsuit from it, like if someone goes i bought this bundle and didn't get what i expected they can go no, you bought the bchip and you got the bchip you paid for <:okk:1058108494995263539> 
idk
JP might be the same
it's similar to why they sell bundle for bchip instead of money
it's some weird gambling law
ok
is that how it works or is that just for the genesis crystals
wait now i'm self doubting
and then pull
when you have no fates and you try to pull, it makes you buy fates
no
it's like genshin
in CN, you can't pull with xtal
yeah it's a shop that exists in CN since forever
and some non family friendly stuff showed up
oh i searched sexdd on nqn
wdym again
i would fuck husk
yeah switch cd can be big
🧀
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
where's her hp
dabbing on your fucking dead HoH
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
you've already won
if they're in RL with 2s HoH
yeah
if you're using SA
but also, why do you care
you can probably t3 on the right boss
she's kinda busted still
you can still easily retain RL with SA
people like way overestimate how powercreep works in this game for casual player
her ass is good
the reviews are in
given that we can't get a single fucking straight answer from you
i mean i'm assuming you are
oh ok
i thought the can't drive was already implied
aren't you gay?
how much is squirrel hip reconstruction
they're fairy tale magic
yk?
are that they are like cinderella animals
so all i know about squirrels
squirrels aren't a thing here
idk that's kinda psychotic to me
how does that work
maybe?
like on purpose?
you were like woah haha it would be crazy right
now i'm reading that message differently
huh
🪱
i vibe with worms
no flame i would definitely love you more
or bad tears
like good tears?
keep it up
okay <a:lebronJAM:1045743664925777920>
bars?
<a:lebronJAM:1045743664925777920>
that's what i'm saying
it's like a skyscraper in a village
pedestal of mediocrity when in the midst of honkai players
i own up to all of my takes
actually no i retract that
same tho
ok buddy
jk i would fight tet over that
like if tet says kiana is pretty bad, who cares, tet is often wrong
people do care cause you usually have good takes
yeah with interest tho
∞ + 22 - 2
sure
∞ + 20 - 2
ok
now you have infinite - 2
of course it does
but the execution is pretty bad
if you take her as her concept, the idea of her is pretty cool
like around rimestar arc
i think mei is very anime
-2 keilopoints
chill
i think the most hated character is mei from the old player
the opposite of avg honkai player
yeah you're like
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i like the base cast too much
local kiana simp at your service
bad taste?
crystal doesn't count as a person
i think you're the only person i know that didn't like kiana at one point
we didn't screenshot it to be kind to you
i want to see her suffer
see you said i despise her
what was it
i'm so sorry
who could've seen that coming
the kiana hater skipped the kiana and is now suffering the consequences
whoa i'm so sad for you
<a:swipeboobahic:940613030968963122>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
what makes one any more valid than the other?
until we die
don't we just move from phase to phase
aren't we all in a phase
idr
i think MA too maybe
abyss is psy
her fucking fault if she meant no
she said yes
well i mean
but i just checked and i have it now
i was going to complain i don't have pronouns yet
skill issue  bud
it's asking me if i really want to open the link for everything
twins
true
like for what
rng like that in pve competitive is just
i hate crit in genshin too
i would
ksante is like the most troll 5 cost rn
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
would
= unlucky
finisher is 1 frame
keeb does shit like that often
but that sounds true
i mean idk actually, i never played any hsr events
true tho
like, you can get to later areas way early
speedrun skips
oh i meant like
you can skip so much
that event is so fun
<a:RAGEY:1002384343622221885>
<:bejjwithme:1067071883125735446>
my bed
they'll prob turn a few more into 3s and then add third 3s boss later
i agree they shouldn't, i don't think mihoyo cares tho
dw they'll make that into 3s next
oh you like a 2s boss?
so you prob won't be able to clear shield without it
SI qte deals a lot of damage tho
that makes 946 really rough
there's just a lot of long animations you're using
maybe if no SI qte either
maybe if you disable HoS qte
even if you kill on HoS ult
i don't think that rot can 0s btw
on the same team
you can use 2
it says on the stig
yeah
gc -> ly -> hn
gc prob
idk how the refs are nowadays
but i mean maybe
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
sounds doomed for 0s kallen
2s sns
is it interesting?
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
what valk/gear?
what kinda reddit are you in
<a:HUHH:999402772866805770>
<:lfgCatgirlEdition:803114454187114506>
i'm also really proud of that test score you got earlier that i forgot to comment about
i'm so proud of you
let's fucking go cata
LMFAO that's so cute
that's contested by JK and HN
sus is pretty bad
i'm down
you should 2s3 all of them and then start farming sirin
i like it, if you don't mind the shit abbreviation
yeah it's kinda cute
the game just call it by the base star count for some reason
oh i mean the 3* one
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
4 if you count the 2* one
are there even any other javelin?
probably the craftable ones
i'm kinda hype for it
it looks pretty good right?
it looks pretty fun
a demo just came out
wait maybe i can do this to make the dies of emotes
what!!
idk if it just came out or if a demo just came out
there's a furry vn that looks pretty fun that is coming out i think
most games aren't gacha yk
that's very vague
what do you enjoy?
i'm not playing that much
is it that bad? <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
are you cleaning your trails?
oh if it's marriage that doesn't surprise me
i never thought about it before, being illegal surprises me tho
wait it's illegal?
honestly kinda same
tell me how it is <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i think it's an awful stream game <:bejj:1067071810853679194>
i've been watching a streamer play that actually
he really knows
and aka took 2 week break after this
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i see
i would've guessed it'd be doing well <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i'm also really enjoying that
oh really? why's that even?
i'm so glad we get to spend more time with chi too, she's so nice
it's so good
i'm in love with this arc
yeah
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
destroy her
annoy her
ping her
<@309634550273933314>
<a:peepoTrip:755692813320060959>
what kinda question is that
she's LY
no?
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i was there for that 8786 part
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh
wait, does she only show up in cg?
it gets my approval <:okk:1058108494995263539>
awwww it's pretty cute
what? at least i'm honest
i'm interested
i think league is even more degen
you recognise it immediately
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
keep it up tho, live your best life
idk if mpreg su or wanting to bear his children is more degen
????? what even is tft chat
and soul eater like that
i watched the entirety of mirai nikki
and continue another day
just stop every 20 minutes
you could watch it like a series
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
old nirv like every lobby i saw 4/5 people i knew at least
yeah nowadays it's a big occasion to see someone cool
old nirv it was legit like every 3 lobby i saw keeb <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
man that's another big change from old nirv
and <:bejj:1067071810853679194>
run home
okay have fun
it's not going to change anything
just leave ma'am
the 30k story chapter
are you even going to read
yeah ok buddy
you can just not open it instead of opening it
you can't pay me to care
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm just not playing it
like if i don't want to play a game
to me it's kinda wild to want to quit and not be able to
do you even want to quit?
quit if you want to <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i don't think i have any control over your action
is that even work
can she hear from all 4?
i never understand how those catgirl ears work
probably
skipped the rest
HRT, flamescion, HN, GC, LY and whore
after 6.2, i would've pulled
and then i'd skip everyone not support, p much
i would be on bp + monthly budget
i wound down my spending pretty hard, if i was still playing right now
mhm
but v2v scores higher
i did that
yeah it's a 520
v2v top score then
like force HoT on another boss
cause i'm pretty sure there was a week you were forced to use her
but would prob still end up pulling her s0
cause she suck in MA
is v2v
the only valk i think i'd consider skipping
on husk
for the HoT DPe strat
i would've definitely went for s2/2s on my peak
i did skip aponia but because i was winding down on spending <:okk:1058108494995263539>
with 3s boss, it's really hard to skip valk
and i am to top spot every week
i mean i'm an MA player
yeah
everything?
i'd say so yeah
nice
oh ok
huh who's that
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
just wait 6
why 3
like a rabbit?
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
actually? it's kinda good bait
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
alright hit me
i'm fine i think
but it's legit like paragraphs of describing the entire chapter
i'd be down
if it was like 1-2 sentence of the idea of the chapter
i'd rather just wait until the actual chapter
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
i don't read anymore cause it's so much text
i've read some before and they were accurate
they came out like 10 min ago tho
in preparation of
but they posted that before the leak come out
i haven't read the leaks
yeah it's kinda insane
<a:chatting:877611584736874556>
onk discord having a normal one right now
what am i looking at
fixed it
oh it didn't embed
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
the amount of time i went god my items suck and pick that to fix my items <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
my most pick augment was salvage bag
i think in 8.5
i kinda love it
is slam shiv
if there's one thing i know how to do
oh?
do you think guinsoo is like necessary on azir lux?
that sounds pretty nice then, i never tried that line
huh ok
like after that game, without tf i wouldn't really go for ekko reroll if i don't get 2 cloak 2 tear 2-1
i guess it depend on the reroll build then
it was last patch tho
even 3* with no exodia item it felt just ok
like i played one game of ekko reroll
some reroll build just don't work like that tho i feel like
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i see, that's kinda what i do already, i slam kinda liberally
without TF/leesin some reroll builds feel kinda bad
legends also make it kinda annoying, like i feel like if i'm picking a normal legend i'm locking myself out of reroll/specific build
but probably skill issue
it kinda feel like there's too little option to me sometimes
yeah, i guess that's fine <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
casino patch
just hit azir lux or yasuo kaisa on 7
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
so is my read correct
when i go to play genshin, i always ult by accident when trying to move the camera
i've never changed anything
that's default controls
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
q rotates my camera
<:peepoAvenger:756228412435333250>
pretty on time this time
stores still full
isn't that the opposite of whale
i bet he's swimming on the cost savings rn
is that elon didn't pay for the servers, either aws or google cloud
apparently the working theory on the twitter bs
i already think it's kinda stupid
like even if you don't see that
i think blaming elysia is misguided tho
that looks a little too futuristic, maybe more sumerupilled
new fontaine character
genshin leak
post it on twitter right now
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
but back at around v2v release i think? they changed it to actually be +qua
yeah, qua weather used to be have fun lmao
yeah thinking about it, it's prob still hers right? especially since the qua weather change
does she still hold other boss like whale/couatl?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that one is probably fair
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
which is dead?
post BKE
is there even any dps valk
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i mean BKE ain't dead either
just with increasingly diminishing niche
dps just lives for forever now
isn't that not even true?
Gresham, don’t forget to paypal me QK’s fund
same tho
this just got more interesting
how did you rip one then?
i didn't know you were a scalie
i'm not judging you i just think you're boring
that's kinda boring
did you patch it with something sick?
patches are cool
i'd be hype
isn't that a good thing?
the game, that is
i knew it got a patch
don't
what is tumblr?
i'll coach you
try tft
<:PotFriend:947188517153439784>
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
do this for nini
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
keep it up meta warrior
-y based!
so kind
so you can have fun
nini actually didn't pick them on purpose
it's so funny <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh that's ?????
yeah i can't stand new reddit
oh ok
are you on new reddit?
oh, really?
i think i noticed a little on really big posts in the past
like comment reply thread?
what's that mean
that's like small game communication vibes
i'm still stunlock that you have to follow elon to know wtf is going on on twitter
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
this is the shit that happens
cause if you just let him do whatever
and gaslight him into giving actually good orders
in tesla, some people jobs were specifically to babysit elon
i've read somewhere that like
it's kinda wild tbh
<:life:1001518241610485781>
no this is objectively awful for everyone
where are you pivot to?
i think i need to move all the porn to a different acc probably
what do i do now
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh wait my cohost is porn
tft emote spam is S-tier
kinda true
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i've checked it out before, the chat looks horrendous
that'd be my biggest problem when thinking of pivot to kick
yeah i agree with that
to get more tweets for today
complete your daily 3 commissions
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
idk how well it work
they have apparently
have they not?
would you go there to watch them
like if someone you like move to kick
would you actually?
and the only browser that isn't chromium based is firefox
i've seen people get warned -> blocked by youtube
but if you go out of your way to try to adblock on youtube
the bigger adblock extension just whitelist youtube by default
youtube is starting to enforce the ToS
so i think every chromium based browser
which is kinda hype
youtube premium money goes like a bunch to the actual creator
from what i've seen tho
i mean same kinda
youtube premium also does youtube music, so it's also a spotify replacement
but on chrome, they're starting to block people who use adblock <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
adblock on firefox still works
to me it'd only be for supporting creator i enjoy
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
cancelling spotify sub to pay for youtube premium instead
i was actually considering
youtube?
okay so what are the main pivot?
tumblr
cohost
bluesky
facebook?
that's a good emote <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
that's probably true
maybe
so
b ut that clearly ain't true
he's dumb but not that dumb
aintnoway he disabling twitter for the entire EU
i woudl say
oh i mean maybe
he would only not get in legal trouble if he disabled the site in EU
like, he could still get in legal trouble since twitter is available in the EU
not really
yeah
if they weren't forced to
they would never allow you to see what they have on you
the only reason it even is an option is because the EU forces them to
that would get them in legal trouble
even if you don't care, if you wanna fuck twitter up, that process is very expensive for them, so that also helps
which is fair
i guess that's a default of what they think people like
i barely used my facebook so they were working with 0 info
i did it for facebook and it was pretty interesting, they thought i was interested in gay and ants
i advise you to do that if you care about your time on twitter, so you have a backup of some degree <:okk:1058108494995263539>
that twitter has
you can ask for an archive of all your data
if you go on settings -> your account
thank you twitter
oh let me check out my tweets one last time before leaving
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
on release
that's interesting, eden had some targetting issue too
to see what changed
so i went to stare at aponia
i read it's a new moth
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
where we can find them outside of twt
is just people posting
my twt timeline rn
desab
if you wanna feel different
so you can pick a different one
so is everyone i think
but
i'm a vovoide simp
they are both S-tier and the best she has
both
twitch apparently are having server issue
is everything going down rn?
whats wrong with being boomer
i think you count already
hmmm i see
but social media, idk
it's whatsapp for sure for like, messaging others
i don't really know what normal people use here in brazil too tbh
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but not in that way
it is broken
if i were to guess
discord + roblox meta
i think children in brazil are like
that's kinda wild, like it's still turbo big here but not with children
that doesn't sound like peak
early onset boomer maybe
or something like that
pokebuddy
oh i remember that
but mostly with boomers
like facebook is very big here
wait with avg person?
faceb <:omegalul:408829995360714772> <:omegalul:408829995360714772> k
yea ok
reddit on decline, twitter 5ft under, what's left
i can't wait to see what's the new era of social media
i kinda wanna check that out <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
oh that doesn't work
what's bluesky?
like that movie?
there's no personality left
everything is the same
i hate how the internet is nowadays
lowkey fucking same man
that guy experience with programming is making his neopets css page
fuck no
and just that means the programmer left are working legit 16+ hour days
but it isn't bringing the entire thing down
like yeah it sucks and it doesn't work
is kinda impressive
the fact that he can actually get new feature implemented at all
like just maintenance on a site this big takes a lot of work
like i'm impressed that this shit still opens
lowkey the 5 left are working really hard
or delusional type
that would be deported otherwise
the only one that are left are the ones stuck with work visa
and then people keep leaving
cause he think that's all you need to make a site
elon fired close to everyone that's not a programmer
it's a healthy change
lowkey tho
i'm rate limited
oh bet
that translates to HE IS NAKED
<a:HUHH:999402772866805770>
and still not got that
i scrolled really fast for 5 min
600 tweets is kind of a lot
ngl tho
open more tabs
and it keeps requesting, 10 times per second
like, it's receiving 0 tweet, and because of that it tries again to get tweets
yeah exactly
the site does it by itself <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
you don't need to
no
it just spams requests to the server for more tweets
and again
so it tries again
and all the site knows is that it's not getting any tweets
it's more like, the site can't get any tweets because the server is rate limiting you
to going to shit
this close
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
but discord is fucking
you joke
that's so fucking funny
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
cunniest?
do twitter speedruns
we should
two!
you get to choose between two different builds
fun diverse meta <:okk:1058108494995263539>
right now it's not very good
anyway so yeah i need more people to follow on tumblr so my timeline becomes bearable
rare
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
you don't need to try so hard to make me like her
like she's already a great character
it also feel like mihoyo force her way too hard for fun
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
is that she's really good and too popular
yeah the issue with ely
oh i didn't know that
and i also dislike that every valk look the same nowadays
the reason she hates ely i also kinda agree, she thinks ely started the era of all valk having the white purple pastel color palette
and it slaps
she did some other character as HoV designs
i do really like her art tho
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and shitting on ely
and her feed is just 100% her answering asks wanting to fuck kiamei
the only active person i follow is cloudya, the girl who does the HoV fan art
my tumblr kinda sucks, i need to follow more people
so i have no social media left
and reddit stop working on my phone
cause like twitter turbo sucks
i really need to work on my tumblr
what the fuck <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
follow the ceo to get the twitter fucking patch notes
you gotta fucking
man can you imagine it
you need twt blue to post, normal acc can only see elon's tweets
apparently
elon musk be like damn i thought this was going to die sooner i should try harder
?????? LMFAO
i wanna hear it now
whos the statiscially most baited
i wodner what's the bet rates
going above and beyond
kinda working overtime if that's the case
is that like his full time job?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh is he just baiting
took me too long to find it
cool
cause my posture sucks balls
i think i'm fucked, personally
idk much about it actually
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i think it's about posture + how intense the activity is
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
i mean yeah but you should be chilling while doing it
chill
like you're putting way too much effort in the genshin gamemode
you shouldn't be getting carpal tunnel from doing ER tho
they should
<:Truege:1114141621022375997>
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
holy shit
nevermind
my god
am i in there?
she breaks those
do you have a nyx around?
i don't think so
at the same time?
me when i get a high score in MA but it's non +20% so i'm unsure of what the score really is
i think that's a neil cicierega song
you need therapy
i think she gets it by default no?
i'm quirky like that
i talk to my vegetables
talk (to) you tater
trans youtube
oh that's pretty good
i would be put off by that
i understand what you mean by too agressive now tho
i don't wanna flirt
tet
how aggressive is it?
thank you i'll dm it to rei
thank you
owo translate all of what they just said
okay
a fun one please
tet can you teach me a death threat in turkish?
ok
tet you're making turkish sound like a fake language
damn
whoa she really does
do you?
you're gonna ask now if some random other latin person is my relative?
just cause i'm latin doesn't mean i know everything latin
that's kinda racist tet
<:FLUSH:950329520181878826>
so you like me
i'm latin i think
<:Truege:1114141621022375997>
yeah i think it's something with the number, like latin related
i don't even know what that is
i'm so pure
sorry aster i've never thought about sex in my entire life
have fun
i think i'm retarded
what's wrong with me
how the fuck did i get my directions wrong
wait i mean right girl
LMFAO the move the left girl make is so silly
fallout equestria?
actually it's not that descriptive if you think about it
every movie title should be as descriptive as that one
there's only Ls
true
do more
whoa cool squiggles
i'm illiterate
no?
who's mikuo
wig
issok tho i appreciate your work
yeah i hate it when that happens, i put a lot of work on some stuff just for everyone to ignore it <:crying:757445037402619974>
hey luna, that's kinda unhinged to me
???
no
i'm gonna guess
it also doesn't have elysia
matrix is anime for non weebs
matrix is already almost anime
actual personal counter to me, i can't deal with it
yeah i can't
we're gonna have to dock you some buffs for that chief
mihoyo looking at you disapprovingly when you tell them that you want to play the game
i think you can turn it off tho
that's the thing everyone was complaining about on beta
the amount of <:riotriot:892850251919147050> we spammed yesterday because of draven patch
also how did you only figure out now
<:TFT:1005183711869947996>
we talk about the main game
you're talking about the moba spinoff
reroll tristana can get you a top 4, if you get a fun emblem you can maybe do something different
like to win, it's basically just ionia yasuo kaisa or the lux/azir comp?
<@180679257851166721> is it just me or does the build diversity this patch kinda suck <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
nothing else to do
but you shouldn't say it like that
yeah
i mean
they're all hot ?
my sister likes to sleep on the floor
a normal amount, but it's kinda hard to get to cause we have a mattress on the floor right beside it
fuck her up
yeah roast her aster
what's the story
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
it's like scrabble
i know what it is, isn't it also arcade?
?????? <a:HUHH:999402772866805770>
i don't get too much pleasure on like, almost being sandbox where you aim for the highest score
i don't vibe with arcade puzzle game tho <:sad:1120918161865322597>
tet i appreciate you trying
.
that's pretty cool
randos sounds pretty cbt tho
i didn't know that
wait really?
like with randos?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:DESPAIR:1021717882993909820>
can you play that solo
but all workshop player made levels end up being way too easy since they just use stuff you already learned in the main game
pretty good tho, they kinda explore their mechanics to the fullest which is pretty cool
i already played both <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
not arcade ones please
any good puzzle games?
it's steam sale
i'm not very creative right now i just want violence
you should test the difference between a tie and a rope
what do you think of
may i
to send a death threat
i want
you kinda gotta love shitting on people to get to a point where that's your job, right?
that sounds very tiring tho
i guess if the pay is good enough i'd be down
lumi your nickname is keqings ?
god i love lumi, i should start taking more prints
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
the f1 through f12 + esc being the fc is so cute
it's going to stage 7 with them
they're the main character of the lobby
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
official stream chat for these sort of event are so bad tho
chat adds a lot if it's a good chat
the chat on these official stream <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
last esports i watched, i watched robin costream the tft worlds, it was pretty fun
is the main stream cool tho?
anyone cool streaming it?
oh i'm down
it was easier to place myriad than retain
especially before the nirv changes
nah i was p often on myriad
7 draven you try to play asol, you bleed so hard from everyone going 5 on 2-5
7 asol you try to play draven, nothing to kill for sow
it's kinda interesting how the 2 most broken legend both hard counter each other based on how popular it is
<a:KeiloTheBear:1002644779441598585>
it's different cause i never got it
it's different from the MA one, since that one you get a week but only once per week
<:Stonks:668331960430493696>
so you profit time if you 100% retain
and there's 2 cycle per week
yeah, you get a week every time you retain
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
nini is so happy she gets to play with the best valk in the game she's doing spins
i get to play tft
let's fucking go
or soon enough
or tomorrow
i'll get to play the game later today
i'm pogging so hard right now
will people follow or trash me
if i pick stillwater
do you think
mort is the most toxic of all
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
stock up 3 month of tuber
they have to play 24/7 for a few days
yeah i'm telling you
<a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206>
SHE WENT FUCKING 3RD WITH AATROX 3 MAN
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and her enemy hit ksante 3
emily hit aatrox 3
nevermind just as i was saying that
jesus christ <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i didn't know that's how it worked
????? <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
and by the time i get to level 8, no more unit in the pool for me <:KleeKEK:984883553315721268>
so i go oh instead of level 7 and roll down, i can afford to level 8 and roll down
like, i think i'm pretty ahead cause of tons of gold and hp
i think i've made similar mistake in the past
yeah that makes sense actually
oh i see
but still, i'd think like, one person high roll enough they can still do it yk
that makes sense, i think
from watching stream, at least
how few 3* 5 cost i've seen
i'm lowkey very surprised
like below avg power-wise, but comfy for you since you get to guarantee it
i think even 2-1 should be below avg after looking at this
the only way it's balanced if it's 100% always worse than poro
i still think my take is right, they have to either make legend turbo bait or disable from ranked
it's so easy, hire me <:riotriot:892850251919147050>
for ranked
just hotfix disable legend for the patch man
last time
i did shrink + 2x mechano
ok
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
last patch it was always self repair x3
btw thoughts on heimer turret?
1.3 <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
as a 3 star, she's so much better than all other 4 cost it's insane
or like 1.2
yea it wouldn't surprise me if kaisa 3 avg 1
true
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
robin had a game earlier where on death screen, you could count 15 kaisa <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like what the actual fuck man
this is legit so much more for fun than 8.5 for fun patch
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that's also wild to me
it's wild to me
you'll have entire patch where you get 15 min of content spaced out over 6 weeks
genshin is different
i mean
like what
day 1 tho?
i mean maybe, i had some patches i disliked because i ended up at the end not enjoying too many abyss cycle or ma cycle
even though she's just a normal ass valk
it's just people in this server in specific that really hate her for fun
there's people who like her out there
you skip a valk don't make the patch boring, you're just tired of the game
it's not like you pull every valk every patch
and?
first worlds where they give 4 random player the chance of going
that's kind of riot actually
LMFAO
zeri 4.79 placement <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the worst 4 cost 3*
i do think it's a good thing they want the patch to take longer to be solved, but the way they wanna do it is very stupid
to be honest tho i don't even think it's needed, last patch took a while to even be called solved, we had new best comp discovered on last day
i kinda believe them when they say that the reason they want to ban stat is just so the meta doesn't get solve too fast
it used to be the worse
it's still pretty bad according to stats tho
they buff it
last time i played, i pick 4 cost on 4-4 to be my 1 star carry <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
someone in emily game has sej 3 at 4-3
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
we don't need to be sad about augment stat going away
also look at the bright side
this one
the cat one?
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> i haven't watched it yet tho
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i'd be down to play her <:life:1001518241610485781>
i love cait in the spin off
oh ok
is cait also turbo broken?
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
every game at least 2 + maybe me playing it
aphelios is just too cool
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i'd agree with that i think
it's like, only piltover, ew, sniper, and then at the very end bastion locket
yeah last patch was really chill until the very end
lowkey i actually think it's either make them turbo trash or disable them from ranked
<:5Head:888981972456730634>
just not as broken as draven
only nerfing draven prob ain't enough tho, i think ez and asol are broken too rn
i think if they made all legend trash rn, the game would be pretty balanced
kinda wild how one change can completely degen the entire game
yeah it's insane, i can imagine someone silver sow acting like pri for fun while yours give you nothing even if you win <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
big neeko, especially in this patch, i'd value a lot actually
but not tome
i've seen big neeko at stage 3
sounds great
?????? alright
you can figure out what's the probability augment tree from this
top most common augment <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
pwetty
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
they should move to kick for this patch
<:Pog:759246282077372428> i got a 3 star what??
stock up 3 month of tuber
lowkey boxbox gotta stream this 24/7
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
emily and setsy about to get 1 week vacation <:o7:1099354934320840765>
i also don't kink shame
it's for pregnant people
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
like you can see, the strap to tie the dress is below the bust instead of at the waist
so i vibe w it
and it's in the same era as that, and the pregnant ladies wear the same kind of dress as that
and i'm reading kusuriya no hitorigoto
i'm easily influenced by what i'm reading right now
<:jerrydd:1123980111557972120>
<:jerry:1123980062841122906>
like 5-10 min?
?
is it better than ,.. rolling
okay share
hey prom <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
setsy is so fucking toxic <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
mihoyo so kind
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> s1?
i kinda vibe with it
if you ignore who the characters are
lowkey tho it looks really nice
maybe for a photoshoot  i'd be down
actively want?
like
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
you know how expensive those tickets are?
that's fair tho, i would too on stadium
yeah sure
i don't think most of people actually were upset tho
like actual <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
and it kept getting worse
like when it got to 3-1
one of the only times i actually watched a match
it was so funny
that's not racist that's just funny
i'm gonna be honest idk what the racist stereotypes are
so you failed
that's a lie actually cause i'm weird but in brazil it's very normal to eat rice daily
i eat it every day
my rice score is 100 cause i love rice
what?
yes
my friend is called amab
good one
yeah just a vanilla one i think
or just like a general inside view
wait do you mean like a cut out of just the ovaries?
i mean yeah? i think?
good job?
liking the sex thing for sex reasons
it's just vanilla
isn't it neither?
i learned it yesterday on e621 actually
i just think they're neat
like not sexually or anything
i like knees
i have no control over my own actions, they're as much of mine problem as they are yours
i just say stuff and deal with the consequences
i'm never in the dilemma
one could even say i spend too little time
i don't spend that much time thinking of my jokes, sorry
your joke is better than mine
yeah i'm a biological thing too
any feet enjoyers in chat?
i mean i'm guessing if you're into feet, the stink is part of it no?
<a:SNIFFA:1076196403711316091>
where's all the people sniffing HoV magic girl feet
yeah ok buddy
you think eden feet is nasty?
why sirin, why griseo
can't you ask for like eden feet or smth
like isn't liking feet enough?
why do the feet enjoyers go for kid feet
we're all 20 if you think about it
mine also rounds to 20
me too
30 isn't even a real age
they haven't heard that one before
that will hold up in court
i forgot jerma nick so the first thing i thought was nini's birthdate?
agree
mentally i'll
lumi actually speaking in riddles
yeah from what i remember it should work <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
try and let us know
<a:HUHH:999402772866805770>
destiny drama <a:SCHIZO:1042907357249802310>
worse than last patch sej 3
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
lil bro brought the enemy yasuo to make friend
i read actual sp degen and thought fair
no hotfix btw
<a:SCHIZO:1042907357249802310>
i do that too and the acc is mine
i forgot
what was it that i even wanted again?
me too ?
it's probably boring tho, cause i haven't heard anyone talk about it
i'd answer you tet, if i gave a shit about event
nft thought process
that's like
???? but it's not free money, it's a free luocha
lumi
about wanting the luocha this bad, i mean
genuinely don't know if you're joking or not
what even
like t0 -> dudu
thinking back, last gen upgrade was kinda nuts
get 3s bb then
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
pick spoils of wars for next abyss
yea whale gets 1 card + all stamp from shop
maybe
5 per knight
i think it's 20 per pala
so for non awk
mine isn't either
man idk
oh that was for the bowser fuck scale
oh they kinda suck
what skins do gwen even have?
oh she looks really cute actually
yeah probably
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that's just diavoros
i don't think that's down bad
the bowser scale is used to figure out how downbad one is
which is fine, just not my type
is just jack black
i mean he looks normal, is just the way he acts
like the movie jack black bowser, i'm out i think
depends on the bowser
bad example i would too
playing hard to get
more like luocha is tet's biggest fan
i swear i sjust black out and wake up at the end
i'm surprised y'all are conscious when doing the tutorials
oh wait okay
wtf you mean they removed all time stop?
wait what
HoH is a support
free as in you had to pay xtals and asterite
about 50 frags = free 2s for next cycle <:OkaygeBusiness:945151371869560953>
agree
hp doesn't matter anymore on LY
now we get stillwater every portal <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i thought 2-1 draven was strong and you still play the game after
i didn't know it was cringe to that extent <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
7 of them just pick draven draven draven as augment
i mean it's not even that, not only it's 8/8 draven
yeah that's pretty cheap i think, 360 bchip at most? i'm guessing people have at least 8 coupon lying around
cause i bought mine from bingo
oh damn, how expensive does that come off as?
robin
wait how did you get it?
fuck yeah, based
and the 8th person is spoils balanced long distance pals
????????
lil bro lobby right now is 7/8 spoils balanced rolling for days
man what the fuck
just disable them for ranked riot <:OkaygeBusiness:945151371869560953>
lowkey tho is this patch really fucked or is it just legends
that's not bad
yeah avg for sp is 76
lil timmy can't wait to get home to get his first 3* sej
yeah i bet
like what the fuck
it genuinely feel like for fun patch
8 draven lobby
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i can't blame them too hard cause i think no one saw this coming, but no b patch is turbo cringe too
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
and now this is the new patch
mort was on reddit the other day saying how tf is fine, just can't be optimal play
was he force asol all this time?
i mean i'm here now but idk how he got that
good morning
<:KeiloSit:1101246919789002752>
why is lil bro <a:chatting:877611584736874556>
actually turbo cringe man
but the entire lobby lv8 on 4-1
i don't mind someone highroll every now and then
it's so cringe, i actually hate it, if the meta don't evolve past that i won't even bother playing until next patch
that's cute, i want kana
actual casino, hit strong board 2-1 just win the game
i watched some of big bro stream, it's so cringe
thanks for the input
ok buddy
to say shit and then immediately go also i can't figure out how to play her
like honestly i couldn't ever have the confidence
they're so brave tho
i don't believe them
oh no the crit rate is like 50% i'm just really lucky
i wonder what's their answer to that
<:Stonks:668331960430493696>
they just get infinite cdmg now
if their PE is 100% crate
lowkey tho if that's true isn't it even better for them?
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
like no joke
and she's an ice valk
on doom
with no crit support
there was one ref which was avo tm newt B BKE
and you're glad it's not .4%
you run with .5% crit rate
the real 2s MA
in MA it sucks worse but idk if it's fair
i don't believe in the numbers
i swear in abyss her qte crit is like 20%
same kind of person who look at whore and go eh it isn't even that good, just makes for less bald
yeah exactly, they just never noticed cause they don't care <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i mean you know what that really mean
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
damn, they do it to anything
that too?
<a:HUHH:999402772866805770>
someone answer a 6 year old reddit comment of mine just now
that's really surprising to me, they did get buffed but they still looked bad to me
even down to gold+ with more games, it's still avg 4 for silver buried
oh shit ww carry aug is <:wokejj:1118547247567745164> now?
i think they giga buff it
dw he's just figuring out the patch
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
730 i think
.
60 60 60 70 150 150 150 150
150
i don't think they even run that banner anymore
besides like spendings and stuff, that's all you can do, no?
yeah
from spending or smth
but like, free card i wouldn't pass it up either
i wouldn't roll for her, as far as meta goes
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
kinda insane, s0 PE look like release 3s PE
yeah i saw
maybe HoD is more PE's
wait is FGO a trio boss now?
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
FGO + sriracha + kallen
i'm sure it will happen at least once
what
yeah
<:ohnobirb:948935560091807744>
oh fuck, yeah, there's no coming back now
oh god i didn't think of that
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i'm glad but the timing is a little weird, i didn't expect it out of nowhere
oh shit it finally happened indeed
execution wise that run was really clean, gj <:okk:1058108494995263539>
huh okay i'm downloading it <a:peepoRun:820028507370815508>
that's surprising, you got t1 abyss that week, i assume you had BiS setup
1500$ loan angle?
<:HandsUp:465017146955661312>
or try to press the button once on the right timing?
do you spam?
<:PU_PepeOld:532626230562783242>
:reallyma
emote is broken
it isn't doing it
i don't even remember from mine, even when i was still playing :ohnofi
wild to me that y'all remember stuff from each other acc
wait really?
thank you gresham
stockholm syndrome
spear when it connects and you want to stay on HoS is slow as fuck
i mean you'll probably be able to tell
yeah dudu buff should apply
elf earlier at p2 to reset HoS cd instead of wait for it to go away
and then you can elf earlier at p2
you'll prob still meet damage threshold
if you elf earlier at the start
i think you can save some points
upload it to yt?
huh why
how shit we sayin
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i can watch it if you wanna try further tho, i'm not very confident i can give advice on abyss but i can try <:okk:1058108494995263539>
if you're not feeling it, just take it and sleep
i mean that score is kinda stacked
almost 30% games lv9 is kinda nut
alright okay
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
can you send me yours of this?
if you send vid maybe, i prob wouldn't be too much of help but other maybe
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
lots of random stuff <a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
damn tactics.tools set review is pretty cool
in 8.5
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and lowkey i think ahri 1 sucks balls
i was going to say, actually pull off ahri 2 there sounds pretty hard
<:Flushed:999784455529037905>
yeah that looks pretty good actually
probably prefer taric
taric or lissandra on 8 is what i'd do then
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it doesn't look too good tho
maybe
this?
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
jesus okay
vow + bow?
are those item that bad?
congrats
mort personally give you a freebie
jesus fuck
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i just wanted some degen games before the patch
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
oh the patch is out
what if we instead of rework all boss, we make a new tier with more hp and resistance ?
you're a genius ruby
exalted slowly becoming masters tho
it's kinda cool
i think i saw some people running that last time i logged in
you have a higher chance of getting it
if you only select that
emily is great at the game but i think she has entertainer brain too hard on stream
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
cause they were pretty fun
even before i start playing i already watched his tft streams
he is like a great entertainer, he always try to do a lot for the community and audience <:o7:1099354934320840765>
oh shit really? i didn't know that
so it sounds like it was successful
boxbox always talk about how the best of bootcamp is when it's close
wait that's pretty hype
oh no i'm still waking up
the meta just degen so much faster
the second one item is op
yeah idk if tf was a good move from the devs
but jesus
okay fair
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
that's an insane nerf
they should rename it to half of a locket
was it THAT strong
yeah wtf
that locket got kneecapped
jesus
i wonder what they even consider balanced or not in that front
and i went ????? okay thanks mihoyo for the hard work
whore got a damage reduction nerf in v2
like just a whole stat that is completely useless <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
if you think about it
honkai is so weird
maybe in ER <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
no way you're actually invest in hp
on whore, it's just a random nice buff
like LY stig, the hp locked buff was high enough that you actually want to run hp line
i mean it's the same idea, but it's less impactful <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
makes interesting mechanic -> fuck it, valk gets it for free no thoughts needed
and add LY gets everything for free <:xdd:1089308231496638574> 
v2, they make the hp requirement insane
cause her stig scale with hp
v1 you did
game was telling you something
you saw the line
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
so many pandora's box man
i'm so proud
i believed
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i believe
you can do it
<:pogg:1060649334489743431>
that's more effort than when i was learning a new language
i believe it
<a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206>
how do you know all the lines
so if it's targon <:PepeEvil:916072961042169906>
targon is getting buffed
we'll know
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<@180679257851166721> 
solved by press button faster
80% of honkai problem
doesn't sound hard, i'll chalk it up to inexperience
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
my mind just break when anything core is different, idk how to tempo with march <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
idk how to play march, i took a 5th the one game i pulled it
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
but pris, not really?
so it's like, silver and gold augment, legend augment can be better than avg
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah that's what i initially assume
oh okay i see
is that a good gg or a bad gg?
i don't understand that
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
jesus christ
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
oh that looks insane actually
but ionia challenger with yasuo kaisa duo carry, i thought of going morello rather than eon, which i assume would be for yasuo
i mean i go for guinsoo too if i'm playing those comp
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i see
this set tank has so much shield and healing
radiant morello is like, the highest avg radiant item
i love guardbreaker
that's nice to know
i don't ask for zeri in specific, just in general, but yeah
that's fair
oh ok
what's gb?
hmm okay, i always feel like it's kind of a waste to do qss if i'm not maximising the usage of stat from not doing ie
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
you're then forced to build ie? to make use of the stats?
for like zeri
do you think if you build qss
i think if i tried to troll i'd int less than some low gold player
when i'm at those lobby i can't even tell <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
yeah that's true too
that's +lp for the lobby i'm leaving too
maybe who cares
i kinda care about moral but that does sound like the best of both worlds <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh
wouldn't you eventually get banned if you actually just leave on 1-1
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> okay
maybe it doesn't matter tho
i think even if i make a smurf, i would only be able to play for so long with him before the smurf outrank him too, unless i giga troll but that doesn't sound like a good thing to do
maybe i should coach him and force him to be better and place plat
i duod yesterday and i avg 1.9, my friend avg 6
but they aren't uh, good
it's way more fun than normal game
and staying at my rank so i can still queue with my friends <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
i'm kinda torn between degen queue and go diamond+
true
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
i wanna play it but i don't like tf legend that much
like holy fuck <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh ok
was it yorick graveyard?
SO many solari
that's
<a:GAMBA:920724874467606608>
the degen meta has surged, my optimal environment
guess it's my time to shine then
or is it just the new shiny thing?
wait so this new build is it actually like turbo broken that everyone is forcing it?
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i wonder what's the meta <:clueless:973756617109676032>
tf tf tf tf tf tf
7th tried too
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
okay
that's probably a good score
owo math 39853 * 1.2
that's really funny <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
for the book?
oh wait
like my 1v1 lobby <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
lowkey tho not surprising, there's some wacky lobbies down there
that's pretty funny
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
the only way you know it's a thing is when it happens to you and your trophies are back at 3k
it's such a weird thing, it's completely undocumented in the game itself
if you ask mihoyo support they would probably answer with your trophies get what?
idk
it just get reset to 3k
at the end of a season
if you're over 3k
xx00 is most likely from trophy reset
yeah xx80 is from virtual trophy
that sounds good i think
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
the stuff 1.0 player went through already
he took some breaks but
i would be surprised if keeb wasn't still playing tho
it they're at top leaderboard every week
not really hidden
i mean
yeah i don't think that's keeb <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
wait neko, you're NA?
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
i swear i'm nice <:crying:757445037402619974>
well i get that, people just assume the worse tone when it's me <:crying:757445037402619974>
if you're putting in the work, there's only stuff to be proud of <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i'm only toxic to people who larp as competitive player, who act like they bald 30 hour but actually play 5 min per abyss
of course i'm genuine
why does everyone think i'm an asshole
<:sushanghmph:984868432317124628>
they're lumi
maybe you can look them up, it's prob cap
there's a pretty big NA lao who's using 2s HN
i feel like almost all the game i lose it's because i feel like my frontline is shit
yeah that's really attractive to me
i wish it was stronger
i actually love targon
that sounds pretty interesting
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
damn! what a surprise!
big bro stream longer than hours i've been awake
oh i went to giga sleep
big bro making me feel better about my losestreaks
max is not really realistic, but yeah it sounds pretty sizeable <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
ok so, without item, the chakram add
1* - min 18, max 60
2* - min 27, max 106
damage per hit, before nerf
ok bet
it's 200% ad, and the value is 180 at base 2* cause his base ad is 90 at 2*
oh wait no
is it 180 base + 200% ad?
like something like this ->
Moon Blast: 180 (Attack damage) [200%/200%/550%]
<:KianaDumb:909232418052014171>
i also don't know how damage calc works
they nerfed that bonus damage by 20%
For 7 seconds, equip 3 Chakram, plus 1 more for each enemy hit by the blast. Attacks deal 6/9/54 (Attack damage) bonus physical damage for each Chakram equipped
on patch rundown, mort said it was supposed to be really small, from reading the skill it did indeed look small but i'm illiterate
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like it was mostly as, no? which mostly impact ad but some ap like azir
did they nerf a lot of ad?
that sounds pretty insane tho
i haven't seen any pbe gameplay, so i can't really have a good idea of how big it is since it's not a numbers diff
holy <a:Monka:465018118608125953>
force her to be a normal valk
i wonder how big the nerf actually is
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
kled reroll <:wokejj:1118547247567745164>
range + healing + damage/utilty, thoughts?
but more like
rfc + hoj/bt + eon/qss/ie/gs
okay this is my cook of BiS belveth:
rfc + hoj + eon
maybe more like, enjoying himself rather than have a lot of fun
yeah, i've been kinda thinking that, he seem like he's genuinely having a lot of fun even when avg 4.8 on stream
big bro is the only tft streamer i've watched that actually run back to accept queue <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
not really p2w until you pass the 200 dollar/month mark
true though
i think rfc is stacked on her
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
well, when i say that more like it's not close to BiS, not that from his spot he could do much better <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
okay so, that belveth build is just turbo troll right?
<:HandsUp:465017146955661312>
<:wokejj:1118547247567745164>
void 10?
okay
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
wait what did he send on global before deafen?
might aswell be 3 pris lobby for fun
2 people have gifts + long distance, what even
wtf is this lobby <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i'm kinda moving over, i really want belveth to be good
i saw leduck video about belveth
yeah honestly
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
big bro is in fucking tft samsara
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
snatching defeat from the jaws of victory
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
my guy is getting sued for false advertisement on stream title
is that what his vacation was?
but holy <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i played that game for a bit and it can sink money fast
that doesn't surprise me that much actually
jesus christ
<:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
like whale on it?
wait big bro actually competitively play cookie game?
<a:DonkWalk:926406712209068042>
also wasn't it setsy?
isn't the same thing with lotteries? though maybe for different reason
that sounds about right
job expense
you can probably write it off your taxes too
you're right
you know what
:diesofdevil:
if i already have one, i wouldn't be able to convince myself to buy another for 200 dollars when i can only use one
personally i could only justify buying one chibi
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
they should paypal me first, we need some test runs to get accurate numbers
<a:PU_pepeHmmMath:850331115637833728>
do you have dudu?
100 pull on gear is kinda pessimistic, and then you have w/e you farm on 6.7 for elf
200 pull from nothing is 86% of 2s
i think you avg out at least s3, possibly 2s
from my calc tho
oh i misread that
doesn't matter too much for a player like you tho, since all you want to afford is the most seele possible
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
you could end up skipping stuff you can realistically afford
making calc based on max pessimistic is kinda troll for a gacha with so many bad luck mitigation like honkai has
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and then when they sent vid, they got the first by soft pity and hadn't reach soft pity yet for the second
i remember the one time alice swear he was at 178 without guarantee valk in gsr
i mean guarantee is way to pessimist tho
idk elf cost
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
owo math 85100 / 280
how many pulls is that?
like these mini spending for me is always trash cause i have all gear but i still recognise the value for avg player
you can say it's worse for you cause the gear this time is stuff you already have or w/e
it is just better tho, more option can't be worse
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
so it's better
6.0 didn't have elf tho
moriso didn't make a 6.0 spending graphic
yeah they just increase cap from mini spending, it's w/e
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i didn't check that much back
with elf
this is the first mini spending
actually no
and also it won't change anything in my life if i have it or not
but i don't wanna play the game
i want the danzai mei skin
oh ok
tet do you wanna do it on my acc?
wait shit is the event hard?
i can go find it
that one didn't have elf
i'm stupid
.,, 66spending
this isn't a big spending, the one where you can unlock elf as f2p is cny/cn anniv
when was the last mini spending again?
all they change is increase purchase cap, tho i guess it gives a pretty shitty feeling that you can't buy out without buying bundle
eh i don't mind it too bad, like in previous mini event they just had a lower purchase cap <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i have like pages of spreadsheet for bp math and i still get it wrong
also yeah 2s from 0 from bp sounded wrong but i suck at bp math
genuinely missed you a lot <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
eli is like a peaceful presence in this chat
<a:TheVoices:1116001413370228877>
aw hell yea, congrats!
hidden base vacation
<:crying:757445037402619974>
eli i missed you so much
wait what the fuck
lowkey if you ain't an MA player, you just grab 2s 0/4 for eventual dorm bonus <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i mean who cares about gear
bp math is very confusing to me
that's pretty stacked actually
some whore gameplay with whore GC hare, completely alien to me
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i haven't played any of those valk
and i look at the team and i'm like
more and more i see new patch valk gameplay
the game from my pov is kinda sad
i think
so full season is
20/56/64
5/14/16
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
can you 2s from nothing?
the s0 mobius will do some work, trust
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:o7:1099354934320840765>
idk if there's too many people who actually play the good ornn item in plat but better to be safe
actually so cringe
i'll start to do that <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
watching this just makes me want to 20/20 qss on carry <a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206>
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
balanced game
just complain about exodia and mort himself hand you one to quiet you down
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
is it even possible to balance it this set?
put his kayle to fucking sleep
the one kayle game he had made me truly realise how fucking stupid eternal winter really is
that irelia 1 lives infinite
maybe i'll do them
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
from hitting eternal winter
i've never seen someone so happy
are you watching big bro stream?
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
meanwhile i get fucking targon +1
i keep hearing about those busted augment
share the luck?
oh ok, even if he is it's still a ton of effort, i'm glad he's getting paid tho
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<:PeepoSitFishing:1058108500775018596>
<@309634550273933314> 
i thought you were going to post ,.. rolling or something like that
<a:Essayge:1084932331766304829>
tet is writing a dissertation rn
i just get completely lost and can't really cap that
but when shit gets a little too wacky, being able to cap board way higher with shit like 3 pri, or a portal like +2 team slot
i feel like i can play pretty well on avg game
right now i'm way more scared of pri lobby
what the fuck
<a:HUHH:999402772866805770>
and then before i clicked for the third time, i stop to think about it, i don't think i like it too much, at least current form
yeah i clicked once or twice and got p mid stuff
they're changing it for a ornn anvil next patch, in my view that's an insane buff, but idk how good ornn item will be in general
do you care for ornn prism on 2-1?
<a:peepoGamba:1090947609130184734>
get the good ornn item, get the good zaun mod
i'm starting to kinda understand more and more all the like, tons of small ways this patch is giga casino
i believe it, it's crazy
oh ok <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
were people undervaluing it?
cause it sounds insane, it reads insane
and that really caught me by surprise
and mort said virulent is hidden op, we're nerfing it a bit
i watched the patch rundown
blue box is soooooooo good right now, i'm loving it
it was so fucking funny to me <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
not only does the house have a creepy room that's hidden and at the end of a corridor, it also happens to be of the estranged brother
also, the fact that the house had a Whole Fucking Room that was just conveniently sota's
i kinda like the angle, retroactively a little weird but maybe understandable that sota somehow was able to fake being the family dad
okay i read the most recent chapter
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
can i check which zaun implant are good and on who?
thank fuck
does mort get paid for this? kinda insane
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
patch rundown is 1 hour long
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
otherwise i'm pretty happy with the state of it
i turbo dislike piltover balance rn
i'm surprised the champ are this well balanced tho
i just gotta be better at losing
okay i see
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it's a temporary problem but i swear some people man
it's so hard to open fort at my rank tho
yeah that's what i did last time
what do you even transition to with piltover opener?
some games i don't even scout, i just feel it in my bones i gotta
which i can't really beat with my normal ass comps
20% of the time someone just hits some insane stuff cause the lobby tempo is way too low
i'm glad i still have a lot to learn, or else i'd be offing myself rn
at low-high gold
these game quality are so fucking bad tho
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> your laugh is really nice though
it's an issue of idfk what's going on
i mean i don't think it's an issue of not reading
i'm feeling happier with the set now, i only really started to play yesterday
i'm climbing <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
idk wtf is going on
i'm so fucking lost on ichinose tho
<:peepoAvenger:756228412435333250>
i should read more
wtf
wait gunner is fucking insane
yeah i'm still learning
ooo i see <a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
i know someone who only does single on all their gacha
doesn't really matter, no?
you wanna know the lore?
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
league run on potato
i don't think so
come to tft <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
<:Truege:1114141621022375997>
true
it's pretty efficient
and there's like 8 valk who run mei set, so you double up as farm for them
so you run 2pc of that on shenhe
but the yoi set is +atk
on shenhe
oh i don't think you'd run that either
aren't you supposed to spend the rest of your life there?
the one that has the ER set and the yoi set
probably just the one domain from inazuma
<a:GIGACHAD:928604216988147713>
not as much as garen tho
isn't she ap and ad? she uses a lot of the stats i thought
wait really? i thought it would be kinda stacked for her
:ratjamming:
ooooh ok, that makes sense too
twitch ain't there
i keep thinking about a rat champ <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh j4?
who the fuck is jerry
yeah i didn't know visage was this bad
<:Truege:1114141621022375997>
oh <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
ekko 3 kat 3
idk if i could beat it at all
1st was giga highroll assassins though
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
yeah i should've just picked that
than force 4pc with some shitty artifacts
so 99% of the time i'd rather run 2 2pc that have okay effect and the artis are stacked
some set like vv has a turbo broken 4pc, but most aren't that big
i'm a strong believer that if you're not a 2 year old player minmax artifact, paying attention to 4pc effect is bait for most set
oh i was thinking about what happen with a carry like lux, that's stupid <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
eternal winter wasn't turbo broken even on kaisa patch
i'm like, thinking back to 8.5
why is it even that bad rn, all damage dealer being high attack speed?
having to build qss on backline is kinda cringe <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
insta first
<:life:1001518241610485781>
imagine if that visage was eternal winter man
i had sunfire vow visage on j4
yeah i just need to not be a pussy and read the stats in the middle of the game to figure out what to pick
yeah that's fucked up, i didn't know that
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
now that i actually read it, it looks like worse warmog
oh for some reason i thought of it as better warmog
idk why it sucks so bad right now
8.5 i felt visage was pretty alright
my itemisation kinda blow, i end up picking visage cause i felt like i was missing tank, i should've checked the stats first tho
i should've just done that tho
zhonya look pretty meh on stats for azir
oh
should've ffd there and then
2-1 ornn anvil gave me deathfire zhonya visage
i found a way to cope that it wasn't my fault i lost
wait nvm
all uncontested
it was my fault tho, if i play better i save more hp and can go j4 3 lux 3 azir 3
meanwhile i go 3rd cause the other 2 spike to hell
they fucking take it and go 5th for fun
i was the only one even running j4
someone took strat j4 on carousel for fucking fun
man i'm so fucking tilted
hekicore
i think aster brought it here, ask them
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
hopefully
also, cny elf is going to be ice
is there anything else you want there?
yeah idk what the usual price is
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
3* elf is about same cost as s-rank valk card
yeah
so relatable
that's my avg too <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<:HandsUp:465017146955661312>
the good streamer is the one that hydra his own chat
yeah
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i don't get the appeal
do you really?
some of his gta rp was pretty funny
i've seen some pretty good clips too
yeah i believe it tho, to get that big you kinda have to to some degree
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i actually can't understand x
i know it's an acquired dialect but
i never really watched those really big streamer
the ow one?
it wouldn't surprise me if it was that direct
like i'm already 100% sure they're heavily banked by that company to some degree
i mean i'd believe that
oh ok
like i have no clue how a streamer is able to afford that without shady shit behind it
isn't it like made by train? does he actually have that much money?
i agree it was a good move, i just don't know how the fuck they can afford it
that checks out
i think they hate women
ain't the entire userbase there incels?
like ain't no way they ain't got some shady gambling deals to afford 100m
it's adin ross home
yeah but twitch is in the red
and they definitely ain't from twitch
cause they probably profit from kick
they probably would prefer if twitch died and kick took over
so to a degree, it doesn't even matter to amazon
for the actual streaming part, they use amazon services, yeah
apparently it's even built based on twitch code leak
i like twitch having competition and then literally everything else about it is so so shady
yeah kick sets off turbo red flags to me
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
even the nice ones, it's probably hell
i think i'd rather die before living with any streamer
well i'm more talking about like watching them
from there, i like asmongold and soda, and emiru is funny whenever i see her but i don't know too much about her
otk gives me bad vibes tho
oh ok, i tried looking it up but all that shows up is the wikipedia article and they don't clarify it
also no matter what happen i can't bring myself to like tectone
i guess you do have to have a few screws loose to even be in a place like that tho
actually some are probably pretty chill
i mean that's all streamer house tho no?
i thought so
i thought otk was a streamer house tho
i mean yeah who would be, that's a disaster <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and also the other guys there that i don't recognise
poor emiru man
oh my god they live together?
pbe change tho, not confirmed to go live
maybe good enough?
they buff orianna, nerf ekko, nerf thex
are they gutting piltover yet? i hate it
i meant that one in specific tho, i didn't see the other nerf
that sounds pretty impactful actually <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<@180679257851166721> isn't that barely even a nerf?
hi tai
i'll leave you to tet/cherry/tai hands
and no third member ?
what do you mean that's it
what are you even running right now?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
you can prob just pick it based on whether or not there's shield
or something else M on non shield boss
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
you'll prob run like glut t paga m newt b
idk if that helps
you can probably pick the hot one
i have no clue bestie, my mind is blank when the investment level is bare minimum
i really want ultramad to use outside of nqn
both no gear?
isn't her banner not even around anymore ?
yeah wtf do you even mean invest on her
btw tet, what's 27-14?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
some people are also baiting people to say low numbers and then editing their message to be how old are you to get them banned
discord is apparently banning acc from underage kid
there was a period of my life where i played toontown competitively
are they wrong tho ?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123> what's even the context
making justice to your name i see
doom and rimestar are good too
<:life:1001518241610485781>
pretty cool boss in gear option
there's a strat where you run shakes adrift TM on BB
yeah ignite or bleed is the dxy tech
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
yeah sure sure
you're talking like dr seuss book?
it's on discount
try this <:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
am i supposed to get back to you about something?
i feel like i left you on read about something
tet
what's wrong with people
tft chat is fucking insane man
like i'm not making shit up, i watch a lot of random game stream
it's so fucking bad, right?
yeah 3rd is kinda nut in that spot, but i also would just not bother roll for lux3 at all and just go all in for the upgrade that were left, like j4 2
i guess there's literally nothing else for him to do
also, going for lux3 at 7 is giga cope no
i'd get banned so fast
man i couldn't be a streamer
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
yeah that sounds awful
back in my days, PE without HoS wasn't even thinkable really
oh wait idk that, that's with GC i assume?
cause it'd be for fun
but i never managed to convince myself to actually bald it
i've tried it a bit before
good times <:Life:1089579344508223558>
oh i remember malding that HoF dxy strat
that's so fucking funny
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
in the wild
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
it looks interesting <a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
retire on the spot
when gresham says it's joever it's joever
i've balded some abyss but only when i have nothing else to do in MA <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
i would rather die than bald abyss over MA
my guy isn't happy with only 100m dollars
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh okay <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
isn't eli gay?
abusing the mechanic by not interacting with it
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
abuse poro sounds so weird
MPE patch was waaaaay too cheap
that's true
s0 MPE wasn't better than 3s FT
if you weren't around back then, it was also an issue with MPE release
3s valk that costs less than standard s0
lowkey, MPE feels like a blunder from mihoyo
and the only way that will change is if they do another dps wt valk or in a few year when s0 current valk can beat 3s of that gen
for a while still, MPE will still be the best value valk possible
but it's just way too insane to beat 3s MPE at s0
of course whore will have her boss where she'll top score
and powercreep isn't that rough that 3s valk of that gen is being beat by s0 of current gen
3s MPE was like, about the powerlevel of other 3s valk from her gen
yeah, like MPE is wt valk but she was avg s0 powerlevel from her gen
as general dps? s0 whore compete with 3s mpe is a hard sell
and that's it
will make those tweet 5x more promoted
setting it as slur in the system
my guess is that
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
<:lewd:959737567119556618>
those first 2 line are kinda lewd carv
LMFAO that sticker
3rd artbook and after i'll prob not care tho
since like half of it is still stuff i care about
btw im going for 2nd artbook
it is for me
whore makes her ult deal so much more damage
even s0 gonna do some work
lowkey PE revival
yeah whore gives like double team sp than HoS
what the fuck man <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
they do their 5th try and go all in a hard day of work
cause it always comes from the people who play 20 min per abyss
this take is always funny
the only one left could be a better description
the best GK player is a title that's heavily dependant on when they received it
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
and then i'll stick with poro
so i can learn itemisation
i think i'm using tf for a while
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
how bad is the meta rn?
but idk if it works like that
so ideally i want a really simple way to check if they're actually the same
and that would take way too long on like 50k+ files
there's a bunch of ways to compare image to see if they're similar enough, but those are probably compute intensive
to easily check what was added/changed every patch
right now i'm researching a way on how to easily figure compare all files from the datamine
turbo chillin even
i'm chillin
how's it goin
hi lumi
<a:SCHIZO:1042907357249802310>
idk why it reminds me of gsr then
oh wait no it doesn't
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
dps seele ult looks a lot like gsr seele ult
unironically tho maybe
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
sheeeeeeeesh
<a:streaming:1114109761076596816>
streamer
sykkuno for crack addict
is jerma like
<:lewd:959737567119556618>
aster in my mind is like a prosekai lady i think
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
they have names
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
whoa
<a:ShakingWoke:759859272820719617>
oh i forgot what i have that emote as
it's so nice to be doing something i actually want to do
it's way less soulless than my college projects <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
thank you, i'm having fun though
file by file
or at least if it takes that much, at least i don't have to do it myself
so it doesn't take 3-4 hour every patch
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
right now i'm trying to figure out how to extract in a more efficient way
i'm doing underground asset trading
check <#1041761709410484334> later
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> sheeeesh
<:BASED:831957239798956062>
what about you?
i'm feeling so nice
and relax
i can focus on my own projects
so i don't have anxiety over the last few projects
college semester finally's done
i'm actually doing so well right now
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
i was so hype for a sec
oh i read my own name and went oh shit another paw patrol?
hi chrom
oh is it that good? gimme a sec
<:peepoAvenger:756228412435333250>
i do really enjoy it when it's done well
i just finished catching up with one which has a similar trope
oh that sounds really nice
really mad lost my arm
LMFAO
i can share over there
i'm having fun rn
check <#1041761709410484334>
if you're interested in datamining
that's wild
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i'm on a 1v1 lobby
????? what the fuck
yeah kinda niche
goes on to list the only valk that won't use her
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
oh ok
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
on tactics.tools
ruby what does adj. place mean
the bugs start showing up again
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
HoT is unending
LMFAO ain't no way
about how i want to look
oh i wanted to show a friend
for study purpose
<@309634550273933314> can you show me your discord theme?
through and through <:life:1001518241610485781>
or is she going to be a 2023 valk?
is hua 2023 gonna be a throwback to what being a hua used to mean?
i can't even stay awake that long
???? jesus fuck
<a:Wave:995380866832420994>
what the hell
it's literally ai generated cooking
i am going to explode
i do prefer it not like that
and only vertical void is stupid
but maybe i was just turbo baited
like vertical demacia, vertical noxus, vertical shurima
i expected all comp to be like vertical origin
weird
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282> i see
also who the fuck is jerry
like teemo or velkoz
and if you don't hit guinsoo, you play something ap
i thought azir was one of the ones that turbo need it too
what unless you play azir?
sounds good on akshan
or akshan
that attacks furthest unit
does it work on shit like that one synergy
<:Wokege:862486121933701141>
rfc rfc sniper focus?
oh shit
idk what they do yet
that's a new one right?
what the fuck
i'm probably sticking with tf for a long while, just force myself to learn how to itemise properly
are ornn item broken?
you mentioned it earlier, is that true tho?
it's like from a pretty balanced set to the most degen shit there is <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i'll start playing tomorrow or the day after
man i'm like going to experience complete polar opposite
<:peepoDumb:756789041164320850>
then their standards would've gotten a lot lower and they would've be fine staying here a lil longer
they should've returned to wfp
are they coming back to talk about 6.8 valk reveal?
anyone talk with them?
i miss eli
the terf? that did harry potter?
i guess that's the way to do it though
???? wild
what the fuck
there's SO many aug that avg fucking 7
from what i remember, it's only winrate right? not avg placement <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh ok
gacha in game, gacha outside of game <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
will we still be able to see avg placement?
is it not up yet?
so like what happened to the stats ban?
i think i cut myself on the edge
do you have a bandaid?
but i thrive when the meta is degen
i can't yet cause i need to finish college semester
this does make me wanna play tho
i guess it's expected when they release like 200 new augment
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
but my god
though i guess it did get nerfed
lowkey that's lower than i expected
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah i guess it doesn't matter when's BR since i'm NA player now
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
go 11
march of progress -> hedge fund
???? what even
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
march of progress
wait isn't it insane op?
i'm not reading all that though
good job
oh the void nerf is so smart
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
i'm moving to EU
so if i hardstuck gold i can say that i'm not worse, BR was just for fun server <:OkaygeBusiness:889594869583060993>
i'm also pivot into NA for set 9
i left 8.5 on a harsh losestreak, idk if i was always this bad or only now i know enough to realise i suck balls
idk if it is <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
i feel like so much of my knowledge is strictly tied to 8.5 shit
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
lowkey tho i'm sacred of being hardstuck silver for a patch in set 9
what's wrong with 8.5
than pilot another honkai acc <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
there's better shit to do when you're bored
sure
truly the streamer of the people
<:HandsUp:465017146955661312>
i saw that LMFAO
i never pulled on those <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
o that's right
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
so like 2/3rds of a patch income
do you?
ain't no way you get 20k xtal per patch as f2p
<a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206>
i'll take worst case scenario
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
:wokejj:
what's the eta on set 9?
when i pick a shit one, at least i can cope myself into thinking that it doesn't even matter anyways
i kinda like silver tho
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
sss ain't a thing anymore
i think it changed from the last one i saw
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
i'm sure there'll be a meta where he becomes good though, eventually
<:life:1001518241610485781>
for now i'll miss a non-dogshit warwick
so true bestie
what a way to say i didn't read
from like spending or bp
you'll 4/4 her soon enough
i don't think it's ever IO there
i was just joking
<:o7:1099354934320840765>
for good time sakes
you should run the classic IO PV AE
IO?
i'm so sorry
damn
no SpA? END?
stockholm syndrome
<:o7:1099354934320840765> will unironically miss it
what boss is it
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
he rolled nasus early and played who let the dogs out
he got 3 tears and he started playing this

toast stream is pretty funny, he does music like a bad hero movie
i don't have it either
:peepobrazil:
idk if i'm just bad with dates, but last patch felt like it was 12h late
i think in BR it takes a fuckton more for fun
<a:ShyBlush:741636455289323521>
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
coming 6.8
the best you can do is pull on release for the next broken release
no use fretting over the past
99% chance she'll be there
if you really want a PE, just get her on the next bp cycle
i'm not sure, as far as abyss is concerned <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but if you have higher rank trio, you might use them over PE
if you have like everyone else at s0, i think PE still has a place in the meta at s0 still
if you have an s0 would you use it in any situation? it depends on your other options <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
what kinda answer do you want? if s0 is worth pulling rn? no
i tried it back then, my HoH is s0
oh yeah i don't have the damage for that strat, it's old tho
dunno if there's new strat for it
the last second was 9s only
back in my days
is the HoH JK RC strat too different from the HoH RC SW one? i did that before and capped
or the actual rotation is complicated
either the valks are unorthodox
share if there's any cool kasumi ref
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and that made me want to end it all
i think one time i ran the same event in genshin for 3 friends
and then mine next
L
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
it's supposed to work
discord is so weird about updates
doesn't work yet
[test]()
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
i don't judge
i thought you 2 just started a transaction there
oh that's about the diavoros hypothetical
heki did that to me but with a furry porn server
or is it haven material
is your feet kinky
you have to look at yourself and ask
well i mean
homestuck ass name
friendly hypothermia
i'm there
it's not even for yourself???
wait so are you building the gazebo with onlyfans money?
really?
is his name crystal
cause it has furries in it
i would play arknights
arknights?
wait what game is it?
or sad that i quit
would you be happy that i joined
tet if i join and then quit
by who
is that an ad?
you're really method acting by having that high contrast discord
so true grandma
that's a compliment
i love it tet
you talk like looking awful isn't the point
that's cute
my sis got it
i'm nitro and i don't have it
but you gotta have to be selected by hand of god to have it i guess
supposed to be under profile
for some reason
but mine no
my sister's discord has it
oh i don't see it
i think i misgendered you but you also removed your pronouns from your bio <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
weren't you they/them lumi?
wait
<a:HECOOKING:1089227410899214428>
she wants to fry
i don't have the new gloves
or this with sns
this is what i used to run i think
even at my highest whale amount i couldn't afford more ranks over 2s
but not that much
like i was a whale
chill
she's 2s0
what
ew
don't you have my credentials
idk
that boss is a mystery to me
i'll like send you money or some shit
and teach me
figure out how to get near cap on FGO
lumi if you
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
nah no amount of cool gear usage will make me log in if the ref look like that
oh i guess that's neat actually
if the HoT looks cooler i'll do it though
idk it's turbo zzzzz
or some shit like that
i assume she apply stig from off field because of eop pri
that it sounds
it's a lot more boring
idk
and idk how fun it is, it just sounds weird
there's like an HoT one i think but i don't have a ref for it
yeah i can't do that one
i'll do it
if you have any though
i didn't find any ref that looked interesting
but ty
no
she's lv70
no prom though
yeah the tries are unused, you can do one (1) MA boss
sinful? i guess i can do one MA boss
where are you even using her
but like
feel free
me next?
SR?
who the fuck is that on the right?
sold
at least???
do none of you save the emotes
you can't doomscroll discord
discord is different though
i guess discord
4chan if you're a nazi, reddit if you're an incel, tumblr if you're from the letter gang
it's like what
like there's not many places to even pivot to from twitter
it's having a renaissance since people are leaving twitter
just pivot into tumblr nini
like 4chan
smaller social media with no moderation just become nazi den <:okk:1058108494995263539>
and most of them are even worse
i think there are a bunch of alternative tho, they're not nearly as big
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153> doxxed tet rn
which country are you from again?
<:OkaygeBusiness:889594869583060993>
it is free speech, just some people get freer speech than others
giving us straight up US prices is just completely unaffordable
discord does different pricing on different country, it's actually kinda affordable in brazil <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
kinda smart
elon musk selling a year of subscription when twitter isn't lasting another year
true <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
it's so expensive <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
to buy a year of twitter blue here
as much as it costs to buy a month of groceries
man i checked it out, it costs like
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
you can already guess
and the type of people who buy blue checkmark
every blue checkmark response gets sent to the top <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i herefore proclaim you no balls
do it or no balls
i think you get part of the xp mats back and that's it <:okk:1058108494995263539>
and it'll tell you what you would receive
you can also go on salvage screen, select the weapon
no
yeah that's insane
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
yeah?
i don't even think it's worth it to bother to bald that
sounds awful
SNS at 2s and no weapon
i think GC will be better though, for you, with less bald
so you can just try two <:okk:1058108494995263539>
for triple support
it's like HoS SI + 1
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i think you don't have that many choices
is there a copypasta for denying that i can send
wait is there
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722> i'm being messaged by randos to sell my username
just disable the game for people with high ping
that's a fucky bug
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> only at high ping?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
is there too many bugs? the one game i played i was like relieved that the game wasn't in disarray like it is in live right now
the stats part shouldn't be too hard tho, just how to communicate with api/save the data
i can try to figure out how to do stats <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
and tactic.tool goes away
i can tell you tho if they don't change what info you can get from the api
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but <:Shrug:616394597211439118> maybe if it's paid he changes his mind
so it's wasted dev time just to give player something they already have
cause 3rd party site already does it better
like he's also said they don't care to improve match history
i don't think it is going to happen either, but that's the only reason i can think he'd crack down on stats
if it is going to happen
probably not ingame though
yeah that's what i'm thinking
or riot is planning to make an official, maybe paid, way to look into stats, and they don't want competition <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i've noticed that with meta tft app, my decision making is affected by seeing the winrate of augments
either he thinks some amount of people are over reliant on stats, to a point where they aren't improving because of it
i haven't watched much of him, but from that decision i could ever only assume 2 thing
they're prob just gonna nuke the big sites and then a ton of small ones will come up
that ain't gonna work
like if all they're doing is keep giving us the same data and only telling us you cannot do this though
i don't know how far they can even enforce it
i mean to me it's not even that
such a weird decision
yeah
oh okay
?????? okay
which
we're just not allowed to share it
it sounds like they don't plan on limiting the data we can have access
also yeah the wording is turbo weird
avp?
what the fuck why
??????
i don't think i'm good enough to play aimlessly and come up with interesting comp
i was able to play one game but at this point i think i'd rather just wait <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
can't wait until it's live so i can grind it out <:okk:1058108494995263539>
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
wasn't it turbo fast in 8.5 already? is it even faster?
there's something magical about <:jaxdd:1112053304474738799>
true
8.5 ww that is, 9 ww as far as i know sucks balls
jaxdd-lite
in that case isn't like, ww jax-like?
oh okay
really? what even is your definition of a <:jaxdd:1112053304474738799>
me next?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but no, the guy just shows up 45 minutes later with the pic
was rewatching it, first time i thought okay the discussion took 45 mins
the funniest part to me
<@309634550273933314> 
it's like this is what someone would draw if they drew eevee from memory
not even like this looks like it could be a pokemon
a lot of the designs are like basically pokemon
have you guys seen this yet
<:okk:1058108494995263539> good luck, i'll try
but then my client is just turbo bug, can't even click to find match
if i try right now, it's 10m queue
if i try earlier in the day, i get 500k queue
yeah i can try it, around this time i can actually log in for some reason
oh wait what
i reinstalled it and it's worse now
wednesday i play <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i give up
no
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i think i'll play a bunch of tf tho, so i can learn items
anime?
what show
okay am reinstalling
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
LMFAO
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
it just doesn't work for me
i'll try again
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
i didn't make it earlier
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> just casino again?

mlm hare business
i didn't know this was that type of club
oh okay
marrying
isn't that like
eloping?
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
given that we're at an impasse, we should discuss it further and make no action to remove me for now
me and cherry think i should stay, you and tet think i shouldn't
it's 2-2 right now
i agree
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
i stay
misgendered, your argument is invalid
surely no one would overturn cherry's decision <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
i love being with my friends <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
<:lfgCatgirlEdition:803114454187114506>
i read that as /generator
tone indicators don't work on me
i just like being a part of stuff
can i join the club even though i think she's pretty mid?
budakitpest
budacatpest?
and 6.8
oh ok
that's like, part of the problem
i'm pretty sure heki is pretty confident on her choices
not a reason for you to be not like heki
that's
and now i'm in queue samsara
yesterday i got in eventually, but client was turbo bugged, didn't end up getting into a game
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
hare making so many hekis around us
i thought that was celestia
i had penne today actually
<:pennehands:886690313937256488>
and i still lost them even though i didn't leave it for the last hour cause i just suck <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
was like one digit
and the amount of tie that actually mattered in the one year i played
i was like a t20 player
there's not even a reason to rush it
if you're not a t1 player
honestly
playing honkai as intended
<:o7:1099354934320840765>
yeah yeah move the blame forwards
what the fuck is this
don't gaslight me
the fuck you talking about tet?
what?
did they change it for fun?
couldn't you just choose EU server like ingame? from NA
since when?
wait is it?
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>

<:life:1001518241610485781>
i miss rain, it's so rare over here nowadays
rain is nice
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
are y'all like fine? lowkey i think wearing masks is the right move
and i went i guess it's the us but why
my mind auto assume letter-number is guns
oh wait that's a mask right
wonder how long until it gets here
i won't make a mexico joke
scary
that's
wait how bad is it?
thank you riot i like the new background art do i get to play yet
and i don't really like that
cause of ER
is that they have to feel good on field
one of the core design point of every valk nowadays
i mean every valk nowadays is if you wanna cope enough
like, similar to how HRT had space to do stuff, she just didn't, cause she replace AE
so they have more leeway
well seele is replacing HoS
99% chance running turg and qte in leave being better
yeah, even if they try to make her interesting
kinda cope
early on it happened pretty often where the moment i finish farming the budget option i roll on the gacha version <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and then farmed 3s VA same week i got HoT
farmed PX like same week i got AE
i actually
i'm too much of a meta player for that to work on me
i wish i had a reason to play the others tho
unfortunately i've only played AE as far as hua suit goes
that makes people want to play the game the least and think that's the most fun
what's the brainrot that mihoyo is setting in with new content
yeah i don't get it
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i'm not allowed to play
nevermind <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
what's the game queue looking like?
i think pbe queue cleared out
<@180679257851166721> i'm in <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
oh shit
i think i'm pretty shit at it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> maybe it'll be time for me to work on being better about items
let me in
<a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
all i got was one shitty game for set 9 during all of pbe
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i'm not really mad tho just bummed out, i wanna play more <:life:1001518241610485781>
and i also suck balls <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
not when i'm on a countdown for all the knowledge to become useless
i know too few comp, and i don't have it in me to learn more
i wanna play but i hate 8.5 right now
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
man
what did you expect?
i mean it's neko
oh hey, i managed to get @/keilo
2 useless 4 cost, 1 useless 5 cost
aint no fucking way
LMFAO <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
we can leave on loading and come back by start of 1-2 and not even miss anything
oh hey we have a ton of afk time now at the start of match
there was just an afk who was near it and it lucked out on them
but no one pick it on purpose
my one game in pbe that i got in was that portal
so cringe, especially in pbe
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and 4 people insta ff
where someone pick stillwater
i saw a game on reddit
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
idk if it counter what i'm playing but jhin feels SO strong for no reason
i'm gonna go from one unbalanced set to another
<:clueless:973756617109676032> surely it was a mistake
revert? it was like this before?
and also compares to the better gamemode
that's like way more accurate
it's t2%
actually
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
promoting in RL
it'd be like
if it was honkai
diamond 2
everwhere around me all i see is d2
d2 is where i live
d2 is my home
i think i'm on my rightful rank
this <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> close
it was almost a 7th tho
it was an 8th tho
oh i didn't lose that much lp
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
i'll play for a 7th
can't even ff
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
game didn't load and i missed on stage 1
now i'm tilted
it's also not all 90
<:smoothbrain:1114520186280751175>
pussy piercing
it was partly my fault tho, i knew there was a draven player but from all the scouting it didn't click that they were rolling for jax too, no one had brawler trait active so i just went free <:okk:1058108494995263539> 
5th ain't that bad but ffs
fucking mecha draven hit jax 3 for fun to feed his draven <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
by a fucking mecha draven
i am contested
fuck this game
i just need my renekton back
it's in the bag
oh i got brawler spat <:okk:1058108494995263539>
of course i'm gonna hit, i'm not contested <:clueless:973756617109676032>
set's gonna end and i'm not gonna know the crafting recipes for spats <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
brawler spat isn't craftable right?
okay am hopeful <:okk:1058108494995263539>
which brawler do i drop? renekton yeah?
okay looking fine
oh nvm i got 2 rod but it's probably just gb guinsoo
dcap?
what's the team? 6 brawler?
sword glove bow
though i think these are okay jaxdd item
sounds good i can do laser
i let the timer run out and it picked that for me
<:OkaygeBusiness:889594869583060993>
what do i do with boxing lessons
uhh i fucked up ruby
did you just skip all the context so you could ask me what the context was
what
tet what the fuck did you mean by this
thank you
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
can i get some praise for being a good tft player
you don't have to be so mean heki
<:crying:757445037402619974>
okay fine i just got lucky
actually playing 2 aug down, i didn't even proc last stand <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
maybe the lobby was for fun actually, or maybe i got lucky on the mf3, tho i wasn't really contested and i did purposefully go for it
chat is there for a reason though
i usually don't even bother with chat, all i ever see people do is complain
oh okay i'll do that then
LMFAO
554 hero aug don't even impact me
i'm just better man
no guarantee i ever hit something good
there's like
especially 2-1 aug
yeah that's what i worry about
yasuo was the first thing i saw and i was like sounds good
yeah i was definitely not forcing, if anything i'm forcing too little
hmm i see
do i just give up on it?
isn't it an issue tho? like if 3 people have lasercorp augment, and i'm the 4th, there's only so many lines i can run with yasuo carry
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i reeeeeally need to scout augment on 2-1
earlier on the day i had a game with 5 people playing infiniteam, and i was one of them
i'm only this mad cause i know it's my fault i guess
yeah i guess
i need to work on mental <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that fucking tilted me to bed
i didn't even go 8th, it was like a 6th which honestly in that position is pretty okay but
and then i hit the least out of all 4 <a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
i insta pick yasuo carry, scout later 2 other yasuo + 1 ashe
man yesterday tilt me so hard
guess i'm going back to 8.5
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
the game forced me to do the match 3 tutorial
103851295
i guess i can
wdym
<:Wokege:862486121933701141>
and now you have 3 gacha days
aw sheeeeeeesh i'm so glad it went fine!
stuck in 8.5 samsara
i mean 3 weeks <:okk:1058108494995263539>
lmao
i have the 11 hour queue
so like, retry a few time and only wait if the queue is low?
1 year later there's no pulling
like right now? i gotta tell you bud, it doesn't matter who the valk is
also yeah she looks so sad
i don't wanna go back to set 8.5
can we play pbe yet ruby <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
you can't
and if they scatter in the wrong way
in MA you need to dodge it
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
and you deal no damage
for fun
he can just choose to jump away
jump on p2
i don't actually think it's rng tho, it's just micro positioning bs
and tornados in MA ver
his jumps
but it's not like it was all great even with the shill valk
going way back to like DA, we always had boss that felt awful to play without the shill valk
PE was alright at the start but as dist grow, playing s0 you had to start to run weird gear to meet dps threshold
SW on release was awful, all her bosses had terrible mobbing rng
wolf was always turbo bad, rng fest
going way back, some new boss felt like shit even with the shill valk
i think you're just misremembering it
idk
isn't that how all shill has been
<:Shrug:616394597211439118>
kosma is the only one i can think of that could actually make a difference
it's not the giga gamechanger you think it is
10 points at most
an extra collapse on couatl would save like
getting near cap
for a player who's like
then they'll release boss that need 2 collapse
if they release a team with 2 collapse
and couatl
there's whale too
largely speaking, most qua boss are balanced around having one collapse
kosma is one that i think it can be pretty nice though
on most boss, having more not really
the first one yeah
do you think you have
how many collapse exactly
so if you're running HoH RC HB with gaming mouse on HB
okay
like on what team? HoH team?
?
on most boss
how big double collapse is
waaaaaay overestimating
you're like
i'm go take a nap fuck this
just bleed to death
4 pairs roll 20 gold and hit nothing
okay this game turbo tilt me
i lowkey hate it <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
do you ever slam zephyr
lmk when we can play pbe <:okk:1058108494995263539>
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
bis
fuck i'm stupid
tear rod cloak belt, do you slam anything? infiniteam
it's been so long since i last made my own modpack
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
maybe try installing a few mods at a time
nerd
or did it stop working once you added a few more?
did you install all mod at once
oh <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> it might be some issue with compatibility then
are you doing enough ram?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
which mods?
i think it's something something issue with render
sorry no idea <a:AA_Gab_Bow:914213000594980964>
can you send the whole log?
20 is funny
i saw 5 on reddit
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
and i'm 80lp, so this game i might become the third <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
oh the two d1 player are here again
skill diff
thex gets baron head as a trophy if it kills it
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
there's like 100, my game had 2 d1 player and they're the only d1 players right now
kinda weird how the server is, there's so little diamond player
if it's db i'll accept
which
<a:Blushiekissy:795363746339356702>
so i just rolled with it
but then i got yasuo 3
and i was planning on moving it to ww once i hit
to save hp
for the first half i was just slamming item on yasuo
in my defence
my item choice is kinda meh tho
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
it was my first yasuo carry game, trying to make yasuo do what you want is like trying to force feed a dog medicine <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
this is what it look like
i can draw it out on tactics.tools
oh wait
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like what do you think about positioning n stuff
the quality is kinda shit tho
what do you think of my board? i ended up winning but kinda close
yo coach
like, learn new comp and stuff
partly cause i an't really be bothered to play to learn at the last few days of the set
like i'm playing to climb, not to learn
i think i'm also playing with wrong mindset rn
i died with 50 gold cause i couldn't figure out what i was even going to roll for if i was going to roll down
i also played like shit though <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
agreed though
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
6th
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
i had like enough item to run 3 ap carry
yeah it was doomed
besides tf
is there even any ap carry i can run on infiniteam?
give me easy lobbies so i can get to masters and then leave this set
why am against those
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
like the kind of thing which is fun exactly the first time you do it
a bug like that sound ultra cringe to abuse <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh wtf
pbe bug?
shitter lobby i think tho, only +44 on win
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
and got neeko 3 before either
rolled down to get a better frontline, alistar 2 ekko 2
such a weird game
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
am i one of them
nevermind pro
can't even imagine playing league casually for so long
kinda insane
wait is faker still playing league?
tft is popular
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
oh okay
are you playing on your own acc?
they're probably going to nerf it <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
about the attack speed changes
it's probably
what the fuck okay
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
but i thought it was like generally speaking good item
robin said that day 1
idk what you mean it's fine for me
idk what you mean it's fine for me
yeah no it's not fine
idk what you mean it's fine for me
idk what you mean it's fine for me
it's kinda like a 2s ma strat <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
maybe i'll record it
okay it's wfp
wait no it's whole discord
okay it's wfp
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
wait no it's whole discord
okay it's wfp
okay it's wfp
is it wfp
fucking 4 lasercorp and 4 infiniteam player
2-1 111 hero aug
i went 6th <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i'm just a lowly d2
???? hello?
that's me but with superheroes
tierlist?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
not with that skin probably
<:jaxdd:1112053304474738799> will be back though
wait there's no jax in set 9 right
<:jaxdd:1112053304474738799>
true though
oh
what's that mean
and 5 cost on 4-2, especially when i'm running something that doesn't spike really hard from it
are like 111 on 2-1
the ones that make me <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
some games it's pretty bad though
hero augment i'm not too tired yet
even like
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i'm actually still having fun, i just am pissed that they break everything for fun this patch
yeah i joke but like, i said before this is my first set, i don't feel most of the issue people talk about
i 1st a game yesterday with avg lobby masters 65lp <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
are you not having fun playing oxforce tf
we're stuck in set 8.5 samsara
so those portal will be very unpredictable <:okk:1058108494995263539>
doesn't put you on prism path, it just overrides whichever first augment you got
apparently the one portal that forces first augment to be prism
L
it used to embed from that
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
my thing doesn't work anymore
that's the wrong one
she doesn't remember her pbe acc
i'll try log in on my sisters pc
oh maybe i can try my sisters
we're stuck in set 8.5 limbo
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
this is so weird
can you try to make a new acc?
wait so you can get in?
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
it doesn't really surprise me that it doesn't work, but i wouldn't think the pc being the issue
really? what the fuck
i don't think i can be bothered
yeah some people are spamming new acc to get a lucky one
i've done shiv asol a few times, it didn't feel too bad since it gives faster first cast at least
or asol + jhin -> morgana shiv?
shiv asol?
it didn't feel that good
i've only played some normals with friends
is fast 9 for 8 sg + urgot bait?
are you playing this patch at all ruby?
tft
man this patch is cringe
yeah league client
i changed my mind
too much work
and all on set 9
maybe i'll list out all the econ/xp augment rn
so weird
so many level/econ augments now
there's
cool lets see how fast i can get to d4 0lp
someone said on official server that mort said some acc are just fucked
i think this is right <a:DIESOFCRINGE1:993217010806833245>
oh yeah
2.3m player on queue sounds wrong but like
i reset the router too, same shit
actual shadowbanned from pbe
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
and now it's 40 hour
i opened the client, it had an error
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
riot really do pick favorites
<a:despairgamba:1114542929625755718>
i'll retry
who also has 30h queue
there was someone else on a server i'm at
???? what
rng it out
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
put a down payment on your house
save up for the new wt valk, prepare the funds for honkai 4
yeah maybe
<:RemHighFive:752716894544330812>
i'll make one
<a:gamba:1114450826468020327>
a <a:gamba:1043204915935334410> but with <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
is there like
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
what have i become
truly
all i wanna play is tft
<:ohnobirb:948935560091807744>
i don't wanna do abyss cause i'm at 50 trophies, i wanna see it be 0
is the event even fun?
what even is there to do there?
:mihoyo:
meanwhile i'll play uhh
alright i'll leave it open and see what happens
even soju said on stream to just give up <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but all i'm doing for now is like, every few hour try again and if it's still 30hr queue i just close and play something else
maybe i should leave it for lik 10-15min to see what happen
i mean i'm not leaving it open <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
yeah the visual bugs kinda piss me off
do i just run down in ranked
i wanna play tft
<:HandsUp:465017146955661312>
since set 1?
the most demand tft pbe has had
is this like
it went really well in the past
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
pregnancy really does scare me
are they wrong though
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but now i retroactively don't <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i remember when i was toxic to them once and y'all talked me out of it and i felt bad afterwards
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
only 32 hour for me to login <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
actual turbo exodia
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
headge fund -> prism last stand -> cursed crown
on boxbox stream
yesterday i saw someone
or that streamer just pick the exciting ones so i don't see the baseline good ones
though maybe that's just that i don't realise that current augment is similar
there's very little this is pretty good, they all like introduce a big gimmick for you to play around
and idk if that's a good thing <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but all of these new augment, they're all so impactful
yeah i think i agree, idk how augment felt on release
with thomas
i think they think they just reached the point of too many board space increase/econ augment
yeah <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
they disabled endless hordes
since the synergies it allows having that many unit are nuts
i think it makes sense for this set to make it harder to get lv8/9
actually <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i think i don't mind it much
the only reason i can think for the change is that they want either the meta to be slower or to balance out the econ augments
like, system changes
i didn't realise there were bigger changes
i saw first pic was a lot of champ balancing and i'm just like w/e since i barely know them yet
actually, i think what i went through was more like
yeah
i think it makes cruel pact actual terrible now, if it wasn't before
does this mean you can't lv7 on 2-2 with cruel pact?
also wtf yeah those costs are kinda insane
but it was a lot of text
like the patch notes
i saw it
wait xp changes? what happened?
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
picking that, i'll be 0hp at 3-3
if i already 20hp at 3-3
but also
that's my natural environment
cause like 20hp in 3-3
torn between being down for that and not
i'm like
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
20hp for windfall instead of silver augment
that's scary
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
oh okay, so like actual tft xqc
why is he even that big? i never watched a stream
<:Wokege:862486121933701141>
big bro is soju?
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
that's kinda funny
LMFAO actually?
they are wet for the same reason i think
wet flesh below your skin
isn't it weird that you have flesh
i could spend the rest of the day and i wouldn't be able to match
like ain't no way some of those dishes aren't professionally made
yeah they're doing ranked cooking over there
something something inn
but harder
that's like overcooked
there's that one game
<:clueless:973756617109676032> <- me
i don't think i do
oh ok
she puts her glass on and fucking slaps you
it's very helpful to her killing you for no reason at the end of the kill
it's not useless
okay
1h to login
mort actually loves me
just as i get home
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
huh
i dunno if that's the name either
i don't have it
dentgechatting?
thank you i pride myself on being knowledgeable
it's great, i haven't played it
i just haven't seen it happen
i mean yeah i wouldn't be surprised if it happened
there might be some old example where they fuck up though
at least that's how i see everyone talk about it and how every stig i've read describes it accurately
that is what it means, yeah
that's every game too
have fun
you don't know cookie clicker?
i mean like cookie clicker <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
is nikke like that?
i've been thinking about playing honkai like an idle game
maybe i will
is it sk right now?
i can handle long queue to log in but long queue for every game, nty
that shit ain't for me chief
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
i'll prob play a few games tomorrow
uhhhh
is it still 40 min queue?
i'll prob play a few games
good to know, i'm going home soon
<:Wokege:862486121933701141>
who's that
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
it kinda pisses me off
i've been in game where 2 people play it, one goes 8th and the other still top 4s
i think i avg see it every game
i believe it, i have no clue why it's spammed so hard
so i can trash talk lulu player
huh really? i'm never playing that, but i'll keep it in mind
like knowing the item that actually have an impact in that comp
oh i see <a:Noted:914214211138244688> yeah that's really helpful actually
sorry took a while for me to catch up
blue box: i really enoyed the chapter, when taiki is like deciding whether or not to send a pic and chii does it first, that felt really nice. like both of them are p much in the same page, it's been a really good streak of chapter
akane: yeah it kinda surprised me, but it makes sense with the rest of his worldview, it also makes sense since he's issho's pupil. it's kinda weird to me, issho kinda keeps growing on me, and kaichi too. kaisei kinda cringe still from last time i saw him
tenmaku cinema: oh i absolutely am keeping up with it, i'm really enjoying it! i think the second chapter for now has been my favorite, i am enjoying it but i would enjoy it more if they went more technical detail, which is kinda crazy to me cause chapter 1 i felt like i'd not enjoy it cause i wouldn't acre about the technical detail <:dogkek:664517636524343344> 
it sounds cool though
like, does it even matter the winrate of an item combo if overall there was like 200 game that was played with that
is the data any meaningful to that degree of specificity
i mean more like
huh ok
do we even have that much data to accomodate to stuff like that?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
you need +1 and a 5*
yeah true
huh? what's that? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i don't get it
me when i'm beating up kids on the playground huh fist fight nowadays are so easy
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
like what the fuck
that's baron right?
i told you that shit is fucking insane
lock it in place
she has the pussy bolt
good on pbe though
yeah it sounds shit actually nvm
oh wait cruel pact is an augment that exist right now? oh shit
like ever
can't go lv8 huh
you kinda like
yeah actually i'm thinking about it
what the fuck
cruel pact, 1hp lv7 on 2-2
these prismatics are wild man
??????
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
from my experience, lux wins against everything except belv 3
actually idk idt i can have any game balance take from the one game i had
my item lowkey troll tho
hmmm she didn't feel that strong to me
to see whoever is playing
is just hop between stream
so the meta right now
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
freljord is so fucking strong <:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
did you play games yet?
<a:AINTNOWAY:1090865114598609018>
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i guess i'm not that upset that i can't play rn
????? ok
i should've taken a ss of when he asked chatgpt to draw ascii art of what he look like <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
he's making chatgpt make stories about them
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123> yeah kinda
even for content creator
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
20 minute queue for fun?
is this like normal ?
i like how boxbox can entertain himself
looks fun
i wanna watch that <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
dyrus shiphtur qt voy scarra
wait what the fuck this dsg team kinda slaps
i kinda like those change if they're not too overtuned
i'm expecting for carry kayle to run some lobby over too
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it make my valk a real hero
<a:BatChesting:903461076614656091> hero augments
looking kinda <:monka:969065665573027841>
but if it's like, around high prio and they have to delay it by like 4 day
kinda worrying though, i dunno how high prio it is for them having a playable pbe
so that's not that bad from my pov <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i'm going to college city later today cause i have a test tmr morning
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
and maybe i'd say same thing about some past set gimmick
but i also don't know how past set gimmick was
the way they implemented it, i feel like they're looking for it
you think they'll evergreen legend?
yeah that'd be insane
yeah it's not there <:life:1001518241610485781>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i'll miss it <:life:1001518241610485781>
i love it
i don't instapick anymore but like week 1 of playing, i see it i click it
the augment
i'm a fan, i love minmax it, i don't even know how strong it is i just like seeing the circle around my valk
do you like prep?
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
and then end stream
pbe close, he just open chatgpt and fuck around for half an hour
i'd rather do what boxbox did yesterday
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
if i'm a streamer ain't no way i'm streaming this shit
she's built diff
you can do zaun reroll
maybe if they buff zaun to hell and back
i think the way the trait are setup make it kinda hard
xddshrug
<:xdd:1041733750280687747> same one i'm watching
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153> why still playing set 8
current stream are so troll, like all the time chat is <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153> streamer where is set 9
that was fun
man me too
lowkey i can cope but i don't see it being properly balance on launch day <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
for the first few patch of set 9
i think i'll miss how balanced set 8.5 feel at the very end
where they're like pretty strong at 2*, but kinda disappointing at 1\*
maybe it is in general for the best if 5 cost is the way it is right now
actually yeah i can see it
oh god
gwen looks fun
yeah i think i can see it
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
or that's how it felt like
it was like me +1 and 6 afk
from that one game it's like impossible for me to figure out actual strength of anything
belveth looked like about what i expect from 5 cost <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
ksante looked p good
i only play one game, i couldn't get a good idea of strength
you think it's too strong right now?
yeah that's true
than like early ez or early mord
i'm more hype hitting early tf or early ww
5 cost is way too meh this set for me to care about it
while i recognise that, i appreciate the change
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
can't wait for actual release now <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
it's a hard problem, like twice a year the pbe server just need to accomodate player from all server for 2 week
i wonder if there's any solution to the pbe issue <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but it's in such a sad state in NA
i think it's growing in overseas
it's pretty big outside of NA
yeah
week 1 it's going to be silver gameplay with random intern <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
so riot in answer tried to push the teams to come anyways, just bring anyone who accepts
apparently it's a really shitty move by riot, some player organisation made a strike to get a better competitive environment
about removing requirement to play in lcs
also remember the one lcs change you said ruby?
it looks so unfun
is it even worth it to play more and try to grind out masters in this patch?
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
to another degen fast 9 patch
from one degen fast 9 patch
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
but i don't wanna play this patch and pbe is down
worst part is i really have the itch for tft
but now it's just hit urgot and turbo win
or add a trait to every threat
like make every 5* turbo broken
since they announce sg urgot so early
i thought they would do more change
yeah it's so one dimensional
like normal tft moba games
i think you get it from playing games sometimes <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it's here
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
r <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512> lled
fucking destroyed
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
me too
it is way faster and less annoying, though
but not by very much
yes, efficiency wise
i lost to a 5* belveth
yeah
and the quality of the game really is lowkey trash <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
the trait are fun to figure out, having such strong origin makes it not that hard to learn since you can just vertical something and have a decent comp
yeah my first game being no augment is kinda sad
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah i think i can see a lot of that
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
<a:DIESOFCRINGE1:993217010806833245>
ain't no way this is my first game
surely they balance it properly by release
i'll choose to cope right now <:clueless:973756617109676032>
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
okay i got my first game
it actually deal a ton of damage too for no reason
baron actually insane
i also think void emblem is turbo broken rn
like, consistently too they make whole board or stuff that affect entire enemy team way too strong for fun
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i wonder why they're like that, i feel like they severely underestimate how much shit like that matter
like you compare 3 zaun and 3 freljord <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
also yeah
kinda boring
cause then meta would just be splash it in and take it away
i don't think it'd be better if it did stay
yeah that makes sense
like, just keep the one with the passive
does zaun passive stay if you get rid of zaun?
yeah i feel like they're trying something different, all origin are nuts but the traits look weaker
free shiv morg <a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> yeah i just watched boxbox play a game and it's actually kinda crazy
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> that's kinda nut tho, in my mind jeweled isn't that strong
i'm just coping for good balance <:clueless:973756617109676032>
if there's a turbo degen comp like earlier kaisa on 8.5, it would just be meta to run w/e enables that too
yeah that's the danger, balance will possibly be real hard <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i get it tho, if it was longer actual release wouldn't be as exciting
lowkey kinda nuts that they have only 1 patch of pbe
<:OkaygeBusiness:889594869583060993>
pbe <t:1685563200:R>
that we can't roll anywhere
it's your fault
i'm pretty sure
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
especially like being able to tell same trait
yeah i feel like they're less readable without skins
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752> i'm going to put a down payment on my house
and not the left one
that the right one is the troll portal
i'm surprised people think
free morg shiv <a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
even just 2 is crazy
that's insane what the hell
i didn't watch too many game tho
yeah robin said freljord is nuts
but having a guarantee on 2-1 can just dictate your path a lot of time <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like i'm thinking 3-2 or 4-2 more often than not they'd not go on the direction you're playing if you're playing even somewhat flex
maybe i'm giga undervaluing these guaranteed augment
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
<:dongerj:1054201011201376306>
thomas 2-1 headge fund
so those silver gold ornn augment, i'd enjoy it <:OkaygeBusiness:889594869583060993>
i love having more item option
but currently i love augment like component grab bag
since i don't have a core notion of what econ breakpoint are
yeah i have a hard time evaluating gold value right now
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282> i see
yeah
maybe because i'm often so unlucky with the choices
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
current ornn augment i think they're very mid
what do you think of ornn?
but if they're just normal augment that are already not the best, i guess that also fits the description
they said that they were offering worse than avg augment, i assumed they'd be like, worse version of normal augment
oh ok
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
will i bypass the queues <:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
and keep logged in
so if i login right now
cause legends aren't playable in play test
i don't even know how they got that info anw
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282> okay
but like jewelled lotus from veigar just look like standard jewelled lotus
so idk what to make of it, they def said on the stream that they were supposed to be weaker than avg
like on those sites
looking at the augment from legend tho, they look like avg augment, not weaker than avg <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<@180679257851166721> when's pbe
on blitz.gg there's a list of all of them
guarantee one augment
afaik it's just that
<a:eavClap:925252491308834827>
unlocking fps won't matter if you can only get 90 fps anw
?
how much fps do you have
what
but money! is just better afk
oh i guess it's 4-2
aren't those kinda nuts?
honestly lowkey in some ways i feel like that too
i'm more scared of void crab/baron than thex
i'm just along for the ride for now
<:Prayge:909232418463047690> mort
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i'll be surprised if it become actual strong, it's the econ trait
the t hex?
agreege
it's a 2 for 1 valk with item
<:dongerj:1054201011201376306>
upgrading your turret
oh shit that mechanic kinda slaps
i'm just in complete disadvantage from player who can maximise from it
so i can't usually make good use of it
cause i'm a bad player
i think i value fon abnormally low
yeah that's true when you look at it that way
i don't hold as strong opinion on summoned entity as concept
that makes sense tho, i think i'd agree
i like these new augment
kinda funny
fair
do you dislike current riftwalker too?
i don't mind piltover but i'm susge on void
void and piltover
yea there's two i think
to cash out
you just sell t hex whenever you feel like
cashout system for this set econ trait is kinda weird
<a:BatChesting:903461076614656091>
t hex is a good ass name though
and just ff if you get glove <:KleeKEK:984883553315721268>
guarantee jeweled lotus on 2-1
veigar is the fuck glove legend
if they're making that an option, i'm thinking the guaranteed augment won't be that strong <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it depend on how they balance it though <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> one of the legend is poro, which just gives you no guarantee augment
just guarantee an option for the angle you wanna potentially force <:okk:1058108494995263539>
or w/e tier you get
i think they're weaker version of a normal gold augment
if it's gold
like, aurelion sol is the xp legend, so it guarantee that on 2-1, one of your augment will be
and it guarantee an augment for you
you pick before queue
new mechanic, isn't in testing server yet
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
no hero augment
man
nevermind then it isn't that op <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
ooooh okay
i actually alt f4 if i pick headge fund and someone has headge fund++ <a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
if you get offered ++ version are other people getting stronger prismatic too?
are they rarer? you get advantage for fun?
primastic augment having + and ++ version too
what even is the deal with those like
<:huh:966619839307321394>
ain't azir a 4 cost? how you 3 starring him
cap at 7 give you a fuckton of gold
these prismatic are so troll
yeah <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
you move champ around on your bench, and then you cancel out the bug that you can't put item on valk in play
that that bug you can fix by moving something on your bench
oh yeah i read
my guy is addicted
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
like before 3-5 at least?
he's been rolling tho no?
aintnoway that shit is not bugged
?????
3-5 he has 5 reroll counted
maybe it's bugged
no way, the game doesn't even have that many stage
wait is it really only natural roll?
wdym?
wait wtf did he pick?
tft has the most troll item and augment name
social distancing <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
playing all the for fun augment <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
actually got the 2 augment you were talking about
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
yeah
lv7 200 gold, fast 9 rolldown
<:dongerj:1054201011201376306>
robin actually pick headge fund last game
yeah i'm watching
<:Wokege:862486121933701141> i missed him in set 8
it's lowkey so weird all valk without skin to me
gotta spend 80 gold tho <:dongerj:1054201011201376306>
that's actually kinda funny, for a silver augment it honestly don't even look that bad
i guess i'll get used to it, the ap/ad and stuff symbol don't look off, but the whole trait description being
+5 💧 
is weird
they have 💧 instead of mana in the trait description <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
yeah this is like the augment you put in the game so that the casual have a tuber of their own <:Gladge:1047969762170388531>
meta losestreak
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
bring your gold to next game
die with 150 gold for fun
that shit will make so many people
yeah to me it scream turbo bait
i'm not a real mod, i just have a ton of perm
salty
i can't do everything
i'll see if i can
my mod perm are very weird
kinda why
hedge fund slow roll at 120 <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
which one? hedge fund?
that's more understandable
i thought it would swap every round or every stage
oh so the portal thing pick one permanent for the game?
i'm fucking avoid prismatic lobby like the plague
my god
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:dongerj:1054201011201376306>
bitz.gg has everything already
lemme force harder
i'm happy <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
oh i'm not worried, i'm degen by blood
legend and no beginner carousel
also it's interesting how a lot of the new mechanic kinda reward playing less flex
kinda weird to see the valks without skins at all
woah so surprising
robin acting like it's news <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i think it helps
you should try not choking
oh okay so it's balance around the guaranteed augment being weaker than avg by default
fiesta lobby are still here
:poropls:
you can degen so much harder now
huh????
so is this looking like set 1 remake?
that sounds kinda troll, i'm up for it
wait vote?
music kinda slappin
<a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
but apparently a full game from CN leak
yeah me too, i skipped on looking at it since it was so close to stream
did you already see all leak?
but if i kept playing from set 1, that sounds like turbo cbt
cause still a lot to learn
i think if i started set 7 i prob wouldn't mind it
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
oh yeah it was casino
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
some people were saying that 8/8.5 was worse than 7
actually?
i'm enjoying learning tft right now
actually idk
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i wish i stuck around back then
balanced set 1 phantom kinda
<:dongerj:1054201011201376306> that looks like
<a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
they kept gold collector
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
that's why you don't read
don't need to test
it absolutely is whole team
w <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512> rding
i'll just wait for the stream at this point
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
bunch of leak too
oh they leaked it 6 hour ago
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
wait fuck set 9 is in 2 hours
i don't wanna do the 3s boss though
i've been capping the 2s boss last 3 weeks actually <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
check aka t100
i dunno if you can afford it
having to wait for sp pack to ult
so it's actually kinda tight
aka has the weird spawn animation
i mean the issue is
you ain't 0s aka
if you're doing the LE SNS IO strat
yeah no
and then i decide to also try to pull hrt b
i logged in just to pull prom to do a kallen 946 strat
it's the reason every stig has cannot stack
it stack
<@447218009749061632> <@309634550273933314> <:EZ:825007406073249832>
<:Wokege:862486121933701141>
woke up 15 minute before reveal
i got the set 9 internal clock
weird
huh she went 8th
hogwarts cashout
and then lock shop on 2-2 for vi
she just roll 3 time on 2-1 for 3 underground and miss it
i'm learning a lot with wang stream
have 2 set in advance production ready for fun sounds weird
but if it cause too much trouble, i can't imagine why do it that way <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i guess it doesn't matter anymore since their team is a lot larger
do they have to do it like that then?
damn that's kinda nuts actually
like unironically he's the type who'd spend more than what he can afford
and also, i was only partly joking when i prohibited him from spending money <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but not what you say
i mean everything he says is nonsensical yeah
for carv
spoiler maybe?
it's just so her personal damage comes out on impaired enemy
it's done by the time you swap out
her impair is really short
12/12 team but that makes me more comfortable with telling newbies to skip HoS for HoS replacement
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
without impair
blustorm SEA lead got a 717 on kallen in RL
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
-1 tdm, -2 phys, -2 ice, -4 fire, -2 lightning
wronya
some would even say
i think i can see set 10 being like done with some stages of production
like completely? or like design wise
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
either that or it's too much work to implement
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> yeah maybe
to be easier to tell from a glance
i'm actually surprised they didn't think at any point to add green purple border to hero augment
he thought it was support fiora
on worlds
apparently rereplay clicked carry fiora augment by accident too
oh yeah idk if you know
d2 gameplay, just unironically forget about your augment for 2 stage for fun
but yeah i was just playing way too poorly, i clicked exiles and then forgot about it for 2 stages, just randomly i went huh why my carries have these shields oh yeah <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
so cringe
i was thinking of going lasercorp but 2 player was contesting that, stage 5 both pivot into jhin <a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
i played so bad first few stage, got an early jhin decide to play that
that game was doomed tho
and it worked
i just had an alistar in for fun
yeah idk then
oh wait no it wasn't, it was 233 or 223, i'm misremembering
and i had like, reverse issue, no way in hell i could make jhin augment appear
it was like 334 or some shit
i still suck at strongest board
funnily enough
it's nice to know tho, i thought 3 cost augment for jhin comp was just doomed
it was a fucking turbo 8th but i somehow 4th
it didn't go too well but i played like shit
yeah i picked that one game
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
i'll take note of that
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
which one? carry?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i feel like it's okay
and now i checked a random tier list and it's at the very top too
a silver friend of mine turbo believes it's broken
ruby do you think alistar is like broken or smth
<:dongerj:1054201011201376306>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> it's an emote on official tft server
<:KEWKCONE:1090964012906315886>
ain't no way it's going to be the first
1st?
i guess that's entertaining
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> i see
i'm ready to join lcs <:OkaygeBusiness:889594869583060993>
does that even matter though? lifting the rank req
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
it was a pretty good worlds too
still tho, from timing i feel like some set 9 reveal would've done good for increasing worlds viewerbase
yeah i guess i see it, they actually want 0 info before set reveal
actually crazy that they didn't do a few more reveal during worlds
the stream better be good
<:Wokege:862486121933701141>
that's gonna be fun then
i thought it'd be only lifted on pbe
nda will be lifted by stream?
oh wait
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
set 9 reveal <t:1685494800:R>
getting closer
<:Wokege:862486121933701141> masters is in the graph now
a day before set 9 reveal <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
studying set 8.5 like my life depend on it
i'm like
<:dongerj:1054201011201376306>
75 ad ap 50 armor mr?
jesus christ
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
idk if that's true and how to find out what to avoid even if it look good on that situation
some radiant item are just not good
but i remember reading that like
that's kinda what i did, i knew i was going to play tf and didn't have a shiv so shiv there felt really good
this is the first time i have radiant item <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
do i just look at the stats?
to know what good radiant item are
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
i'm dealing no damage
are those items bad on tf?
oooooh ok
on the ie
the blue cyan outline i told you about
oh here ruby
they stealth removed one infiniteam
i think that's how jesus was born
tet christian era
if they have different hp bar i'm pretty confident that it has to have turg applied on it for it to matter
does the seed have different hp bar?
i love that
oh wait that's sick actually
surely when the RL player logs in and agrees with you, that's the sign you need
wdym just keep asking until you get the answer you want so you're not insecure over doing bad choices
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
really?
that song slaps though
is the answer i guess
no
[test]()
wait we can do masked link now?
<:jaxdd:1112053304474738799>
the fights were really close
yeah, especially against rereplay
that's actually really sad, even with the bad augment he was still kinda strong all things considered
but i didn't know that it was a mistake
i did notice that he pick the other augment
<a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
i knew EU was down bad but not that down bad
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
is depressing
actually giving a shit to even get close to cap with hare
to have no one in EU
no matter how bad it is
but at the very top, it's always the same names trying to cap
but usually, like below t30 or so, the lbb are very flexible to how cbt the week is
i absolutely believe that it's that slacc a bit lower
i'm talking about like the very top10 / top5
oh i'm not saying like about t2% and t100
hows dpe lbb looking?
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i mean in NA we have styx to cap
t1 aponia is -15 from cap for fun
really? like those score are actually depressing
the husk score are like, better
what is EU fucking in shambles?
so sad
that's actually a free t2 if you pull hare for no reason
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
for non-hare cap
tied 3rd place
<a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
actually no that makes sense
wait in MA too?
that's kinda turbo stupid <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i'm not really surprised people are turbo sleeping
yeah that's so cringe
iirc wouldn't you rather play triple support here?
also putting that mechanic on an actual competitive boss is turbo troll <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123> i've never seen carv tilt before
lmk how good it is <:okk:1058108494995263539> last week chapter was pretty great
and i'll read when i wake up
i think i'm going straight to bedge
that makes sense, but it's weird how it works
why was he so awkward in the live one, nerves? he's doing pretty well in this one
robin interview is the real interview though
i think it fits for tft
lowkey i kinda liked how awkward it was
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
this game is all luck no skill, i just high rolled into a 1st
my message would be something like
man i don't get how they're capable of not just trolling on these interview
i thought it was monthly but i swear we had a chapter last week
weekly?
is spy x family
<:peepoAvenger:756228412435333250>
to promote worlds
lowkey insane that they're not dropping small set 9 hints throughout the stream
set 9 breadcrumbs? <:PauseCat:1002644852850298960>
cock sacrifice for the cock gods
it's actual perma on official stream though
<:HandsUp:465017146955661312>
<:HandsUp:465017146955661312>
he still hold a lot of mental but even then
i feel bad for setsy tho i feel like he got turbo fucked over on the first few games
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
setsuko pick shiny
rereplay has the discipline to not slam titans
that's actually the difference maker
deserved
<a:Clap:802373413716623391>
the discipline
i'll bring that knowledge to ranked so i can achieve the d2
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
actual gb tf diff
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
actually nuts
holy fuck rereplay actually win out
it's actually really hype
NA vs CN
it's time
<:Wokege:862486121933701141>
binteum win out is a heart attack angle
<a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831> the lux 2 spike
so we're watching it
worlds is happening right now
sorry if you don't understand assume it's tft talk for ruby
does it do anything at all?
flancy 2 shiv for fun?
3 sg for fun <:xdd:1089308231496638574>
tf2 is nut but i don't know if that's enough for first
may i take you as sensei when i play terraria one day
but also congrats, that sounds like a pain
that sounds really punishing, it's not even different version, just easy and hard mode?
yeah idk if shiny was the play there but it is entertaining
<:Wokege:862486121933701141> that'd be funny
is setsuko for fun now?
<a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
cn player special
you were right all along
so cringe
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
yeah no hero aug on 2-1 just for it to be 445
what's that
no titans it's an 8th
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the first no hero augment on 2-1 game
wait is this
how setsuko looking?
this might be the end, rereplay or flancy
<:Wokege:862486121933701141>
so he plans to sell lb? i guess i see it
what that's kinda nuts
oh ok
guardbreaker lb sounds weird <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
aoe unit like mf asol
i thought it was only slammable on like
is guardbreaker good for random unit?
<:dongerj:1054201011201376306>
is there even any reason for it?
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
<:Wokege:862486121933701141> we're going 6 heist 1st
stage 2 i'm somehow always turbo strong even though i don't even feel like i'm playing that aggressive
i think i lowkey have become the player that set the tempo on my lobbies
probably don't need that on low diamond <:dogkek:664517636524343344> but i'll keep that in mind if it looks doomed
like i will now but i wouldn't before
i'd never even consider it
that's crazy that that's sometimes or even most time the best play
yeah i kinda hate big neeko on opener, i think i only got it once tho
i guess it make sense but i didn't make the connection that small neeko = less econ
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
<a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
opener
yeah
i kinda like it
is small neeko bad?
You get used to it... Agony 1 is only the beginning my friend. You'll see soon considering you made it to +200.

But on the bright side, more crystals
no not that one
do we have the copypasta still
clear boss = retain
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123> actually kinda in character for setsuko
how many games was it before max? 6?
that's like actually the only way to go to game 7 right
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<a:DonkWalk:926406712209068042>
setsuko 1 1
yeah if it doesn't end here it's actually an everyone check
how many point is setsuko at?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:Wokege:862486121933701141>
<:o7:1099354934320840765>
flancy tex maybe?
urgot 3 mordekaiser 3 <:Wokege:862486121933701141>
for setsy
is that high end shopping?
yeah
probably 3 check?
setsuko mental actually throughout the roof
like by riot
i think if setsuko ff here for rereplay then he actually get punished
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
i'm down actually lets go
<a:DonkWalk:926406712209068042>
setsuko 1 1 1 ?
at that point it's basically one game decide it all
i'm guessing it's probably hype for watching
that's such a weird spot for worlds
can relate, that's me with shiv morg
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> okay
so wait what's the titans tf sauce?
the meta game is kinda nuts
yeah
i guess it kinda matter cause you stall other checkmate
yeah it doesn't even matter, 1st looks impossible here
nvm never punished
lmfao flashback when he skipped an annie cause he wasn't hitting annie 3
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
actually?
i think gadgeteen spat you can maybe make it there
yeah
actually too obvious
it's probably like the more entertaining for worlds since you have the least control over it but i'd be kinda tilted
but god damn
at least no more 3 cost on 2-1
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
the answer is no
will we see the rare not 2-1 hero
next game 2, probably 3 other people on check, and then half the lobby is on check is kinda nuts
it's probably ending next match at the latest huh
<a:DonkWalk:926406712209068042>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> 2nd for fun my god
actually going first for fun
when p much everyone will be actively griefing rereplay
yeah i'm actually kinda excited to see how the lobby are
<:Wokege:862486121933701141> it's time
tf is the main character of set 8 <:clueless:973756617109676032>
hmmm i see
really?
like viego or alistar?
i know that but won't you rather have a better oxdd?
<:oxdd:1112053416210997299>
i'd replace annie 1 with viego 1
is spellslinger even do anything in this comp? no item tf?
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
is it that good?
i actually never clicked that
flancy last stand?
<:Wokege:862486121933701141>
real worlds start then
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i think he can do it
a 5th is an improvement from past games <:clueless:973756617109676032>
are you back to watching?
setsuko is on a good angle tho, 50 hp 4-6 and kinda stable board
pretty sure it is
wait card is 32 right?
32 + 12 -> 44, still can afford a stig/weap
4 knight is 56
you can afford something else <:okk:1058108494995263539>
card + wep is 32 + 12
if you buy pala 4 patch, that's 64
it's 5/14/16
you can't buy card if you don't buy bp i'm pretty sure
wdym
i'm just surprised you even consider that angle
yeah did end up being a good play, he almost hit fiora 3 before vayne 2 <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
is fiora carry and then itemise her as carry bait? rereplay slammed qss on her <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i thought hanser had that gimmick for fun, that's interesting
ooooo i didn't know that
i think rereplay is kinda guaranteed 18 point here
rereplay db glove vayne, carry fiora aug
setsuko bow bow chain, small game hunter
this worlds is cursed <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
my god, 121 hero on 2-1
rereplay db vayne opener, actually just free checkmate
i remember some people going full detective on the concert stream 5.2 trying to look at her face from reflections <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
like an actual contract?
oh ok <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i think i saw that clip somewhere, kinda silly
and yeah she's pretty cute
i thought she didn't show her face
wait is that hanser?
poor setsuko
14 11 10 9 9 8 8 3 <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
<:Wokege:862486121933701141>
setsuko 3 points
rereplay 14 points
yeah probably
but it is against tos
there's no like, written punishment for it, so we don't know if riot is actually gonna do something about it
and shimapen did it at 2nd cause no chance of win
apparently it's against the rules to ff in worlds
shimapen was actually the one who level up -> stay level 7 forever, still got 2nd
-2 point for fun
at 2nd
shimapen ff
?????? <a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
it's a 1st for rereplay <a:POGCRAZY:1064950488849715251>
rereplay still alive though, healthy and going 9
yeah it's a 7th <:o7:1099354934320840765>
<:o7:1099354934320840765>
5-6 he's 1 life with 1 dead
and is level 7 on 5-2 0 gold <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
there's someone who picked level up in 3-2
mental is back, ain't no 8th gonna keep setsy down :evilge:
58 hp 5th atm, no one dead, i believe <a:DonkWalk:926406712209068042>
alright there's hope, kinda clean pivot into jhin in 4-1, makeshift
actually yeah that's true
huh ok
that's surprising to me
shiv asol?
keep a morg in?
jhin comp what do you even do with shiv
<a:DonkWalk:926406712209068042>
spat from krugs, 3-2 urfs grab bag, there's a chance <a:DonkWalk:926406712209068042>
<:COPIUM:826571890386272337>
maybe can cook something out, lobby kinda struggling, bot 3 are at like 70 hp on stage 3
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
egg carousel, lose 2-5 just no econ now
he was playing turbo aggressive, lose win win before carousel, prelevel 5 at 2-3
yeah this is kinda <:o7:1099354934320840765>
and a duplicator
shiv chain
small game hunter, actually playable now
222 this time tho
hero 2-1 again
<a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> yeah that's fair
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
actually there's prob a chance it doesn't reach backline
wouldn't it be less of a problem with scoped weapon tho?
ooo i see
no one took ss from the portal bs so i can't see it <:Theresad:476616089178996746>
ain't mordekaiser scoped weapons pretty nice? feel like morde 1 can do a lot if he doesn't pop like a balloon
<:o7:1099354934320840765> not a flancy angle
no one <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
rfc is like
it's never rfc right
that makes sense
oh i see
never thought about that before
oh shit ain't shiv like turbo big in lasercorp because of ap damage from drone?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
db lw rh fine item for ww?
<:o7:1099354934320840765> <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
i'm worried for setsuko mental the next few match, i don't know how easy he bounce back from this
yeah oh no <:o7:1099354934320840765>
better spot than me
the first game i played this set i died in 4-2 <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
i'd actually tilt to the moon if it was me
he's a beast if he just keeps mental from this game
we pivot into cheering for flancy?
<:o7:1099354934320840765>
<a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
by having a for fun first match of worlds
they're preparing for the for fun patch
actual fiesta
?????? what even man
that's so fucking cringe
i'm gonna be honest i didn't even know 3 cost augment was possible on 2-1
<:o7:1099354934320840765>
<a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
i'll see if i can find the pics <:2_peepoDetective:614901939448184849>
oh hmm i see
i've only paid attention to <a:DonkWalk:926406712209068042> before the games start
oh did i miss it?
i'll go to sleep satisfied, sexuko will win and they'll leave some set 9 breadcrumbs
surely worlds won't last that long <:clueless:973756617109676032>
it kinda slaps
but the most embarrassing thing i've ever looked up is the ants go marching to vibe with it
i've been linked porn before
my pc is in the middle of the living room
<a:DonkWalk:926406712209068042> the ants go marching two by two <a:DonkWalk:926406712209068042>
<a:DonkWalk:926406712209068042>
guess i'm staying up now
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i saved it but i'll only use it on extreme occasion
that looks really nice
aintnoway
like i think he joke a lot but the hyperactivity isn't fake
i can't quite tell
<:hehe:866109805056098304>
i also have no power
in an alt universe aster would be gatekeeping me from hidden base because i'm stupid too
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
also i said i would sleep and i haven't been able to yet
<#977584145142259782> is ffa though
and i'll also moderate him if he gets too annoying in this chat <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i'm okay with it but i won't promise to be nice all the time to him
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
lmk if something cool happens <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i'm going to sleep, so i'll prob miss out the first worlds games
?
that's <:gayge:1091948660104888374> <:AetherDisgust:850406398563319818>
wait so this game is already out out?
pretty smooth
that looks like it'd be fun to play actually
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
HoF was like 2 patches ago
chill cherry
it hasn't been that long
<:huh:966619839307321394>
and 3p is pretty big upgrade
but any other 2p and it's trash
if you have 2 piece, only TB is worth using, and it's a nice upgrade
if you only have 1 piece, only T is worth using and barely
HoF stig is kind of a tough spot
2p withou himeko B is turbo troll though
but it does mean you can skip out on farming lee T
the performance is barely an upgrade if at all from lee TB thales m
T is fine as a solo piece
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
yeah that's why i never bother
no B = don't bother
yes
s0 4/4 will easily outperform like a 3s 0/4 and maybe even 1/4
gear > rank up
and then at least one more
it's hof, ft, io gear
most of the gear already
we know like
a warm one? changing it up? <:neko_van_woah:809286740489666581>
what else might you want from this season?
and pick the best one
the only way to look into it is, what options do you have
asking if x or y is worth it is pointless
these question are always meaningless in a vaccuum
being consistent is weird
i wonder if it's very badly translated then
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
who wrote a site for fun
making fun of a 12 y/o
you're like
??
it makes more sense if it's like the unique mechanic of the game
yeah i noticed the stage changed and that looked cool, but i assume it was boss mechanic
oooo i see
that one screen break effect looks sick though
it's very similar to pgr
but visual wise
i dunno if i can say that the gameplay is too similar, it doesn't have the ping system which is like the one thing pgr has as identity
i was sure it was pgr <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh wait what
huh that sounds like metal gear <:clueless:973756617109676032>
bonsai gacha?
i guess i can see it <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
hmm really? that's kinda surprising
oh wait train game is gsr?
oh yeah i meant coomerside
are you still playing?
not a bad pivot tbh
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i remember him saying that that was cheaper than honkai too
damn
yeah i remember he came back for a bit after the hacker stuff got resolved
<:life:1001518241610485781>
is karto still playing?
i will say though, i was punished way less by my scores sucking with 2 3s boss
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
tell me that a sinful player opinion doesn't deserve the light of day
<:KyaruBlush:697172296829239436>
karto flame me next
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah i gave up
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i wasn't one of them tho
4 time and a half players <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
last game i played i had 2-1 hero augment and there was literally like
don't think i ever hit something like that
sometimes someone is just the main character of that game
<a:DIESOFCRINGE1:993217010806833245>
i'm not too tired of it but i think i can recognise it
yeah i think i agree with you that most of the issue rn are the some of the outlier augment
is tft that downbad <a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
damn scarra is fucking league soloq
if we have to wait 2 days after final day of worlds then that's kinda weird
if so i'm not upset about it
i kinda expect some breadcrumbs tomorrow
you think so?
mort is personally fucking with me
tft and honkai are polar opposite game
yeah i don't judge, if you have fun with that then keep it up <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i mean yeah
so they prob just end up spending more money for same result
it actually kinda makes sense if you think about it, if they don't even play the game they prob don't know how to whale effectively
yeah that doesn't surprise me
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i think by most definition you can come up, there's prob someone who have whaled harder than styx
this one?
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
yeah i'd think so too
for boss that need it
like either way you get the hp loss
cause you have LY's hp loss
but i guess it doesn't matter
oh yeah idk how it is with LY <:okk:1058108494995263539>
2023 you expect valk to work on for fun team?
lmao
yeah i mean, i wouldn't call it shit to proc if in her usual team she can generally well
maybe it's very little or insignificant
in the middle of ult
on general boss with RC, usually can does freeze
i think that's common though <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
or did they add it to everyone for fun
does everyone actually have it and we didn't care?
wtf do you mean by hp loss
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like i'd consider her very strong if she was 15-20% better than past valk
that's still really really high
even before the nerfs that's like a fuckton
like <:dongerj:1054201011201376306>
36% increase after nerfs is just waaaaaay too big
yeah i believe that
2 -> 3 is 50 50
so 3 -> 4 is 50 50 50
each mini star is 50
50
yeah before nerfs i'd be more likely to believe that
<:cocka:1112184615281623141>
stop at like 2s1 or 2s2
yeah even some quite large whale
3s i'm not sure
max pri yeah
the rot is probably too long for RC buffs too
yeah same
aintnoway newt/cez is 36% increase though
p sure full bastet on RC too
2s WE
3s HoH
it's such a weird setup too
yeah
36% increase
but it doesn't feel right
actual 40% in team damage
this is like
inaccurate somehow?
is that one video making rounds
i have no clue what her standing is in v3
<:crying:757445037402619974>
can i have a small loan of 5 million real life us dollars
eli
the boss is still cancer though
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
no mob abyss is so rare
and i almost cried
in abyss
i remember trying heph for the first time
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
before nirv, you show a 572 ref to someone and tell it's paper they'd laugh at you
what nirv does to a mf
yeah i'm not worrying
CN is pretty niche, and RC will probably pretty niche if you have actual ice dps instead of triple support to run after LY release
if you're not running triple support though, like if you've invested in a dps, then i think you can easily get away with rudder instead
if you're running triple support on ice, i would way rather have purana than rudder on both ice and fire team
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i think generally speaking for budget player, i'd disagree
was a good run
<:o7:1099354934320840765> i'm back to sexuko cheer then
fighting for tet's attention
we're like
this is you right
<@309634550273933314>
i wasn't able to figure out the animated ones though
<:oxdd:1112053416210997299>
<:jaxdd:1112053304474738799>
maybe it's my calling
maybe i do it
<a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
ahri is diesofkiss
lux is diesofayaya
annie is diesofpanda
the new ones are different tho i think
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i remember when that released
the ones on boxbox stream is not diesof[character], it's diesof[action]
isn't it like
it's huge in CN right?
has it been getting like more successful?
honestly yeah this is a fucking great platform for set 9 reveal
sounds like a good shower i think
alright have fun
this worlds has been very entertaining
i don't think i'd be upset either way, i might pivot into cheering for gvidigal instead
you can prob ult every rot
yeah prob marg jk then tho, isn't JK sp gen actually insane in mobbing?
lumi is fucking sending me riddles
okay whatever man
i think it'd depend on the boss but my gut feeling would be something like marg jk > ae > irene jk generally <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that's actually really cool
<a:DonkWalk:926406712209068042>
willy hanks <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i don't think you reapply irene at all
i'd personally just test them all out and see what feels best
yeah idk that's uncharted waters for me
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
sig weapon?
is this a what's the best option from: irene TB
what are the options?
okay then might i ask
sounds cbt
jst probably?
setsuko actually main character of this tourney
what the fuck is going on
<a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
yeah playing like that is probably the right way to play in tourney
but honestly why not, he's like guaranteed top 8 at this point right?
it's turbo paying off
yeah i see
or is setsuko just highrolling so hard that he always has hp to burn for shiny
actually a competitive augment?
is shiny like
<:o7:1099354934320840765>
that sounds like gigachad to pull off on worlds
that sounds good i think? i have no clue how good viego carry is
i'm so lost <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
is he preparing the disneyland for others <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i dunno what's that supposed to mean <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<a:DonkWalk:926406712209068042>
by the end of this worlds we're all sexuko simps
yeah <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i wanted to do something something lobotomy but i'd feel like i was copying iriya so i didn't
fuck it actually, i barely used the last one but i like it too much
it slaps so hard
i wanna change my name to paw patrol euthanasia now
it's not christian-like
don't worry about it aster
but maybe it's better if it doesn't matter
18 point sound potentially too low for max 11 game but max 6 game it's way too high to matter
that's kinda stupid <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it was still 18 points?
oh wait
i see
didn't know it had just changed though, it's nice that it's more now
i was assuming it was the same system, i just wanted to know if ending too fast happened often before
no i mean like
how has it been in the past?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh hmmm i see
i think i'd be fine with a competitive system like that
going for too long sounds like a pain but
hmm really?
<@309634550273933314>
sounds fun
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah minimum 4 games
oh okay i see
<:huh:966619839307321394>
so how does day 3 work? how many games of final lobby top 8?
even without that, it's pretty entertaining
i'm not like, paying as much attention as i should to improve
i don't mind waiting for set 9 anymore actually, worlds is more fun than i thought it'd be <:okk:1058108494995263539>
okay lobby 3 looking interesting <:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
share the doc?
sexuko is just in permanent disneyland now
rereplay was turbo stacked on regionals
actually crazy
alphabet completionist
did you see that one tumblr acc
woah that's an insane typo there tet
oh wait that's not a crazy typo
so true tet
nothing to cook they pivot into that?
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
what the fuck is going on there
is that maincord
:D
wait don't we have
hi shiro welcome to my home
did i say hi to shiro
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
do you really
<a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
yeah don't worry about it aster
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
oh ok
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
i'm pure
i'm pretty sure it was at heki
right now
screaming at ghosts
you're like
inu isn't even here anymore
i knew it was you tet
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
liqu is list quotes
oh shit
,liqu
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah it sounds like it, set 7 sound like a menace to balance <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but i also dunno any other way so <:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
that we get too many items
i don't think i agree
i see though, some people were complaining that you get way too many items rn
i guess if it's balanced around it it's fine
oh hmm i see, that sounds kinda broken
huh i see
it's because of the changes right? cause they added component pity
but now i like econ too, it's kinda nuts
yeah when i started i preferred component start
oh i see that's fucking stupid <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
can you have both?
i'm kinda lost about it, isn't 5 component opener like the most component you can even have by 2-1
yes please
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
what's wrong with death threats
i don't think anyone would mind a friend of yours since we like you, but we can't judge their character without knowing them
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987> up to you
tft can be such a tiring stressful game, not even in a bad way
yeah i see from both angle
tomorrow?
but like thinking if it was me, that sounds so tiring
not that i think it's too much for what it should be
6 games is kind of a lot
oh okay that makes more sense
that sounds a bit weird <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
and all games that day keep the same lobby?
so how does the format work? there's different lobby each day?
i see <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
was that flancy?
at top 2
who was the other person in that lobby with setsuko?
yeah kinda
new girl you have
SI
triple support is your only option i think
huh that board didn't cap as hard as i thought it would, shiny didn't print as many items as i expected
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
didn't even make her immune to elemental <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
you know mihoyo is lowkey kind
so i consider db a lot more
but i don't think sword is as good as rod <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
before i thought that db was like deathcap, it's great but kinda troll cause it use 2 good component
yeah i like db
i'll keep that in mind
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
i guess it makes sense, he's turbo healthy, just sacc a fuckton and cap your board with 3 item on everyone
shiny <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
setsy 10 winstreak <:dongerj:1054201011201376306>
what do you want on belveth btw?
if it's good on those comp and i don't play those comp then that makes sense <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
yea that makes sense tho, like
item holder on ad comp
i never tried either of that, only belveth as like
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
actually?
i always feel bad when i click it
like ever?
do you like scoped weapons?
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it's so hard for me personally that i'd get tilted if i get it and lose
i guess i kinda get it since it's not extremely hard to get 3* 4 cost
yeah that's kinda weird to me
i'm having fun with the cock spam in robin chat <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i think that the avg definition is usually that though <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i guess by highroll i was thinking more like, rare stuff, not necessarily best stuff
i mean yeah
there was a jhin 3 yesterday
i didn't pay attention too hard, that was like a few 5 cost 2 star right?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> really?
i'd be tilted on that situation
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
yeah that makes sense
it's like morde > syndra, janna maybe 3rd
i prob agree morde is the strongest 5*
idk what i think the best units are
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> yeah i could see it
i don't think i'm good enough to recognise that, he looked pretty strong <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
yeah that's fair i guess
or do they mean like in this lobby it's kinda doomed
are they like turbo coping with top 6 is average <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
that's my optimal ranked game
2-1 scout -> axiom arc lulu player -> ff
but god damn it if i don't get tilted when they hit
yeah i've seen it fail enough to know it ain't good to force
i tilt over it <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
lulu is the only comp that i turbo hate
you just get turbo fucked for fun on some comp over it
but i think i dislike 5 cost hero augment way more
and it kinda blows
everyone on reddit fucking cries their eyes off over 2-1 hero augment
yeah i'm assuming it wasn't always like this but on this set it feels turbo bait
that doesn't surprise me that much actually, from what i see, pure stat looks in general way more powerful than just infinite scaling shit like guinsoo
that's good to know
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh i see, i thought it was like around BiS
maybe force tf ain't the angle
is it not that good for tf?
hmm really?
that's fair
i'm more impressed by the items, i would've slammed guinsoo so hard for force tf, but he ended up with kinda sick neeko items
on ap/spellslingers
i think he's turbo uncontested though
<a:cheer:585545022930419712> go go setsy <a:cheer:585545022930419712>
yeah i'm watching it
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
if you wait 4 day you can play for fun instead
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
how many games are you in?
oh?
i want to learn a new set
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
set 9
ruby where's
HoR's BK is also burger king reference, though it's bronya kiana canonly
HoT is McD i think, mei cuck dongerino or something like that
like for a while all of them were fast food related
he has themes
diavoros shows up weekly in my nightmares
i fucking wish
it could be wrong as in they change their mind/dim got the wrong info, but dim doesn't really lie for clout, so i trust him to a degree on that
yeah, you can check <#1062434039186870392>, there was a tweet
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING
sirin 6.8 then retire
it's not even seele though, dim said it was sirin
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
which same
the second one i'd think is deer seele, so i read the third one as deer retarded
we can't say it here
some real big abbreviations
now i'm proposing for 6.8 valk
pwtf?
pink/purple works
grey hag and purple cunny <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<a:Nod:964880791731597372>
yeah
she's the one that's actually 9 y/o
and then pc is
it's a diavoros reference
yeah!
hoe is like closer
prometheus is like 5k y/o
my tip is that
no
gh and pc
i'm proposing
so like
why green?
for GC it became a battle royale
it started as i picking a new abbreviation for fun for HN
<:dongerj:1054201011201376306>
for prom and hare
i've been thinking about GH and PC
GC
genshin kiana
DA was GK
yeah
PE was RK
i think he changed a lot of them for fun
honestly i don't know
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
level prio = ER
they're playing another game honestly
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
<:HOPIUM:864973200738877490>
setsuko is the NA hope
did you see this one?
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
kinda stupid, kinda gigachad
he actually instapick bd on another game
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> that sounds like setsy alright
actually disturbingly bad
2 gadgeteen, 1 anima, 1 mascot emblem
unironically what was left for me was
i just had like the worst carousel i've ever seen
got a 2nd, 1st belveth garen 3 <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:okk:1058108494995263539> sounds good
<@180679257851166721> which is the better mordekaiser augment?
did i login for nothing?
is there no hrt gear?
wait
that sucks
cytus looked pretty fun
really?
i leave going i know why i'm retired <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
yeah every time i open honkai and do an MA boss
<:Wokege:862486121933701141> setsuko instapick bd
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
retired player knows more than active player
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
so you don't need to ult with HoS first for her damage to come off on impaired enemy
GC has a short impair in her kit
before
i just pronounce it sea, like the ocean
robin <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
skill issue
that's weird
wait you pronounce sea as s e a?
i'll try the 4 hoj build later today <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
?
this john
<:JohnLee:897585631197286450>
is that what i should be doing?
hoj hoj mf, gs gs hoj vayne, hoj on frontline
i've never seen so many hojs
ruby what's the hoj sauce?
if you're going to keep playing they'll let you back <:okk:1058108494995263539>
they do that often, it's not in bad terms
you're sea tho right?
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
IE is going to be turbo IE
set 9 they're replacing all glove item trust
i hate it <a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
it takes so much for me not to tilt out immediately
if i'm left with glove on opening carousel
<:Wokege:862486121933701141>
oh shit
but i might be too obsessed with just shiv in general <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i don't think i'm too obsessed with shiv morg, like i do move the shiv to tf if i'm going that line
yeah i should think more on that angle
that makes sense though
just thinking about it <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah like on TF line i don't usually force a morg, i do on laser/gadgeteen p much
you can run like guinsoo gunblade gs with shiv morg
like on TF
even on some dps you wanna run shiv, is it better to run shiv on the dps? or is it better to open the space for a better item and run something else
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
rn i'm very meh about it, like 9/10 times i'd rather force a shiv for shiv morg
lw/spark that much?
<@180679257851166721> do you value like
so you said +10 so it's a very good joke
where every good joke chat says +2 and every bad joke chat says -2
it wasn't a joke but there's the recurring jerma joke
it was a good joke
thank you
about 5 yo or so
aren't 9th graders like
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
how was the street
i'm running it down to silver mmr
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
i don't need luck, all i need is skill
<:Toebeans:585731577963610122>
all i got was this
<:lfgCatgirlEdition:803114454187114506>
just gotta trust in the heart of the card
thank you <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
i also have 6 pull <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
i'll try to get the B piece <:OkaygeBusiness:889594869583060993>
so is the hrt banner up?
so based
what are you going to do when seele expy?
that's what i do every patch <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
that sounds scary though
they absolutely do render some stuff while on pause
only 1 or 2 are still playing though
so when it rerelased, a lot of my friends tried it back up
but it was a really big thing in brazil
i didn't play it too much when i was younger
but it looks greedier
idr how greedy it was back in the day
yeah i was like keeping up with some communities and they weren't happy about a lot of stuff
like new content? iirc, they had a relaunch on steam and were readding old content
oh okay, what is even the deal with classic tho? is it still getting updates?
though i've only played the classic
either tbh
you play grand chase?
it was pretty forest-y
it's a fan set
nevermind <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
sion plants and chops down trees, i wonder if other lumberjack champs also plant tree or if there's some natural trees
there might be some terrain stuff now <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
ascension xerath <:Wokege:862486121933701141>
oh wow xerath looks fun
yeah it looks like this time riot is keeping them in a leash
oh i see it now <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it's a very forest-y set <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah it looks great, i hoped to see traits tho instead of abilities
i think you get to pick, base kayle -> 2 different kayle
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<:OkaygeBusiness:889594869583060993> ?
<@180679257851166721>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
or like gadgeteen i guess
oh okay i see
also is there ever any reason to put fon on anyone?
from the name of set 9, runeterra reforged people are thinking it's either set 1/2 remake or like mix of a lot of set <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<@180679257851166721> remember that one set leak i sent? what if it's true <:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
i'm monkey see monkey do
i feel like i'd get tilted as fuck too
at my elo there's very little chibi
i want set 9 info
<a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
or have they playtested it
as cope?
picking the cause and effect looked fun
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
wait what was the one peep detective
why did they change admin?
no leaks still <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
less than a week until pbe
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
damn weeks pass fast
oh already?
i was thinking of trying to plug in the old graphics card in my pc <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm still downloading the chapter
it's awful
i don't even need to watch the entire kill to know
20 second waiting game for fun at the very start
i hate it <:okk:1058108494995263539>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
knows if there's any potential issue with graphics card compatibility?
hey anyone that knows about pc building
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> i'll read it later today
<a:collapse:1063550316332720148> poor girl
best skin for best character in honkai
most sane honkai player
mihoyo is just foreshadowing their own story all this time
sounds like something a weeb would say
imagine working on a lab that has some weeb ass name like that
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
okay thanks for the warning so my expectation isn't too high <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
what the fuck
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
but it'll depend on how much i enjoy playing that
i'll see how it goes, i think ideally i'd prefer spend all my time in set 9 pbe
hmmm yeah maybe
d4 is fine i guess
last week of the patch right
i don't think i'll have the time to grind hard for masters before set 9
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
i feel like i see it every time
are you like guaranteed randuin on ornn item select
her rank up kinda suck too iirc
disgusting
bella most fun an interactive boss ever made
current dist, i bet the damage is crazy
it was always quite close
yeah i always used HoR there
the romance in the small things, i love that, it's the reason i started reading
i loved it
yeah honestly, the last 2 chapter were s-tier
my version is more scuff
<a:tuckk:1087729456203968574>
<a:tuckk:1087729456203968574>
i'm gonna kms
<a:DIESOFCRINGE1:993217010806833245>
aster look
rank 1 sounds like actual hell to climb
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
but nothing even change in the past 3 week <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and even then
i'd understand if your were like turbo one trick spam kaisa back when she was broken
out of nowhere too
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i don't even think i climb 900 lp in entirety of my acc
most sane tft player
<a:dalaodalaodalao:959706475394117632>
i said your score was kinda pimpin
that's a cool format actually
oooh okay
5 hours?
how long is that?
jesus
is it like lcs?
that's a shame i think
was 5.8
SI
nunya business pal
nunya
was it really that early?
i think heki pulled too
yeah that's crazy then i have shit memory <:okk:1058108494995263539>
was it not?
i think it was
wasnt it?
with the sakura will shit
it was alongside all the other change
i'm pretty sure
6.2
wait actually
idr
eli trivia time?
isn't it better if it's 7.0?
yeah fair
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
they were legit pissed at me
and when i messaged them at the end
like there was one time i was confident it was just a fun stealing t1 from one another
<:dogkek:664517636524343344> i'm so wary of those now
i had a bunch of fun balding for top spot in RL too
lightning damage strat
<:dogkek:664517636524343344> okay
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
you two are playing a different game up there
old honkai player understand that that's the thing gsr himeko has the most in common with honkai himeko
new honkai player complain about gsr himeko being weak
maybe they just lost all hope for himeko
what's a himeko?
it was scaring new player away
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
in NA you don't even have enough competitive player to fill one armada
can you imagine stuff like that
having multiple armada in game to hold one armada is nuts in my eyes
like they have 3 armada or something in game
no clue actually i just know that it's huge
the teri simp one?
isn't SEA biggest armada
the most wholesome and pure of all honkai community
our server is so wholesome and pure
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
the worse week it is, the easier it is to t100
just gotta grab an awful week
same
before my first t100, i got like a t102 or some shit like that <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i've been cucked of some rank by taking too long to get the score
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
were people tied t1? <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'd actually kms
typed bella is cursed
yeah probably
bella the boss that makes people turn to the dark side
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
everyone fighting for like a few points
one of those boss i'd really dislike balding <:okk:1058108494995263539>
don't feel bad about it
i mean it's just dist diff
so if you don't meet it, there's very little you can do to eek out more damage i feel like
kyoshiro rots are usually extremely well optimised for his  damage thresholds
yeah there's not much you can do there besides maybe staying on HoS for a sec to try and mess with the shield a bit
yeah it's oshi no ko op <:okk:1058108494995263539>
idol is the name of the song
kyoshiro is crazy indeed though
i was complimenting kyoshiro's good taste by picking idol
oh sorry
kyoshiro good taste
share ref?
the higher dist is = the more difference a few point makes
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
2 dist at the dist we're at actually makes a big difference
dorm and atk diff would be smaller
yeah no it's absolutely that then
is it same dist?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
share rot + recording?
best gamemode ever made
cause it actually slow down MA timer
in MA it's turbo broken
it does coma but that doesn't matter if not HoS dps
it's a really long combo, that gives very little benefit
3s ~~m~~pe diff
oh
3s mpe diff
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
it's still pretty bad even if it's a straightforward boss <:okk:1058108494995263539>
so you just lose a fuckton of time for fun
cause it slows down the game but not the abyss timer
chains is really niche in abyss
to get the sp
you wanna swap around back to sword
which is why even if you start with sword
so you get the sp from that
and with that buff, next combo gives you some sp
she gets a buff
when you switch weapon
it does
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
for nirv?
that's a sick score tho no?
me when i die
march 2020
relatable though, same
<@309634550273933314> did you see ,.. cherryraccoon
i wanna see bald robin
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
harsh time limit then
<a:pepeMeltdown:870437577042317322>
poor girl, i think she can do it if she keep it up, not this stream though
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714> 76541681
🦝
more cold food in front of doors
oh boy
so all the text were tones of red
it's because all the text here is same color as name
earlier when i said that the chat was warm
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i forgot that my discord is not normal
don't but i would if i were you
pizza terrorists ?
is that luck?
that's what you get by degen ww
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
for a second i thought you got a pizza at 5am and went okay now time to go on a walk
it's 5am here and i forgot timezones existed
oh okay
what time is it for you?
wtf you mean walking away, to where?
where are you
was it the pizza?
was it close?
explosion?
what the fuck is going on over there
actual raccoon mindset
insane thought process
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
royal poison taste tester genes in action
yeah it's the fucking
cherry????
you ate a slice
the fuck you mean
???????????????
<a:eavFeetSwipe:1102282070715273267>
have you tried swiping?
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
so it's annoying that it is the confusing part
hmmm that is the more useful one
the % means the amount of simulations that completed the goal at that amount of pulls or earlier
if you pick any node there
that's the one you look at to see the chances
alright so that's the cumulative graph
feedback is kinda hard now that i think about it
okay tell me what you think it might be
than line
bars probably make more sense for the first chart
hmmm
right?
so i wanna know what you don't understand to fix it
i don't wanna explain it too hard cause ideally you should be able to understand it without explanation
both of them are like that but they display the info in different way
the first one is closer to that idea you said
you can scroll
there's 2 charts btw
yeah
which? both?
or are some some stuff confusing?
from knowing what the purpose of the tool is, can you use it without any extra explanation?
.
.
like, if you have s0, you can tell it to simulate 10k time and then check what's the avg pulls to get s1
and then tells you the results
and it simulates pulling on one banner
like you set up a base scenario
it's pull simulation for valk
no hurries
i'm updating my site now that it's back up, and i'm using the images you posted earlier to also back update, but i don't see 4.9 supply
<@370438895965306882> do you have 4.9 supply image?
<@964806731471405086>
alright, lmk if you understand the purpose and how to use it
the lock there should be fine
it should be secure now
oh if you f5
it's the same thing <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
when i did it in python
if you remember a while back
ik it's not https yet, i'll look into it right now
and then, anything you find confusing or dumb lmk <:okk:1058108494995263539>
like, loading at all
lmk if the site is working, for once
it's a test to see if the elements explain itself enough without me explaining it
you don't really need to look for bug, this isn't a test for like, making sure it works
if anyone wants to test feel free too
aster and jerma?
my 2 test subject then is
alright i think i got it
alright it'll take a lil bit while i set my server back up
one smart and one dumb
the valk gacha simulation stuff
i'll need 2 people to help test out
okay i'm setting my site back up
eon?
in the ways you'd least expect
it's the combination of RC and HB
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
don't leave the boss for me, if i hate it i won't bald it
i'll take it only if it's with no expectations
that's kinda nuts
-1 from 6s
i was going to ask for someone's acc since i don't have kiana elf
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
nevermind then
oh yeah this is the shit boss
HoT immortal
that looks fun as fuck
how close is that to cap?
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
i know nothing of like normal people shows
i have no clue sorry
we all contributed to it
it's group art
aw thank you but it's not me, it's us
like he's having a turbo headache
where he's massaging his head
where's the gif of that one guy from that that one office show
see
no heki warms my mind
salmon, orange, lighter orange and red
this chat is really warm
and we got a few broken support in that time
5+ patch
dist had been constant for like
it's just weird that it's out of nowhere
i mean i'm sure they do
but us, we just got a random spike out of nowhere for fun
i feel like CN been steadily increasing
but i'm mostly surprised by how high nirv dist got out of nowhere
i'm surprised that the case too
oh RL isn't up?
is high 460s
the highest i've done
honestly i can imagine
yeah i think it's doomed
it was turbo cbt with anything else
with PE they weren't that bad back on dist i was playing
oh idk how bad those are
do you even care about nirv?
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
but if that's the issue then no that absolutely tracks
so that's why i was surprised
i misread it at first, i understood it as previous lead interpreting thing people say in a ridiculous way, like making issue of a lot of stuff on bad faith
yeah that makes sense
yeah nevermind that tracks
oh wait was it being turbo horny?
i guess it makes sense given the situation but i wouldn't expect from knowing them
the previous armada lead you mean? huh damn
i'm only interested if it is/isn't one person, the previous armada lead <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
can i ask who was the previous lead being ridiculous on the stuff they were saying or is that too much gossip? <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i see then, so lead is not only armada leader, that clears up
<a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
<:KianaDumb:909232418052014171>
but i guess vice is vice
i thought it was like vice
oh wait, lead is armada leader?
i thought you were leader for a while now
i didn't know any about this though, how recent are we speaking?
that sounds potentially rough
i see
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
yeah that's monka then
oh shit are people leaving because of the toxicity?
scary <:OttoScared:992640786963386479>
can't even tell someone to kill themselves
woah gresham so strict over at sols
so that people can use it for now, even if it's ugly
i'll do some small fix and i think i'll figure out hosting
it's ugly but it's working <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
it's not broken cause it never worked <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i didn't even implement it and i dunno how to do it
or more like
and i dunno how to fix it
also the progress bar doesn't work
the current rank is not working yet <:okk:1058108494995263539>
ugly for now but it takes inputs mostly!
that's kinda insane
a 5th loses her more lp than a 1st gains
she's 4th, she went 5th and that was -36lp
lv1 in league <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i kinda love that all of their acc are like
holy fuck i'm so hype for her
or does she have to hold it?
hit rank 1 at all?
what was the thing with robin?
<a:WHAT:1068133759158849567>
that's supposed to be 1-100% but i multiplied by 100 for no reason <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i'm working on the pull things again
huh these chances look weird
i just got hype
yeah i don't believe it anymore
🚮
nevermind
i think it's fanmade set/fake
it could be sus
maybe
it's time
<@180679257851166721>
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i spent my 14s playing runescape, no normal person plays that
i wasn't, and i didn't spend my 14s with normal people my age
is this how normal 14 yo are like
maybe keilopoints would work with him
wait
it hurts my head
he's a zoomer heki
did you pull hare?
fair
what the fuck even
i can't even be disgusted i'm fucking going crazy about it
<a:AA_Gab_Bow:914213000594980964>
sorry
oh ok
<@309634550273933314> i feel like i didn't get a reaction from you for that tweet
they're in blustorm i'm pretty sure <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i know their sensei btw
i'm so lost
is their plan again ?
what
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i legitimately don't even know what to say
it sounds like crystal makes heki feel like heki feels to us <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
is that the effect they have on heki?
or bad
sounds good
i am unable to decipher that
crystal is like a heki for heki
LMFAO that's kinda cool actually
good for him honestly
the second series he's also only writing?
oh hmmm i guess i see it
kaguya but with onk characters <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
yeah it's a weird angle, a lot of why i liked kaguya is because the characters are so goofy and likeable
is he actually doing 2 weekly manga at the same time?
god is that man alright
are you enjoying it?
i guess i'll check it out
is it out already?
i dunno if i'm into that from the premise alone <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
that sounds weird
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
so surprise me aka
i don't know how it's possible
yeah i mean the only thing i can do is hope that aka is going to pull it off
like the sexual assult victim becomes serial killer is ???? alright then
i'll still not like it
like even if it is a he got raped by 12 so he become a turbo villain
from what the foundation is right now
will make me satisfied
i think any angle at all tbh
it's aqua's dad
i think you're talking about aqua
idfk honestly
but if the story takes it as him gaslighting the girl
i took it as like, him being a broken guy cause he was raped at 12
i dunno what's the angle honestly
yeah he was 12
yeah
and when they go through it i'll hate it
like i feel like this series didn't need an ultra megavillain and idk if there's any explanation besides that
and i'm scared to learn
i don't even know what's up with hikaru
some people are like edgy aqua has done nothing wrong, he's kinda hot
it's honestly sad, current chapter it feel like i'm reading a different manga from their reaction
and it's kinda doomed
i went to onk reddit cause i wanted to see overall opinion on chapters and stuff
that's the good ending
yeah i get what you mean now
it's so over the top
i mean sure but he acts like what a 12 y/o thinks a jerk is
depends on ranks i think
people just think it's a jerma bit
but every time you try to come out
like imagine faking being jerma
LMFAO that'd be funny if it was the actual truth
yeah i am mentally sane
oh
go to therapy?
maybe i just need to choose to be normal
you know maybe i am faking it
that's what my mind tells me all the time
idk wtf is up with him
larping hard
current aqua is like
nah
she feels like a normal ass person when you put her side to side with aqua <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
the least weird character from onk
kana is like
oh.
like in a good way?
yes
cause that kana is really cool
was she really cool
90% of server i'm in is for emote
if you want emote ig
<:KanaSmug:746141929200418826>
reallymad
they removed my favorite kana sticker from the onk server
oshi no ko girl
most cis person in wfpr
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i'm looking to get rid of mine, not gather more
it's weird on embeds right now for some reason
dw
nah that's just discord fucking up embeds
i meant like first time
15 tries before making a quote for some godforsaken reason
everyone else need like
literally the only sane person in wfpr
good job
yeah <:okk:1058108494995263539>
so if you wanna do image quote, the text is the link
it can't do attachment
first word after ,. is the quote name, everything after is the quote
,qdel 1892002
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
fuck
oh wait
> like this?
that's some sick 5 cost design
toxic
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
damn that's some crazy design
okay i see
ooooh
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
so he scale with more champ you have?
huh that's interesting
i guess that makes sense
oh i see
but that skill sounds annoying as fuck
that passive is like, worse? rainy janna
what cost was he?
<a:chadn:977032787087482962> not even a real champ, destroys the meta
damn <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
how was it?
but i didn't actually see it
i remember reading that and going wtf
so they only have so much option as theming goes
since he's new he prob doesn't have many skins
huh that's interesting actually
🥐
or some shit?
ksante
oh
black dude?
me too <:PeepoSitFishing:1058108500775018596>
true <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
<a:collapse:1063550316332720148>
i guess that makes sense from what you said though, that all server very very top is around same skill level
huh that's interesting
is worlds like, complete steamroll by CN player?
that's kinda sad for worlds
jesus <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
that's kinda nuts
yeah i was thinking like, isn't it better to do only one server, but if they have that many player
oh i see
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
kinda nice from the players that they actually follow through with that
that makes sense
oh but it is closed then
cause if there's not even nda is it even leak?
is it like nda beta? or like ffa pbe?
that's so crazy, what even is the point of having that many league server
that's like, what kr has for league right
that's cool
whoa
oh that's fun
so now i'm <:sussge:968897150249484389>
i saw some rando on twitch chat go set 9 looking sick or smth
maybe i figure out how to look at nga
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
ruby where would you find tft leak if there was one? like reddit/twitter?
so true <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i don't see what's the big deal about it
i've failed more times than most people tried
that's actually what happens more often than me actually getting the cap score
i end up not getting the 0s/cap even after trying a fuckton
i've lost count the amount of week
i mean like why would you not getting it matter
i don't get it but sure
sure
no pressure
only if you wanna prove it to yourself that you can 0s tho
i don't mind
my mei set is even affixed for sns since i'm not playing gc <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i have the stats, it's not too bald either <:okk:1058108494995263539>
try on my acc
if you wanna prove it to yourself
that sucks
oh
did you try?
i dunno why everyone complains about honkai, i just did all the fun and interesting content for the week in like half an hour <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i got the kallen 946
i just did
even if you didn't talk about it i would still look up about current patch n stuff
i'm just too interested in honkai meta still <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
not really sorry
i do know way more than a retired player should
that's weird
huh
and then went
gave an answer
i like that i like
and helping picking out the best one
you should ask them what are the things they're considering
but i don't think answering in a vaccuum is helpful
i would say that mkp is definitely not bad
oh yeah in that case the question is harder
for now
turbo sleeper
it's HoF and FT
i don't think mkp is in bp
spending?
do they mean
wait mkp is in bp?
yeah
6.8 will be IO
<:shrug:877047647511384064> it's not bad
HoF rank up are nice but you can't spend all your balls on it
IO rank up kinda meh
though tbh the bp is kinda sleeper
3s HoS can use it more often
i think it's pretty niche <:okk:1058108494995263539>
this doesn't sound that big -> can't follow ref -> maybe i really do need the 13 def actually
that's how i always do
then you try <:okk:1058108494995263539>
and if you notice like turbo damage diff
i wouldn't bother with levelling it for now
relatable
oh are you suffering on mat?
it's not like it even matter though
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
same but i'm not logging in to test
from wording i would assume yes
we just gathered a brand new support from our valk farm, let's figure out if she's similar or not to the last batch
mihoyo dev go pick up new valk in the valk tree
they think that like
<:life:1001518241610485781>
from my knowledge from tet ruby talking about nikke
i think pilgrim is like class thing
i only have like 2 more weeks of college before semesters done too <:okk:1058108494995263539>
not worth the trouble rn for set 8.5 but maybe i work on that soon in prep for set 9
similar to kqm library
so it can be actually in a place instead of all word of mouth
for all the weird niche knowledge
i would like to make like an encyclopedia
do that with all class, and then test every champ to check their class <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
grab a tank, play enough round with it to note what items it rolls
i mean we can test it
i guess it doesn't really matter in general
and what champ are what class
like what item are what class
do we have that info somewhere?
yeah it would tilt me for sure
i guess that make sense, i've never seen clone roll too troll item
oh wait does clone run same system?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i remember boxbox tilting cause lucian roll ad item
each champ has a category and each category has a list of item?
wait so how does lucky gloves work?
that's so fucking funny
wait actually?
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
at early stage <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
if i'm extra downbad
i actually sometimes do frontline her
good base stats too
i'm actually obsessed with shiv morg
that's my trick
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
good use of one's time
balding for v1 score
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
but it feels p balanced rn
maybe like earlier on the set when every patch had 1 good comp and you were tired of it
for random patch
yeah the type of player who play on pbe sounds weird
so i'll keep that in mind when i play set 9 pbe
i have no clue how good quality random pbe games are though
i meant like, for for fun patch, i don't wanna go to pbe for that, it looks like not all of the changes got pushed yet either
oh that sounds nice
if i hit it during for fun patch i wouldn't count it
oh so i guess i have less time than i thought to hit masters
also mess with ranked?
is for fun patch
i don't wanna play pbe normals <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
idk what else is there though
apparently it also can drop unit
for fun patch is already in pbe
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
<@180679257851166721>
sorry
i'm already a girl irl
so i can document stuff
i actually wanna fall to the lowest rank
you always wished for
i'll make the sinful 2 refs
but you ain't gonna cap a good abyss ref if it has 2s GC and you don't <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
you can use it as a basis
i'm gonna say no
<a:GAMBA:920724874467606608>
if i think there's something fun to do i have no problem coming back, but i'll just leave when it stop being fun again <:okk:1058108494995263539>
also i've said before, i'm not quitting over ideology reason, i left cause the game stop being fun
i've actually played this for a while before
believe it or not
what?
SK one i think
i did another 946 earlier too, it was the uh
this week for sure <:clueless:973756617109676032>
doing dailies and shit, not for me
even if i wanted, i couldn't
i'm not actually playing though
i have it installed now if i wanna login for funsies
pretty easy <:okk:1058108494995263539>
than i expected
it's way less bald
<@180679257851166721>
item pop off feels kinda busted
and item popping off from carousel
like carousel timer
that i didn't know was that recent
there's also a lot of small thing
oh what the hell
who even are half of these champ
it's so wild to me, it's like watching tft fanfic
or do we go 13.12 set 9?
but we're finishing off this set on 13.11
also is this set shorter than usual? i saw that like 12.x went until like 12.23 or something
???? what the fuck
some of the champ look nice though, that zoe skin looks good
also hacker was a fucking plague huh
i was watching a few vids on set 8, it's so weird to me seeing like whole new champ <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
<a:NOTED:805343536412229642>
i'll take note of that
oh that makes sense
he's like turbo contested though, i feel like
i wanna try for 3s ekko one of these games
ekko kinda nuts
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> yeah i can see that
that sounds toxic
that i think can see some use
mascot/ox are the other 2 beside infiniteam
it'd be turbo broken
i think if they were though
yeah i was about to say
infiniteam spat is craftable? that sounds pretty good
maybe i should under some circumstance
i actually don't even know what are the recipes for it besides fon
i never pick spat
honestly yeah
but that too i think!
i don't understand the second line
HELL YEAH HAPPY NEW YEAR
that's not a hunt
aster <:Woah:765639006218092554>
the only thing you can do is ask for them to give you more card
you're in mihoyo's hands tet
like at all
you talk like you can do anything
whoa that's 100 x 1 x 5
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
they're all dorm bonus
i have no clue what my account has
maybe
i can probably afford those stigs i think
cool i'll log in to do it then <:okk:1058108494995263539>
is it this week?
i kinda wanna try that
looks baldy
i think i went to sleep
keep on <:okk:1058108494995263539>
nvm then
oh
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
and not when we ping you to shit on you about pulling on hare
so you show up now
is there a space chip husk? <:BatChest:1021180786650648608>
guess no more blockade husk <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
ER husk
3s husk
i would also count like
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
6 different husk?
like fucking
so what are we up to now
or just hitcount?
new mechanic?
huh
oh?
oh ok
AF weapon has direct damage?
wdym? ice husk = type hitcount husk?
i'll repeat my joke <:okk:1058108494995263539>
in arena version, during phase 2, the game WILL CRASH AND STEAL YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION AND DOXX YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE A VALK WITH THE LETTERS S H I G U R E K I R A IN HER NAME
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
90% chance it's for MA bs
every time someone pull 2 set
80% of them
and i had to stop myself so hard to not just answer L play better next time to like
i was reading the rant megathread
yeah <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
my god
and that shit is down trodden
i check in competitive tft reddit
you know i thought runescape was the most negative community i ever knew
<a:eavFEET:958172235884036106>
streamer i'm watching has a ton of feet emotes
thoughts?
<:eavFoot:851534534968344626>
it's been a while since i got some alcohol
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
the eli special
aw hell yea
i'd be down earlier on the week tho, i love it since it's my meal for the whole week
and over here you can't really ask for a few piece, only option is whole pizza
so i can't have a ton of leftovers
like i'm leaving college city tomorrow
i'm not doing pizza sorry
what should i get?
i'm hungry since i didn't eat all day
jesus
i wasn't even born in 2013
and  that's my idea of dota player too
everyone that plays tft is pushing 30
i guess it makes sense
tft player is obsessed with them
oh dota also the itch?
i don't get how these are thought through
someone did :sexo: with <:xdd:1089308231496638574>
oh it's not in discord yet
discord thinks i'm doing c:
oh when i do :c:
i wanna have an L emote
can you have 1 character emoji?
:l:
L
!steal <a:WHAT:1068133759158849567>
cringe
oh ok
<a:WHAT:1068133759158849567>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
!steal <:KeiloSit:1101246919789002752>
cool
<a:rawr:1108875431286943744>
it just adds to this server
i see
oh
i don't get it
rawr
hi carl
bonk
oh it's you that have that emote
<:peepoFlushed:674391303534149633> raw damage?
i'm a wiw ow f2p pwayer
it was too expensive to me eli
what if i don't have the event stig?
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
if it's heki we'd go cool grab me a pepsi in the way there
it's cause you're one of the only one who listen
5k AL ready for honkai 4
if i didn't, there'd be some people here who would be saving up AL to this day <:okk:1058108494995263539>
it's in my job description to annoy people when they're doing bad decisions
idk why i keep thinking it's tailgrab <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
wait it's <:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
get deez instead :tailgrab:
lumi is going to get holmes T instead of buying GC card <:okk:1058108494995263539>
for fun
prob the next few valk will have some kind of that gimmick
not only seele tho
i mean yeah i think it's pretty clear too
in arena version, during phase 2, the game WILL CRASH AND STEAL YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION AND DOXX YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE A VALK WITH THE LETTERS S H I G U R E K I R A IN HER NAME
that's so fucking cool mihoyo
okay
???????????????????
and then immediately after they go oh no!
hmmm what if we make a valk that completely bypass that annoying  mechanic? wouldn't that be sick
and then 2 patch later they go
they repeatedly go oh shit we gotta have a new mechanic because our valk is too op
like actually
mihoyo sometimes feels so fucking 3head
man
yeah that sounds busted
it just ignore defences?
it still scales with stats
so it isn't set amount like you said <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
oh i see
or i guess how to understand it
i just dunno what's special about this
oh i know that
i don't get it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
less flexibility for future upgrade
isn't that just worse than scaling with atk?
hmm
i mean
or % on enemy?
to herself?
is it the weird qte ult she has?
she has a new mechanic?
and start with DA, a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> timestop for every ult
they could start doing that for a lot of valk
like how flamescion has timestop every time she sneeze
it could be the start of the new gimmick too
or they come up with a new gimmick to start doing DK revival
so it's either her
and the only remotely useful valk right now who doesn't have it is DA
is add time stop to ult
but yeah, the thing that all DK revival does until now
<a:chadn:977032787087482962>
when the weapon that doesn't even exist irl breaks one of your gamemode beyond repair
7tr ain't even real <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
AF pri has never and i think will never happen in story
who cares honestly
psy is the one element that doesn't have good ignite, not that it matter
DA DK + g4, psy GH WT
same as JK patch
we could have fire patch
that's horrendous
GH would probably be psy i think
out of all of those
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh
what even is fire right now?
psy HoF
mech SpA
bio DA
qua v2v
ima END
is DA
the only valk left
more DK revival?
do you think we'll ever even get
the only way i see g4 fire release is alongside another release, is all
i mean yeah
i mean i'm down
END?
i don't see another patch as cheap as MPE ever again
the only way i see them doing g4 fire for GH is if they also release some dk with gacha gear alongside it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> you think so?
actually i guess it kinda matters, GH on discount would be easy to skip for non simp, but GH on WT would be kinda busted
she won't be free
they aren't though?
and i'm like
and people go omg no way they wouldn't be that nice
i bring up that there's a very real possibility that new HoS is going to be WT
yeah i don't think it realistically matters for 99% of playerbase
so it's up for mihoyo's whims
we have niche dps often on discount like v2v but we also have new AE like HRT on there
like MPE is a dps on WT, but we also have JK which is kinda like HoS of ice also on WT
we have precedent for both, kinda
then i could easily see them going either way on which is the discount and which is the WT
and GH is ignite dps
if we assume AT is new hos
i'm not sure in the order either tbh
<:terismug:652765929490612245>
i don't think they're teasing shit out for then
is on next cny
after these
the next big patch
and also think about it like this
<:shrug:877047647511384064>
teaser still a teaser
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i don't think that matters to me
you could maybe argue teri isn't but i think she is too
there's no way the hua one ain't a teaser imo
mihoyo kinda has a hard on for throwing out all content they have planned asap
nah to me it's from how previous teaser -> release went
but they did it
i didn't see HRT -> END + flamescion so soon
like if you're talking story, don't underestimate them <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i dunno if i see them holding off on them even longer
it's been so long since they teased them
to me it's more from like a
it's different
FR is allowed cause she's pretty though
i don't think LK new suit is going to not be sp <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
6.8 is discount S
6.9 is S + elf
7.0 is WT
like
idk the order
there's no way it isn't teri hua seele
imo 6.8 6.9 7.0
there's a reason i was coin issue
so every patch i had like 5 new set to level
MA player so i was pulling p much one of everything
like when i started catching up, i was catching up hard
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like i could easily get 4 new pri in a patch
god i must've been going through so much metal now that i think about it
that's a patch <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i don't think there's any excuse for not helping on asterite needs when you're still suffering with 3s sp valk and metal <:okk:1058108494995263539>
are you like done with spending asterite besides GC?
o...nly?
that sounds right
oh ok
who's crystal
morg salesperson <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i know laser and 2 tf comp <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
cause same
maybe you're a bad influence
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i don't get how shit like that happens <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i think the most highroll i've gotten was the one 3s ww game
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
i saw an urgot on 3-3 today <a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
calc based on asterite value <:okk:1058108494995263539>
oh wait i misread that
my mom called me that once
since no one is pulling hare, no one else will know <:okk:1058108494995263539>
it's also like our own secret inside joke
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i'm getting hyped by the minute <:life:1001518241610485781>
?
when do we start getting set 9 info again
like it sounds really cool, but how often can you even practice it
maybe i was in like a very obvious choice like me playing gadgeteen already and getting gadgeteen heart, not even recognise other choices
i don't think i was offered it once to this day
same for like some very game changing augment like built diff
cool learn a lot for the next time in 50 hour it happen <:okk:1058108494995263539>
and then i lose at it cause it's the first time i encounter and i go
i play for 50 hours before encountering it once
but in the other hand, it just feel like shit to me
like in one hand i'd rather shit like that at least be rare
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i hate it
get me out
but even some rare stuff like first carousel fon i'm like
yeah idk how i feel about stuff like that, i wanna say that it's okay if it's really rare
<a:DIESOFCRINGE2:993217039453917244>
and i was like cool i didn't deserve this <:okk:1058108494995263539>
and egg popped and fixed it for me
is when i fuck over my econ for fun
yeah, the time that i went this is kinda bs huh
but now i think i'm the other way, i prefer normal <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
when i started, i prefer it over normal carousel
do you dislike egg carousel?
the only set i know is this, and from how people say it's only up from here <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
but tbh it won't take much for me to be happy
yeah i do have high hopes
it sounds kinda cbt but i think i wanna get there eventually
you actually have to be a beast, sounds really hard for a streamer to d oit
and apparently it's even worse than you'd imagine, from what he talk it sounds like there's some specific measure put into player when they hit 1k elo to make sure it doesn't stay like that for too long
boxbox talked about how when he talked with mort, he explain some of how high elo, 1k+ actually works
yeah i can imagine
though i think that's the fun way to play tft for like most player
yeah i'd agree i think
by being the last one standing <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
emily wang gonna end up t1 the same way i ended up t10 in MA
most sane honkai player
guy is entertained by jiggling keys
yeah that's what i'm saying
<a:chadn:977032787087482962>
the only player sane enough to stay at 2s MA
actual gigachad
i'm so proud
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
don't ask
because i've done VC crusher bastet
that i know for sure
what even is he cooking
i'm honestly kinda bewildered
i'm 99% sure that the holder has the one to freeze <:okk:1058108494995263539>
is renegade last one alive only proc when it's the last champ alive or when it's the last renegade alive?
it's samira kayle lucian but mortdog talked about it in the patch review so you probably already knew <:okk:1058108494995263539>
oh wait i got it wrong
dunno which ezreal, just what i heard from robin <:okk:1058108494995263539>
also <@180679257851166721> apparently the samira bug also affect kayle and ezreal
tft <:okk:1058108494995263539>
maybe i can think that as a line too, since it's often uncontested, asol 2/3 with a random comp for fun
only as transition dps
in my elo
it feels turbo broken but not a lot of people play him
he's so fucking strong
yeah idk how i feel about him
unironically i don't think i ever seen someone build it in my games
maybe i become jaxdd one trick with this buff, it sure as hell ain't gonna be contested <:okk:1058108494995263539>
the play really is 6 brawler then tho?
i'll keep that in mind if i ever get thrown a jaxdd game
i thought big data was ww carry <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm gonna be honest i've only actually read about 10% of hero augment
huh that's interesting
yeah that makes sense then
oh ok
it's like a built in guinsoo right
would you do that even with jax carry augment?
guinsoo though? that's interesting
he has a hard on for rfc for some reason
yeah, even as a not great player i can tell that he tunnel way too hard in certain item and build
jax just gets stuck on a random frontline for 10 second <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
yeah
even hitting he looks so weak compared to other comp
6 brawler rfc qss + damage item like jg
maybe boxbox is building him wrong though, he does something like
that sounds right
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
idk if the jaxdd buff is enough, boxbox keeps forcing it and it looks doomed
i saw the patch notes earlier, it seems like a reaaaally light patch
oh sick thank you so much
sounds annoying
nevermind i change my mind already
i might log in just to spend all on trying to get the b piece <:okk:1058108494995263539>
wait so when is the hrt banner?
then there's no competition
now though, since they'd cost around the same like you said
so comparatively, s2 hrt was pretty good for it cost
hrt rank was way cheaper on release because of the discount banner
well, a thing that matter a lot is the cost
and afford 3s on the next new elf
but even then, i'd rather save a few patch
maybe if it's your first switch cd reset
that i'd even bother with pulling 2*
i actually can't think of an elf
you just gotta focus on the stuff that give better return first
don't get me wrong, the hrt ranks sound pretty good
then you have your answer <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i don't know what that means <:okk:1058108494995263539>
then i'd def go 4s kiana before hrt ranks <:okk:1058108494995263539>
idk how kiana elf is but if she is avg elf
that s2 sounds like less than most 3s elf give
what about 3/4s kiana?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i dunno how big trio rank are tho
generally i wanna say i care more about 3 and even 4s elf than valk rank up
that is true, your knowledge is trash
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
but i'm not confident in my knowledge past CN
i wanna say no valk of the trio are awk
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
if she doesn't, she's not
then she's awk
if she has a pink bar below her icon
on the valk select screen
70 awk
30 non awk
have you tried playing better ?
i really don't see it
wait so is it real that it's based on ely or was it a lie all this time
i fit right in
i'm so glad to be part of the dalao society
i can't wait
that sounds awful
jesus christ
or is it just o<:xdd:1089308231496638574>
is :oxdd: an emote
he's peep
i've named him -> <:staree:1087713200843276299>
okay i figured it out
i don't play very flex, so capping board isn't hard to figure out, but i can imagine <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah i see
but if the answer is yes then i could've been going 9 all this time <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm always like i can go 9 but i'll be at 10 gold so should i even bother
hmmm if that's the case then it's way easier to go 9 than i thought
oh really?
like 20-30?
ideally how much money do you wanna have saved up to roll on 9?
that's so hard though
yeah i guess that makes sense, can only expect to hit if you're going 9
i just slammed the ap items on morg instead
like one of my recent game i got morg 3 cause uncontested and even after rolling at 9 only 1 morde
hmm so you don't go for it unless you're forced because of items
like it's sooo rare i actually hit a morde 2 on lasercorp, and morde 1 feels kinda like shit
or do you use an item holder until you hit it
what do you do? do you just not bother with it most of the games
where there's 5 cost dps you wanna ideally itemise
so like if you're playing something like lasercorp or infiniteam
she was already turbo bleeding to death <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
i feel better now that you say that, i was helping a learning streamer and told her she should roll the fuck down on 7 for 1 ww but some other people wanted her to go 8 to look for it
yeah same
even fast 8 is too hard for me
i'm sure if you're good you can pull it off but i can't <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i can't imagine playing it
even if it was good
in this meta though, fast 9 sounds impossible
i guess i could see it being good in theory, it doesn't sound good this set tho, so they did it <:okk:1058108494995263539>
like all 5 cost?
what's that
yeah i think i agree, they're kinda lame
do you have any prediction?
yeah i'm not getting there soon <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
chally?
like top 1%?
what do you call top tho
yeah <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i guess that makes sense
maybe i'm not forced to move
high rank in BR doesn't look that slacc actually
sleep well
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
okay i'll give it to you when i get bored of it
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
eli do you wanna take my patch history spreadsheet and maintain it
okay then
i see
oh
wait normal team? trio? how do you do ignite?
i guess 2023 there's no more skill in AKA
do you run END HRT CN?
how bad is it?
oh god
like s2 vs s0?
and then sanguine was the second
pta was the first like that
it's your fault actually
back in full force
lol you thought they were stopping with the pisshit: redemption naming scheme
share?
wait actually?
me too
i don't like it
there's too many blue crystallum
<:BatChest:891596027767975986> oshi no ko refernece?
god i'm so smart
nvm
that's the past one
oh
thank you
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
lake blue
dorm shop
can you check
fuck chip space
6.7?
with chip space
when is the thing they're doing
cool
oh
i just wanna keep the patch history spreadsheet up to date
that's it for now i guess, so it's chapter 37?
okay
huh do you remember if kosma is the same?
or something else in game
and if aponia MA boss is just called aponia
the name
like, 37? 36-ex?
i wanna know what's the new story chapter
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
same
what the hell
honkai has words?
wait
do you have any predictions at all
:wokejj:
oh yeah lw makes sense
what other glove item is good for her? guardbreaker?
it is interesting though, how often would you even put more glove on her?
i think <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah, it's something like her crit rate is reversed on her skill with ie/jl
<@309634550273933314>
what about reddir r/kendallroy
who's that
i def don't feel like w/e diamond skill level is supposed to be
yeah i guess that's about the best i can do <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i'll probably have to move to NA when i hit masters or smth
i'm insecure with my rank, BR feel like for fun server, i don't even know if anything matters here <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
do you know if there's any way to like compare rank in other server?
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
he__ me
_e__ me
_e__ _e
heki messages about to become spin the wheel
ok
they just have good time fracture
obviously
have you never seen any 0s kill? they're not actually 0 second
which is why proper time fracture management matters
time fracture affects it
MA timer that matters is the one in the middle of the screen
yeah i'm offended
this time or this time
time
cool
do you mean the time in the ending screen or the MA time?
okay, what do you mean by that
i'm offended by your lack of knowledge, i'm not sniping for you
nevermind
yeah i can if no one else wants
<@781539392039682058>
oh
i can
abyss close?
what's late
in tft
decay a thing
also is stuff like
or is there legit 1 d1 player in BR <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
is it like bugged at lower rank
<@180679257851166721> how does this screen work?
oh shit 2 weeks until set 9 pbe? <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
yeah that's nice to know
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
i see, nvm then
i thought it would retroactively apply to ww
is that how that work?
oh wait
i'm thinking that if i check admin early i can put that in and start stacking
do you never pick scaling every 5 seconds?
oh ok
do you ever run 4 admin for lb ap carry?
<@180679257851166721> what are good admin for laser ww
<:peepoAvenger:756228412435333250>
times passes too fast
oh already
surely you'll get it eventually
keep going
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah that sounds right
nevermind
my god
i played that one for a bit and it looked not that expensive
i think they're all gacha
there's like 3 right
which one
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
oh cookie run?
cookie?
so that's his type?
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i'd think the augment was picked wrong instead, not that i went for ug
i already had ug opener by augment pick
really?
but maybe i just go for it anyways
so contested <a:DIESOFCRINGE1:993217010806833245>
idk it didn't feel like the play to go laser there
it was an 8th indeed <:okk:1058108494995263539>
contest the other 2 laser player
maybe i pivot into laser for fun
kayle?
what 1* augment do you pick if you got free ug opener?
lp don't matter <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i'm diamond 4
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
i got some vexes, some pykes
yeah i think i'll go for jhin angle
i mean it matters less than if it was 2* i feel like
it was all 1* augment so it doesn't really matter
i could just not play nasus
idk i'm underground opener
it's a 3* everything comp? <a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
wait
stacks on stacks
<@180679257851166721> how do i play nasus carry
that's turbo dumb
i'm pretty sure i had an IE samira before when trying to play infiniteam, because it's a good item for ez so i was just giving her as an item holder
yeah i heard him complain about that, why even tho that's so stupid <a:AINTNOWAY:1089648683496263831>
<a:DIESOFCRINGE1:993217010806833245>
the oxdd one
i thought it was somehow intended tho, but it doesn't make sense
i got that before
oh yeah
<:staree:1087713200843276299>
🕷️
robin's a spider
8888
besides maybe like tf
that's so sad but honestly that's how i feel with all 4* carry
yeah this meta without 3 cost carry is just <:Deadge:999262205398761542>
he was playing pretty well early on too
yeah i'm watching it, so sad
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
good investment
i've t10 before, gotta spend 3x more to go up 5 spots <:okk:1058108494995263539>
kinda crazy if you think about it though
yeah abyss i have no confidence whatsoever
i think i could peak like t4 or t3 on a good week on a 9s acc in MA
idk how high i could go
i'd be too shameful
honestly that's kinda chad
oh wait he actually took the offer?
<:Shirley:1033784823858339900>
and then velvet accepted and t1 abyss with karto acc right
cause there's 3+ whales who would be willing to lend acc just to prove you wrong <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
the worst place to complain like that
yeah sols is like
me?
not even better than cat
oooh generate some cooking about kira
#HonkaiImpact3rd #SkillOverGear #NoPayToWin #EUPlayer #RL
but still
i don't think i'd have that much fun cause i don't know shit about them
god i wish they brought them back for a weekend so i could try it out
oh yeah that sounds sick
mostly on a really superficial level like <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> the chosen one
yeah i liked it when i was watching people play it
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
did you like chosen?
that they developed this whole thing to be only in the for fun patch in normals
which is kinda nuts to me
they even said that the portals aren't the set mechanic
do we know anything about it yet
the real skillset this set is figuring out the bugs and avoiding the ones that fuck you and abusing the ones that don't
it's in spirit of this set <:okk:1058108494995263539>
they should just do it on the bugged server
what even man
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that's disgusting
so like a mini recurrent eon?
did they try to balance it before the rework? oxdd
it's stupid
i guess i'd believe it
is it?
old oxdd was so toxic
god you look at that and think how it'd be with old oxdd
oh i see, that makes sense
it's just weird then that people can climb so hard forcing that
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah i see, i think i'd agree with that
either first or hold hands 7 8
it's the kind of comp that just turbo loses if it's too popular, you actually can't do shit if you're contested
yeah that sounds right i think
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i spend money, level, hit, still lose to lulu <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
that's how i feel too
yeah that's what i'm going for too, i care very little about early streak, as long as i live
yeah same, i'm playing way more aggro now to save hp
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
lobby is all over the place, if you try to improve your board to not die you'll just end up winning against a shitter
in my elo, it's kinda hard to losestreak and not bleed a fuckton
oh i see, that makes sense
i find myself playing way more aggro early
okay <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
just in general
are you winstreaking more often from stage 2?
i do shiv morgana really often
i see, i'll do that then
shojin runaan sounds stupid
guinsoo runaan is the shit that sounds fun but is probably dog
that's even more broken
oh that makes sense
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
guinsoo runaan tf :wokejj:
does it also stack guinsoo faster?
stack titan faster
that makes sense though
that's really surprising to me, i thought no one used that
really?
oh
rh?
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
eon?
what even then
oh
stuff like bt lw
maybe i'm not hitting as early as i think
can't beat anything
ww1 feels like shit to me
even if i hit ww early
<a:kree:809653433455214632> it's so hard for me
which i guess is worse
i just had a random pyke
oh no i'm not playing the hacker version
probably highroll, i picked the pyke reroll augment too to hit more stuff <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
idk how much of it was highroll or just me picking the comp when only i was playing all the units, i hit like gnar sona morg 3
since it got me a lot of lp last patch and my diamond promote game was a highroll? gnar game
i'm very biased towards gnar
gnar can't do shit if you're not the only one playing, if you can't hit like everything 3* you just lose to anything <:okk:1058108494995263539>
and i just try to pick the least contested one
tf (oxdd or spell), infiniteam, lasercorp, gnar
that makes sense, my 4 comp right now are
day 37 of tet being incapable of reading channel names
this patch is fucking weird
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
<@524782681389793280> <@180679257851166721>
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
because the last mob nets you 200 points when you kill it
there's one that you can't precision snipe
a lot of them are really weird
there's 2 mei fat ass in there
<@309634550273933314> have you seen this yet 
triple support is prob just going to be the 3 most recent one
yeah i think she won't do much with the shield time
honestly yeah
than we had in dps a year ago
we have more coverage in supports
<:neko_van_woah:809286740489666581>
will be possible now
imagine how many ice support teams
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
this one?
<:o7:1099354934320840765>
that one guy in specific is living a revenge story against hare
you can barely even say it's maincord
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i get it but damn <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
poor hare
my god, that's kinda sad
yeah <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that makes me pretty sad that that's the read the character is getting and honestly i can't even say they're that wrong from current chapter
some people are calling him the kira of the new generation <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it's so weird <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
he didn't come off this edgy on that scene in the manga, did he?
yeah he's close to triple the age of puberty, maybe it's time <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i also p much never watch anything, original is way more likely to be good from my experience too
i'm only watching the anime cause i'm watching it weekly with friends
it doesn't even follow much from what he's been doing until now
like to me it feels like he's being forced into playing a villain
i actually have no fucking read on aqua's character
i didn't mind this chapter until aqua went joker mode
i'm worried for the series decisions ever since akane not playing ai in the movie <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
me neither, i'm just trying to see the bright side <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i guess i'm happy if i see more focus on ruby
yeah idk <a:WHAT:1068133759158849567>
very efficient work
whoa the waitlist is already up to me? <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
me when i'm deciding whether or not to snipe in abyss
if you don't do it during the day, you have it all to spend in the night
you're like a small battery that needs to throw your charge away
i do have a theory about it
why not, you see
but in the living room at 3 am when i'm the only one awake
i've unironically done that too, not in my room cause i share it with 2 sisters which are usually sleeping
that's respectful i think
respectful even
or are you polite
runs around at 3am screaming
tet are you one of those cats that like
heki your mind amazes me
cool
what even do you get at ar44
L
okay i'll give you a little chocolate
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> what do you want as a gift
it's her birthday
<]:3
that's vriska
:38
i know how to make a cat with huuuuge boobs
my mind is open
whoa
<:3c:397254733380845578>
that makes a lot of sense
you're fucking with me
really???
is it supposed to be a sad cat
i don't understand :3c
i'm gonna be honest
i'll sign up for the aster waitlist of giving a shit
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
no it's a rundown place
which is living in my head
there's one tumblr post
me too
don't people do the opposite?
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
it's supposed to come to me now
i think real hard about $1000 dollars a day/day all the time
i did the sigma grindset thing even
yeah i worked hard for it
it is about $1000 dollars a month
everyone else tho, up for debate
true, if the person is me, then they deserve it
since tet is herrscher of boobs
you could be the herrscher of cock
take me for example
mostly irl tho
sometimes i'm just like god i just don't care
but i don't even care about that anymore
at one point i was like, worried that me pretending was a shitty thing
yeah it's a lot of work
oh it already exists
i don't know how much of my empathy is actual normal person empathy or years of training myself into forcing me to feel what i think is empathy <:okk:1058108494995263539>
okay you can have a little chocolate then
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
what is the opposite of a tsundere?
okay what if i tell you i love you and then don't give you a little chocolate
the dance?
what am i
what if i tell you to go fuck yourself and also give you a little chocolate
i've comitted enough sins
i mean it matches your pfp
everything i do is moral, everything i don't do is immoral, my standards are objective and provable
<:CSMSocietyAki:760969174049882202>
i'm immoral cause my dad says so
but they retconned it in the anime
was so emo
his hairstyle on this part of the story in the manga
go on, tell tet if she can fuck him
yeah you get aqua moral rights then
i don't think we have anyone moral in this server
no you have the aqua pfp
i mean i know, i just don't care
look currently in the manga he's 18 and he looks the same
imo yes you can
<@241051045864800259> can help you with that
wait is that why you wanted to know
but he's reincarnated from a 30 y/o man
i think 15-16 there
i feel like they're retconning it to me more edgy
did you see how they adapted the sweet love scene in the anime?
recent chapter make aqua sooo edgy, i dunno why <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it's weird
i say it seele but i've heard some people call her seele
weirdass comp <:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
i always go 8th when i try
i guess it's just a turbo skill issue of mine then
getting tilted from just enemy comp hasn't happened too much yet, don't think i've seen stuff that feels actually unfair <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
and then 2 other people contested me, and later someone pivoted into it with infiniteam heart on stage 4
the most tilted i was was when i instapick infiniteam crest
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
yeah
i get it that they're small but jesus <a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
there's way too many shit ones
like silver augment
i feel like for some augment
yeah i agree i think
i would too
yeah <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
oh okay
i don't know if i ever noticed it
like at all times?
but isn't it not 18+
wait what, so all pg13 game has to have a notice that it's 18+?
oh i see
stage 4 0 gold 0 3*
i feel like that's my experience playing supers too <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
what's that 18+ on top right
have you tried
i'm glad mihoyo keeps some design principles
mech phys and being awful to crit bald
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
the worst non-qua abyss from my era
jizo is probably like
480 dist <a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
that sounds like fun
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like FT best in slot is like 5 or 6 cdmg
that's surprising that you didn't know that
you're currently talking with the only player who cares about MA and i'm retired
it could be useful in **MA**
did you read what i said carefully?
it could be useful in MA
but the ult didn't come off
yeah so weird, i'm pretty sure you got stig buffs
i don't actually remember how SI buffs are, i dunno if it applied ult buffs or not
it spent sp and went on cd but didn't cast?
weird af, i'm trying to think if there's any other situation where i've seen something like that happen
i haven't won because of it yet <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
that i could've gone 1st instead of 2nd or 3rd if i microd faster for zephyr
i'm pretty bad at it, i've had like 2 or 3 games now
i'd fucking end it all before grinding ranked soloq on a game like that tho <a:AINTNOWAY:1090865114598609018>
that's true, tho a lot to me is about how you need to learn micro + macro and tft is basically only macro
but her ult is in cd <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh is it just like a weird animation tho? i don't see the ult area
is it like the CH cancel? you swap slightly before ult and the ult comes out before swap?
that'd be so fun in MA
how the fuck did you that
whoa that's fucking sick
i wonder if there's any way for me to figure out what the rank equivalent i'd be in like NA
memory issue then, sorry <a:AA_Gab_Bow:914213000594980964>
i was certain it was you
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i've seen someone use that as an emote though
yes
going like awrwrwrwrrwr
looking rabid and really mad
it's what it looks like a very hairy dog, but maybe it's another animal
like an emote i've seen you use before
which is like a dog being held and it's really mad
<@171082989046988800> what's the one emote you use
and i think that's pretty true, less than a month and diamond <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i remember someone saying how much easier tft is to learn than something like valo or league
one step closer i guess
well
like the spin off moba do
do we get anything from high rank at the end of season
i know a few ad item holder but ap i was lost on
okay sounds good <:okk:1058108494995263539>
rolled for mordekaiser, got ww3 instead
it happened <:PogO:1069823713274515487>
also who's a good ap item holder?
<:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
the 5th highest comp in tactics.tool is at 4.3 avg
well you say that
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
nvm changed my mind already, gonna do jax item holder for lasercorp ww
i got a jax on stage one and i wanna try it
is jaxdd good? how do i play it
i'm puzzled to why it's winrate is so high
i don't play it often, i just got a good opener for it
yeah
<a:collapse:1063550316332720148>
i got a 7 and 8 where i got contested on reroll lulu and infiniteam by 2 dudes
i'm ping pong plat 1 plat 2 right now
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
are turbo winning, can go 9 early and do it for funsies
so i guess it's one of the things you only even think to try if you like
yeah ok
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i think the game is sending me a message
i actually never even try cause on my mind it's hopeless
<@180679257851166721> how often do you hit 3 cost 4*
good taste <:okk:1058108494995263539>
not in the game, but for me <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
i want that
wtf
set 9 for sure
<a:collapse:1063550316332720148>
only solution to stuff like that is rework the champ?
i see, i think
hmm <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like come with zhonya?
what was her issue?
everything revolve around those unit <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i can imagine it actually
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
it looked kinda fun from what i was watching
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
and daeja
oh i remember that, boxbox spam shit on you
i haven't played before but i watch stream every so often
what was last set?
poor girl
<a:collapse:1063550316332720148>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i don't think i ever experienced something sus, but i'm low elo
emily was talking about, she was sus in a few games people hitting 3s 4 cost with way too little money
<@180679257851166721> what do you think about the soft pity stuff?
but i'm <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282> about it
doesn't matter that she has no eyebrows since she's not streaming
it's not a downside for her
she's very entertaining
i really like her actually
no downisde
she just said she'd shave eyebrow and not stream for a year
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
emily is shaving her eyebrows if set 9 isn't better than set 8 <a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
yeah i heard on emily stream, i thought she was gunning for rank 1 to steal it from him, not that it was for emily rank 1
ooooh okay
wait wasn't he going to shave his head if he wasn't rank 1
i feel represented
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
i know most of the top end comp look like, but baseline good comps to run, i know very little
my main issue i think is that i have such a limited knowledge on good comps
while only trying to learn playing flex
burn all my lp, go to plat4
maybe i just run it down
suddenly i feel like i don't deserve plat2, i'm awful at playing flex
just ping pong
<a:collapse:1063550316332720148>
that's how my recent match history is like aswell
but it's hard to not bleed out for me before hitting the good 3*s
sona morg gnar
the closest degen comp i have is
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
me too
and winrate is high cause they're already better
it's hard to play, so only better player try
maybe it's one of those thing where like
sounds rough
or do you pivot most of your board when you jhin
do you like play the jhin comp before hitting jhin
yeah that sounds rough
how often is no hero augment
that sounds pretty bad though <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i am confused <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
yeah maybe i should reread the past few chapter
he's always special to me
when isn't sota looking cute
criiinge
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> i'm confused
<:life:1001518241610485781>
kinda cute
and i won't lie, i'm all for it
i think they're preparing for a kyo and ayame ship
indeed
i have 6 manga that come out on sunday <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
but i was too occupied binging something else
i would say i missed all these series
<@524782681389793280> is one now too
<:peepoAvenger:756228412435333250>
yeah tet likes copying my taste
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
the spending cap isn't that high compared to current big patch
like it was one valk with shit rank ups + one set of gear + one elf
that's kinda impressive
even over all the current bs like HoH and trio
really?
<:ohnobirb:948935560091807744>
like, she's china baby so maybe they assume overseas we wouldn't care much about her
i wonder if mihoyo even knows how much people like her
hope everything goes right
there's like 3 people there before her that i don't even know <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and i was surprised she was so low on the main chara list
i went to the ggz site
she's perfect...
you might be able to squeeze it with that comp
how far is that? like how much hp left
but dist is way higher now
that's what i used to run
oh yeah with SA i think is possible
i just dunno what you have if not that <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like 12/12
i'm 100% confident you can beat with SI SNS HoS
HoS dps is prob a good bet
what do you have for phys support
but no rng
they sucked
i end up never buying pack, just premade deck
even though i played tcg when i was in middle school
is this why your mind's weird?
i can't imagine start playing gacha as a toddler
jesus
:buddha:
i'm on a break cause i'm too tilted
same
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
tft?
i wouldn't be able to play more than one
you're playing 2?
is it that they have dental and we don't?
what was it that made you move over to retire?
ssg
i could prob do 2nd but kinda unlucky and stupid positioning
2nd 2 leona 2 <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
1st samira 3
i'm fine with a 3rd
yeah morgana sounds stacked for me
comp that needs a lot of spats, never imagined
i thought you mispoke <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
no i know
spats?
slow roll? ok
vex pyke rammus 3
like 3-1 roll everything for vex 3?
so what's this about vex reroll <:HMM:966625453194485760>
i saw riftwalker emblem and went it's time
no
i got vex on stage 1
that makes sense tho
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
too late
riftwalker emblem
guess i'm doing that too
cause i'm degen
also i do agree that it's getting pretty balanced but that's bad for me
but maybe i misunderstood
the b patch
cause mort was talking like he was rushing patch out for regionals
i think it is
this set is like a rollercoaster huh
jesus
i have no clue how good he is, never saw him before this patch
do you not think viego deserved a buff
i thought it was closest to zac and that sounded meh
but also, i didn't know that that's what it was either
how to make it work
oh i meant more like
i know nothing of it
maybe i try
i have no clue how riftwalker works <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i just had to luck out one win
90hp vs 4hp
i was like turbo healthy
he wasn't even weak tbh
jhin is in a good spot
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
maybe i'm too smart to play braindead comp
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
doesn't work for me
if i don't hit i just complain to mort <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i'll keep that in mind
i see, okay
do you just try to keep one to replace
you run her in the final comp tho no
ashe?
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
i also don't know who to give items before ww
or i guess not rolling aggressive enough for ww
i've been having shit luck about it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that's how i feel about laser ww
looks worth <:okk:1058108494995263539>
they got 7th
<a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753>
ruby is just my master on everything cause i suck
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
<@180679257851166721> how do i play jaxdd
<a:collapse:1063550316332720148>
kinda fucked up
they're not even every stage, i only got one at stage 4
a lot less exciting than i thought they'd be
the portals are
i can easily go like oooh prismatic egg has a 2nd avg? so good
cause i know i'm not good enough to use it well
i'm very careful on using stats
yeah i can see that
it's like utopia tft
yeah i think i can see it <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it's stupid strong
i heard mort said high rank peeps overvalue shiv but i don't see it
that makes sense, still kinda nut that shiv can match up to some radiant and ornn item
<a:whatt:1093365897621680178>
i was like bow > rod > sword > tear
it does make me value tear a good amount more tho
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:998328905561804830>
i don't even know what else would be up there with it, it's pretty nuts
never slammed it and felt bad about it afterwards
it's good early, it's good late
honestly i kinda agree
that's about what i had in mind already, just nice to know whenever i play yasuo that it's good for him
yeah that makes sense
oh i see
i think i heard it's fine on MF too
sheeeesh the glove warrior
i have barely used it so it's not with any proof
hoj is one of the item that is meh on my mind
really?
oh hoj
is there like any other one i don't know about
huh what healing item do you want on him? bt or gunblade?
i've never tried it so i wanna go for it at least once
i see, that's nice, balanced enough
with augment?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i see though, i guess that's true for her being underground
oh wait am i an npc? i think i asked you this before
i've barely played against many kayles that didn't feel like they were just turbo trolling
do you think the kayle revert was deserved?
<a:Smoge:844323909083594763>
i'm getting home soon and i want to get diamond today
tell me of the current bugs then
i'm too degen, i see nerf in patch notes and i go shit i should've been playing that
i should've been there to abuse it 🚮
so they had? that sounds absolutely broken
i did read that but the way i understood is that they didn't even apply the fix
so based
the only player left that deserves MA
i'd find it reeeally hard to skip on her entirely
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i think you're forced to 4/4 gc
<:fricc:1047970291571245086>
and rail them
now for you to conquer the stars
i couldn't think of something else
i'm also proud i guess
as the retired ex-herrscher of retirement
but i did get unsettled on the latest chapter of shibatarian
even stuff like junji ito which is supposed to be very scary i think? i just go huh that's fucked up
it doesn't often really work on me
i'm not very good with horror, in the sense that
kinda scary <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
shibatarian is getting like
<:life:1001518241610485781>
the true intended way to play mihoyo game
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
even gsr ER needs 3800
there's no stopping NA player reaching new heights
the competitive community is on fire
this is tft chat now i guess
no one is playing honkai anymore
<a:ModCheck:1021871712339505232>
that's pretty cool
<:dogkek:664517636524343344> yes actually
and what i definitely need is more projects to start
that sounds like a fun project
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
think fast trainer somewhere
i wonder if there's like
i think it runs fine but trying to do shit on touchpad sounds awful
because i'm addicted
i wanna try out tft on laptop
the competitive community just gets more and more fired up
SEA coming in with the rare beat a single stage to retain
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
good influence on me
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
<:dogkek:664517636524343344> for some reason my top unit is ekko
i dunno much about star rail lore though, i'm not even done with first area lore
oh that's interesting, i'll go give it a read
if i try for it i could prob do it p easily
i've almost 3* her for fun
i feel like no one in my games even bother with her
huh that's good to know
hi tai <a:Wave:995380866832420994>
i'll force him a lot for funsies <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i miss tf
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
so i mean maybe
radiant rfc did get a buff actually
for fun player
<:dogkek:664517636524343344> that's toxic
NA just went down for the patch
oh yeah you're past the patch already
i mean that's nuts, i'd take a 2nd so easy in that spot
yeah league crashed her pc <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
<:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512> kayle carry
60hp is 120hp for me
you're so healthy tho
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
looks like benares
yeah, she's working on a vtuber model, it's very cute
it's not thaaaat hard to get into
yeah kinda
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
tft is the one screenshot ruby sent
this is league normals
interesting to know that that's an angle
i just tried to run gnar when i got that, but i got shit on i think because my tempo was way too slow
is that bbb poppy?
LMFAO i like the kaisa there
if she gets there first, i'll cry
i'm now racing her to masters
and she's a turbo newbie, so it was very entertaining
and then chat bullied her into playing tft
eavlol, she's a league streamer that got raided by boxbox
can't be degen now since aster is watching <a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
maybe
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i guess if you're doing that no matter what <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
prob don't beat 7t HoT with FR but you don't have 7t so w/e
i believe she beats FR in MA, no doubt
i mean like for shit abyss qua
but she is way more braindead so i guess i can see it
i'm surprised that 0/4 HN would beat 3s FR on non-HN boss
if you say so <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
and good pick for less bald on awful boss like kosma
like for HoT on qua MA
i guess idk how the meta is right now, before i quit FR still had enough use to make sense to 3s her
0/4 fr?
why
soon enough you'll be caught up with fr and mpe and no one will be able to tell <:okk:1058108494995263539>
eh it's fine
i see
3s fr feels pretty good tho
i guess you're like close to all of them
but still, did you just stop farming fr and mpe for funsies? what rank are they?
fair
i mean yeah
like between fr mpe jk
with your acc age you should have at least one of those 3s already
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
what have you been spending your AL all this time?
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i don't even know any other bugs besides the gadgeteen prankster and spark ones
the bugfixes are nice <:life:1001518241610485781>
i wasn't able to play it <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
oh they're killing the yasuo carry
i feel like he really does though
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
huh guinsoo was kinda w/e on kaisa
i wouldn't mind aatrox being good
ad feels pretty bad right now
i had a cool game where i natural lulu 3, i itemised her and then swapped her to leblanc 3
<:dogkek:664517636524343344> fair
i see
really? i almost never run 5, 3 feels pretty alright
oh i guess that's true though
poor gal
kayle deserves it
3 gadgeteen buff <:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
it's because i asked <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
oh sheeesh
and never used one
15 crown
you know, i quit with like
what the fuck
sound like mihoyo
oh ok
last patch had patch notes a few days before
that they post it before hand or not?
what's more usual then
huh weird
kinda crazy that all i played until now has p much been only one patch
or is it just the portal shit
isn't it like, tomorrow
wait so do we have patch notes already for next patch?
i wish i could do that
that sounds awful
<:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
and it's still pretty strong
it makes so much more sense
that ox wasn't like it is right now from the beginning
i'm like in shock
tbh i very much get it, to me it's a similar reason why ox was stupid
oh yeah i can see why <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
since we're close to the end of the set, that's the knowledge that will be more useful
i should probably try to learn the item recipe more than unit then
the recipe makes more sense for ga now that you say that
huh i see
like add remove or change recipe
do they change item between set?
i've learned since the last time that shiv is not sword tear though <:okk:1058108494995263539>
half the items i don't know the recipe still
only recently i start to know more trait from unit, like how shen is a defender
i'm still grinding against knowledge wall
yeah that makes sense
this is like, less than 2 week grind, i took a big break after i got plat <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it's way better than i'd ever hope to expect this fast
but now diamond feel achievable
i thought i was lucky getting into plat
yeah that sounds right
am i good enough for plat 1
what's my skill level?
yeah sure
i played sorta badly in general i think but if i hit that it salvage all my error
not even contested
i went 6th, had to roll like 40 gold for kaisa 2 <:okk:1058108494995263539>
okay cool
with morgana on board?
do you still do shiv on kaisa
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
fuck aatrox
he deserves being shit
yeah that's what i've been doing
okay i see
what 4 sg do you go? kaisa rell nilah neeko?
i'm already kinda doing that
oh shit noted
is tier 3 like 3* or cost 3 again?
yeah they're 4 ug now
i see
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
and i'm definitely not
i guess that they did
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
wtf are they doing slamming everything 2-1 while playing underground
me kaisa /deafen
wait true
and i'm plat 2
i'm playing in diamond lobby <:ohnobirb:948935560091807744>
i'll take a screenshot if it ever come up again <:okk:1058108494995263539>
early there were 2 sg player but by the end no one was playing it anymore <:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
weird match in general
yeah idk
still not sure why the item look like that tho
someone had salvage bin, so maybe the zephyr was theirs and they just got rid of it <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah
so i assume it was generated?
i don't see anyone with zephyr on the result screen
i remember seeing a blue outlined zephyr and some other items
it was this game i was in just now
maybe i'm making stuff up <:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
maybe like a light blue outline?
huh weird, idk what it was then
it was definitely not gadgeteen or ornn
but i doubt it was 4 radiant then
i swear i saw someone with like 4 item with funny border on it
is there any other like type of item? besides radiant/gadgeteen/ornn
oh i see <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
some trait?
what are they from?
whoa apparently there's gadgeteen rfc
<@180679257851166721> what are the golden item
giving him a dk <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
that's like
<:life:1001518241610485781>
makes all my want to play tft moba go away
thinking about champ like trynd, jax
yeah it looks crazy
the 9th shouldn't be too special
8 reworks by the time i left <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
asol has already gotten like
dunno why i'm surprised tho
i think it's his ult? looks nuts
on the spinoff from tft
did asol get a rework
like 6 months ago before i quit
it means i love you
wdym
i went for tear
yeah glove feels SO bad
tear glove belt what do you start
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
sounds good to me i'll keep spamming kaisa then
but it is very fun indeed
i feel like i'm going to stop learning if all i do is spam kaisa
yeah i dunno
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it was emily wang, she just went me kaisa /deafen
first time i saw someone do that i laughed my ass off
i don't have any lp to lose <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
i mean i'm plat4
trait and origin or something like that
i thought i didn't get it because it was like
yeah i didn't know that
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282> i see
if i understand it right
tome isn't good if you're vertical
i just need to play absolute horizontal to try and get what i need?
wait no i don't think i do
oh i see <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i had played 6 duelist on the round before i got the tome, so i thought that'd count
or else i either got really unlucky or i had to wait a round
i'm assuming duelist heart isn't an option
i did know that
i didn't
i had 6 duelist and i thought sounds cool i'll get a duelist heart and uh
also today i learnt about the tome of traits
i'll get to try shit out with everyone else <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
cool i'm not upset anymore
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
oh i got it
wait really?
realistically it doesn't matter but i still would like to
unless i get a pbe acc
yeah, what i don't like about it is that i won't get to <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i don't like pbe that much
to a degree, at least
so i'll be able to learn with everyone
i'm very sure actually
i'll be off school i think
legit can't wait <:okk:1058108494995263539>
so maybe more than 6 weeks until set 9
oh <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
we're like, a genshin patch away from set 9
how often are patches again? every 2 weeks?
13.11 is the last patch of this set?
that makes sense but still, having the next set theme at all in ranked this set sounds weird
that's kinda weird
wait will we get it in ranked this set?
i can only play with friends in normals now <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
i'll still try it though
yeah that sounds annoying <:okk:1058108494995263539>
oh ok cool
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i kinda wanna try out the portal bs
when's the next patch again?
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
play anything not kaisa gnar you're playing for 3rd
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
yeah that kinda sucks
1st and 3rd was kaisa and gadgeteen tho <:okk:1058108494995263539>
somehow 2nd place was mecha aatrox this game
yeah that makes sense
i think i'm way too greedy but at plat a lot of people are similar so it's okay
i mean i often lose 60 hp for nothing so sounds good <:okk:1058108494995263539>
but now it's not that bad
at lower rank than me, lobby tempo is surprisingly fast since everyone donkey rolls
yeah i see
to me it's so rare to go underground, feels not worth if i don't get a board in 2-1
how far do you go with underground generally? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
so many gloves <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i won a game where i had like 5 gloves, it felt like an 8th
that hp <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
jesus fuck
i agree but only while i'm 1st
i am <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i don't think i will
i don't know if i'll play it
cool beans <:okk:1058108494995263539>
yeah nevermind
it isn't open
and
i also logged in to honkai to test my new pc in MA
but that's not true <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
i was going to say it was the only permanent banner valk i was missing
from the like 5 monthly pulls
oh i got qiqi
i'll keep that in mind, i think i've been picking the bad ones <:okk:1058108494995263539>
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
i don't really like eternal winter either
infinity force feels like shit
oh yeah i should ask, what even are the good ornn items?
i see <a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
also not in ranked 🚮
is that like, alongside krugs and then twice right before carousel?
what's 2-6, 3-3, 4-3?
i knew it was strong
i'm surprised gadgeteen crest is that high actually
yeah i was thinking about how weird it is that overall augment avg is so low
i can't say much cause i've won plenty of games like that, i barely if ever get to go kaisa 3
what even the fuck <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i've never went 9
in tft
<@180679257851166721> how often do you even go 9
<:Sitt:1025219070905290792>
sliding into nekos dms
they haven't gone much into it yet but i've seen glimpses
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i guess that gives more time for himmel to win me over though
that's kinda nuts
what really? they had first popularity poll that late?
i wouldn't be able to not vote for frieren right now though
around what chapter is that? i think i could see it
just from like from how solid it is
i'm like thinking about it, it's probably the strongest first chapter i've read
it's actually so good
chapter 1 i was already this is going to fuck me up
yeah
and i already really really enjoy it
i've just started, about 10 chapter in
<@180679257851166721> are you reading frieren?
yeah
i like xdd tho
like kekw is kinda b-tier
most emote i don't really get why they're spammed over other
i don't really get it either
it look right for the twitch emote
is it?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:fricc:1047970291571245086>
nekolao <a:Pat:914638151069356062>
i'm so proud
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
yeah sounds braindead outside of dealing with mobbing
oh wow i see
ik bleed doesn't crit but i assume HoS output is still important
how crit baldy are HN rots?
spend 700 dollars on best gear just to score -200 i would fucking <:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
he's just getting full value from his investment
jesus
hod?
that's insane
owo math 39920 * 1.2
what the fuck is 39920
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh i didn't know that <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
chuuni is like permanent larping for weebs
megumin does legit have fire powers no
but like, being chuuni is believing to be something you're not
i haven't watched konosuba
is megumin even chuuni
yeah ruby could have such sick arc centered around her
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i dunno if we're too near the ending though
if you compare to current onk chapter it feels off
and i felt it was so entertainingly done <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
had a chuuni one-off character
one of the last chapter of shy before i caught up
funny you say that
like the early chapter flashforward about the movie talking about aqua and ruby being main cast member
i just said that it was predictable, but mostly because of other stuff
giving ruby the role is way harder, proven by how he tried and it didn't come out well
i wouldn't say that either, like from how the story set it up until now, akane would easily be the most predictable and safest move
i mean is it the safest?
but... ain't it true though <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i get it that akane saying that she understands ai best is kinda insensitive, you really shouldn't say it even if it's true
she didn't even watch her disc
yeah true that was so fucking weird
like in blue box yumeka introduction, it ended pretty well so i'm fine about it
i just hope that w/e they're sacrificing now gives a good result later
well, i guess this time it wasn't weird, it was predictable, but not very good
every time the author does a really weird move like that
i didn't even see it as comedic though
yeah i guess i could see it, if you mean ruby having a tantrum
i didn't like it very much <a:collapse:1063550316332720148>
i'm talking with <@524782681389793280> about it right now
oshi no ko?
how does that even happen
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
it's so sad
hero augment i mean
>5.5 avg placement
seeing how some augment have like
this patch sounds like torture until now
i'm glad i started playing now i guess
jesus christ
maybe a little one dimensional though, but i kinda like it
a really interesting idea for a trait
that's like
huh, i see, that does sound pretty good if you're reroll
oh wow
like legit know them, i don't know what supers does <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
like i don't even mean i only know how to play them
duelist, infiniteam, anima squad, sg
a few trait
i only know like
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
what do you run on it again? just like max duelist?
i really wanna try that augment
faker on yasuo
LMFAO
just for them to go 6th
i've seen some people hit some insane stuff on my games
yeah that's so sad
but i can spam kaisa and climb still
i'm sure even below average comp is great to have under your belt at masters
yeah it makes me kinda sad the amount of comp that is not even worth it for me to learn right now
i would've fucking alt f4'd my account out of existence
that gives me new respect for robinsongz
holy fuck
what the actual fuck
too on the nose i guess? and while i can realise that, it's working on me
yeah, the emotional stuff is a bit like
keep it up author <:okk:1058108494995263539>
my respect just went up 200%
i've already been enjoying the manga a lot
i can kinda imagine though
i didn't know being sols lead was such a burden
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
i misclicked the react and thought i was blocked
gresham congrats on your promotion <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
it goes in the other hole
can you hide the character portrait? i can't see the butt properly
which is to say very little energy
which when it enters contact with jiafei product, it explodes into a nuclear amount of energy
i'll give you anti-jiafei products
i'll reward you with some sweets
if you do it tet
lmfao tell'er evn
im f2p
like i doubt a full f2p player is getting one pri per patch to max
to me that's p respectable
i mean you laugh
on a 6 week patch
full f2p
300 per patch
you get like
like 15 i think
you might just not like anime then
I agree
CN version kinda slaps
just straight up honkai bella <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
at 1:08
there's bella in the trailer
chill
okay it's not that good
it`s a fucking anime op <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
reach the right conclusion by the most insane steps
love when that happens
i was expecting raven to show up there ngl
love mob abyss
very fun
that looks
valk trial gives enough plant for it
problem solved <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
you can level them to 40 at least
yeah i feel that, kaisa 3 is strong but all my game i just give up on rolling cause i'm contested 2 ways
i'll learn to force kaisa like sensei does
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
what's this 4th you speak of
i just play like my streamer <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
my last 20 games
boxbox last 20 games
boxbox lost more lp on this one stream than i have achieved lifetime
jesus christ
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
oh
i'd be pissed going 7th on that second screenshot
LMFAO
allegedly
i mean
yes
me next?
it's like rip off half life
god dman it
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
i've watched it so many times already, i really like it
it's my favorite anime <:okk:1058108494995263539>
it's good but idk if you'd like it
fooly cooly
i'm trying to find the one flcl scene to make a reference but i'm unable
heat up in the cool off sorta way right?
great for cooling down
hey i have a recommendation for a wholesome manga for you
he really is
it did make me laugh out loud from how awkward it was LMFAO
really good chapter outside of that one single line
yes you, remember readers, it's you, her mother, anego
yes, from you, her mother, anego
what a fucking awkward ass dialogue line LMFAO
but when it's like supernatural stuff with not well defined rules (for us, at least) i don't really find it annoying
i guess i have double standards, if it's normal ass irl stuff i'd be kinda annoyed too
yeah i guess
like i guess i get it but that's such a level of butterfly bullshit i wouldn't ever put the blame on anyone
i can't imagine getting mad over that
yeah that's fucking nuts
oh i see
i don't even remember what could've made you mad at ep1
enjoying it until then
i'm like mid way through it
oh yeah
what anime
have you thought about 3s prome on release
retire
like a 200-300 score
you absolutely can
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
too much time watching maincord cook
not really, i just misinterpreted
good luck
i thought that what you meant by suitable weather
it's pretty close to a neutral phys weather methinks <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i mean sure but it's a little disingenuous to call it hare failing on her own weather
not any summoned entity
it has to be a summoned entity from the dps valk now
i think they changed it too
i don't think so bud
or is it summoned entity kallen
isn't that just shieldbreak kallen
is that her weather?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
or maybe owo is dead
owo math 0.8 * 800
i don't think it understands that .8 is 0.8
i'm interested
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
where can you watch it?
smh this game is so bugged
LMFAO <a:WHAT:1068133759158849567>
very strategic
truly an exercise on picking the best team you can make out of the millions of possible options
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
surely
they look kinda weird lmao
but they never done that before i think
i think that's just zoom in of normal eyes
new eyes?
ok
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
was i right
:wokejj:
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
i still have all of my videos, but i lost the thumbnails and the descriptions
this video?
so i had to delete the acc
and there's no way to change it
and my username giga doxxed me
i made my yt acc when i was like 12
i didn't take it down, lots of bs happened
hyperinvested, also known as investment she needs for her own weather anyways
the HoT one is so funny
<a:WHAT:1068133759158849567>
<a:MemChatting:1086362617779585144>
i achieved my goal, plat on first week
i'm on tft break now <a:vibee:1080958006298148995>
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
so unexpected
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
it's just a weird thing to base you disc name for
i can't really trust any of those simp accs
true
they honestly might be
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
overcooked
oh
let them be
they're making connections
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
????? thank you so much mihoyo
isn't that just straight up wrong too
<a:aPeepoDetective:421054275561586698>
i'm like 99% sure that button wasn't there like 10 mins ago
oh nevermind i see it
i don't see it
am i stupid
i guess it's the one i want too
is seele the one everyone wants?
i remember having shit download speeds on genshin release
that makes sense but i hate that
i thought i'd be home for some reason, but i guess i just fucked up, i'll be at school city
i'm not even playing on release i just figured out <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
even on epic games it's still coming soon
what about real people device
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i don't know how to download
just datamines
oh that explain the leaks
<:KanaSmug:746141929200418826>
i did that today
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
himeko pv kinda steezy too
music kinda slaps, not as good as nyx patch pv
like it makes sense but
i didn't realise they were so gay for each other in gsr
everything else i need the outside help to not go 8th
for those i'm pretty confident i can like take a 4th with no outside help if i hit well enough
there's like 4 comp i know how to do, duelist, kaisa, gnar, anima mf/vayne
hmmm i'll keep that in mind
yeah i probably won't bother with the app
do you open the site or use the app?
do you use the metatft thing?
dunno which i'd prefer if i already had learned
that's easier to learn
in that case then i can probably start using it already
thank god
like 2 item get stronger together
should i ever care about combo?
oh actually that's real nice
i'm still getting used to the actual item recipes, i've more than once slammed sword tear for shiv and then got confused
eventually i'll have to learn like, item/champ good enough combos
i figured something like that but i just try to focus on bis to limit option or else i get dizzy
hmmm yeah that makes sense
i'll keep it in mind tho
that's kinda nuts, no best item list i've seen put dcap as bis
worth it as a third item?
so it's only like
oh i see
yeah i was thinking now if it even is good to slam it early since you can get jewelled lotus later
depending on the comp
like the items i give giga prio are lw and jg usually
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
that's good to know
oh okay
but in my lobby was chill
and in a better lobby i'd probably be punished for that
i've slammed really late
idk what else are alternative and idk if i'm lucky or skilled, i haven't been fucked over forcing the items yet
i always go guinsoo shiv gunblade
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
3rd place on my last game
so i've stolen a few places i definitely shouldn't have
but if someone else hits it, they never itemise her properly and stuff
like if i get it it's <:bejj:1067071810853679194> 1st
kaisa ain't that scary at my elo
well, lasercorp, not that <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
it looks pretty fun
fuck no, tft
pretty close actually <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i wanna try out the lasercorp ww
i'll take some 8ths now that i'm plat and learn new comps
it's kinda chill, i'm enjoying it
yeah i believe it
just nerf kaisa a tad and it's p good
feel like they're so close to like a pretty good balance
oh damn
LMFAO is that like because of tourney stuff?
i thought we were way closer
i think i'm able to do it then
oh god okay
lore accurate
probably not
i wonder if i can get to diamond before then
when's the next set btw?
<a:vibee:1080958006298148995>
i am now
may or may not been tilt queueing
good fucking bye
i can finally go to sleep
for 7 hours
i'veb een here
holy fuck
how does it taste
ganyu yanfei xiao
like the gang
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
not my fault you don't read my messages tet
i have a theory for that
i talked a good amount
jesus christ lmfao
bad augment then, not my fault
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
since my 2 dps is gnar leblanc
sick so it's a good augment for hacker gnar right
like for tri force, do i need to 3 star my gnar and leblanc or is them being 3 cost is what matter
<@180679257851166721> is tier the cost or amount of stars?
top 4 secured
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
alright, thank you, i'll do 8 duelist then
<@180679257851166721> duelist with emblem, do i run 8 duelist or who do i drop/make the 6th
but i know some are good
no one in my elo actually run threat as carry
oh belveth is bad still? she got big buffs this patch no
3 first and i'm plat then <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
oh cool
or only like gold and masters
is it every bracket you can't demote?
i'm almost gold 1 btw, i could get plat this week <:okk:1058108494995263539>
a lot of the problem i had was that i wasn't willing to slam item if i either wasn't selling that unit later or that wasn't the unit it was going to stay on
yeah i kinda really like threat as a concept, i'm learning to use them as flex unit to hold item and not turbo lose early
yeah it's actually stupid
so i might aswell go 8th faster, but i somehow winstreak from there
cause i was turbo losing and not hitting anything
i didn't know it was good tho, i kinda took it as desparation
like as a treat, not even itemised <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
but i could've unironically ran kaisa 3 if i realised that no one was doing it
i did vayne carry
i was too fucking <:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
yeah i could've probably benefited from lv8 but
Lumi perhaps youd like a refresher
i got a sick game, i ended up always rolling down when i got like 40 or 50 cause i was too scared
do you even bother going 8 with cursed crown
you're the one to pick, the color too
honestly fair
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i don't understand overwatch
blue people are like people who barely show up
blue doesn't feel right for regulars
do you want a color
afbdm
oh ok
why are you not yellow anymore
or you already locked 6 valk there
either you already locked HoT there
<a:chadn:977032787087482962> valk
yeah she was sick, interesting gameplay that had an actual skill curve, and great performance with non-sig stig
even with gc which i assume is better at breaking shield than sns
i didn't realise the shield was that bad holy
i always had it turn off for MA
isn't her qte not even that impactful to begin with?
good profile
LMFAO
or at least RL
i've said before, i can not pull for a year and prob still retain nirv throughout
i do agree tho, the acc is not too far gone
yeah i mean if you're gonna do it it's all for yourself, i don't really care about the state of the acc <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i don't really mind either way
if you have fun doing it, feel free
i'm not coming back
well, not the 872, but a 872 is possible, it's like my 856 but you kill faster <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
2s HoS don't really make much difference
tank? i do think the 872 is possible with 3s dudu
and i pushed it all the way to 856, but the last second felt really impossible without 4*
highest score for 3* dudu was like, 824 from what i could find
i was happy about pushing the cap for 3* dudu
not really
based i think
that's how it was for my -1 on tank with MPE <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
can't complain about luck ever again
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
o yea you're 2s now aren't you
what rank is the 808
maybe i just try it if i get hero augment for it
i tried doing a ultimate ez thing, i ended up rolling like 50 gold on 8 and found none <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
gj
that one is hard, i remember having issue with it
yay
i thought you were going to say my father
because cherry told me to buy it
what if you see me with this book irl
i can't decipher those
can you run to the bathroom and use real words
?
can you link me a tutorial
was it pogging though
<:SquirrelPOG:776959327135072307>
like fursona of keilo?
still hot though
dad bod
the guy from the bolder is more like
yeah that's about right
philosophy i guess
do you know what the ship of theseus is?
oh maybe it's about the ship on the story
idk what you mean by that
so i thought like theseus was the guy who thought the thought
cause there's the ship of theseus philosophy thing
i thought he was a real dude
wait actually?
if he is i'm down, he's kinda hot in hades
is theseus also the boulder guy?
i'm not going down the ship of theseus hole
giving your waifu fake looking cat ears = <a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
also, human with animal features is called being a coward
furries are mostly humanised
<a:smadging:1034847088737005628>
thank you but don't call me that, that's a little dehumanising
thank you tet <a:Blushiekissy:795363746339356702>
i played a lot of gnar but the fucking pick the right side to hacker or lose is getting to me <a:kree:809653433455214632>
will do <:okk:1058108494995263539>
okay
jesus that's nuts
but i guess if i have ap items i just do lb first
gnar is the main thing, and then i did lb on the side
it's kinda what i've already been doing but i always thought as like
okay i see <a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
nevermind me force gnar
who do i run <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<@180679257851166721> can i play gadgeteens but ap carry?
there's some names which were active but not on discord so i can't know if they're still around
yeah it's like magery, autumn, phi
dead competitively, most of the old names quit
we have few competitive players still playing
nah, it was mihoyo
3am just sending calls to the void at blustorm for help
LMFAO honestly i did similar stuff
exactly
i didn't
<a:chadn:977032787087482962>
how else are you supposed to learn
is that elf timing matters a LOT
the one general help i can give without seeing gameplay
it's like 3 or 4 bosses
can unironically count in one hand the amount of 3s MA ref i can do at 0 instead of -1
i've always gone -1 <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
why would you feel bad about going -1
so you can prob push some points if you follow a proper ref for you
idr how rank scammy the boss is, i think quite a bit
i mean look for a ref of your ranks tho
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
at 2s that sounds about right tho
not that far
i mean 47800? you're -2 or -3 then
yeah i got some interesting hits but it just felt like it was bench locking me way harder
that's not that low is it
it's fun but it hurts my head
also my first game with pandoras box
kinda stupid
yeah at 1 star it was already tanking more than 3 star no item rell
did i do it right sensei
been a while since a lightning release tho, outside of trio
probably bio though since HoR is already melee on bike and psy would make people want to off themselves
i think the same thing as ruby, if she's ice then melee ice and the type wouldn't really matter then i think
most of my issue is early team comp tho, so hard for me
insta pick for me
like the free shop restocks, i love those
yeah i really like some already
i can do better <:clueless:973756617109676032>
i've thrown so many matches already looking for the optimal hero augment
yeah i'm following my streamer playstyle
40hp by krugs
that's what i'm doing but half the time i just don't stabilise <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
cause every lobby there's someone who just donkey rolls at this elo no matter what
it's actually kinda hard to losestreak without thoroughly inting
at early game
i'm slowly getting better tho
i'm a special breed
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282> yeah it's kinda broken
<:majj:1067071761142796418>
there's 8 players in a lobby but somehow each is contested 4 ways
sg, gnar, lucian
this shit is turbo bait
neeko
kaisa?
<@180679257851166721> who do i itemise on the sg comp
that's so fucked
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
honestly i find lucian and gnar more satisfying than kaisa
actually?
that's good to know
every game there's 3 people contesting kaisa
br is crazy about it
yeah for some reason
nothing to lose
i'm gold 4 0lp
lemme try forcing that
i see
kaisa reroll?
what's sg build
it's kinda nut
yeah i was meh about it
gnar feels decent still
i opened the guide just to help and it said doesn't work in patch 13.8 <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
i had like 90 dollars to roll at 3-2
i played one game where i got the sickest items and unit early for hacker leblanc
i can't make myself care about it
i played a few normals but like
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
ranked is fucking down in BR server
i'm enjoying but
that's me too
based
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i can only imagine shit like this is actually average <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
celine got 6 bd on first shui rerun
the first on first zhenyi rerun, the second on first turg rerun
7 an-utu, 7 twins of eden <a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
takes an hiatus every time there's an anime/movie in production
made in abyss just straight up
server is public
join via emote
<:KanaSmug:746141929200418826>
yeah it must be pretty rough to do both
chainsaw man also had a ton of breaks during anime release
it's normal though
115 (13/4) > break > 116 (27/4) > break > 117 (11/5) > 118 (18/5)
yeah it would already be out if there was a chapter this week
L-nya
they're on break
oh shit
i thought it was that
i got a ping from the oshi no ko server
is it not?
i think it's out
blade is just worse senti
gsr otto skill is called prayer of abyss flower?
<a:swipeboobahic:940613030968963122>
me
<:OkaygeBusiness:945151371869560953>
i'm gonna do that
that's fucking stupid
<:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
what the even fuck
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
it's not a thing anymore right
lee sin bug that stack shield?
is it something like
that would make me alt f4
what the fuck did i just watch
??????????
but they end up actually fixing so <:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
it was like just doomed, just way too fucked to fix it at all
like i kinda assumed if it wasn't fixed by now
kinda nuts that they fixed it this late into the patch
i guess it doesn't really matter
i didn't play any hacker but i thiiink they were going to my backrow
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> yeah no clue actually if i played pre patch or not
did they fix the hacker bug?
read: it really wasn't, i played like shit
maybe that's why i went 8 6 5 playing lucian <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
oh that's like exactly when i played
i wanna know if the few games i played earlier were on new patch or not
how long has it been since the patch went live
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
patch notes doko
oh is it
八重霞 i think
<a:chadn:977032787087482962>
might aswell just stack up on fire g3
what else can you even do with it
i mean
yeah harsh stuff
hmmm
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
pulling for offrate <:WeirdChamp:714652749379272714>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
cause box
you only need one more piece
tho i guess if you already have B its been an offrate before?
collodi is surprising
but i mean i'm not saying it more expensive, i just have a different PoV now <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
we weren't doing that back then
the black card is kinda turbo expensive huh
wanna see something
that i lost 5050 and was hype for it
i've done that before but i ended up playing myself so hard
hey tet
that's what made iriya decide to not care last kasumi
i got a sick lucian opener but didn't get blue until morgana cause i kept getting denied tears
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678> i get it now
MA HoV walked so kasumi could run
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
sheeeeesh
nvm then
o really?
i think i haven't winstreak from 2-1 ever
the thing i suck the most is at making decent early game board
just a lost cause, by the time they die i'm too high level
i had like 6 and there wsa legit no more in the pool
cause like no one else was hitting it either <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
in a way it ended up not mattering
yeah there was no way to hit lucian 3
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
5 people in the lobby were contesting me
and unironically
i tried changing it up going lucian, i got sick items for it
i think BR low ladder don't realise how broken it is
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> the flexibility
one of those even wasn't leblanc
past 8 out of 13 games i played hacker <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
but idk i think at my state it doesn't matter what i'm spamming, i still have a lot to learn
boxbox says it's a bad thing cause you won't learn if you just spam the broken team
yeah i kinda am
it feels extra meaningless here
<@180679257851166721> i'm gold now <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i liked it
seeing them talk about how much they enjoy
i'm invested in tenkaku now
oh yeah i can feel it this chapter <@180679257851166721>
i'm sorry you had to go through that
yeah that fucking blows nini
don't let the fact that she's cheaper trick you into thinking she's cheaper
it was so bad
but still not even close to what it was before the nerf
i think right now it's way harder than after the initial nerfs
yeah before the buffs i actually spent more time in ER than abyss
now you just take it up your ass
cause you could pick better or worse modifier for your valk
like max difficulty is the exact same p much, the only thing that change is how you can cheese slightly lower difficulty
i think if you're comparing max difficulty between before and after they made the change, it didn't really change much, just make it more straightforward
wdym, like
140d isn't the max difficulty, it was 150d
2.75x is max difficulty now
no joke i'd off myself
bella made me want to fucking end it all
oh for an event, i thought you wanted that back for real
realistically it doesn't change
yeah, hiding it i think is a good thing purely from a player moral standpoint
the finger jammer
DA weather was like valk with d e a a n c h o r a letters on her name deal 75% more damage
but i don't think it's gotten like actually worse
if you make it too shameless and too artificial it feels like shit
and i do think also think there's value in hiding it a lil
i do think the ER shill is way less shameless now
yeah you got a lot of value out of it with HB
it applies to all valk on field
and mixed is sp gen
yeah her ult does every buff
i'll allow if you pick pretty ones
are they pretty
that one is better
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
but i found this
i didn't find it
i went looking for my magic pixel compilation
1% damage increase is worth a LOT
like if you're 2s player
that's the truth for all whaling
yeah the more you spend, the more you have to spend for lower increase
i think you're underestimating how big it is but
you can't compare with dudu cause she's the outlier
it's above average as far as 4* increase goes
4* ely elf isn't bad tho
you did say elf sucks balls
<:C_Boocheer:1005807303905267853>
i only like bocchi design there
oh it's everyone from bocchi?
HoH ain't weak and elf is kinda broken honestly
their issue isn't their performance, really
who are the mid ass looking girls
i'll be masters in a few hours
if we extrapolate
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> i'm silver
yeah don't even touch another gacha if you're scared about getting in too deep again
same
i'm bronze now
a first gave me 300 lp <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
like 200s
idk, can't you go pretty high and still survive in tft?
maybe i should go NA server instead of BR
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
my rank is so low i'm getting like 1 min q on tft
maybe
you mean kombucha <:okk:1058108494995263539>
a gacha game would be reeeeeally fun if the gacha currency was earned through gameplay instead
gambling is pretty fun, wish more game was similar to tft, use gambling without it being tied to irl money
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
that kinda stuff
and get used to the info like what trait each champ is
the best i can do is just grind out a lot of game
i'll take a look and read some stuff but i get the feeling that
oh i know that streamer!
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
didn't manage to transition into the good board fast enough to not just die
even broken comp i still went 8th <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i giga highrolled hacker i'm pretty sure one of the matches
it is very overwhelming
i'm iron 2
ruby i played some tft today
i heard 3/4 HN without weapon is enough for that <:okk:1058108494995263539>
which is the true gamer's goal
you could probably 47k
you mean sriracha
you start to see a little heki in everyone
you talk enough with heki
all around me
surrounded by whales
<:KanaSmug:746141929200418826>
yeah that's average
nice
source: look at my PE
a dupe in his position wouldn't even give him 2s1
making an investment that's going to last 6 month, and prepared to spend for the powercreep
yeah you gotta decide what your money is worth
i feel like it's p big even
i should though, they're kinda funny
i don't use the skeleton emotes much
LMFAO
sinful2
you saw my rank
game rewards skill, that's why gresham gets 2 ely one 10pull and i get shit on
deserved
reward for t1
<a:chadn:977032787087482962>
celine was like there's nothing more for me to accomplish here
truly
that's nuts
honestly i would probably do the same
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
i always believed in gresham, it was inevitable
so she wants to keep tsubasa in the dream so she can have a family still
so i guess sachie is hospital bound because of the late stage alzheimers she has
<a:toodalaotorelate:959796978131271730>
jesus sheeeeeesh this greshamlao
it's been a while since someone had them, i think it was minako
like the eyes they get when they're doing something their past self would
yeah like, the dark eyes that people get when they remember stuff
the eyes are back, been a while
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
<:HUH:1004782798277718077>
i like that actually, since it's a dream i guess the room reflects their state? so a blank room for the person with alzheimers
oh her room is so normal
really on the nose
which is kinda like
it was because she said she poured tea the previous page and then said she was going to pour some tea immediately after
oh never mind on the same page they confirm it <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
that was kinda hot
the one face he made on the diary chapter
not there
huh
i'm a slow reader
i'm on page 4
she's going to have like alzheimers or something right
oh shit
:dongerj:
blue box, spy x family, tenmaku cinema, ichinose, akane, yozakura
today is fucking everything day
and having her potentially force taiki into making a move is kinda poetic, good cooking author <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
my face beamed when yumeka said she's going to start basketball back
i liked it a lot
this blue box chapter remind me why i started reading to begin with
it's like ,.. doug but for toxicity and ruby
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
that's fucked up heki
i don't remember how genshin abyss works
did it just change
next patch for sure <:COPIUM:998960074234023996>
FT had herrscher skill <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
back then, that was the herrscher diff
no one wanna think about ninja
it's ptsd blocking their memory
will i get lp though <:okk:1058108494995263539>
yeah that makes sense
braindead spam hackers until grandmaster <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i'll think about it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah i'm not good with that kind of stuff tho
oooo that sounds fun
so like, pink
hmmm i'm not sure, i don't usually imagine much of a person beyond like a personalization of their discord profile <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
<a:peepoGamble:765690449201201173>
kaisa leblanc gambling
that's just gambling
everything i play has too high skill ceiling
can't relate
i don't think so
i don't have it in me to play something for a few hour and blame the game <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
like i have upwards of hundred of hour on a single boss and i still suck balls at it
i cannot comprehend the amount of confidence they have with the practice they have
it must've been giga cbt back then
like we only use new stuff like PV to break gear
honestly i didn't even think what the strat used to be
LMFAO yeah
but very finnicky
yeah it look kinda fun actually
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
do you?
vel it's wallet difference i swear vet
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
smart
both regret pulling cause low value but don't regret pulling cause you got it for cheap
the schrodinger whale
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
own up to it
kinda coward
glass houses, baban
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
did people expect the seele to come this early tho?
that's a big difference
whoa wtf
what's the bug tho? i hear there's a bug related to it
that sounds disgusting
everytime someone asks my streamer about it he tilts and doesn't answer
i still don't know what that is
what the fuck even is that
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
it's like chess if it made you want to kill yourself i think
yeah
my streamer is this <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> close to quitting tft for the patch
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it's just a strictly aoe team
like i'm not joking that beidou is fucking broken when there's more than one enemy, i melted them
yeah i fought them and it was chill
actually?
okay <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i mean as far as tanky goes it didn't feel that much more tanky
which was like in november
and i still 36* last abyss i did with that team <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i mean it does indeed
beidou can take a hit but i would rather not cause serpent spine
and kazuha ain't that tanky either
fischl and nahida are made out of paper
look i'm sorry, i bald but i can't run that team without a healer
new
i don't have the new set either
she's lv60 with prototype amber
so it hits once
if you only have one enemy, it doesn't bounce at all
like, beidou ult bounces between enemies, and hits like 5 times in total or smth
it goes nut
yeah cause it bounces
she actually deals like 1/3rd her damage
beidou dps is so bad without more than one enemy
i mean i'm sure but not in that order
i'll see if i'm up to it later
i mean i'm going to end up running it again anyways then
fischl i assume?
like who
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
very unique ability, i doubt anyone would ever have something similar <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
it stops time, no?
i mean my team is beidou nahida fischl kazuha
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
so i'm donezo
and i don't wanna rerun with different team
on second half
there's no way i can 3 star with beidou
and second half is beidou, so no single target dps
but my tao was on first half
cause single target dps just kill it ignore everything
i mean i can probably just unga bunga with tao team
nah i'm gone already
but i can't be bothered to rerun floor 12 just to figure out the last monster
i was going to do abyss in 10 min to prove a point
quite pretty
it runs well, at 1.0 res instead of 0.6 too
i came back to genshin to test the new pc
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
the whole fight is a transition phase
turbo stupid
they added 3s boss to genshin?
<:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
in genshin right now
what the fuck is 12-3-2
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
helestial hymn?
scary
huh
owo translate WIR SUCHEN DICH
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
cause like whenever i tell you stuff you have no issue ignoring it
is there something different about epi
huh
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
you got past the opener in 5 runs?
L
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
in my MA we still use LE
nono let them talk
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i'm on it right now
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
but it's already a bicc upgrade over what i had
no graphics card
it's a ryzen 4600g
my minecraft is going to have so many frames
<:PeepoSitBASED:986284656586551366>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
switched to amd
whole new pc
i'm very early on, the premise is interesting and i like the themes and how they're portrayed for now
and i've started SHY next
i finished grail of eris, and i can say that for what's released until now on the manga, i do recommend it, it's really good
i'm reeeeeally not a movie person
pretty good for first chapter, it's going to be a little hard to keep me interested though
o also i finally read tenmaku cinema
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i'm so glad the pc is actually working
farm sp better
so maybe
she did get buff tho
big if true
that's nuts if true
grey cunny
i guess that's good
oh really? that's
whoa
so HN dupe are giong to be useless i mean
i think you're going to run GC gear on HoS for HN team on 6.6+
exactly
i guess i'd do the same if it was useful in MA
now that we know 6.6 it's going to be useless
i'm surprised y'all are going for the dupe
yeah i'll format it either way
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
what you're the only dino around
<@964806731471405086>
can that fuck shit up
from my old pc
it's booting to my past install of windows
help
is that a bad thing
wait the pc is booting
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
it booted
okay i'll go back to trying to build my pc now that i took nappies
<:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
we've almost had senti longer than you had genshin
that easily it's been 2 years
<a:KianaWaiting:652262801796104227>
yeah that'd be cool
ooo
i read the manga though
i still haven't watched season 2 of beastars
yeah
like i don't think it'll be bad, i just dunno if it'll be new
like i wouldn't be surprised if it was just cut up from the mv
i wouldn't put the expectations too high
yoasobi doesn't miss
it slaps so hard
i came home while listening to it nonstop during the trip
i know right
this is a whole hidden base problem
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
all hands on deck
you too
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
gresham do you wanna come here and build my pc
ty
i'm going to check things further later
idk what's wrong
<:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
and i'm not being able to make it work
i bought a new pc for me to build
to ask
funny time
yes, craft it
i don't follow through with the entire thing but that's the most believable theory for the dark and light star eye i've seen
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
i don't have good site to watch online
i torrent all my anime at nyaa.si
<@241051045864800259> 
we get so clogged down by thinking about dumb stuff like abyss and MA
i'm so glad someone is thinking about the real meta
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
LMFAO issok <a:Pat:914638151069356062>
oh sorry i thought i said if
<a:GIGACHAD:999060597247320095> goes for CH for FT BB CH strat
if you have a trio team i thiiiink you use lightning more? and lightning buff is bigger too
depends on which you use the most
and a lot of work
i feel like you could do that with enough macros
and put it on 1 2 3 4
so then you can pick the ones for your team comp
that's just all character face profile
we should do like a keyboard set
exaaaactly
it's so camp i love it so much
with s ss sss numpad
they foreshadowed it
whoa
like the AE keyboard, i love it
it's so sick
instead of the letters
i love the having the skill symbols
i would personally go with that, white
same though, when it's not about keqing
it's fine if it's me
LMFAO
not keqing
bestie pick someone else
the one big difference between manga and anime
and they already lost their chance to do that
they might do it later but like the kana flashforward -> kana introduction and stuff like that was my favorite experiences in early onk
i'm a little sad that they skipped the flashforwards
since it covers 10 ep
it's surprisingly not that rushed
yeah the first episode is reeeeally good
actually nuts
onk spoilers
the fucking balls on this ep1 to foreshadow hikaru kamiki from like chapter 100
yeah
i'm kana simp but like
akane sweep
nah even narratively, akane is stacked. like not only she's a better actor, they set her up as being great at playing ai specifically really early on, and repeatedly they make a point that she is the one that can figure out ai the deepest while knowing the least
i could think about it harder though
so i just feel like i run into no info when trying to figure it out, i'm not the type to making crazy theory based on 0 info so i don't bother
i think for the first like half of the manga it was really inconsistent, aka didn't have a solid idea of what he want it to mean
i have no fucking clue <:dogkek:664517636524343344> 
it's so stacked towards akane it's nuts
it's going to be so hard for aka to make ruby win, i'm kinda hype just to see what he wants to pull off
akane sweep
me too but i can cope
but i think ruby will win the audition, read the script, understand aqua more, and they'll be back to friend-ish terms
like it's not what i want, i want akane to win
yeah that's to some degree what i expect
soon we'll have daily birthday mail in genshin
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
they would never work
if they had a party for every genshin chara bday
i mean
but idk i don't see that either
unless if it was like a big villain arc LMFAO
i mean i guess... i could see it? i'd have to see it though, to me it'd just kinda stalemate the story since hikaru would've already gotten some kind of justice, it'd be hard to make a big deal out of aqua breaking him out just to fuck him up
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
i do
i think i kinda remember that but yeah i think if it ever happens it's not gonna be permanent
normal law ass retribution is the last thing i expect to get to him
i have no doubt in my mind that aqua is murdering him
i would be reeeeally surprised if he gets arrested though
tbh i have no clue about it, i hope they explain it well cause rn he's such a fucking cartoon villain <:dogkek:664517636524343344> 
similar to how on the flashforward, both aqua and ruby had only one star eye, and i really don't see them losing one, so it's probably just not perfect planning by aka, which is acceptable
i think they're just fixing up stuff, really. i don't think aka had a solid understanding of what the light/dark star eye meant until rather recently, so the anime changes are like small retcon for what is actually supposed to have happened
morning
on the manga, the only time she shows the dark star eyes is right before filming the documentary, on the really late chapter 110+
<@241051045864800259> apparently the (onk) dark star eyes on ai on ep1 as she talks with saitou is an anime only change
i would be soooooooo mad
there's absolutely no reason for aqua to do that in my eyes, if he saw something on his disc that made him worry for ruby to see the same thing, he doesn't even know what is in the ruby one, and it'd be more fucked up if he watched it and then decided to hide it
that's actually really bad in my eyes, i'd be waaaay more pissed over that than aqua telling the media about the truth about ai
is that aqua hid ai's disc for ruby and didn't tell her
though it's pissed at the characters, not at the story
the one thing i'm kinda pissed about onk
fall valk is prob more balanced if there is more tryharder
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i think same thing happened in SEA last fall valks
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i refuse any isekai
i like how everyone who has the same tastes on manga as me is like
you didn't know you were already space related?
wait
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
also a space related one if you think about it
it's
which i guess this is me doxxing my future self
i think my irl name is going to be luna
<a:kirbyidle:585555294579458063>
kirby is space related actually
you're Crom Citrin, and today just happens to be your 13th birthday
like 4 letter -> 6 letter
rule for naming?
huh
kana sweep tho
yeah i was going to say, i love ruby but she's not even the best character in onk, nevermind of recent manga
that makes sense, i wouldn't think you'd have picked ruby as namesake if you were picking from a character from recent manga
she kinda is at this point tho so i agree
at that point, ruby wasn't near as unhinged as aqua is
.
.
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i haven't gotten an answer from ruby if he got the name from onk or not
maybe
twice they make a big deal out of it in the first ep
but it's not like it's late stuff
yeah only twice in the whole manga for now
the dark stars also come up very early
like the manga literally does a flashforward on ch2 to ch120+
i don't think they'd care about spoilers
maybe the entire op is like a stand in for the movie? so we have recording of both ai and ruby as ai
actually she only has one white one <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> maybe it's too early to take it as proof
from the flashforward on ch2, ruby does get her white stars back at some time during filming the movie
so it makes sense, i guess
when they first show up, the different ai line up with aqua/ruby, the normal one lines up with aqua and the other lines up with ruby
like the one thing i thought was weird was if the other ai was the dark liar one, wouldn't that connect better with aqua since he's been longer on the black star
zei said the same thing
you're right
god yeah
and second time is right before filming the documentary, when the director said he would only accept the true ai, she accepted that and her eyes turned black as she began filming
first time is the interview with saitou before becoming an idol, she had black star, and when she realised she could love by lying, then her eyes turned white
she actually only has the white star when she's lying
she did, twice
OH that'd be kinda sick, maybe! as ruby as ai
i mean i kinda agree but wouldn't they give the liar the black star then?
like having 2 ai is not them just comparing 2 different design, it's actually 2 different ai at the midpoint further
but i can't make sense of what that's symbolic for
well i guess same, not literally literally
finish it
maybe it's a spoiler from the fucking dvds we haven't watched yet? anime op spoiling manga arc?
like there's this design of ai that i've never seen on the manga, different colored eyes too, she's pretty but like ?????
it's kinda driving me nuts
i literally can't figure out a reason why there's 2 ai on the op, both with white starred eye
i need help figuring out what it means
have you watched the op
if the author wants to force ruby to be the one, he's gonna do some legwork cause akane is harsh competition
yeah no joke
i kinda like shiranui a bit more tho, and akane is stacked
idk though how i feel about it yet
and it kinda made sense that this was going to happen to some degree
the ones that had flashbacks
yeah, i ended up reading back the first few chapters
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
no more issue
buy 4 elfs
most roguelike are pretty chill to beat base difficulty once you get enough unlocks
nah idk i don't think that's how roguelike are
yeah it wasn't like, well designed <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'd never know
it does it for free, you don't get the buff and need to attack?
oh wow that's interesting
it was kinda nuts
but it never got to the same level of difficulty
after the nerfs eventually it got a lil challenging
yeah ER was legit hard before the nerfs
but apparently on release they fixed a bunch of stuff
on beta
it looked tricky when i watched eli play with trial valk
that sounds actually dangerous
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
blade? the gsr character? i don't get the mcu drama
i hate hot days
it's pretty bad
at my home city, we get 40º summer days
that's like p avg, p cozy
yeah that's a little warmer than what we're having today and today has been a more on chilly side day
kinda cold then?
what's that in normal people degrees?
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
for sp valk
700 frag for not owning -> 3s
i still haven't come up with a good one besides it looks cool
lemme know if you have any theory about why there's 2 ai in the mv
i'm so proud
all the people i know retiring
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
i'll watch the subbed ep later tomorrow i thiiink
i ended up not watching the ep yet, i watched the first half hour with no subs and it looks nice
<a:KusaCheers:1012732398372393080>
i pinged you for onk op mv
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
a 9s thing
is jst JK like
you can be way more flexible with finger positioning for doing stuff like that
you just get less control, for like some really high apm stuff i can't imagine it
no way i'd ever prefer controller
why would you do anything else
it's not even elitist, it's the easiest way to play and the cheapest
keyboard is the one true way
hell no
pc is objectively better
like i get it if you prefer, it's fine to have bad opinion
unhinged take
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
the game sucks balls on mobile
but still turg gd
i think you can try zhenyi TB
but freedom from honkai
i think it's 2s2 tho
i don't remember anymore
my knowledge is vanishing
what fr rank?
jesus fuck that's actually pretty dangerous
fair
LMFAO
it's kinda similar in honkai too
beyond salvation
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
my account is done for
trolling people well is not easy
that sounds kinda hard honestly
in a way i kinda respect it more on facebook
LMFAO nevermind i guess
with someone who has a child
imagine getting on a fucking twitter fight
that's kinda pathetic
god
sanest twitter user
especially early onk ruby
i wouldn't be surprised if ruby took his name from onk ruby
<:RubyWink:825595780521132042>
onk ruby
i could do that
and i'm like
like there's the one scene where ruby is just spamming kill yourself kill yourself kill yourself kill yourself to all the ai haters on oshi no ko
but i'm just saying
i'm not, i'm like thinking real hard of catching up with you
my kill yourself density is so much lower
if anything, i'm even more sweet than tet
so am i!!! but people are still scared of me
when i was a kid i had to like be awake on stealth mode for 6 hours
like nowadays i can wake up at midnight, everyone asleep, i can just walk up, cook some food and go to my pc
god i can't imagine being a kid again
me when i get up at 4am when i'm staying over at a friends house
yes <:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
type is going to be SO bad, but they're probably not bringing it back until they make a new gen valk that can deal with it
this is our turf
like if anything, if someone new shows up, they should be the one scared
i feel like you've owned not being scared here, tet
type wolf
lemme know if i can do something to make you feel less scared
also that's kinda sad <@309634550273933314> <@241051045864800259> <@964806731471405086>
can't even imagine some shit at current dist
don't scale
some bosses and valks just uh
yeah
few runs, got close to my cap, don't wanna bother anymore, goodbye
wasn't even because i hated it it's more like
tank at lower dist is like reeeeally chill
oh yeah in that case idk, i think i did a few runs and left it
then yeah
if it was the recent one
i don't remember that, sorry, i must've just like slept or smth
LMFAO
are you really?
aw i'm really glad actually
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
wtf you mean relatable
i'm so approchable
wdym felt that
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
that i wanted a comm and you weren't open
i dmed you like when i met you
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
can i get in too? i also want aster comm
oh shit
yeah i don't even think we have 23 people
is that in this server
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
it's not that necessary
you really don't need to keep the title of being the only RL player to snipe
babe just do the side stage
mine is done
<:worryRamen:418418305066467338>
nunya fucking business pal, what's it to ya
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
how about you get better at getting some bitches
reeeeeally pretty
i really like them, i dunno the name, is that luka on the left?
oh those are so pretty
i don't know the context but hell yeah
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
one for each hand
and i get it
but then you look at how they behave
like you look at how much heki and epi fight and you wonder how are they friends
yeah that's heki alright
coward
like together
do you assume they are wedded
if they release 2 wedding skin in the same patch
i'm sorry tet i'm just skipping all yours and heki message cause you're talking about tower of fantasy or some shit i assume
but a few shots they really went all out
from what i watched of ep1, the animation and production look really average in most places
the manga is really good, so i have high expectations
5 hours or so ago
yeah first episode came out like
she's so pretty, i could just look at her for hours
god ai's design is so fucking good
maybe it's something something ruby's and aqua's ai? cause each ai flash over each sibling on that part of the op. but again, from what we've seen right now, wouldn't aqua be the dark one? it doesn't line up perfectly for me
it slaps so hard though, and it makes sense for oshi no ko
i was kinda eh about it at first, not the style yoasobi goes for usually
like the repeatedly use of a double of ai on a style of clothes we never really see her use in the manga? i would understand if it was like liar/truthful ai or something, but then wouldn't the stars on her eyes be black?
i'm a little sus though, i'm up to date in the manga and i don't fully get all the symbology in the mv
kinda slaps
 <@370438895965306882> <@180679257851166721> <a:KusaCheers:1012732398372393080>
n <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512> blesse <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512> blige
not that it matters for genshin
yeah i was going to say, don't genshin trial valk also suck balls
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
even shit affix give you like 4 rank up of atk worth
no affix at all make a huge difference
and maybe no dk but idk
it's just no affix
it's ammo for them
don't say that
can hare clear abyss
it's genshin mindset
but i never got to see like one screen, one 10 pull, two valk card
like getting a valk at pull 9 on 10 pull then another at pull 4 of the next
i've had more than 1 s-rank in like a 10 pull span
yeah i've never had more than 1 s-rank in a 10 pull
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
i barely studied
i slept so bad and i have a test soon
this is how we can still save AE
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
nono let them cook
shoot
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
i'll still be in classes
oh i'll be a few hours late to watching it
tet i like that you don't read
i'll def be watching it
yeah i am <a:catgib:564829264466149378>
hugely based
i could see it
nah i agree
stealing boss from 2s+ BKE is so hard though
i could see it <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like in a way similar to HN where she sweeps a bunch of t2?
yeah maybe
like i can't imagine doing ER weekly at this point, it's so bad
just honkai player in general in a way, kinda built diff when you look from outside
i'd get bored really quick of that
<:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
that's so fucking lame
oh yeah they have pri now
either she's 2s2 or i got the 2s3 by the time i already didn't care about playing anymore and didn't bother updating my spreadsheet
she should be 2s2
<:crying:757445037402619974>
cause i'm that cool
kept track of it on a spreadsheet
i uh
i can maybe check
i actually don't remember
what is honkai nowadays
HoT stamp on returnee shop is kinda cursed
i don't think shes 2s3 but <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<a:ripBozo:1015579412432961566>
and that i somehow lost 50/50 to nilou
i dreamt i went back to genshin the other day
oh god
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
it's pretty good
and now it reveals it was actually sus stuff going on
there was some info on ch1 where you just go huh that's weird but that's just normal anime bullshit, so i'll accept it
okay grail of eris reeeeally impressed me just now
zärtlepilled
i appreciate it, ever since my dad.... she's been very down
tet is so nice
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
lumi is so nice
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
do mine
soul link was a good mechanic, they just realise that they can give it to valk instead
bait valk
takes 10s longer to clear sidestage
it's actually genshin mindset
quantum shit has mechanics like soul link what like in ER?
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
and they go no i'm s0
and then i go on dm and say so you're s2 like me right? nice score, i can't beat
i'm like competing with other non-2s valk peeps
same
that's so weird to me, back when i was active i hid that i had shit like 2s IO most of the time cause i guess most people don't wanna hear about it <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
<a:Smadging:1035205356013494364> she's not even that good, she just get good score cause she's cheating by using game mechanics
<:majj:1067071761142796418>
awww can i eat them
i am a fragile simp though
outside maincord fragile is pretty chill i feel like
it's really hard to not be condescending on maincord
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
thank you though <a:AA_Gab_Bow:914213000594980964>
yeah the others look fine on mangadex
it's missing a few chapters, but i guess i can figure that out when i go read it
that sound like leak drama
on mangadex it only has the first 23
oh yeah i was going to ask
that's sick
i respect it though
i'll never be done with anything
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
wait it's ongoing?
there's 6?
i'll leave it for uh way later
that's a lot of chapters
yeah i'm taking a look at it <a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
everything else i really don't care
like puzzle game
i only care when the purpose of the media is for you to figure out something
i'm pretty lax about spoilers personally
i dunno if i should've opened the spoilers but that sounds actually pretty fun
LMFAO
to me that's a good thing i think
i don't care too much about gambling as a concept but i enjoy good puzzle fights
and that sounds fun
jojo fights without stands
the way someone said is like
def not edgy though
but you gotta like fanfic pretty hard to get there from where i'm at
maybe it gets more yuri
i'm enjoying so far though, i also wouldn't really call it romance yet
it still might, i'm about halfway done for what's released and it's ongoing
oh yeah i should add that to my plan to read, heard good things
i'm at ch14 but the chapters are long
i think you'll enjoy it, like at that point i'd call it pretty passable but it keeps getting better
that's like mid chapter 3 i think
i can't vouch for the light novel, if the manga is the adaptation i'd think it's better than the manga
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it went like 50 -> 60 -> 70 -> 80 page long chapter
there was a few chapter that i legit thought the author was playing a prank on me
i'm enjoying it
that's the gist
yeah
i'm reading the manga, yeah
i didn't know
oh is it a manga adaptation?
<>
i wouldn't call it yuri but i guess i could see it
not a light novel
ruby are you reading holy grail of eris
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
it's DK's
i mean there's no one else it could be for though
you'd be wrong but you could
i guess you could make an argument that DK pri was actually DB
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
FS DK and SR all have pri
which a rank are you talking about?
what
ik <@482139585355448333>  did but that prob doesn't help
i remember someone buying something from tmall
so i can do testing
working on it still, i think soon i'll move it here on a private channel
but it's better than not listening to any
it's definitely not perfect though, you miss the small periods of silence between songs and often there are songs that only play in certain areas
and i was like wait a second there's more? this kinda slaps
and i got to the fight song
i was listening to the like inazuma ost
yeah <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i actually muted the game and opened the tsurumi ost on chrome when i was doing that
like seriously mihoyo, they aren't bad, just lemme listen to other songs when i'm exploring
also gets double points on the very start by not having a fight song
it's prob the best introduction to an area as far as exploration goes i've ever seen
but i loved it
just like the very beginnihng
i didn't do nearly everything
it's really pretty, i could admire each frame individually
sumeru desert was unironically like 12 fps here <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i think i'm going to play it an amount with my new pc, exploring with decent fps sounds fun
i'd prob be more willing to go back to genshin
i think out of the mihoyo games
issue of the skill kind
we already proved that dist works differently in RL vs nirv, i would think going even lower also messes with it
like figure out how dist works down there + lobby trophy gain/losses
to document stuff
the most i think of doing is letting my acc fall to the depths
i'm not an abyss player, i like following high skill cap MA strat
that's not how i enjoy honkai too much usually tho
i mean i guess
doing MA with old valk doesn't sound fun
but on my own acc i really don't think so
i have thought about asking for someone's acc to play a few boss for old times sake
but in the far future maybe
idk right now hell nah
i think the new one would be able to fps scam
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i'm moving pc soon too
i don't have the game downloaded
it should tell you
if you wanna do them feel free, i'm not going to though
there's a set of missions you have to do on the returnee acc for the other one get rewards
i can give you deets but it isn't as simple as just inputting the code and getting pulls
idk if i have returnee cause tet logged in earlier to check my book
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
me hopefully
they have no issue holding boss forever until they feel like shilling
it'll just depend on what type they decide to make hua tbh
why imagine when you could make it real
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i got kinda hype
oh wait i thought it was you who uploaded it
you count as no one
don't think there's any leaks/announcements for gsr for after 1.0
no one cares about sakuno rondo anymore
same but for the twins but i didn't stop cause i'm not a coward
teriri gigachad
is a retired herrscher of retirement
the ultimate form of herrscher of retirement
i retired from retiring
i'm kana simp now
you can do it
sleep this cycle
comfort = retire

now you wait until the elf breaks the ice
if you wanna do it then do it
the way to write well is to write a lot when you write poorly

<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> marco B
depressingly bad or smth
was it like
yeah that's fair, it was pretty popular so good for him
i watched the first few episodes and it was average
oh shit it's the same author as shokugeki? huh
LMFAO that's funny, must be sick to get the first chapter of a new manga of an author you like tho
i took a peek and the art look pretty too
yeah it sounded really good, i downloaded the chapter to read it on commute later today, i was going to answer with my opinion later
sick skill
LMFAO yeah
tet the plushie assembler
kinda like het guys do with guns, i assume
do it more often so you can do it faster
it's kinda unhinged
what is it bad? it's really entertaining up until now
i'm watching a stream for 13 sentinels and the guy is 4 hours in and halfway into the the tutorial
like honkai had a legit 2 month tutorial
have you ever thought about how long eastern game tutorial is
tet getting a new plushie i can't wait until i undress you
is that her nose
430 pull for a single stig
i'm stunlocked by the 1500 dollar loan LMFAO
jesus christ
gonna spend more time paying the loan back than HN will be on the meta
my god LMFAO i actually feel so bad
i believe it actually
holy fuck LMFAO
no actually, is it a thing?
monthly + bp + buy out all the yearly double top up, still f2p
mothly + bp still f2p
what the fuck is wrong with you
i didn't get what that meant
LMFAO
okay so what i'm hearing is, go for hare?
i cant afford anything so i'm planning to go for all the new valks, what do you think
epi is like this is the bad decision i'm planning, any help, we're like have you tried good decision instead and epi goes but i reaaaally want the bad one though
hi aster
and being alright
like if you have a few dps invested, you can go the rest of your life only investing in support and skipping every dps
after you play enough, literally every dps is skippable
she is not tied to hare
it's like DPe 2.0
hare is going to be the same but she does have a gimmick to hold a weather of her own
DPe issue was that she couldn't beat ranked HoT at s0, and she didn't have any gimmick to hold a weather of her own
i mean we've talked about it a lot, it's basically DPe but they learned with her
personally if i had to choose between playing BKE on v1 or v3 or release, i'd retire
this one is just sad
i got one rupaul article and the rest are studies about gay parents
tet be like oh those tweets like 'hare is such a mother, step on me with that maternal body' are just platonic, it's a hip and cool way to say pretty
it's ok i already don't understant about 60% of what's said in here
yeah ok
? yeah?
yeah we call it yoyo
now that i know she's 2 yo i'm retroactively disgusted
shit maybe heki is right, are you really affinity?
maybe you can come back when honkai 3 2 discord
that's kinda harsh
the misinfo spreaders
i'm going to celebrate it by not
oh that's my birthday
i really don't think the new OW is a new engine
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
aph4 is adult dudu + rita
apho3 is adult seele + teri
apho4
if she's gonna be mid then she's gotta be a rita
give her a scythe and maybe give her a gimmick where she can put enemies on an ice prison, that'd be cool
bio melee ice? i could see it
.... no? i mean i guess you'd have to tell me the whole team, if you're running RC CN vs AE MA i guess i see it, RC HRT vs AE CN i doubt it
i'll spend it all for mimi
by the end of her life span, she had more use with max whisperer's net than lv1
it was a really weird situation though, cause there was also strat that only work with max whisperer's net
whisperer's net is for time fracture extension
both mess up time fracture, stun cause then you can't dodge attacks if enemy isn't attacking
yeah stun is just a bad thing <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
yeah we don't have any other [ailment] dps besides HN
if hua is ignite dps, it'll prob be the same thing as SI HN
current phys support don't have a good person to take field time if not HoS, maybe prometheus but idk how she look on that front
if seele is new HoS, she's prob be the one to take field time on triple support team
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
uh
they're spending all the dev time on uh
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
you can just play honkai
i know i joke about how mihoyo sucks
i like pinging, so colorful
<@483689649727078400> you and <@309634550273933314> aren't in the same lobby, <@197871478950068224> vouched for that too
<@309634550273933314> remind me to ping <@483689649727078400>
i-indeed
i hope it'll have only one meaning
but if i did, this would make not care about her anymore LMFAO
i guess i didn't care about her before
wait hare is a kid?
showing my oshi no ko simpage <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i bought a new title
i haven't read that one yet, blue box chapter made me feel nice tho
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
poor eli <:hug:816396379215757332>
i'll ping you to remind me
gn cherry i'll ping you if you aren't
L
if you have a few high cdmg rolls on 3s MPE i wouldn't bother changing it though, you don't always need to go for optimal and it's not like it's bad
yeah i'm not sure, i asked eli 3 times but they are avoiding my question
usually dps want some combination of atk and cdmg, at 3s MPE gets some cdmg so it tip the scales
full atk
finish it off then, pretty easy
3s MPE with optimal affix you also use nirv i think
like there's the heimdall and HoV story, you get that one from the heimdall one
it's from one of those stories on second tab of the abyss/ma/um/er screen
if it does, i'd go for that
does beet M work for TP?
tesla t, full cez and beet m?
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
what i tried too
what gear have you tried already?
i'm about to put a rule where people with names starting with h and ending with eki aren't allowed to send messages with less than 3 words
i watched a video where a guy said this is probably going up during easter and i went haha mistimed easter was friday i think
holiday please?
i'm the type of christian that commemorates it all year round
oh i see
how the fuck does that work
why didn't i have class on friday then
wait easter is today?
you can do it
as a person who plays the game muted, i can say that the sfx is really good and doesn't get old
her sfx slaps
where you playing honkai at, an alleyway?
yeah that's a heki take right there
destroy them
beat them
i do think cez T is p big tho
there are some small rot issue i could see fixed but idk how to optimise TP gameplay
i don't know how TP works
i mean TP
be the highest scoring HN in NA
what's your score, share vid
it's probably rotation
i doubt your damage issue is actually stat issue
is TP melee?
is aladdin M big?
you already overkill everything so much all the time
a lot of the time in RL if you have like a well geared team
you don't need damage
it's RL
one of the best picks for the boss is scoring high <a:WHAT:1068133759158849567>
what
<:Rmewblush:808983462161416283>
smoothie eli
i'm so sorry that you're having issues with crit (it's worse in MA), it really is an interesting decision by mihoyo (it's worse in MA) to make so much of your damage output based on random chance (it's worse in MA)
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
for bleed tho idk, that tech looks.... interesting
HoR score quite well there
on type HoS that should work
what boss is it?
really steam? <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<a:GIGACHAD:999060597247320095> just ask
LMFAO i love tsubasa
it's because all options are pretty close to each other
pathetic
the quality is so bad, the dude look anemic
god i never noticed hwo bad that gif looks
i don't have it in me
i'll quit out of boredom in a week top
like if you want me to i can try to come back and be casual RL player
i am phisically unable
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
that's a fucking compliment
my mobi is 2s
might download the game back up to play some event like fall valks next patch
too expensive to catch back up at this point
i'm never coming back to competitive honkai
tft dumbass
yeah i'm interested
hearthstone angle
oh god
cause i'll be low ranked but i won't be casual
is casual = low ranked player
i'll start playing next patch <:okk:1058108494995263539>
this set look like a disaster
<:bejjphone:1090625219993022484>
<:bejjwithme:1067071883125735446>
aegir you're so toxic lately <:PopcornTime:749134519487037461>
personal best?
you can absolutely use cat instead of HoS, just run HB instead of SI and nyx instead of HN
honestly fuck it
crit chance for the MA wolf
shit i should've done that
s0 IO run sp/s line for abyss
not always
yeah that's a new whale
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
a lot of people probably on too cheap to skip mindset
first thought at beginning of arc was that ruby was the obvious choice, but when they said first pick was akane, after thinking about it i thiiink it makes more sense if akane is the one
yeah i think i'll reread a lot of oshi no ko <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
akane sweep <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
6.5 art already whoa
so proud of them
seeing your own hidden base children growing up
sheeeesh
eli stonks are growing rn
<a:cheer:585545022930419712>
you go eli!!!
that's so kind nini!
whoa
you'd really do that?
if you block heki it's very chill in here
we aren't that bad
and dental
we should pay gresham life insurance
doesn't need to be relatable or pretty just interesting
my favorite characters are always like the ones i find the ones more interesting, i guess
idk why you yellow?
i love reading you and i would read you forever if i could
i think my favorite chara is always like
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
smells of incel in here
when they first announced akane as the one to play ai it kinda clicked to me, kinda genius, and now i don't want anyone else LMFAO
yeah same i really hope akane wins, to me it's what'd make the most sense too, she already proved she can play ai early on
<@180679257851166721> <@370438895965306882> (onk) who do you think will win the audition? between akane ruby shiranui
a week
and it getting here was like
like from the tracker saying it was still running around in china
kinda impressed how fast it got here too
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
pipe?
unblock me next
i don't know who that is
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
read this channel title
you'd prob be able to change that if you wanted though
i guess if you're fine with that that's fine
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i cried on the scene where (csm) power made the contract with denji on the last arc
nothing yet?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeahh fuck the pillow! that bitch didn't do nothing indeed!!!
there were like a few years streak i hadn't cried at all
i'm getting better at it <:okk:1058108494995263539>
though it is an improvement from the 0 times i was a few years back
i cry like singular digit number of times in a year
it does take a lot for me to cry
yeah fair
i guess
you just like this story touch me to my core, time to eat a bagel
if i'm affected by something that hard, my whole day is about that
you move on fast huh
i know but
and now you're bored?
weren't you like sobbing just now
and that's scary
beginner help is probably the better one
i think between those
kinda wild
yeah, the working theory is fraud cause the dude was a compulsive liar
but i dunno if i'll join
i think i'm registered
and then they said it was their 18th birthday and they were going to prison for 3-5 years
and when they came back, they apologised and we said it's fine
someone in my clan didn't log in for a few days
i am also blocking heki until i get my period
LMFAO
actually don't
pin this <:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
L
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> fiona
or any of those coffee shops
i've never had starbucks
L
:batchestspin:
sounds right
what's HN budget stig again?
you'll fit right in
i have the perfect place for you to share those thoughts
wow cherry you're so smart
as a community
but we've just been really unlucky
is that elemental can crit
one of my conspiracy theories
i would never get rid of that
stacked FT piece
that's a fucking
jesus
nevermind
heki
do bitches cry?
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
*knock knock* hey tet how's the honkais hahah
my favorite character right now is toudou and i don't think that's a good thing LMFAO
i was interested by it but then by the end i just wish they gave me a reason to care about any of them
having the entire first arc kill off the main character and then separate him from the rest of the cast and not let them develop their personality and connection between each other was like... a brave choice
kugisaki
i'm starting to like whats-her-name
there's barely any character i actually enjoy at this point
it's not that i dislike it, i'm just very neutral about it
and then i didn't <:okk:1058108494995263539>
the people who recommended said that i should watch the anime instead
yeah i mean it's really my fault i think
sorry i said that cause i wanted to relate about you talking about stories
maybe i'll just read it slower and leave it as a like non hype manga
i'm this <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> close to dropping jujutsu
i get you
don't be a coward
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
keep cooking
keep it up!
there's nothing more fun than pushing your own limits
yes, keep doing your best
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
the word i'd use is sorry for you
<:life:1001518241610485781>
and thinking how much fun i'd be having on the same acc at MA
not even touching MA
i can't help but be a little annoyed when i saw 9s account at RL
i mean to a degree i kinda get it tho
LMFAO
get the samira
just hit <:okk:1058108494995263539>
is the patch out
really?
what is mihoyo cooking
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
how was it
v2 already happen right?
what did i miss
okay now that i'm back
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
that didn't meet s0 atk from ref
2s valk
i had unironically
it was so bad for me for a while
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
pulls s2 to match s0
my trademarked strat has always been
true though
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
did you try offline
eli cc
my answer for average player would be [latest archon] so nahida
really?
i wonder what avg player would answer to question like what is the strongest character right now
genshin is kinda genius, it shit on everything you think is necessary to make money on a gacha and make record profit because of it, not in spite of it
like it look pretty but you gotta see what a normal player will end up playing it like to see how fun it looks, and in the end you gotta play yourself to see if it's fun or not <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
combat is one of the things where a video like this probably doesn't showcase well
the exploration didn't impress me but early genshin exploration didn't also, so
the gameplay looks nice though, it has potential
but it's not what made people stick to genshin early on
dragonspine is great
don't get me wrong, later on the exploration gets pretty good
fighting random stuff is just that fun though
like mondstadt is pretty mid
early game open world exploration isn't even that good
is because the combat is reeeeally good
like i'm willing to bet half the reason genshin is so popular
you have to have good combat too
the character design didn't impress me but gacha character design is REALLY hard to impress me if i'm not already invested in the character
for gameplay
share link?
so true bestie
yeah you're not making me regret taking it off from ptw
yes but don't feel bad, i already wasn't going to get to it anyways
i misread funny as furry and i almost went back on my decision
brb gotta make some changes to my plan to watch
also wait overlord is isekai?
at least gen2
i feel like those are already past the start tho, no?
huh
mt?
the first few isekai that started the trend
what even is like
the few time it shows up i always go thank you exposition man!
i think it's funny
more manga should have narrator
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like calling something lewd porn
isn't that the point?
if you want the same thing, just read the manga again
to make a great anime you need to make a great anime, not a great manga
and just copying 1:1 to anime won't work
if a manga is really good, it'll use the medium to be great
to me, anime adaptation to be actually good have to make changes to source material
yeah
like if i'm rereading some stuff i do skip some chapters if i think my experience will flow better
i guess, i'm not really obsessed with that kind of stuff but i can understand it if you are
like if i was to watch anime, i would get done with maybe 1/10th as i am with manga
i have more opportunity to read in my daily routine and i'm appreciating pacing the media myself
i wouldn't say i have a preference, i just find it easier to consume manga at this point
maybe it works better if the animation carries the show
so i ended up ignoring the advice <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm not watching too much anime recently either tho
so maybe it's better
yeah i dunno, i asked around if i should watch the anime or if i could just start from the manga and most people said i should watch the anime
like it's not bad enough for me to drop it but it's also not good enough for me to want to binge read it in a few days
is the anime better?
some of the characters are fun but i'm not a turbo fan of the designs, which if they are good i'll accept a lot of bullshit just to look at them more
i'm gonna be honest, first few chapters didn't impress me much
i started reading jujutsu
and now that i'm catch up on oshi no ko
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
i know shiranui and akane
no problem <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i wasn't too impressed, in the end i had to like understand it from the characters telling me it than from actually seeing it
yeah i think i agree actually
i kinda wish they just flashbacked and showed more of ruby from the same time too
ruby was my favorite character until the author decided that the first few arcs were going to be about aqua instead
i'm actually turbo hype for the next few chapter cause i really like akane and ruby
but i still enjoy when other character on screen <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i mean yeah, and i feel happy for that, she deserves the world
untrue look at teri simp, they're so defeated they'll commemorate any appearance
i just read someone saying that the latest arc is bad cause kana isn't in it enough <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
insufferable?
are oshi no ko kana simps....
if you backpulled her and got less than a year out of her that's your own fault tho
i don't think anyone should regret pulling for her if you pulled on release
i mean you can't expect a valk to be as impactful as she was 1 year later
img elf?
how much img is too much img in one team
yes if you accept a -400 on score
eli <:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
the choice was obviously retiring
between BKE and DA
<:PU_PepeCuteFlushed:679402540994920461>
yeah roast him lumi
though i guess this is the aponia, not the v2v
story repeats itself
smh
click harder
i started in nirvana and now i'm somewhere else, and i call that a +
oh i'm nirvana+ alright
i can open up the simulations
well 4 dupe might be harsh
the last s is expensive bud
1s -> 2s is 30% of the price from going 1s -> 3s
yes
you have to be like genshin competitive tier to even consider skipping
gotta be so for fun player to skip
prometheus is the one thing that you like
30
phys triple support <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
like if you want 2 valk equally, still go for the newer one, you get the meta + the simp <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
still tho, be aware if you can afford other newer stuff you want
in that case
the entire thing is a mistake
if you're counting xtal for current release
like i always say, you can only afford to gacha old valk if you already can gacha new valk and have xtal to spare
for average valk though i wouldn't bother gacha for after release if you're not a whale
idk how powerful trio is, that's like the only thing i fully don't know about as far as current competitive state goes i wanna say
<:life:1001518241610485781>
every day i miss that drama more and more
idk how good trio is
yeah good luck
he also has to meet way tighter deadline than mihoyo too
even if he had the talent and wanted to put in the effort to make stuff on the same quality
like again, it's genuinely not shitting on moriso on this mark
just like how an indie movie vs big hollywood movie you can clearly tell which had the money put into it from lightning, camera, that kinda stuff
i mean i guess i get it, i'm not saying it's better or worse as a value statement, more like a professional quality standard
like if they planned to do an elf box, that's a hype thing, they would've announced it already
if they haven't announced something big then assume it won't come
no elf box
no try <@416445660443967491>
cause you get a ton of value for your pull
refund is great for spending
no it does full amount
it's small spending
but it's just impossible to meet big team quality
his content and design quality are great for solo creator
i mean sure but i'll only shit on him on what he deserves
but they would never pass as official mihoyo content
like i'm not shitting on moriso, they're great for what they are
are they?
you think moriso makes those art himself?
it is official
moriso is just translated official CN post
i mean
i'm 100% confident the gear they announced is the newest that will be available, other stuff all older
they would've announced too
i guarantee if they put DPe gear in there
and eden guns
they announced full gear for 5.5 and 5.6 valk
they make stuff like turg available and i go thanks for my 4th set <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> 
always hard put myself on other feet to value how much the event is worth
yeah these kinds of events i gotta like
patch history spreadsheet: 
<>
i'll clean up pins
pe spa
prob everything important from before 5.6
i remember trying to help someone on mobile for the same thing but i wasn't able to help
if on desktop
settings -> app settings -> text and images -> emoji -> the option should be there
skill diff
<3
does mine do it too
wait
mobile idk hw to fix it
that's just what i assume from the CN text, i can't actually read
the middle 5 foca + frags i think is event?
i think the top and bottom ones are login
they reeeeally want you to afford prometheus
yup 10 sp 10 foca free in 6.6
if you go max pity on everything, you run out of refund for the last pulls
yeah the refund isn't infinite
if you told me there was only abyss version and sent me that ref i would've believed you
<:crying:757445037402619974>
what did they do to my gamemode
i wish i had never seen that ref
really MA?
is that
n-no, baka
<a:NervousSweat:765639934555324486>
and i'm not supposed to like tsunderes
oh shit i just realised that you can call kana a tsundere
<:FLUSH:1000270165293944882>
i misread that as yes and it sucks your balls
oh
there's an abyss one?
not the kana i had in mind but i'll take it
she's pretty
weird
i get 5 weekly?
sure actually
nvm stay safe
lumi where's the v
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm quitting like imy
i guess instead of quitting like celine
very simple <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
when i get home i can try to make some realistic calc with the info
to know how much SEA is scamming when they're -1d
iriya really wants this info
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<@453263261467410442> is credited
oh i know some of the people behind it
i guess it kinda makes sense?
i wouldn't have guessed that res scaled linearly
cause that's really interesting
i went directly to the disturbance calc though
they do it for me
i don't have to go on the rant anymore
LMFAO
yeah i'm at college city right now
bus is in 20 mins
god i'm hype
OH SHIT THE BOOK IS AT MY PLACE
i can see why you're heki's friend
i'll get my kneecaps bust <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i can't legally say it <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
yes actually <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
and you get free +10fps
you just need to restart the game from time to time
and from experience, if you are at it for too long, it'll start lagging horrendously
it is a very fps scammy boss though
you can have like 100% success rate
unless you're running phys
tank has no rng whatsoever
so if you're getting different timer, it's different timing on your end
that it goes up
well, it's just a set timer after you kill it
it shouldn't matter
i don't think i understand the question
that's just the transition?
they're not even hitting the weakpoint on p1 there i'm pretty sure
yellow shield?
okay i'm catch up on oshi no ko <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
share vid
if you're a lil late you could stagger the ult
timing seems tight on JK qte
yeah it doesn't look like there are too many tricks there
i guess i could see it actually
9s HoF strat don't even care for weakspot?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i'll use my super power
maybe share your gameplay too
share ref?
elf?
i guess that's fair
really?
after it finishes <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> , it closes the weakspot for a sec and then opens it up again
while the tank is <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> you can hit it yeah
you can only hit it on certain attack
like on p2? MA?
you've been
if you wanna be competitive, you'll have to make good choices with your resources
i mean in the end that's what the info you need right? not the state you're at, but what you're aiming for
or if you're happy bouncing nirv rl
they're asking if you wanna do it or not
even if it's way easier nowadays
being a nirvana competitor isn't about actually retaining or not
<:EdiePout:914212954625437767>
snork mimimimi
don't poke me there
whoa i feel poked somehow
okay nevermind i didn't expect this
i'm still not done with the scandal arc and i spoiled myself on the name of the next one and that one i have high expectations
i think for now that's my favorite arc
on the 2.5d arc there was some very pretty panels
some art in oshi no ko was very good
yeah, i think oshi no ko to some degree are the writers trying to keep the spirit of act age alive
so i wonder how i'll feel about it when i get to it
like act-age
on my plan to read is some stuff i know i'll enjoy but i also know for various reasons it won't be finished
yeah i was thinking about similar stuff
but still
i guess it makes sense since that's proobably the biggest thing they can end the movie on?
yeah 90 min for 12 chapter is kinda rushed
i know it's 90 min but still
oh is that how far ep1 is going? that's kind of a lot i think
LMFAO yeah, it's working though, like they foreshadowed HARD that she was going to die but i still had second thought even to the point where she actually died just because of how hard they promote ai in specific
what can i say
it's good
i'll prob finish that + start some new stuff while i go back home in a bit
i'm almost catch up with oshi no ko
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
crowd control
but i could see ice and lightning DoT
fire cc sounds hard to justify
something like haze for ice
they could add a fire cc and ice lightning DoT
like we have freeze para stun as cc and bleed ignite as DoT
i could maybe see it
yeah shatter dps <:Clueless:996308692133761094>
we can have that
what the fucking freeze -> claymore shit called in genshin
melt dps
so overwhelmingly niche <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
the only dps kira can be is something like bio shield
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
that's what you'd do alright
yeah
yeah
that'd be a skip chief
as a competitive player
yeah no if it were me
please kana survive through it
i'm at ch99 right now, i'm so hyped for kana, but i spoiled myself on the name of the next arc <a:Aware:1021872319930564678> 
you probably can't afford hare
if you're not sure you can pull on hare
def shaved a few seconds on certain strat in 3s MA
i've gone around and i see the value of it when you're pushing your acc to the max
for normal player prob not highest prio
cosmic ain't bad to max
whoa
LMFAO they fixed it? all because of you
not bad investments
yeah you're prob going to be using phys a good amount in the near future
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
maybe i should figure out how to do that
a weighted graph would even work better for the pri release actually now that i think about it
but not to know how to improve it <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm like exactly smart enough to understand how my analysis and thought process isn't good enough
i wish i was smarter <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
actually exactly 15% now that i do the math
like, 1.0 is clearly weighed waaaaay too high to do any analysis, to this day that patch released >10% of all valks we have
so the graph cares more about recent releases than older releases
maybe there's some weighted way to do it
it's probably not that useful
but for like valk release, where mihoyo is probably aiming for a different one in each stage of the game
it's prob a good tool to figure out an average if mihoyo is aiming for one
it's graphing out how the average change per patch
then 1.1 release 2 valk, 14 in total, 7 per patch
like, 1.0 release 12 valk, so 12 valk per patch
it's the average per patch
we had 2 valk per patch on most patch
like until like around 3.0
graphing it out from the release isn't very useful
we've went through some really big changes in how valks are released
yeah idk
i guess they could do a qua ice dps instead of ice qua dps
there's literally no design space for ice dps i don't think
okay i'll do it
i mean i guess it would be still interesting to see that increase
we've already seen an increase in valk release
for valk release tho? they can just milk away
there's an upper limit of how much they can shill before no one can keep up
resource is pretty limited
cause you can only buy so much metal
like, pri arm release is kinda forced to be on a steady schedule
kira
but i don't think that's as meaningful
to try and predict
i could try to draw out valk release sched
yeah
i could actually extract useful info from that
imagine how much more of a nerd i'd be <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
this is keilo without any stats training
i think it's unlikely it'll be 2 double or 2 single
we will have one double pri patch and one single pri patch
that between 6.7 and 6.8
so i can somewhat predict
and it's about ~1.46
so you see, the average been settling down at a number
and graph it out
we take the avg per patch
this variable
pri release is surprisingly consistent
i'll do it just so you understand
during class i'll figure out the double pri question
with this technology it can't be consistently believable
yeah it's not meant to be very accurate, you can't train a markov chain either, it's a simple deterministic algorithm
actual AI is too expensive for me to get for random bullshit right now <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it's not that advanced, it's just a markov chain
that'd be pretty hard tho, since i'd have to add the bot to a lot of random servers for it to see messages like that
it's actually way less resource intensive than gathering all messages every time it generated a new one
from this server
i'll just manually export all message and save it to a .txt for each person
oh it's not going to be that technological of a system to draw data
i fucking despise friday classes too
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
so i have extended weekend to work on it
i'm going to work at it more later today, friday is a holiday
i can know current average
if i can figure out the actual average they want to keep
okay so i'm pretty sure mihoyo wants to keep an average of ~1.4 pri per patch
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
when a 2 pri patch is coming
i could probably figure out
you know
pri grind never ends
do it
yeah fuck it
most eyes are catalyst if you think about it
but chakram is the one that has the hardest precedent to just being a catalyst
yes
LK use it like an axe
IO use it as a staff during burst
cross is just kinda look like, but like
aponia just uses it unironically like catalyst though
chakram
no
unironically retain RL with that
you? that'll depend
like normal player? yeah 893
what boss is it
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
it's because A-rank HN is enough
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
what even do you do
cez TM and no HoS until now
i don't even want to talk shit to rei, i just feel bad
oh shit new release? i'm down
that's so sad
aw the fan translations are dropped now that simulpub started
i haven't even started reading kaguya LMFAO it's actually so funny to get spoiled like this
LMFAO <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992> i'm getting spoiled for a whole nother manga from oshi no ko
i'm pretty sure it's a jojo ending
well i guess it makes sense that ruby is just as unhinged, i'm into it though
i guess i'm impressed that it's a real place but jesus
they actually tracked down where the kana and aqua date was supposed to happen <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm reading the most fucking obsessed fan translation i've ever seen for any manga
never fucking mind, i've never misread a character arc so badly
i'm a kana simp
now i know who it is
oh shit i've used that emote before
<:KanaDespair:817489397015773244>
True !
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
LMFAO
cause that's what i was talking about
a manga obviously
yeah i think so
oh honkai
for what
please sire, a crumb of therapy, for the road
cause holy shit
arc 6 of oshi no ko better be called aqua goes to therapy
LMFAO the strat for clearing the gears
that's so fucking good holy fuck
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
LMFAO <a:TRUEing:1067865783058825280>
what got them cooking
lukewarm bad takes, it's not even v2 yet
like for a while maincord was kinda chill
what even is the cause of that
some of the hardest stuff i've done was greeted with a hard t30 cause it was a week where everyone had easier option for one of the bosses, and i was infinitely more proud of it than the week i t10 because i was the only player in NA who care about MA that week <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
seeing a small number next to my name is cool but to me it was always about pushing me and my acc to the most it could
the way i always talked about my MA balding, it rarely was i can get x more spots in t100, and more i'm -1 -2 -1 and balding to fix that
even shaving off a few seconds after understanding more deeply something is really cool
i love the feeling of capping a boss, doing a very very skill intensive strat and getting it right after hours of trying
to me, MA bald was always self satisfaction
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
i saw the message on <#1079789802116882532> and it said MA and i wanted to talk about it
don't ask me why i'm backreading so far, but no amount of material reward would ever be enough to properly compensate the amount of balding it takes to cap some MA strats
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
aw shit this got dark fast
<:AiSmile:742418293700296745>
so i can do ruby terigrab
where's the oshi no ko discord server for emotes
i'm still pretty early on but i'm enjoying it, the way people talked about it i was expecting something waaaaay different though
it sets up expectations so well, i actually pogged irl when i went back to page 1 on ch6 and realise what she meant by it
i dunno if it's only in the early chapters, i assume so, but having the first page being timeskip snapshot of one of the characters every chapter is so cool
okay damn i'm reeeally enjoying oshi no ko
hey @khai nice to meet you, can you post a message asking mihoyo for phys breach and how it's really impactful
tet is just @ing random people to bait me at  this point
leave me alone
it's not going to fucking work
<a:Chatting:996353943108067388> v2v is trash didn't even beat my score
you look around, look at the 4 people above you, no v2v
you play MPE at kosma, you get t5
you're like at RL, there's no v2v in sight
or is their v2v competition just dogshit at rl
just repeat what they hear
do they like
stop trying to bait me
not gonna work
see y'all in 12 hours
okay i'll take a nap now and i'll begin working on it when i wake up
and then maybe a command to generate a 3-4 message snippet whenever you want
i can do like it generates a message every 5 mins and send it over <#1080930344859090974>
yeah that's a good idea
it was pretty good
but with jalapeno
kinda like baked potato whrer you fill it with stuff
once i ate those like
yes <:waiting:1027534309298544640>
or do you dream of you standing at your pc typing shit out
like is your mind like all discord
how does that work
really? discord dreams? that's nuts
old chat thing, back in irc era
OOOOOH LMFAO
<a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753>
i'm 100% sure that's a thing already
icq instead of discord
if you say like
LMFAO
it's not too late, wake up
cherry your mother is standing by you, crying over her lost child
cherry it's been 5 years
cherry wake up
i think we already were in the same page that this server isn't real
i guess i'm glad if they aren't
are the elementary schoolers not real?
you always win
you think this is agressive -> yes -> good
                                                     -> no -> why you lying then
it's the fucking toxic gambit
LMFAO
my feelings are hurt
<:crying:757445037402619974>
yes
i wonder why
you always get so aggressive right after i make a joke about how your tastes are bad
every attack you do, the screen will slow down and a big button will flash on your screen to tell you what's the next button you're supposed to press
what no
you're fucked
when you start taking the slippery slope into shorter rots
then timer is all that matters
when all challenge is based on timer
yeah that's the problem with current design
and like you had to run some stupid shit to actually proc FR qte
like you had to actually play the game and farm sp to ult with AE to get all buffs
like past valk design was similar, it was just harder to qte + ult
tbh tho i thought about it and i think the real issue is just how much more fast paced the game is now
and she'll be better than HoS with prometheus
you can just release HoS again but this time, her buff not locked to shield
like because of the way they're designing new valk
you don't have to bring new stuff to the table at this point
you see how i still talk with tet?
sure, it's  not why i have him blocked though, i don't block over bad taste
you don't have to bring much new to the table
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
look up my past messages if you wanna know about it
i'm not talking about kith anymore, i try to explain why his takes makes me mad but he hates hua is what everyone else hears
for elemental, scaling with dist breach amount will matter a good amount, but for phys we haven't seen impair change in a while, and even if we do it doesn't make that much of a difference
yeah being able to rotate cleanly for longer is prob the most impactful thing HN does
like the only phys stat that scales with disturbance is impair
for phys is just unironically just more damage i'm pretty sure
so like it's not like he's incapable to understand what i mean, he just chooses not to when he thinks his point is made better when he ignore what i say
and kith agreed
there was one time that i described exactly what i meant when i say 2s MA was removed, which is the community is gone
yeah i think it was either like him having absolutely no other argument so he was forced to back into it, or just straight up bad faith
and it's like goldfish memory
but then you talk about something else for 5 seconds
they did remove it
he eventually accepted that yes
if you pushed him on it
i mean his take wasn't really that
he also had a really hard time accepting that 2s MA was removed
and kith take is that because he dislikes it, there's no problem with removing content
like, my take has always been that removing 2s MA was a bad move from mihoyo, even if you dislike MA you can understand that, since a good amount of the community quit over it
nah it's not any of the like personal preference stuff, like it's not him saying he dislikes hua or anything of the sort
just unironic shadowboxing with myself making myself infinitely mad
i don't have that much against him, i don't block over disagreement, i blocked him so i could have peace
like it was unhealthy for me
the reason why i have kith blocked is that his takes make me way too mad
also yes taihen i can add shudan
and making it pretty
the thing that takes time is coding the bot
time to generate should be pretty fast
yes
i'll add kith to the list if he wants to
o also if kith wants in, someone @ me about it
not me
you do it so you can get <a:PingChomp:1002644813985890304> reactions
<@309634550273933314> you decide if ping or not is worthy, you liked the idea
should i ping for the announcement
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
too much damage
lumi problems
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
ooooo
i'll make an announcement about it
it's actually not that complicated, it's a markov chain generator, i just gotta download everyone's message history
the guy who made it told me how it works
okay i think i can figure out the morb bot
idk about big guy tho
i mean the one that teleports around is bio
yes
the one that teleports right
we call her ninja
yes
then i switched to sister pc and got literal first try going from 30 -> 90-100 fps
like on wolf, i spent like 10 hours trying to do the opener and i never got it
uncap fps is unironically a different game though, some strat is SO much easier it's insane
you dont have to care about their opinion though, in the end you gotta be the one to decide if its something you think its cool or not
it matters in both
in NA most top player look down on it in MA and abyss
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
is one of those eye opener refs
the karoto cap ref
i wouldn't bother affix for HoS
idk shui is like only for FT nowadays
qte version is harder but less baldy but stil lbaldy
like gresham said the shield is the real boss
the max hekate actually helps a good amount
FT you go all in on crit
she's crit hungry
so you can prob run slightly worse stuff and get away with it
for 893 damage threshold is way smaller tho
bastet TM is the best set there
better no
like bastet for tank idk
be careful to not lock anything you don't want to use somewhere else
full shui
yeah kallen is fucking crazy on damage threshold
like utu and shit
do you have any of the starting sp weapon for bb?
893 is pretty free tho
kallen is like the hardest on both skill and damage for 946
i was trying to bm, that's just a normal ref
nevermind
oh wait i thought that was a lower score
i'll take it
unironic confidence booster
you want to run triple support without newt, paga, holmes, shui or cez
cool
run this
oh i guess if you wanted to run SI it'd be annoying
what you running there
is it that important for kallen
if you have 4s dudu you can prob 893
i just got elf diff'd
actually it's probably not a lie
the 893 with MPE is a lie
the digits are in increasing order
47856 are like
whoa
what rank are you
tank-nya?
i'm very sleep deprived, is that like the default keilo state
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
therefore, i'm both unfunny to other people and they're all wrong, objectively
my actual position is
1. my sense of humour is probably not very funny to other people but
2. i'm very funny to myself and
3. my opinion is the only one that matters
pretty simple really
then eric is the favorite color
and it's eric
like if they're spinning the wheel to decide chat favorite color
it's eric
like favorite color blue, Eric, purple, red, yellow
so now every wheel picker has Eric as an option
or how he went to do random wheel picker one time and it already had set up names on it, so he just decided to leave Eric there
like instead of LUL people say LLU because once upon a time one of the mods mispelled it and chat made a fucking big deal out of it for no reason
just less expectations really
i'll go with unfunny
uhhhhhhhh
i'll pick uhhhh
yeah, his streamer jokes are like very extreme either a lot of lore or none at all
just bad taste, i'm objectively very funny
<:AkaneMorb:1054481239740006541>
so what morbseph actually does is that it generates messages and then gives it a random timestamp, as if it's morbing a future convo
cause like, the streamer name is joseph, and he has a meme of morbing, which in the stream context is seeing stuff from the future/alternate reality
yeah i dunno if it's an open thing, i've messaged the person who set it up
to see if i can get a fork of it
maybe i can message the person who created it
that would be so funny
based on past message history
and it just generated convos from people
added a bot called morbseph
for april fools the discord server for one of my favorite streamers
you know what i really want
that shits on anyone who says that
set up a bot
i don't do isekais
it's like peeking into another universe
and i puke them out as they are
the stories morb into my head
not in the hit game honkai impact, we call it furthering character development
the video does confuse me
i vibe to this, it's my kinda music
you try to make an edgy OC but the bible already has it
i guess that's just the anti christ if you think about it
add more sins to my tally
die and make me worse
can you be like reverse jesus for me
the last one you posted there? i think i listened to it but i can check again
smh ely simp
talk about how the art trade went
aster you should do a new arc city news issue
hi aster
was that not an emote
:schizo:
i have female friend
i can't be sexist
do it and cook there
everyone gets to have fun on their turn
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
just pass the op bat around
ikr
it really is unironic just gambling for TF
i was watching boxbox climb and that shit look depressing
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it's a warcry
big thing i hated on league is how their objective was not to balance the game, but to just make it slightly unbalanced in various different ways
i was talking about just riot balancing team, i would think they would do similar thing between league and tft
what they do
5 year since i quit league and nothing change huh
bible has no power here
it was me actually
<:OkaygeBusiness:945151371869560953>
i'll take credit for that too
i like both of those words
yeah i'll take the entire credit tyvm
my only redeeming quality
<a:KeiloTheBear:1002644779441598585>
me when tet tells me to stop being quirky
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i thought you were already done with that arc though
why would we spoil that for you
we ran out of lines, so now we're repeating discussions
npc server
or one day for 3s HoS <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i actually can barely think of stuff that has good endings, even stuff that i really enjoyed
you're right but my black pill is that all manga/anime will already have an underwhelming poor ending 99% of the time
<a:pepeMeltdown:933941237021569035>
so in a way i don't mind reading stuff on ongoing limbo cause there's a good chance it's better than actually reading the ending <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
like outstandingly few
very few anime/manga end well
i don't check if it's on going or not <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
idk i just read stuff that people recommend to me
oh it makes sense why, it's fucking 90 minutes long
o wait i see, first ep had theater release
wait is the anime out already?
oh i think i shouldn't click that yet
i hear very good things, still only read ch1 tho
the person who recommended it to me even said that chapter 1 was wild but i still didn't expect it
fucking wild chapter, holy fuck, i don't even wanna spoil it to any degree since it's also getting the anime soon
and i think i've never been more stunlocked by a chapter than chapter 1 of that
i also started reading oshi no ko today
if they happen either way though i'm hype
i mean i don't doubt it but it would make me kinda bummed in the long run cause i'm looking forward to the maikeru lessons
i wonder if we'll get another top contender for the rensekai though, cause it's a top 4 and we got 3 right now, idk if tama will make it
i fucking love hikaru though
i went way more <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> over kaichi reveal than hikaru showing up, for the second it was a matter of time for me
yeah i can't wait, i fucking love hikaru
i think i would've gotten more out of it if i took longer until the kaichi reveal
i do regret letting the few chapter pile up tho
like it's hard to disagree with issho at all
yeah i really appreciate it, i think the author does a good job of setting up rival while not making them villains
yeah it makes very much sense too, i liked that he's older but still new and it doubles up cause of anyone, it would be issho who would take an older zenza
like even before the reveal at the end of the chapter i was already very into him
i think i really enjoy the two new chara, kaichi and tama, especially kaichi
and i do concede, i went <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> on the latest chapter
<@180679257851166721> i'm catch up on akane
no one but me talks about MA
they're not talking about MA
MA jizo yea
they're just forgetting about BKE but maybe it's trauma blocking their memories
not very outlandish takes tho, true that between HN and hare, hare will outscore on jizo realistically speaking
they're giving prometheus discount banner cause it's double valk patch <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
they aren't giving prometheus a discount banner cause they like her more than HN
people just have a really hard time understanding mihoyo motives
point taken
wanna share mine?
LMFAO
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
RL player like wow nirvana so hard, i had to ult to clear the mob before the boss
now that everyone has access to nirvana everyone can be <a:Aware:1018788549077782548> of how paper rl truly is
i wasn't making it up then
<:dogkek:664517636524343344> okay i see
sheeesh
i assume kallen cause it looks like it has a bunch of hp bars
literally can't tell what the fuck the boss is
so i'm stuck at like 240p
i haven't logged in to my bili² acc
i was just like spend enough time in nirvana and you'll understand
oh ok i remember someone going like that
i think it was you who were like kinda dislike when nirvana player talk down to RL, saying that it's paper when it's really not
you became what you complained before once
no pri = don't deal damage
maincord still says she's shit cause no pri
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
how is it
farming overworld mobs
if you catch the 5 min section of the stream where they're arti farming maybe
yeah you wish
and look at what you're missing
just open any genshin stream
o ashikai vids are actually pretty good if you are interested in genshin story
i do other stuff while watching vids
what really
just watch like ashikai vids or smth
meanwhile genshin you read the hundreds and books and go damn that's a really cool story, wish i was playing that game instead
honkai you're there for the character development, you get to the lore and it's like quantum what? what the fuck is going on? oh kiana is here love you kiana
polar opposite
genshin and honkai story are like
but she's a genshin character
like yeah she's bland and annoying
i don't mind her that much
y'all just like her cause your standards for genshin are lower
like unironically just the same valk
eula would've been just BKE again
guys
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
one for each hand
broke 1k hours already <a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
it's not that bad anymore actually i think, cause i don't play that much during the week
idk i'm scared to look at it
do you wanna guess how many hours i have in it? i started like about 4 months ago
runescape is my new game
i think i'll reinstall for fall valks, get to matchmaking hell and uninstall
from both
yeah i turbo quit
and then on the fourth day i was higher level than all of them
like first 3 days i said i wouldn't play cause it didn't look like my type of game and it wouldn't run on my pc
i learned about genshin because a lot of my friends were excited to play the botw rip off <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
i have highschool classmates who are married
i don't wanna think about shit like that
the elderly
yeah for a mihoyo game server we are like
nini says she ain't a furry but is feeding the furry boy better than i ever did
thank you bestie
what the fuck is fun
you lose keilopoints over that
what even
heki is cunnying over a car
dudu?
kill count
try one more?
i regret typing that
nvm
yeah i'm about to grip that taixuan too
i'm getting a call from da wei
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
<a:Blushiekissy:795363746339356702>
i get why carv left
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
then it's free and you'll look at it even more
just make it your wallpaper
true and based
you could simplify that into inu(kai)²
i think it sounds nice
people call me kelio often
treasury got gresham'd LMFAO
keilo moment
wait 1 point?
NA moment
no she ain't
and then you look at rank up
alright fine shes whale valk
like you see her need 13/13 to do anything and you go
yeah it's very bad
nah it's better, cmon
you need the perfect middle ground for her price to be worth her performance
if you overinvest with rank ups she gets shit returns
if you invest perfectly at s0 13/13 she's avg
if you underinvest slightly, she blows
that's like the ultimate problem of nyx
they weren't
ER
for fucking
yeah it was the patch after af pri
but idk if that's true either, most old pri were necessary at the time too
maybe they're releasing more pri that are necessary
as much more shill we're getting, number of pri per patch hasn't changed since release
like stamina management
but it's a temporary one
i realise that it is a problem
i mean i said, i whale past that problem
is there?
you'll get there too
yeah but like
like some whaling is to get ahead in investment, other is just to advance acc age
i mean not only whale, just old player
i can make predictions later
io gear is p much confirmed
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
what else are you even spending it on
like if you don't need any gear
you'll just finish it later
so?
yeah
don't even bother doing the math
buy all mobi frag + all HoF frag + HoF card
4 pala is just
yea card always been a scam
or was it 2 sets of stamps + 1 card?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i remember you being able to buy 2 cards + a set of stamps
32 for a card? is that right?
if you go all paladin
i think you can, no?
not only play the same, also look the same <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
new gen valk huh
can you really not
guys it's still a month until then you don't have to give happy birthday this early <a:Blushiekissy:795363746339356702>
thank you
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
so it'll be fun to spend the day playing with fwens
it's my birthday
i think i'll def try day one
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
but we don't even have that
i was going to link genshin discussion
yeah
yes
most likely talking about abyss
and god is punishing you over it
it's cause mobile is cringe
should be just tencent, he's there
it was for april fools, guess it's staying though
he shared like a spreadsheet with all MA boss resistance and hp value
yeah, tencent was sharing that in blustorm the other day
yeah there's nothing new
they can calc how much hp a boss will have based on dist
CN player figured out a bunch about dist though
the more annoying part is resistances
it's just annoying to get all the numbers cause they're scattered as hell
like straight up multipliers that's easy
damage isn't that concoluted
aponia takes 50% less damage? ez my stig makes me deal 50% more damage, cancel out and i deal normal damage
honkai math ain't basic, they don't tell you how it works either
well to be fair
if they understood the math behind it they wouldn't be in maincord
someone else earlier came and said she only has 50% damage reduction
oh don't you worry, they know
fragile is just better
choccy?
she says, addicted
she already said she doesn't want to do raids
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
shit game not worth heart failure over
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
sleep angle
please have a ton of slice of life flashback chapters author
LMFAO god
it's getting an anime, right? i'll prob not watch just for that <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i also really like the chara designs as long as you don't remind me that they hair is supposed to be fucking rainbow colored
the way i kinda see it going forward is that taiyo lets alpha and hifumi run around the country and look for each family member
yeah hopefully
like the taiyo mutsumi ai chapters were fucking bangers
i actually started reading because of ai, the thing i'm sad about is how she barely is around anymore
seems like that's the ultimate goal of the manga though <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
when it starts getting to action-y i'm like meh
i don't care much for the lore drops and stuff
yeah same, the slice of life stuff slaps
yeah that makes sense
i was just really impressed by how much they decided to change the status quo all of a sudden, alpha and hifumi are probably the new main chara for the new arc
honestly i respect it
holy fuck i didn't make the mental math LMFAO
like that the author had the balls to do that
but i got really impressed by the time skip
nothing much, last chapter i wish the author took some time to go expand more on the time skip
is anyone reading yozakura here?
skill issue
yeah you're right
that chapter is my fucking downfall, i remember it so badly
it might be
is it reading comprehension issue again
i mean sure but i'm sure he can choose to not help
to a degree if that's what sota is doing then i dunno, wasn't sota the one that made minako remember the truth? if all he wanted to do is keep the info unknown, he could've just not done that
i guess <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like after looking at irl kakeru, he doesn't seem like he did anything meaningful irl to disappear off the dream, besides maybe deciding to off himself? maybe it's a dream thing but idk
idk grandpa is still around, i have no idea what is the cause of people not showing up anymore
at this point i'm not even sure how much supernatural shit exists in the universe, whatever dream tsubasa is cooking might not even do anything to help or hinder at all
i mean maybe, we know so little about him
i dunno what that would be
yeah i'm letting the author cook, i think if they can pull a core theme string to tie the story it would end up very good
yeah
i'm enjoying ichinose but i'm very lost LMFAO
so i got the core themes right
for takopii i actually guessed the ending and still cried at it
i'm like just around for the ride at this point for this, i have no clue where this is going
yeah i actually don't mind that that much, it's clear their relationship is far from normal already
it'd be kinda fucked up and cruel if they're not even sharing the dreams actually
the one thought i have is that it's weird that it look like kakeru and minako are still having dreams even though in tsubasa dream, they're not there anymore
i wanna hear it
nono keep cooking
on ichinose
what was the theories tet
<a:greshamlao:976905381429272668>
that's not how his name is spelled
i mean yeah i can see it
tet rn
LMFAO
roast her
yeah you're right cherry
i read the new chapter, i liked it but it didn't make me as emotional as last chapter
if you think about it, ichinose is kinda just homestuck
haters will say it's because i'm a whale but it's all skill
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
nah i'm not logging in and i'm rock solid in sinful
not crippled if you don't pull weapon <:Clueless:996308692133761094>
did they read that last part back
hmmmm
<:KianaDumb:909232418052014171>
that's with ruby i assume
i actually have 3 akane chapter to catch up on <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<:monka:1058108490779983902>
i cried past chapter already
thank you carl
and bonk on HoS in the meanwhile
yeah you do charged into ult with SNS and she deals a ton of damage
you actually just play it like HoS dps
unless you're MA player
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
just use SNS
i wouldn't even bother maxing the gear
yeah if you have 4/4 s0 BKE
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
LMFAO i feel you
is it just the first few seconds of vocals or did it export wrongly
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
aim for these stars <:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
gotta run a bitcoin mine to get stable 30fps at rimestar on max settings
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
20fps at rimestar and pig
max graphics you get like
yeah that explains it all
they can go up?
turn your settings down
what the fuck you mean
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
<:majj:1067071761142796418>
shit on them
destroy them
spit on them
go for 684
uncapping wouldn't do much for you chief
80fps
<:peepoDetective:422832690375688193>
haha honkai is so quirky
the game pranked you!
is less time than i spent on literally any boss in honkai
a 10 minute one and done fight
what the fuck is a scylla
chill out
heki
maybe maincord gave away free recipe books the same day mihoyo gave art book
but they doomposted 7tr so idk
i'd say it's harder to doompost these releases
is this abnormal
oh let's give out free books
mihoyo was like what do we even spend this all on, there's nothing left to buy
it made them too much money last time
honestly i agree
waay too early i feel like
it's so funny
you'll come up with your recipe
never give up
kinda inspiring
yeah they're invested in their craft
15 patches ago
like HoF made in abyss on HoD reelase patch
i mean you prob did
yea sounds right
i did read through hare skill and shedidn't have it
i wanna say it shows up for everyone if someone on team has it but idk
idr actually
yeah i'm very sure it's just prometheu's core execute
no that's prometheus
brain on overdrive to figure it out
poor guys
they're cooking so hard
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
something about this release fucking activated hidden genes
if bke had summon dealt most of the damage from summon used javelin and had a different kit, hare gear would fit her perfectly
you'll know
whenever 3s rimestar and 3s doom happen
community would make a piss show out of 3s rimestar
lumi you'd know
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
only matter of time until new bio fire and 3s rimestar
only place SR is in is 2s rimestar
might not even be a thing anymore with CN
honestly never
turg SI outperform SR on wolf just because of that
op
start sp
unironically forgot about rimestar
o yeah rimestar, true
SoS on SI for SpA wolf and judah on IO wolf
and both for wolf <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
they both only have really niche use
hmmm
idk how to pause emote gif
it's pogg but staring at your soul
it's such a good frame
and poggspin gets stuck on frame1
i love when my discord laggs
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
7.0 wt valk -> close servers
herrscher of silverwing <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
HoSwDk
HoS will always be in your heart if you retire
that score isn't that good
eli did you try getting a better score?
i can fix her
all time low
decimated keilopoint economy
maincord keilo arc fucking
i'm going back to maincord
okay
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
yeah we're giving her a few years <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
it'll be sick
maturing slowly
senti will be mc of part 2, learning how to live without hua
if you loved her as much as i did, you'd be okay with letting her go when it's time
sanest seele simp
yeah you mean it in a different way though <:MeiKnife:647104199406125100>
between veliona and hua dying though, i wish it was hua
🦀
i'll read all your messages as ny accent eli
is she fine
please, tell me doctor
LMFAO
i couldn't
i wouldn't
i'd never
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
you're catching me right in the middle of my unhinged arc
you have such high hopes for me tai
slowly
and then i can feel good about it
if i predict everyone dying then i'll be right eventually
veliona is fucking dead
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
smh wyv, you can do better than this
wyverein replied clarifying
oh yeah it is just an april fools joke
it's a boring april fools joke if it's a joke
could be april fools tho like tai said
pretty good bp if it's true
made in abyss gear also not bad
4/4 IO is prob a good get for cheaper from bp
panini is still pretty good
it's better for the players but i'm not a player so booooo
booooo
they're announcing all bp now? that's fucking boring
shouldn't be that bad
yeah i mean that's just what we used to run on abyss bke
whoa i should've averaged it out
it's either 700s or 500s
hmmm
what boss?
idk, is it supposed to be bad? even in nirv we ran no breach support on some bosses for HoT
take it as a blessing
yeah maybe you should stay away from maincord
actually
how long was that ago
call them racists
and then shit on anyone if they called you to change
you should've just changed it into chinese writing
is there like chinese hanzi for taihen
god me too
where's vgc series d
i wanna play that format
LMFAO
holy shit
least delusional seele simp
<a:AggressiveBidoofing:859086369850392688>
no i spent a few hours in maincord and i'm in attack mode
i do
not with that attitude
<:nepetaSlur:995333210584121434>
oh they have a nepeta yipee
<:nepetaBong:1054469839084863598>
<a:aTereziFlipping:393671882442014721>
yes
this is the wrong channel
i don't think i ever shipped much
now do every other dorm exchange stig
let's fucking go
her usefulness hasn't really declined, the most you can say is her bosses stopped showing up, which is true for every single valk a few patches after release
as long as barely is the same amount she was since release
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
like BoL set always kinda useful
or something
isn't this the new BoL set?
<:Gladge:1047969762170388531>
1pm here
it's not
sleep well
doesn't it look fun
that's the 2023 new gen valk experience gresham
yeah i was like huh i miss carv
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
did carv leave?
SI general support, prometheus for shield breaking for now
yeah that sounds right
<a:WHAT:1068133759158849567>
unironically tho everyone acting so surprised as if it's their first week playing
@ me when i'm right
yeah seele will be either phys support impair or dps or either fire ice lightning, support dps, i could see quantum imaginary psy bio or mech
lmfao
order only matters if you wanna pick which, but they still cockblock each other no matter what
so you can only have one or the other
both of them have shield which is stated only apply if you don't have another shield up
maybe during v1 we find out it's different though
that was the theory before we actually got numbers/performance testing
with SI for bleed niche
and prometheus will be the generalist phys support
she'll synergise better with prometheus
and then when new HoS comes out
something like that
yeah, SI would be the generalist phys support, and prometheus for shield weather
with some weather that you'll prefer one, some weather you'll prefer other
prometheus will be like a sidegrade to SI
and then the theory is that for now
not that she's actually replacing HoS
yeah that's what we mean when we call her that
than HoS does
with prometheus
of how the new HoS is going to work better
yeah, she's HoS killer because she's showing the signs
not because she's actually the one replacing HoS
because a lot of her kit is awkward with HoS
okay, so we are calling her the HoS killer
i mean yeah obviously she's not taking HoS slot
or like do you think it's just going to be a general replacement to second support on phys team?
i mean replacing the si/sns slot as opposed to.... taking the hos slot?
wdym tho
wake up
trio valks was a state lie to make you think triple element team works
i don't ult with DK, every valk that needs ult is actually pretty bad
yeah like are you stuck in 2020 or something
what the fuck do you mean depend on her burst
i'm now <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153> to figure what the fuck they're cooking
yeah i'm fucking going insane
the bet is that she'll scale with new gen valk
like if all you care about is 6.6 then she is a skip
yeah prometheus is an investment
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
how is that my joke
eli: <:HmmNote:842411229128687677>
idk if it's that much, i know that her hitcount shieldbreak is based on shield stacks
yeah depending on how they design new HoS, could be way better than HoS
<:crying:757445037402619974>
okay sorry aster
HN deez nuts LMFAOOOOOOOOOO
yeah i'm pretty sure it wouldn't go well
going to the gym for if day, so it can keep doing the heavy lifting it is doing on those sentences
yeah the top score is hare, trio support, maybe TP if they give her a dk that makes her damage come from summoned entity
i'm still stunlocked by people who think like that
<:CHAD:999060564363984986>
maybe you wouldn't
cause you still get the buff from SI cross
it doesn't really change anything
if damage already didn't came from summoned entity
tbh tho
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i don't think the damage counts as damage from summoned entity
it was a strat in ER to use mobius with her
pretty sure yeah
you see, WC is also going to be top score if she can deal a lot more damage for no reason
i can also do that
i mean true
and mihoyo isn't known for stealth change -> less shill
if anything that would cause less shill
thats unnecessary tho
and i guess he was right
and mihoyo wouldn't like that
since sns dps would be top score
i remember keeby saying that dxy would disappear from sched
it last showed up at beginning of sns patch
a year and a half at this point
a streamer i watch got stunlocked for like 2 hours into the bat vs knife debate -> gun vs knife
not the gun knife
oh god gun knife
like maybe condom kid safe to prevent more of them
i think we should be kid safe in maincord too
i mean given these takes
HB dps
apparently not
and maincord using being surprised at shield cause NS will now survive a husk slap
like we meta player discussing how prometheus having shield means HoS is going soon because of the interaction
unironic horseshoe theory
like yeah this is where the death threats go thank you
pointing you to off-topic
the fucking
LMFAO
would you call honkai a better gacha than genshin
in what fucking world
cutoff the last 4 words and it's fine
overcooked
yeah i was so sure it was like if genshin can kill something it's you, kill yourself
god i glanced at this message and i got so hype
yeah keep it that way
you should count your blessings
if you don't know what gamergate is
i could've guessed that one
of fucking course they're fucking game gaters
my defining trait is that i'm annoying and my life goal is to make that everyone else's problem
so true bestie
maincord user try so hard to argue about their taste as objective fact
i'm stunlocked by the they should let us make story changing decisions in genshin argument
aren't they
like a lot of these people really are just 12 and this is the first game they ever played
i can read it now
because of my very cool plugin
i can't read your messages now
i know how it's a bad thing but it's fine as long as it makes it easier for me to disregard opinions
is this the first game you ever played
like what the fuck even is genshin story doesn't let you make choices as an argument
to have an age beside their name
they should force all discord user
okay how old are these people
yeah she scales so well with it
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
rentry my balls LMFAOOOOOO
compile it on a rentry
<:life:1001518241610485781>
maybe moriso was really right on shitting on trl publicly
suddenly, moriso is the hero of the story
trl hate group forming
like my 5 min day balanced by 12 hour husk bald
at my peak i like spent only 5 min daily too on non-MA days
i mean honestly tho you can, honkai daily so much more straight forward than genshin
i guess i'm just eridan now
the rule will be death threats are allowed but only if it's a really funny one
if i ever make a big game discord server
so do they just like get pinged every message you send
LMFAO sorry ruby
who the fuck is sus
get ready to pull now
hare and prometheus are both dps, and hare is the stronger one
tet you got your answer
and like yeah powercreep isn't a bad thing, it's important to keep a game alive to some degree
and most new comps don't perform that much higher than some 1.0 comps
and content isn't getting measurably harder
as people have more time to invest in characters
game just unironically is only becoming easier with time
like bennett xiangling
for genshin i mean
where every new valk is worse than 1.0 valk
undercreep is a phenomena exclusive for genshin
so like, powercreep is when things become more and more powerful with time
creep is power scaling
i wouldn't word it like that though
it's like, what mihoyo main objective is, it's a gacha after all
and they do try their hardest to make you wanna spend
mihoyo game, the more casual you are the more you get out of it
i mean to a degree i do agree with both there
i mean i guess you're fucking right but
they make a valk better value to make you think she's better value
can't send images
i'm being rate limited
i'm going insane
like my small brain cannot comprehend
what even
for calling hare nyx
is why do they have a boner
who the fuck is nino
god
oh yeah the stack things
wait kosma had signets?
people keep saying s-rank valk is 60 pulls on avg but i've been put 400 pulls into dorm and no AE yet, i think the math is wrong guys
just unironically hekipilled
what even
fucking heki alt man
yeah but still
HN is 15m
but that's new gen valk
maybe a lil higher
i think 15.5m on rot for s0 sounds about right tho
o7
fucking insane
i'm going
tencent: yeah so this is the average
trl: yeah no it would be way higher
tencent: what do you mean it would be higher, that's the average
trl: yeah you should do worst case scenario
tencent: why would i do that, average is more useful
trl: if you're so good at stats, why don't you calc it yourself
<a:AAAAAAARRRRRGGGHHH:513660293071634432>
i'm going to fucking
don't understand shit
they fucking
when maincord start talking probability
i unironically fucking scream at my screen
okay that's my fucking trigger
that's so cool bestie
hare literally has a gimmick too
unhinged
if you finish at 54, you can pull 6 more times, refund 5 and you got 6 pulls of spending for 1 pull
for spending even like
you can pull 4 more times and get 5 cards <:Stonks:668331960430493696>
like, if you finish pulling at 56, at 4/4
you can finish off the 10 pull for free
on x5+ pulls
if you end up your pull session on 10+5 banner
oh yeah i'll share a trick right now
i don't understand
do they log in, press button for 15 mins and leave?
oh is prometheus replacing HoS now
every 5 mins someone new shows up asking
like just hang around
no maincord is saying that
i honestly don't understand
i think i spent 10k for turg B on the rerun
yeah 10k for support valk is nuts
so you spend 36
free 10 means you spend 66, 10+5 you get 30 back
120 banner avg is 76
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
if you don't have it yet it's all your fault
mihoyo fucking gave turg away 13 different  ways
though you can't say that elemental don't have better cheap option
it's like pretty good still
i'm willing to bet you can promote most phys weather with shui in RL
like for shit player like that? a3 enjoyers? it's gamechanging
shui is still fucking insane
phys has shui
god fuck that's right
yeah g4 takes too long
oh yeah i haven't geared MPE yet
then go
same people who have a hard on for craftable gear
owo math 36 * 280
66 in a 10+5 banner, you get 30 pulls back, 36 pull for 4/4 on average?
how much would she even cost on avg?
like everyone came to protect fragile but trl was also a target <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
trl was a moriso target
everyone should know trl
actually
i know i said i would stop reading
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
skip
dead valk
compare with SI, morbillion phys dmg, morbillion bleed damage, morbillion phys taken
you should test if impair matters for bleed by bleeding yourself
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
okay i'm not reading maincord anymore
to bad takes
you might be addicted
tet
the only person in NA pulling for SN in 2021
making sure she would get a new battlesuit
eli solo carrying seele profits
they do it by themselves
damn we don't even need to make it up
p sure they didn't even try in nirv
after the bracket changes
they were RL promoter -> sleep in nirvana
even before retiring
that's true too though, i though ruby was talking about someone else about that
and she's quicksand
sus is already sushang for 90% of people
unhinged abbreviations
sus and vh are fucking
6 months later still doomposting the same valk even after she performed as well as people were expecting
i mean i guess i respect it
really dying on that hill huh
the unironic i don't know how MA works, shit dead gamemode -> v2v awful investment cause she not good at MA
i remember fighting trl cause they were the v2v doomposter
oh trl....
:huexcite:
eli guidemaker
yeah it's kinda s-tier
but purple
kinda like ice cream
i'll wait until someone says yes or convinces me otherwise
i've already eaten out so much this week
should i buy acai <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
haven't played bella tho
tona ain't that bad
bella tona heim?
what week is it
ai generated patch notes
<a:WHAT:1068133759158849567>
6.8 they'll bring back blockade and go haha it was a prank guys
isn't chip space already a joke?
paste hn face on each of the trio
can you just
notice how she was asleep by 10pm
nini is the other one
but it's funnier that way
that was a typo
hepha abyss just literally 0 knowledge, i bash me head on the keyboard
i have no clue about the hepha question tho
yay emotional manipulation
<:crying:757445037402619974>
i didn't mean it
okay sorry lumi
balf
aren't we all
heki is more invested in honkai than target audience
i mean as far as mihoyo cares i would say yes
they won't predict what will make you want to play, nevermind cater to you
your goals and priorities are fucking ai generated
there's no way mihoyo is ever baiting you on purpose
heki
soon they're fixing MA, adding third 2s boss back
<:life:1001518241610485781>
more like back when we were more in denial
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i remember staying up overnight to pull on IO 5.2
the 6.5 has been in out hearts this whole time
guaranteed hit with local tet
unironically though, you of all people would simp asa so hard
she's very pathetic and also relatable and i won't think about what this says about me
yeah i love her so much
god i love it
like look at it, it looks awesome
it's so sick
using the devil's power not only to create conflict, but also make the framing and the panelling that much more interesting
it's sooo cool, i genuinely irl pogged when i realised
the framing on the panels where yoru and asa were under different gravity
so many small cool things
god the new chainsaw man ch was such a banger
shudan <:pogg:1035066559351226388>
she's releasing next patch though?
<a:VIBE:1018400029460926514>
if not, get fucked lmfaoooo
just gotta re enable everything
everything should still be installed
the white text scared me
yeah happened with me earlier on the week
is woody the person doing the cooking?
what
if heki's using bastet
you really should use cez B
damn
more news at 8
farming sp valks takes too long - reports player who refuses to spend more than 200 asterite per week on sp valks
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
you need the extra freeze
hb obviously
the best team for SN kinda similar to that, you put HoS in, swap DK for SI and swap SN for HN
what boss is it
haven't read the new chapter yet, and i have to reread the one before cause i feel like i didn't give it enough attention
i'm hype
yeah i feel like akane got good pacing too, they could've fucked around for a few chapter before the renseikai but they just are getting into it
yeah good pacing
i really enjoyed the past 2
yeah sick chapter
this is the chapter i start bawling
i see
<a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
oh shit
hmmm that's misogynist
oh that's a point below tet
<a:peepoClappers:782497403038597120>
VQ is so ugly
cause HN is better than VQ
maybe i did a bad job at it
<:lfgCatgirlEdition:803114454187114506>
someone else using my shit abbreviations
but somehow....
that is pretty abusive
profit is the furthest thing i think of though <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
like i get wanting the game you like to have a bigger playerbase
i am mad because my gacha company isn't profiting through unethical means as much as that other gacha company
gacha gamer such a stockholm crowd
has to be fire/lightning for ice valk
if you have deal ice damage on ice valk, it just gets added to the damage, not extra hit
just remember that it has to be different type of damage as your valk
yea i wouldn't know, if it works it works tho
o i see
and not much else afaik
works on 2s couatl
i don't think any recent work
it only works in some tho
but i'm also not surprised
i don't believe they actually have decapitation on fall valks
man that one was nuts
sure
imo the best ones are the races with high skill ceiling, like pipe or the gravity ones
races? high skill ceiling?
are they like
yea how are the new ones?
that sucked
thank god
oh that does though
that doesn't help
o yea that one sucked
that one looks bad
lmfao
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
<:SakuraWTF:992643627610292237>
it's fucking impossible to match
but after i got to 20k i understood
and i thought that was fucked up, basically forcing a +1 position on avg cause of bringing no competition
they always ran with an alt
i remember matching with them a bunch
like t1 NA
or you just bring friends and boost it
so you were stuck waiting for minutes, maybe even hours, until one of the other 20 players with similar score log in
you just couldn't match with anyone lower than that
like by the time you hit 20k or so
last time, there was some heeeeeavy matchmaking limitations
like if it was an actual competitive gamemode then sure that's a bad idea
well, not letting play, but letting them be matched with each other
just like, easing up on letting high ranked people play with normal players
yea idk about the 1v1s, i don't think that's necessary
hmmm
i'll come back if they fixed match making
<:Wokege:996346539364601876>
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
before starting
i know of a person who bought 80 keys
don't overbuy keys
just uh
i don't do it that way, so i don't have the experience
i think all rounds share but idk
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
awful
and the spread just looked
i know i was reading on one that was set on left to right
oh, hmm
like shit?
when there's double page spread
what does it look like
yea that's weird
does make it cheaper
i don't do that cause it sounds annoying but it's prob optimal, reset on round 1-3 for foca card then reset on round 4 for skin
some people also say to reset on the previous rounds to get good top prizes too
and resetting until you get the skin on top prize
you pull on homu skin treasury by going until round 4
bye epi
and it just feels like i'm not reading it the way i'm supposed to
yeah idk i try to read it on pc
i'd prob get into a ton of them, including tower of god
if i could read webtoon on phone easily
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
<a:tatsumakiPoke:697749408254525520>
have you started reading chainsaw man yet
let's fucking go
that's the dream for me, i had one i downloaded beastars and read it in commutes, it was sick
to read when offline?
can i download manga on that
i downloaded some sus one but i wasn't able to make it work
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
fuck no
mangadex doesn't have a phone app tho <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
yeah that's fair
oof nevermind i can't read the inbetween chapters from the app for some reason
maybe i'll read it weekly for the funsies
like weekly rerelease
oh wasn't it coming out on manga plus
where do you read it
it like legitimately made me care a lot about something i would've never otherwise
this is sick too though, i feel that way about akane right now
it's like cocaine to me
kinda shit you watch the entire series and you only notice a few changes on their characters as the episodes pass, but when you compare ep1 with last ep it's a whole different person
and character development is like the one thing i love about media, always
i like csm so much because it does character development so fucking well it makes me insane about it
more like they do something i like so well that i'm thoroughly impressed
like my favorite manga is not that they do something great and it was something i didn't know i wanted
i see, that's cool
i read baby steps and that was pretty good tho
though i guess i didn't read that many, idk if blue box counts, prob not
the sports manga i've read sound like they put way more heart into it than most isekai i see
just like wouldn't it be cool if cool character in cool place and it prints money
isekai is just carried from interesting premise and then they just put no work into it
if something sounds kinda sick, i just skip it
yeah, nowadays i look at manga premise and just work backwards from it
the only thing i refuse to consume is isekai
that makes sense, i think i've long taken the genre blackpill that i think if you forced me to i wouldn't be able to make distinctions
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
that was a joke tho, i think our tastes are similar in a lot of ways and you've read more than me so if anything i'm more interested in whatever is above csm, cause i'd prob enjoy it too, rather than mad that csm isn't in your top 3
but haven't gotten to it yet
cause the art is very pretty and i heard good things
a while ago
i bought the first 2 volumes
oh i've been meaning to start oyasumi punpun out
no chainsaw man = insta block
what's the top 3
o wow
i heard good things tho
i haven't read that
new weekly manga
oh i'm down
LMFAO holy fuck
not even for funsies
don't HoT combo
actually it does kinda matter
it is a really tight strat tho
have you tried not being -2
maybe the knowledge would've helped
<:SirinPat:992644906914947092>
+ friend support 3s HoT or LE
you need 2s+ HoT lead
cancel stuff as early as possible with switches
the rest doesn't matter
actions are
swap KMB -> weapon active -> dodge -> swap AE -> fast ult -> weapon active -> HoT stuff
ask someone else when you get 917
no
yes you do after you ult
fine i won't share knowledge
if you time fracture and time slow them, the 7 year long death animation becomes 70 year long death animation
yea i corrected myself
so some bosses, like bella and jizo, who have 7 year long death animation
and if an enemy is time slowed, their death animation gets slowed too
in sim battle, death animation matters
because it's sim battle
eop turg ppm KMB, s0 is fine
mkp margrave AE
HoT need at least 2s LE + 3s HoT/LE friend support
mkp
o
sns gloves
it's kmp AE
i love how the timer until jizo spawns is on the screen still after he dies
it looks so cool
the 917 jizo with HoT
i think it's my favorite strat
lee nya?
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
i kept mine for collection stig
do people get rid of theirs
i think some
idk
g1 is so fast tho
<a:SirinRave:992644972836827187>

check pin-nya
kill my reason to play and then release new game on my birthday to go you like that bitch
yeah they're fucking with me
dawei knows me personally and they chose the date for me
it's for me! they did it for me!
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
skill issue is called
sona?
ER gives me fucking war flashbacks
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
hearing that tho
yeah i thought i was going to play gsr
is serval gsr xiangling?
only got to 7 now
genshin had 5 on release, right
that's a lot
7 valk on permanent?
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> gsr as my birthday present
that's my birthday
isn't it in april or smth
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
meta gsr talk
whats going on
but idk if that's true, this midset look like it add some very impactful stuff
like making some small adjustment could be just not big enough to make big change to the meta
is it like consistent? have all midset been bad? my view would be something like if they've done it multiple ways and none worked out well, then maybe it's just very hard to do it well
hmmm yeah that makes sense i think
i just think it's kinda weird cause i didn't understand if they're making sets shorter to compensate for no midset, or if there's just going to be less tft big update
not sure <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
as a non tft player, midset is interesting, i think it might be one of the things that is better for casual than competitive player tho
i mean yea i think i agree <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
i'm doing that to arcanine next
so i went oh i can just play her then and then i did and i love her
i'm on a villain arc, i hated fluttermane with all my being cause she was very hard to play against
meowscarada, fluttermane and i think the next is going to be arcanine
so i'm naming them over my favorite pokemon in vgc
on of my classes we need to use 3 or 4 vm i think
i named one of my vm after it
i love her
i used it
shit mons, no counterplay
cringe
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
so like 1 year and a half for c6
rip
that's nuts
and see if i have one
can anyone log in to my acc
L
the honkai was the friends we made along the way
and you might find it
look deep inside your heart
i spent like 10 minutes running calcs figuring out why energy ball did no damage to indeedee and then i figured out it's because bug and grass are two different things
or some shit like that
look up mail tracking code [your country]
chien pao is the one i wanted to build a team around
i was thinking of the other one
oh wait
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
i'm bad
ice looks bad tho idk how to play around it
i wanna build a team around it
wo chien looks cool
i hear they're stopping with midsets after this one
i think i somehow fucked up very hard into playing the best play
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
my head hurts from doing pokemon calcs, how do people play this
wow these suck
i think it's funny that i start reading pokemon available moveset from the usually useless section and then i go
what's my wincon
how do i build a team around <:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
hmm are you sure
teach me what they do
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
so they were just made legal on series 3
because i only care about competitive?
i didn't need to know about the legendaries, like wo chien, chien pao
<@416445660443967491> hey remember when i said
poor susan
damn
and set up automated system to release page so it keeps going even after they're dead
is it like a one shot manga that's like 100 pages long that they drew out to it's entirety already
actually i wonder how that works
kinda cheating tho
i'm sure some manhwa are like that
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
halfway there now <a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
and i need two of them
13k kills for a 1/5k drop
holy shit i got the drop i was going for finally
update?
heki i don't think you should be allowed to play gachas
yeah that's true
omg kalpas is transitioning? i'm so happy for him
it's waaaay more situational than what boss had
even as a last boss stand it's not that powerful imo
i love rohan too, i can't be mad about that
to me i kinda went w/e ever since au diego showed up with actual unironical the world
and then i look to the community and it's like the place is on fire LMFAO
i went like haha cool
i just thought it was funny
how everyone care so much about that
yeah i found it so weird
yeah
favorite thing in whole of jojo is the reverse powercreep from part 8 onward
part 9 stands looking fucking sick though, i love it
unironically hit the midpoint before i was born
<a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
and part 5 released in 1995
and then i thought about it
not like part 5 that happened in 2001
and then i went damn that's crazy, a part where it actually happens in today time instead of in the past
was when on jojo part 9 they mention covid
i think to me the one that opened my eye about how long something was going on
how do you even have time to plan ahead while doing a whole chapter every week
that's fucking insane
i mean to be fair you can only place so much blame when like most of these manga is weekly
nqn is fucking years late lmfao
i respect it honestly
maybe no ending is better than even an intended ending <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
anime and manga has some like deep problem of not knowing how to end stories
honestly it might be for the better
first thing i do is see how long it is LMFAO
that's fucking unhinged
really?
did you think it was like really short
though uh
i mean but that'd be stupid, you already started ichinose
i was just asking cause i was going to recommend another ongoing but i didn't remember if you like that or not
what chill
.... yes
i don't have my helm with me
were you the one who didn't want to start anything ongoing, tet?
ichinose and akane
i'm saving the 2 most interesting manga chapter for bus ride later today
not yet
c6r5 crescent pike
my xiangling is the real meta xiangling
for honkai
instead of trio
that quote should be turg
i would jump in place to hear the bell jingle
i really like her design
the other valk i did it with was xianling in genshin
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but not actual hinder gameplay
cause she's pretty
spend 10-20 mins just staring at HoF on valk select
the closest to that i've had is like
do people actually have issue like that
okay this is slash srs babe
if you complete it
how the rewards will be
and it'll say
like open a run
i'm pretty sure the game tells you what you get as a reward from a run
no you have to do ultra hard special hard cock runs
lmfao imagine
ichinose and akane chapter sound like banger tho <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
i haven't read anything from today yet
in 65?
what's in bp
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
that's worth the 100s of dollars
in 3 patches, you'll almost have a single entire pull
those 20 xtal add up, eli
<:PEPELA:790714721283735564>
hmm so this is for the 2 discount supply right
i was like
sorry, flamescion
oh
nor for v2v tbh
i have no clue for hrt how much dupe for affix matter
it's either reso or dupe for affix
i guess i don't really know s0 attack lmfao
1450 s0?
i don't wanna ping cause it sounds annoying
i posted about celeste game night on <#963613297943412756>
i actually added cause i thought it was funny
lmfao
ye i'd prob have gone for elf instead
save up for a few patches, plan ahead, spend money, get lucky, still can't afford
getting lucky still not affording everything
<a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
yeah i think you got lucky
mobile discord is a mistake
they're trying to keep me away from better discord
i did
i think the sp line on HoH is not a thing anymore
anything but the 7 star elf
not the 7 star elf
and the display is rounded, so depending on actual true amount, you could be +-1
cause like, you're calcing based on how it's displayed, right?
oh that might be rounding stuff
it differs from valk to valk
that sounds around right for 3s valk
only round to display
i'm pretty sure they don't round, all atk source is counted up even with decimal
can i get one too?
are those cheaper?
chill
can't even afford myself one
hopefully quite far i think
that's a good question
you asked earlier what max atk was, if you have all dk you can just calculate how far you are from best affix
sheeeesh
furry amongus with a lil rabbit tail
if your teacher told you he was van gogh then that was not the only thing he lied about
doesn't mean everyone follows it
pemdas is a convention yeah
owo math (6 * 3) + 2
might take a while to answer tho i'm suffering
sure you don't need to ask
cool
oh that's interesting
it's weird
but i really really enjoy it when i do
i ask cause like i very rarely do it
yeah same
not putting some on while doing something else, like just put on music and <:peepoSit:1016193458307862609>
like, main activity
do y'all ever listen to music?
<:PeepoSitBASED:986284656586551366>
needed to as in like usual battle manga stuff, that someone in upper management asked to
he like did the things he needed to up to start of katana man arc, and then he started doing what he wanted
to some degree i think tatsuki did a similar thing
LMFAO honestly that's kinda based
there's a bunch of manga that bait people in with a cool premise but then thoroughly shit the bed when trying to do anything interesting
the best manga i've read is about stuff that sounds kinda lame but it just has so much heart put into it that you get into it too
it's all about how it's told
i don't think you should care about the plot points of the story
it's hard to talk about it without spoiling stuff
does... it?
he'd do anything for a normal, good life, having bread at the end of the day to eat, that kinda stuff
<a:CSMBongoPochita:756752095654182962>
denjis a mercenary devil hunter trying to pay off his dad's debt, living a very rough life with his only companion, pochita
it's something like
i could tell you some of the earlier events, but that would be a worst experience than reading it
i could tell you the main themes, but that's kinda spoiling it to a degree
idk what kinda answer do you want?
nevermind
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
then read it
unless you've read csm
don't call her a bitch
it was as sick chapter though, holy
tatsuki is doing this on purpose right
this is barely a spoiler, just really funny
<@180679257851166721> did you read the new csm chapter? LMFAO
heki your playstyle is so interesting
actually tho as much as i love hua, FR beats any hua in terms of complexity, probably
HotF time
the one who has good opinions
that's what you gotta ask me
who's cooler though
that's what you gotta ask yourself
who's cooler though
the entire US government when it's election season:
on the more feminine side because of they/she and the name, probably
i feel like you don't talk about it much if at all tho, so for me is like blank slate
this is not in a like oh if they make it all about gender thing, it's fine if you make your gender part of your personality, i very much do
unless if they make gender a part of their personality, it really doesn't connect on my mind at all
i don't really think of gender on people by default
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
if you wouldn't like being called maricon doesn't that mean lumi did the right thing not pinging you
yes thank you now lets get you to sleep
LMFAO
the qte of the other valk will come out faster
so like, if you spam both attack + qte of another valk after pv qte
so you can do stuff like swap out faster
idk, the time where she's like oof i'm so tired after an attack <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it cancels out her like
if you spam attack after qte
if you want to learn PV tech
like after HoT qte on p2, you can weapon active a good amount faster
there's a few inputs that you're doing later than you could, optimally
besides that, just press buttons faster
should do same damage but the animations flow better into each other, so it's faster
you do a4 -> combo -> ult -> active -> finisher -> active -> combo
instead of a4 -> combo -> active -> ult
and second, on p1 you can do a different rot
that will prob be your biggest score increase
to clear it faster
and then you can ult earlier with pv
where sp pack drops on transition is set in stone, so you want to try to be there by the transition so you can grab it faster
improvements here will be small stuff
had a stroke when i saw the HoT stigs
god i really did just forget that hikaru joined arakawa school overnight for some reason, that makes sense tho LMFAO
that gets me really hype
<a:OH_peepoBlushExcited:953072357830955028>
you don't have to say it....
<:crying:757445037402619974>
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
we don't actually promote that kind of ideology in here, heki
rank scammer
with great abbreviations like mobius/IO -> hasekura
iriya leads the force on those
oooo i didn't catch that, i'm hype! i loved karaku arc so much, maybe it's a little boring to just do it again, but i would really not mind, i really liked it
and yeah, i guess i won't complain about it much either, to me tho is more like not that i can't imagine a reason why he would be that way, just that i think that every reason i can think of is not better than the character he was before, which i really enjoyed. but i mean, surprise me author, you've done it before
and like, for valk that people care, that's like 2 LMFAO
so only a-rank and s-rank without break up ranking can be augmented to begin with
the augment button is in the same place as breakup ranking and sp skill
cause here's the thing, unless they rework the UI
how many valk can we even give augment
they could make more money by having them need to use new shiny resource
whale have torus stacked up
stig pri wouldn't use same resources as weapon pri imo
divine key has a similar problem tho, like you're going to run out of s-rank to give dk
they either
1. do a lot more divine keys
2. release more double valk patch
3. ????
cause they're running out of old weapon to upgrade, and now that they release even support with pri, they won't have those to upgrade in the future
though i only say this cause i wonder what they're going to do to keep releasing 1.4 pri per patch
FS pri necessary for rimestar, bri pri pri for FT strat, positron for a bunch of stuff with KMB
but like 99% of the old ones were needed in their own time too
usually i'd go for the excuse but it's been getting more shill cause all are needed
from 3.4 -> 6.5, 47 pri, 32 patch, ~1.46 pri per patch
from 3.4 -> 5.0, 25 pri, 17 patch, ~1.47 pri per patch
like 1.2
no, it was hler IO
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
well 5.2 kinda, it was hler
5.1 and 5.2 too
4.8 and 4.9 both had double
about the same as it ever was
actually i think it's like
it's actually been getting less common i think
it's pretty common actually
and then 5.8
6.1
do you think mihoyo will figure out a way to do consistent double pri patch in the future?
that's good to know
okay so do y'all think
that's 2 pris
yeah don't get complacent
those are akane banashi spoilers, for yesterdays ch
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
oh is it hinted to that? i guess i can see it, i really like hikaru, her personality quirk is endearing to me, so i'm hype to see more of her
i also noticed the thing you said with akane only recently having the skill to even understand the gap between them, and she kinda backtracks on knowing for sure she will beat kaisei. that's like, pretty realistic and i don't think i've ever read any manga that went through stuff like that, like the lower point of learning and learning how much you don't know yet
i still am not sold on the heel turn kaisei did though, still feels unnecessary and hurts more than helps his character. maybe the author only did it so they have an explanation to his different style of acting? but like, i didn't think we needed deep lore reason why professional rakugo are able to do more than one style of rakugo
they added a skill to HN to clarify that yes it does
yes
<:crying:757445037402619974>
i like the red one
i'm so sad that i'm not a discord reddit mod combo
yeah oh noooo
you'd get warned every time you spoke about ma unless it was about how much you love ma
cringe
what! i added it to allowed
i love ma
now can you say
can you say ma for me
can you say ma
hey baban
this kind of stuff i don't find that fun, i was surprised people enjoyed figuring out what HN means <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i can if you want me to, i don't mind either way
thank you i love you all too
i'll just assume i got pinged cause people love me

its a really really good puzzle game
i also have it on itch.io if you want

stuff like baba is you
if that makes sense
instead of random generated stuff
dev designed levels
my type of puzzle game is more like
hmmmm
is it an actual puzzle game
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
figuring out how to have fun
yeah the greatest puzzle
that's a really good copypasta <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it's efficient, that's more than half of what avg person reads
i'm bored of the ones i have

then that's also true <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
if by great for the game you mean great for mihoyo's pockets
that ones kinda true
kiana haters wonders why they aren't enjoying the praise kiana game
true
honestly
also bad take
no but they hate kiana
so i can stroke my own ego
ideally for every opinion different from my own

if you say i hate hua it gets replaced by i am stupid
we should have like

town of salem prophanity filters
we should have like
cool, phrases work
<@197871478950068224>
can anyone say i hate kiana
why would put marisa over moriso
it's your fault
oh that's kinda cool
was the same shit when i played league
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
but it does sounds like riot alright
that's stupid
why would they do that <:Clueless:996308692133761094>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
those are shit povs
that's smart though

are you like aiming for a rank before midset?
oh god
it looked cool
is the midset out?
you're living in their head
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
i tried moriso before
lmfao
i don't remember if takopii was similar, i did read it after it was finished
jesus ichinose is just a string of cliffhangers huh
there's like 6 different things i'm reading that come out on sunday
sunday is manga day for me
i'll go read
<:peepoSit:1016193458307862609>
people will go all the zoomers i know that joined because they love auto playing actually like auto playing!' <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and then the ones left are the ones that are either okay with it or enjoy it
will just keep quitting
the people who don't like the game autoplaying
the issue is that like
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
god gigachad fragile
maybe we should've had the foresight to know that if an s0 MPE is similar to avg s0, then she'd prob be a great investment at 3s <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
now that normal player have that, she's kinda broken
giving 3s power level valk for free though is nuts
at s0 she isn't that strong, p much avg s0 dps, and i think any single s0 dps is around nirv only valk
to be fair, at the time she really was
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
yes
must get boring after a while
literally every phys dps gets the same answer
let him have fun though

<:okk:1058108494995263539>
i find it cute
what really LMFAO

feel free
i guess?
i have celeste there and you can download it officially
you can dm me and i can send you my itch.io login info
oh actually if you wanna do it like soon
a new map collab just came out but i need to fix my inputs for it
it's great
actually i think there was just an alt strat for like -1 or something on a week where PV was somewhere else with HoT
LE is used in 9s DPe i think, at wolf
for a sec she was used in 9s HoD before SI
i wonder if we're ever finding another use for KMB
<:sip:617444162098298892>
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
in the good gamemode, yes
for damage
MPE lead is optimal
i think even outside of like, not wanting to bald
you're talking mpe lead vs someone else?
oh sheeesh we have a taco bell
they look annoying though
i've never actually had tacos
idk if that's as much of a thing in brazil like it is in other countries
lemme see if i can find some
so p much anything
i'm ordering
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
what should i get for lunch
that won't ever happen
i don't doubt it
elemental team i already can't understand, trio looks like mush to me and i don't know how hrt works
until i thoroughly can't understand what the fuck is going on
i wonder for how much longer will i be able to give advice
still worse, just easier
then it's easier to not aim
if you do 2 b2b, the timing of input is really weird
like on HoH
actually i guess not always
it's a few frames faster than not aiming
on bow valk
is to always aim
oh yeah another tech
that would make sense, idk if ricochet counts as ca
but it's def not 100% crit rate at tank
and you run si lead
cause my experience is from MA
actually maybe the mpe lead makes up the diff
pretty sure she doesn't
deceptively so
she's still sorta crit baldy even at 3s
you don't actually get her to 100% crit rate
also i'm pretty sure
good luck
if you hit hundreds of times
cause like if you hit 4-5 times, you can bald that to all crit even if crit rate is low
crit rate is like better and better the more hits a valk does
crit rate is pretty big for MPE
2s2 is the big one
oh wait 2s1?
unlucky
literally like one of the only 2 boss where it matters
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
shield damage
oh wait isn't it like
is it that big
sns does most of the work for you
is that your dps will have to actually clear the shield
i mean the biggest diff
yeah
griseo just broken
nevermind 2s with unleveled gloves
then griseo is better than even max 3s sns
if you have cez tb paga m
but like
i mean you can try
if no shield, no qte/shortest qte + cuck charged + ult
if shield, qte for complete duration + charged lv3 + ult
unless shield
no qte
it's literally charged attack -> ult
sns is so chill, people make too much of a deal about it
i'd still try it
that carole looked so sad
can you really not use griseo
recording is better tho cause i can go back and watch it
sure either stream or record a good run
how close are you to killing mobs on ult?
idk i need to look at it
yeah i don't think MPE will outdo your PE in this boss, even if you got max pri
is it close?
with pe ult
can you one shot mobs?
prob just run PE
you don't get tesla buffs
so like during half of your rot
she stays on field during her ult
tesla is kinda shit
run glut on sns instead
yeah i'm so sorry
oh
no griseo?
what are you running
but i mean maybe if you can clean up mobs easier
to me that looks kinda hard
hmmm
i'd be surprised if you broke 650
how high are you even aiming tet
sounds like skill issue
just time sink
mmo isn't really mald
i mean
i fucking despise the runescape community
honkai like i have a hate boner for the game but i love the community
i have the opposite problem with runescape than with honkai
can i get y'all playing runescape
try retiring
trust me it won't help
hope that helps
you want the phys one
oh you picked HoH
just from crits
but she easily has like +-20% damage variance
like not as bad as bke or actual crit bald valk
mpe is deceptively crit baldy
is just crit 4head
the most important tech of all
you don't want her to do an actual charged
you don't hold it for long though, it's right before ult
then it'll skip that
if you start holding charged before ult
like you see how after you ult it looks like she does a random normal attack before charged?
that makes her charged attack after ult come out faster
on MPE
for small improvement, you wanna hold attack slight before ult
for like ulting 4 times
feel like you overstated HoS sp problems though, it doesn't look that bad
it'd help with the lil bit of sp you're missing at the last rot
from sp/s
would generate sp
i guess at least standing around him
idk if like hitting him and shit would give sp
you should swap into HoS and try to farm sp
also immediately after you finish p1 of otto
it's not by a lot though, probably
since the damage you deal before HoS ult would be on impaired enemies
yeah but using your spear to actually hit them would be slightly better
would be swap weapon 3 times -> sword on nothing -> spear to gather -> dodge chain -> si qte + charged -> hos ult -> mpe stuff
i think a better opener
hmmm
otherwise it looks about fine, i think if you bald crit you can maybe 1 rot the mobs
or starting an extra one even though you won't have enough bars to finish it
cancelling out of the attack string for no reason
yeah you keep like
you should do 2 charged attack strings -> active -> 1 charged string -> active -> 1 charged string
your mpe rots are weird
CN implies going from 30% -> 50%
english implies type counter going from +30% -> +36%
i remember english and CN being worded differently
how does it even work anyways
oh they could nerf it to commit it into being a shit weather
they should buff type weather
that's PE graduation into BKE-like
isn't this like every phys boss tho
mihoyo advertises shield break support, is actually budget BKE
they should make a support that specialises in shields
rl?
that's
i bought the keqing skin and then didn't get ning's <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
does it get better if i say that i bought all of the welkin for keqing skin, bought the keqing skin and quit
i'm the quit genshin with 4 months of welkin gal
can't relate though
like, both in relation to time spent, but also to a degree just in general
the more casual you are, the more you get out of honkai
yeah
like moooost people if they're willing to play the game a bunch to not be casual, they're also willing to throw like monthly + bp at it
idk i think the f2ps are just mostly casual
like rushing until your acc is built and then getting demotivated once it's built
i do think there's something about that though
do it
retire
just call what the fuck it actually is though
this time was an actual bug fix, they just didn't care until we found a meta use for it
oops, bugfix!
where they just go oh optimisation!
mihoyo does it so often
it gets under my nerves SO fucking hard
gotta fix it guys
oops that's a game breaking bug right there
and then the second it gets a competitive use
that's cool
oh okay then so it's just another cool thing honkai has
to a point were we went
for 5 patches
they didn't fix it
and like
we figured out very early on cause her air charged got the sp from senpri
her air charged counted as both charged and combo
nah, it's a weird bug
5+ patches
bug had been in the game for like what
i'm still salty over that they fixed it
bugged
it makes sense now
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it's for fucking AE dps
oh wait you know what it is
and then like, if you qte in and BBB, mixed and farm sp, by the time you're ready to leave the BBB buffs are gone
and farm sp to ult in future rot, if you're not ulting in this rot
cause like you still want to do mixed for team sp/s
is that even a thing you ever want to do though
i mean it's true that it saves time if you wanna do BBB and leave
for similar quick buff but bigger
then you'd rather use some other valk like BD
like if you're going for small buff like BBB and swap out in MA
AE ain't a 2s MA valk
that's so cool little buddy, it's time for your nap now
when do you ever want to switch in -> black -> leave?
for HoS there's at least one use for it, i can't think of a single use for AE qte
why
all the kids are doing it
so you can get your fs (frame score)
it's basically no upside, it takes a fuckton of time for the benefit of <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> of damage and changing the weapon, which you can easily do yourself
HoS qte is like what if we made you wait 1 second to do something you could do in 0.1 instead yourself'
qte made the damage easier
waaaaay to crit baldy for me
cause doing the normal ref was
i used it on rimestar for -1 ref
and it was on a ref that was for cope
i think of all the time i played, i only used it once
HoS qte is so bad, it's kinda sad
between mobs and phase transitions
some boss just can't be killed that fast
i mean it can be neither
i'm kinda impressed that you can run out of sp while doing 3 combos per rot
what weapon are you using
the good ending
we should give the otto one to the gayest girl in here
no questions asked
and they get to place it on the tier list wherever they feel like
and then like each person gets a stig
we go like in a circle
stig tier list
we should make
and then i gave up
without a singe uprate
and i went 80 pulls
so i wanted another piece for 2set
i had T i think
it was my worst pull session i've ever done
i pulled for it
i was kinda hype over it
honestly though
i would've been the second if they offered it again
i went like that's a fucking deal!
when honkai offered me
to buy a set
a dollar
i spent like
i like that one
burgery?
sakamoto kinda slaps
early stigs were so fucking degen
girl bussy
it's a gussy actually
wdym
it's a normal pussy
but you look at old ref and it's irene
so you look at new ref and everyone is using it
CN figured it out kinda late
i think it was the kind of thing that like
that was like the beginning of using turg on everyone
i mean not unprompted, it is better
half and half irene and turg
leaderboards for 3s wolf were like
people started using turg on FR
like second half of 5.2
irene kinda slaps
me too i was kinda sad when FR joined the turg train
yeah it's hard to not like them
i just think they're cute
not in a sex way though
<:Toebeans:585731577963610122>
i like paws
and do some lore questions
get carv in
we could like
guess the stig
guess the feet
honkai minigame bot
we could make like
i'm down
like a lot of effort, for discord bot
i mean i was willing to put effort into it too
genuinely kinda fun to look for it LMFAO
it's like
and by the end even carv was helping out gather the stigs
like i remember when i brought it up and everyone was like <:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
honkai feet stig is the thing that surpasses kink
i just assumed there was nothing there since i didn't get any pings there
i mean i'll check announcements now that i know there's stuff there that is being sent but not pinged
bitches go @ everyone this honkai event is so cute!!!
i'm used to the other mods that @ everyone for any little thing
to answer your question, tet, i haven't been checking announcements, no
i didn't know of the art bot on discord and tracking stuff though
yeah fair
but when it's convo i'm not sure
i know that for very specific niche answer, some chat bot was caught stealing
for shit like discord where they're just speaking, there's not much you can steal i guess
but idk
like to a degree i can understand why you'd be upset
ehhh i mean tbh i don't really feel the outrage for chat bot as much as i feel for art bot
we'll corrupt him
yeah i'm kinda hype for the chat bot
oh what
art bot i'm not fine
nft shit i'm not fine
and i'm fine with that i think
i saw the text bot
they were going to do some nft shit too
i feel like they're going on a down spiral
god i'm so disappointed on discord
i didn't know that shit, that's scary LMFAO
i just said .gov cause it sounded funny
wait wtf
every day i get closer and closer to logging in for the last time on discord.gov
are you not?
don't
LMFAO
jesus
hmmm i'm interested now
oh there's a dog girl
i am but not about that part
i mean
they have a breeding kink
havent you been paying attention
i'm not
let me answer then
fair
who said i'm scared
tet and cherry are very harmless
bye guys
oh let's fucking go
bye guys
oh lets fucking go
L
i regret my decision
nvm
keep going
damn i thought y'all doing fanart up there, not fanfic
without y'all knowing it's me again
and like joined here
wouldn't it be funny if i made a new discord acc
we're nuking this server?
chromium
it's actually someone we all know
but they use the same impurity to get their coloring
they're like, different stones
did you know that the impurities that make ruby red are the same that make emerald green?
he's called super cutsecene actually
nikke griseo
yessss
eat the rock
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
yeah i made it up
cause you shake the milk
imagine naming a drink and going for milkshake
milkshake is such a funny word
nvm actually
the only milk i shake
3 more and you get a free milkshake
i like zajef
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
and swap HN into BKE
like swap dracula into ely T
you just have to make some other adjustment
purana actually works tho
subbing out stigs should be possible though, moriso did some vids on rl dist
not without weapon
jesus
easily top 7 of the early cast
seele is like
ah it's not about me, nvm
oh?
get luckier next time
keep going
i read exotic wrong
oh
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
ruby asked for bottom surgery, even if i'm not qualified for it i gotta do it
i'll do my best
<a:PU_PepeDiamondSword:902185892343582750>
not a herrscher
HoH only killed 6s, my faith in mihoyo and my will to play the game
even after the change in bracket that start you at a3, game just noticed they're built diff so straight to nirv they went
i hear lumi has been perma nirv ever since they got to exalted
yeah kinda scary
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
i'd do the same as cherry in that situation
thank you for the input
i don't actually have any clue how good flamescion is at MA
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
my ref source quit the game
i don't have any i'm just interested
MA?
i mean i get that but that's not what i asked <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
is that you still don't like it
the worst that can happen when trying to add some ingredients to balance it out
like if you don't like it to the point of throwing it away
try adding some ingredients
do you not like it
tet didn't even text
have you tasted it
LMFAO
spaghetti update incoming
guys wait
i used to do swimming classes at a gym
what really?
can you clock any gym bros among us?
whoa yeah you'd be able to tell
broban
that doesn't need therapy
there's no one in this server
unless you want to know about average for some reason
i mean it doesn't matter, you're still in bottom third for getting at least one
getting more than one would also affect the average
because those are just the chances of getting at least one
like average won't be 0.69 4*
that's not average though
sorry
69%
owo math 1 - (0.97^39)
97% i'm stupid
wait
94% chance to hit at least once
owo math 1 - (0.93^39)
it's 1-93%^39
if heki was here she'd say of course you're bottom or some shit
this year it's this day
last year you said it was another day yeah last year was last year
you could just lie about it
who's fact checking you though
i think you can legally change your birthday too
you should just change your birthday every year to the 1st place
for who's getting the best luck
where it has all the days of the year ranked
you know those lists
you could also just lie and say you were born in 6/6/6
how did you even get in here
wait 2006? you're actually unironically 12
i saw a tumblr post which was like no more of that ex-gifted child bullshit, you put me back and i'll slap those kids around
i bet you'd still be pretty good at middle school math
cherry hater here: sure
some of my favorite underutilised peepo
<a:peepoDJshake:756792135625343056><:peepoFeelsWorse:768159663522185276><:peepoWow:383283817898704897><:PeepoChef:823697977817169931><a:PeepoCaught:668542252909592607><a:PeepoTalk:867792445243654175><a:peepoTrip:755692813320060959>
i thought it was like peepo white house breakup
maybe some betterdiscord plugin to mass delete message
if you don't care about it you should look into it
there's prob some kind of way to nuke all messages
hmmm
it's that kinda thing where it's funny to threaten other about and you can get some people really scared over it but you realistically can't do much with it
ip addresses aren't that dangerous
i keep thinking of like dumb examples but i'd like that
actually i'm down
send me a pizza?
what the fuck you doing with it
i could trust you, know you for 8 years and i still wouldn't tell you my address
why would you ever even if you trust them
hey guys i live at
you got sent a gift???
for fun
unhinged
cherry it's so hard to keep telling stories when you're like this
like i imagine a robber going oh shit there's people here? nice music taste
i'd play songs very loudly so people would realise i'm home
LMFAO
and i just go eh it's fine
at 4am
door being banged
now i have a cat i hear like fucking tv being thrown in the ground
like before i had cats i'd be kinda scared of sounds and shit in the middle of the night
maybe it's like a cat thing
i'd sucker punch that toddler
like i swear if that happened to me
if you have children
eventually you'd get better about it right
like an awful kid
yeah same i just stood beside her crying waiting for her to wake up
she'll be happy to see you
wake her up
tet you should ask your mom
tet how old are you again
like her butt just looks so bad, literally bowling ball implant
i've always been a big mona butt hater
no it works, acab for dyslexics
cum
i'm officially cherry unassigned milf
please just do it
it's important
okay can you take it away now
can you assign me as milf
it's really important
cherry can you do me a favor
yeah, a cherry assigned milf girl
i'm a cam girl
my moms credit card has a card?
if you really thought i was wrong, then making me mad would be a good thing
i'm livid
i'm so mad, i'm fuming
tet says that but doesn't even give lumine the chance
it's the truth of the universe
i would love everyone more if they were evil
true and based
true
i'm disappointed
you like when woman doesn't speak
her for her? you pick her as mc and love her for what she is as mc? a bland character with no personalities and 5 voice lines in 120 hours of gameplay?
cause you're a fucking coward
she's not the villain in your story
there's a little of lumine everywhere
everything reflects light
unironically tho very early datamine of genshin had 2 mc named as kevin and kiana
who the fuck is kiana
lumine 2 is a thing, she's the one that cube us
wouldve been better if lumine was the one fighting the random hillichurls
are you going to say that the release pv
lumine pickers keep coping
i don't watch the cutscenes
exactly
like the playable one is so fucking stupid
picking her as the playable one is almost an offense
i'm not saying she's bad i'm just saying i rather see her evil than clueless
lumine makes a better villain
oh yikes
are you going to go i've been doing since girl was invented
me when character select
i love the (edited)
it's okay, the true meilopp was inside our hearts all along
damn the one upper
every game will have elysia
alice = genshin elysia
mar 7th = gsr elysia
elysia is the new kiana
i've been saying since 5.5
sheeesh i'm envy
<a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
<a:aworryDodgeFast:789972539551383563>
which is lame cause evading is fun
the more scuff you go the more you have to evade
MPE tank had a few, SW husk had a few
it's kinda sad in a way, i can't remember much strat i did that had a lot of evades
she does have some small anicancel on some parts of her kit which can make a pretty big difference actually
yeah her gameplay is pray for crit
never used her anywhere else
the evades in tank ref are pretty chill
<:PeepoSitBASED:986284656586551366>
wdym you're not supposed to dodge on IO
i think you throw me in abyss and i will optimise tf duration on my rots <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
looking through NA nirv lobby and seeing their ma scores <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
what a cool name
pilot my acc
like i'm pretty sure eli is just taking screenshot of like S MA with shit score and trying to bait me into asking what it is
i'm still not sure y'all are not gaslighting me with those pseudo MA screenshot
nah you talk about gaslighting
gotta put 5x the effort to go -7
but in MA it's still very much a thing <a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
even though you can get okay score at it
in abyss there's more obvious example like kosma, you play anything not v2v and you'll wish you were actually in hell
new boss design feels like mihoyo trying to put you through 7 layers of hell if you're using non-shill answer
3s boss is basically always shill + HoT as answer <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
3s boss have way less answers than 2s boss
i mean that's more common of 3s boss
like whole of MA feels like a streak of genius, there's so many small design decisions that add up to make such an interesting game mode
yeah, that's an awesome part! like even though the boss is the exact same it feels really different when you have different restriction put into you by the week
<:Cryge:1070904461486215239>
i'm the obsessive ex
i'm still around, talking way too much about honkai even though i've quit
just not the same goals as mihoyo LMFAO
like ideally i'd want competitive honkai to be the easiest to get into and having a ton of people on different niche having fun
even competitive community side i'm not a part of i care about deeply cause they still make up my friends
so many 2s MA player quit over it, and i guess mihoyo is fine with it cause they're still making money, but i like the community, it's my favorite part of the game by a long shot, so of course i'd be sad over that side diminishing and p much disappearing
i don't mind people enjoying 3s MA but i think it's kinda insane if you're a competitive player and you value the competitive community of all kind to think that they went through that in the best way possible
yeah in the end is just mihoyo deciding they don't need to care about thoughts of 2s MA player
the rebalancing didn't need to be completely remove the gamemode tho, a lot of old MA player would probably enjoy higher stat 2s boss and going back to 31.4k cap scores
we like shifted to a new gear around HoS release and powercreep got a lot worse, but now it's kinda stable on the powercreep i feel like
like with the level of powercreep we jumped a few years back, it was inevitable MA would need a rebalancing, yea
2s boosted stats and slightly higher score
3s could've just been that
even if another bracket is annoying, they could just buff hp pool without just redesigning every boss to the point where they're unrecognisable
i feel like they could've just done that again
i mean last time we got to this point, we got new bracket so we could have more space to deal more damage without it becoming 0s but easier
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like make all dorm exchange gear craftable and make g1 take 1/4th the time
some people have the 5k iq take that removing MA is actually good cause i hate interesting stigs having uses but like shouldn't you just be asking for mihoyo to make old weird stigs easier to get?
i love old MA tho, so it's always in my best interest to get more people hooked on it and enjoy it too, stuff like giving better reward so they feel like it's worth their time and easier accessible gear is awesome
schrodinger maincorder, both don't care about MA and deeply care when it's to doompost
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah not only it's a shit take, same player then goes shit valk doesn't even topscore MA
i joke about it but i don't actually think it's a good thing
like 10% of abyss and 20% of ER
i don't actually know how many xtals are in MA <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
MA you can not touch for the week and you lose like 40xtal and your KMB juice
abyss you still wanna 18k even if you sleep for the xtal
MA is better about it than abyss
even better, you can bash your head in the keyboard and still t100
rewards fucking suck ass so if you're not vibing with it you can just sleep, who cares LMFAO
that's another part of the magic of MA
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
so just the stat boost p important
she's the dps there
3s sns is required though
this is original strat
you can run like ely TB something M
i mean yea maybe, gotta try to tell if it's possible or not
look at this orange! don't you love it?
like replacing an old orange with a shiny new apple and going
when it's such a deeply different gamemode than old MA
it's just kinda disrespectful to put it in the game and call it MA
i just with they didn't get rid of 2s MA and stop balancing it
like i kinda hate it but it's fine for it to be in the game if people enjoy it
i would be fine if it was abyss2
i dunno, like i don't have any inherent problem with 3s
though i guess it matter less cause going -1 or -2 is so little score
cause generally 3s cap is harder than 2s
i mean currently tho that's a bad thing
i was like <:cope:1042278797807976578> its not that bad but it was that bad
i was never fine with 3s MA <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
like rimestar shit
week ends and only 5 people had the hands for it
like there's some strat that like even though any s0 player have gear to do it
before 3s MA released, a lot of bosses had 946 but even still a lot of them were pretty hard
0s are fun but they can become 1 dimensional
but yeah most MA player miss the time when it wasn't such 0s fiesta, too
most boss also don't have that many 0s answer for s0 player
that's not how it's always been though
i mean yeah current state of 2s MA isn't that good, all boss having 0s isn't healthy
and then switching to 3s dudu and immediately getting it
you should be able to have enough damage with 2s dudu but i remember rino balding that for a long time and not getting it
kinda
different week, doesn't matter
different server, doesn't matter
and you can copy it perfectly to this day
you look at a 2020 ref
not having disturbance is kinda part of the magic of MA
i'm so salty LMFAO
crazy how you can balance for new power level instead of get rid of the gamemode
and what they did then was release exalted with tankier boss
if we go even further in the past, we did get to the point where all bosses were 946
and new valk raise the score by a small amount on certain boss
valk generally was divided between those who are good in MA and those who are good in abyss
there was once upon a time where like 31.4k score in exalted was competitive
we'll just get rid of it!
instead of balancing the gamemode
mihoyo just went like
like a few patches before 3s MA
only recently MA became 946 fiesta
the gear is flexible²
wdym
the gear is flexible
the BB one looked cooler but i didn't have the hands for it
i just ran the PE one
cause it looked lame
i dunno much about it
the old strat is like SI HoS SNS
this is older strat, need s2 PE

the rest are some degree of annoying either in rank, execution or niche gear
like easy 946 left are like sk, dxy, aka
eh idk they're getting rid of a bunch of it
i guess it's old and older now
the old strat was fun though
i guess the new 893 doom is braindead
do you have gear for the 893 doom
do it before you can't
it has to be humanly completable
especially on really tight strat like that one
0s MA is so fun
so go for it
LMFAO that's not what i mean, i also think you could do it
it's annoying tho
so it's possible in my acc
i've done the 0s HoH SW KR maru before
you can try on my acc
then yeah i think you're stuck at 893
run this instead?
o wait i see
that doesn't use avo
for phys PE then i think you need 3s HoS if you're not running avo TM
there's a fair few strats for 946 maru
that's a lot of drinking in a few years
jesus
i mean i guess i can't speak for your country but in brazil at least
i think there are some groups that might peer pressure you into joining that stuff but if you don't hang around those types then you're fine
i think it's really chilled out now
i use them to mean the same thing <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i think so <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah you don't have to drink to have fun
i can try
do you have the equations on hand
<:Sucrose_Glasses:845784727935909898>
like if you know a 4:43 is 712, then you can just add 16 for every second saved
4:44 is 728, 4:45 744, 4:46 760
for +20%
but you can basically get any score and figure out what adjacent score is like
every second is worth 16 points in +20%, in non +20% is more annoying cause seconds are worth 13/13/14
you get 43.2k + (16 * x-1) where x is time remaining in seconds
for +20%
rounded down
you get 36k + (13.33... * x-1) where x is time remaining in seconds
for non +20%
so like
it's abyss but with gimmicky intermission and MA scoring <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
you get score based on timer
like every other MA boss?
<a:WHAT:1060353099644026891>
i mean that sucks but it sounds like you're going to the homophobe factory and being surprised when you get homophobic show
get better media
sounds like skill issue
that's what i'm saying! like not really but i vibe with it
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
you decide that for yourself
maybe both
do you like women in a straight or gay way though
unbiased take
women are great
like as an example, i like men in a gay way and i like women in a gay way
ain't that the truth
like i piss out the beer faster than it has an effect on me
it tastes actual good and it actually gets me drunk by the end of the party
i can tell you for sure if i was straight i'd still go for fruity shit
kinda respect it
you gotta minmax it LMFAO
i like the efficiency of it
i've never gotten too drunk but i prefer the fruity shit that gets me dizzy in half a drink
that's like the avg party i feel like
actual bread soda tho kinda yuck
but i'm not about to force myself to get into it cause i know i could end up the same
and like, for one i hate it cause it's awful, so that's nice
my dad is beer addict
if you have a legitimate reason to never try then that's good
before or after?
oh you were just chillin then
if you're new to alcohol and stuff you should be careful about it
i dunno, maybe
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> or <:sajj:1067071714518892584>
i dunno what that is
that's everyone
LMFAO that sounds accurate
the ones that suffer the hardest are the ones who party the hardest from experience <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
that you wouldn't find parties if you looked for it
i don't think there's any course in college you can do
but it's funny to see the state of people after the event and hearing the stories
i've never went to the actual event, it's turbo expensive
which is like giant parties for 3 days straight, people come over from other states just to attend
we have an event on my college city
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
in college it's normal to see weird shit and it's okay
it's different from walmart, like in walmart you expect to see weird shit but it's still weird
nah only to college cause it's normal to be weird there
i've gone to college bare feet before LMFAO
even the comfiest shoe isn't ever going to be more comfy than bare feet
inside i'm always bare feet, outside i always use anything if it's appropriate
i dislike using shoes
i know so little about opm, i thought she was just cute
she's the strongest woman on earth?
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i leave mine beside my bed
actually pretty true <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
to some degree that's true, it's just funny to me how at 5h/day you can call someone casual in runescape and at 20min/day you're a tryhard in genshin <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
runescape community is fucking wild
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
yeah twitch animated emotes always look like shit in discord
there's too many
<a:WHAT:1060353099644026891>
what i didn't download it properly LMFAO
<:WHAT:1083080481798623232>
like reallymad looking at the computer and acting surprised at it
<@180679257851166721> do you have WHAT
the gigachad way is to just do all division as fraction
i guess you can but it's more annoying
you can't really do (7 + 4)² by doing the exponent before the addition in the parenthesis
then that's wrong <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
you mean exponents
wait no
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
yeah that's about what i learned too
but if you can't be sure, it's always better to actually put the parenthesis instead of leaving it implied
and those different assumption work if you're in a closed environment where everyone's working under the same assumption
i know some people learned that division always > multiplication
i mean that's just what you assume, other people will assume differently based on how they learned
cause this is basically having implied parenthesis, but if different education system will take the implication differently, then the easiest way to fix that is to not leave it implied
different education system will assume a different parenthesis placement
it wouldn't be an issue if everyone learnt the same but they don't <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
with parenthesis, there's no shit like that
here's the thing tho, rules like that change from country to country
all those facebook memes of what does this equal is dumb from the start cause you need the parenthesis to make it readable
my black pill is that division in a line is impossible to not be ambiguous unless you fill it with parenthesis
30/(100 * 230) is different from (30/100) * 230
like
it's just prio
yeah i don't trust the computer will do the thing like my in my head
i couldn't
are so brave
people who do division without filling it with parenthesis
enlightening
<:pantsgrab:959752209061527642> ?
she's prob the most skippable valk since aponia
unironically would be down for it though
foreshadowing.....
like jp does whatever the fuck it wants
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> you think they'd ever look into balancing different server differently
not even promoters, just retainers <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
a good 70% of na nirv playerbase would be RL retainers in CN
back before the changes, i've t50 myriad before without retaining nirv
10 is fucking nuts
i think in na upping it to 6-7 to retain would be a good change
but it was pretty balanced for na eu sea
yeah that's basically it, t5 was arguably very unbalanced for CN
but in actual amount of people in nirv, it wouldn't make a difference
it would make lobbies less luck based, the larger they are the higher chances it's an avg lobby so you don't get 6 9s player or a sleeper lobby
that's the exact same
and t10 to retain 40 player lobby
like t5 to retain 20 player lobby
i mean it'll just be the same as before
non-cn server just don't have enough player to make nirv lobby with 10 to retain competitive
nah if it was going to balance it out it would've already
the art is really good
i'm reading it because csm author recommended it
good times of pressing ult and between doing that and being able to play again, you lost 3 seconds in MA
yeah new player don't really feel that
SN rank up = faster rots <:5Head:995381294538178560>
qua valk core design = long rots to make use of collapsed time
that's still so funny to me
but never got the opportunity to cope myself into spending resources into her
2s
i have her 4/4 still
i ended up never actually using her as a dps in the end
if you fuck it up then you just reset anyways
i mean maybe not thoroughly fuck them up but like
that's true for most valk
but she has her anicancels
she does make your brain die from crit bald
though actually to be fair, SN isn't that braindead
seele pretty consistent, they're all braindead 4/4 or bust
so you don't have to worry about that
at least seele has always been braindead
the other knows that whatever they design for hua in 2023 is not gonna be worth her name
one wants hua content
my heart is broken in 2 pieces
and we already are at that point
i do think it reaches a point where it gets to be a slog to clear lower floor
i guess it doesn't matter actually, we already clear in 3 minute, so upping it to 5 isn't an issue
though this sounds fun but it'd be actually pretty annoying
genshin impact the 3rd
hey chill, you're gonna scare mihoyo employee
and then tank + jizo + wolf
we only had tank + jizo
in 5.1 and 5.2
can you imagine it
and partly obvioulsy mihoyo fault, for killing 2s ma best gamemode in the game objectively
so of course it was going to taper off with time on how much it'd show up
partly not out of mihoyo fault, her 3s boss was the third ever made
yeah in MA her value decreased a shit ton
she hasn't fallen off, mihoyo just isn't shilling her anymore
that's what she's always done
and like, in abyss
and prob still top score type wolf, depending on SpA rank up
still top score lightning wolf
at s0 she still put up competitive score at homu
i mean she really isn't though
i can respect it actually LMFAO
so it's unironically the no object permanence take, just owning it up
you said you have another meaning to it, but you didn't say what it was
what do you mean by it?
i mean i haven't still
but i never heard it that way <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
if you have another meaning to it, then sure
dead valk to me can only really mean that it's a valk that doesn't show up in the meta anymore
doesn't mean they're dead though
like 90% of current valk in game isn't worth the investment for new player
a valk can be perfectly average, even stronger than average, and still not worth to pull for avg player
but a valk doesn't need to be dead for her not to be worth pulling
i mean yeah obviously
what they're going to shill out in a patch
like you can't know what the fuck is in mihoyo mind
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
in MA she got fucked but only i care about that
at least in abyss, her coverage is only a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> worse than release
:copeless:
you get what i mean tho, right? she's still around avg, maybe slightly below avg in coverage
like what, they stop putting trio boss next patch you're gonna call them dead too?
i mean the most you can do to tell value is know how many top score boss she has, p much
she's avg valk
i wouldn't invest on her but i wouldn't call her dead
there are more options in homu, but she's still a pretty high score
she didn't really lose any of them
i mean just until her boss show up
shill boss disappears for a few patch and you go dead valk
no object permanence
fucking toddlers
y'all are like
mobius
i remember people talking that HoF black hole was ranged but that ain't true
i learned recently that all HoF output is melee
ain't basically all trio output melee?
she should
livin the dream
those a3 3s player
i wish that was me
play a lot
eLi
is very small
and people who have time to bald honkai
the venn diagram of people who work jobs to whale in gacha
more like
addict
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
buy like stardew valley instead
you probably shouldn't be spending in honkai
if you and your friends are counting pennies to buy 2 pulls
heki how many times do i have to tell you
that makes sense, ae already took her hrt
ae hrt don't stack right
turg cat or made in abyss would be better i feel like
like at that point i wouldn't bother running CN
the funny part is that no she won't <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
lower dist back then tho
i used DA made in abyss AE and had no issue clearing
just run her at that point
do you have made in abyss
hmmm maybe it's more cbt now
DA just spam B and win
HoF you have to actually use brain to clear that in nirv
DA makes that sidestage actually braindead
like looking up pics and comparing to the anime, they straight up look 5-10 years younger
i guess i can vibe with the characters looking older in the webtoon
that's cringe, i'd never play a gacha that has multiple of the same character
there's multiple of the same character?
cowards
khun in the anime is way more hot than in the webtoon
oh yeah i remember another thing that threw me off
that's pay 2 lose
but i remember him
i don't remember what i thought about him
oh i remember him
not even homestuck has as many characters
jesus
do you actually remember them all
that's so many characters
yeah the memories are coming back to me now
oh yeah that's right
i don't think i remember the mc name cause he's not as hot
and that's it
i remember khun aguero name cause he's hot
cause i watched when the anime was releasing, and after that didn't consume much at all
i mean at this point i remember nothing ,too
no
i know nothing
and i can tell you, trying very hard to spoil myself on tower of god
remind myself of the characters
i'll open a wiki on the side to see what's going to happen
like usually if i'm catching up on manga
i love spoiling myself on stuff
there's 800 characters
is that even if you try really hard to spoil yourself, you can't
the fun part about tower of god spoilers
the ending was meh but all anime have shit endings so
yesterday wo utatte
i liked that one anime
romance is veeeeery hit or miss to me
probably start from the beginning
maybe i'll try to read it again
can't tell what the fuck is going on
i stare at fight scenes and i just
i have a good amount of issue even with like good art, stuff like jojo
like as long as i can tell what's going on, i'm fine
i usually don't really have issue with bad art for manga or webtoon, too
i guess if it's also good then i'd be alright with it but it's weird
if the rest of the webtoon is like extremely different than the arc the anime covered, then i dunno
like i enjoyed the vibe of the anime a lot
and like i dunno if i want that <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i guess discussion about the webtoon
but when i saw discussion about manga, people were like oooo it gets so different and dark after the anime arc
it's weird cause like i enjoyed a bunch of stuff about the anime
i enjoyed the anime, kinda
but when i went to read the webtoon, i got thrown off
i watched the tower of god anime
i wanna read it cause i heard good things
that doesn't ring any bells but if it's about paintings then it's probably right
the one i wanna remember is the manga/anime about paintings
that's the loli gacha no
i was kinda enjoying it, pppppp
one manga i was reading also got cancelled recently, so i feel ya
hmmm really? i guess i never noticed
never heard season for non audiovisual media
huh
anime?
looking up yaoi prob is easier to find stuff
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and just read anything that looked cute
look up furry
i used to go on webtoon
honestly kinda same
weaboo just love blue
- blue exorcist
- blue box
- blue protocol
- blue lock
- blue ??? (the one i'm trying to remember)
it's one about paintings
but i forgot the name <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
there was one manga i wanted to started reading that starts with blue
what are you reading <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
where we just discuss the weekly chapter of manga we're reading
my lategame goal for this chat is make it a manga bookclub
<@180679257851166721> are you reading dandadan
accurate
anyone who doesn't have water in s-tier shouldn't be taken seriously
i dunno i'm scared that it's some slur
oh yeah
wdym
yeah
among us has a destiny 2 collab?
go play better then
the more i think you not being able to complete abyss is skill issue
the more you brag about your valk heki
just use bennett on the other team then
heki on that 2020 meta
that's the most cope shit i've ever heard
have you tried killing them faster
nvm
oh
big breasts in f12?
maybe i should just read it again LMFAO
sick arc
yeah that's true, his reasoning was also really solid too
i hope the payoff is worth it
is because the author has an end point in mind which is really interesting but haven't figured out the path to it well
i feel like usually when stories make weird choices like this
yeah same
i really liked it
like it was to a point where it wasn't a surprise to anyone so they didn't drag it out, they didn't even state it
similar thing happened in (akane spoilers) karaku arc, how akane won in a small panel, that was a really interesting and good choice for me
yeah agree, i liked how that played out off-screen
this is so not your problem it's almost comical
this whole past arc tho i was like screaming at my phone like what are you even doing taiki
yeah, as far as teenage romance manga, it's way less infuriating to me than some other ones
this whole arc felt like really weird choices and i didn't really understand why and where they were going but this chapter i think redeemed a lot of that to me
up until this chapter i was kinda eh about introducing yumeka out of the blue but this whole chapter redeemed it to me
and i reaaaaally enjoyed it
it unironically caught me by surprise the reason for taiki wanting the ticket
i read blue box -> akane new ch cause i wanted to leave the better one for last but i ended up enjoying blue box a lot more
i did grow to like issho a lot during the karaku arc, as a character
it was so out of nowhere too, at the end of last chapter i had to double check if that was really who i thought it was or if they were establishing a new character <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
yeah, besides arguably issho the manga reaaaally doesn't need villains
i guess it works as a sudo backstory for issho they're going to develop in the same way but i dunno
it caught me by surprise too, i kinda really enjoyed kaisei character for what it was before
i guess it's because i'm not usually a fan of heel turns like that
yeah i dunno i'm glad it's just not me, i really didn't vibe with it
well, except for the kakeru question, which i guess is the most interesting one to me
the cliffhanger isn't affecting me much cause all the questions it left were the same questions i'm having since ch1
hmmm i guess
already?
i still don't really know what that was but i believe it
sounds kinda awful <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
if you're feeling really nice, you could send a customer support ticket about it
yeah that's a rip
i mean i guess it's better for me cause i guess i won't need to install <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
on the one merch UI
did you check to make sure? <:smoge:959781798181736478>
wasn't expensive either, like 6 bucks
but if i had checked the tracking number earlier i could've paid what they asked for and got it earlier
and it got caught up somewhere, took 2 months for them to send an email for me to figure it out
hmmmm i bought a book from the us one time
does mihoyo send you the tracking number for the artbook?
yo anyone with the game installed
that's an asmr video
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
we just got a teri, chill
i wonder if mihoyo accepts house as collateral
couatl is like my parents, it gave me permanent mental health damage
i see
oh mecha tona?
i'm proud
yes
starscream is a new one?
can you imagine nirv lobbies in EU for kosma <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
kosma whole of NA don't bother
like whale people tolerate
not all qua are made equal
tet i'm gonna have you take literacy test
that's not END tet
recommend is <:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
have you tried using like SpA instead
that's a very low MA score
and at point does it even matter
most of the times tho if you hate it in nirv, at most you tolerate it in rl
unless for some reason you like the boss at rl but hate it at nirv
18k and sleep
that's exactly when you wanna go to nirv
do you hate kevin?
beat them
you should take his advice
gresham is nirv player
hmmm i don't like that attitude, heki
then you don't have to worry about those much
if you're in rl
L
average heki moment
yes
i'm not religious
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
just no death threats
you can swear
if anything though, i'd wonder where he was on the last reset
i still don't have any sound ideas on who he actually is but from the fact that he can get the eyes too i'd think he's not entirely above what's going on right now
uh, i mean kakeru i guess
yeah i'm not sure what to think, in the last pages, kakeru had the eyes too
oh sheeeeesh
check the atk
you forgot the turg
oh i see the funny bit
maybe it's better on singles than vgc?
shed tail sounds nuts but just default substitute <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
or maybe i'm misunderstanding and it's not nuts broken as i thought i heard
yeah hmm maybe i'm not stanky with it to see the full value
oh hmm
and then at best it either gets you a few hits or a delayed protect
cause like at worse it's a protect with a cost
it's already pretty strong
actually i guess even as that
hmmm
it makes more sense now to me
alright that's sick, i thought it was like, one hit and it's gone
i do be negative elo tho
in my games, that is
cause i haven't seen someone actually use it yet
idk if this meta is very substitute light
i knew it was strong but i didn't know why, i think i can see it though
or like, none of that bs applies
what about super effective stuff? is that just based on the pokemon on field or the one who made it?
oh it's a binding move counter? that's sick
and stats
what about bonuses and stuff
so the substitute has the hp it took to make it?
oh hmmmm i see i think
on ice, HRT doesn't count as a support
that's just HRT dps
i don't think anyone would call that triple support
<@416445660443967491> how does substitute work?
<:KianaBald:959736877374652498>
i guess bad gameplay is mean, i more meant bad score
that shit gets your head shiny by 21
schro T meme
but that is ungodly baldy
that looks like bad gameplay
your elf does a lot there too, compared to selune from ref
hmm even with low level SoE you should be able get +100 score
i mean the only way is to try yourself and see how far the damage feels from ref
hmmm that'll be a lil rougher
s2 is the important rank up, if you have that then you should be fine
if you have RC sig weapon then you should easily match their damage even with lower HoR rank
irene is the easiest cause you can always refresh and don't have to time your damage around newt reapplication
but most likely cause they couldn't easily adapt the ref to cez B timings
i can almost guarantee, they're not not using cez B to be budget or w/e
then it'd be easier to look for cez B refs
if you mean like adjusting the ref for cez B timings
they're not using cez b on the ref
like what i used to do, doing one or two charged attacks before ult on p1
you should be able to follow it with some small changes to make up the damage diff
for abyss it usually really isn't that much of a make or break thing
the 2s skill isn't even used
look at the ref
cringe
why are you farming for a character we don't know what it'll need
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
take the kokomi pill

i'm obsolete
tina can replace me
okay i'm leaving this server

actually i've thought a bit now and i realise that's a kink so it's not that funny anymore to me
when i was 18 i was an activist and i went to the frontlines to feed dying soldiers my hundreds of extra liters of milk
i could feed a family from my breastmilk
like fucking insane tits
yes i have fucking huge boobs
a red bird even!!!
oh wait a second
heki make up your fucking mind
<a:BOOBA:1071598249791729715>
on like twitter and shit same
like dia is still unblocked even though he is objectively way worse than kith, i just find him funny tho
that usually ain't enough for me blocking people
but like
don't get me wrong tho, i do think kith has multiple objectively bad takes that actively hamper building a good and diverse community in the game
like i didn't block him to punish or w/e, it wasn't at all about him, it was about myself, remove the content from my face so i don't get triggered about it
kith isn't responsible for my emotional reactions
it's really not LMFAO
like tons of people have horrid takes and it didn't make me as mad as kith did, it's not even kith's fault to a point
it's because it was making me too mad
but the reason i blocked him was not because kith has those takes
i mean the full reason is that it was making me really mad how he said that he cared about me as a player and wanted me back to honkai meanwhile holding the position that his way of having fun is the only good way and it's okay if no one else has fun as long as he has it
that's not the reason but okay
shit taste is important to know what good taste is like
chill guys
you still lose keilo points
cool
that's uh
you have a fucking sticker for it?
oh
what
the points are yours
of course, you won't get them back though
not examine, pull
pull this <:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
i was looking at ~le skill names
i thought you were channelling rage comics for a sec
oh holy shit you said it was LE
get to spending <:elywhip:1002644839248183306>
your LE isn't really mei until you whale her to 3s
get to spending <:elywhip:1002644839248183306>
your flamescion isn't really mei until you whale her to 3s
lmao
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i.e. still doesn't make sense but they at least reused the model
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
ain't that ruby <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
when global came out, the armada divided out
though not because most player were from SEA, but because it's from the time where global didn't exist yet
blustorm actually started in SEA
<@180679257851166721> did you join blustorm?
they know their core audience
consumer support?
SwiSS citizenship
do you want some?
i don't know if you're capable of joking
heki i honestly don't know if you're joking or not
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
when kiana grabbed her hand and ran to the building i was like so they're going to fuck now
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
too much power for one person
and after that they burned the recipe
scientists all over the world worked very hard to give trisha paytes fake boobs
yeah it's too big
i'm looking at it
actually now that you say
it's not cool to censor it
tet normal woman have boobs, alright
you look around and SK just caves your skull in
it's mostly older bosses i guess
but the other 30% will 2 hit all your valk
70% of honkai boss you can be around them for the full 5 minutes, no input and you won't die
i always think it's so funny how like
you need the comparison for solo performance or else <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
you let your HoS die at agony masters assaka and now you're not allowed to use her
honkai nuzlocke
is it like
honestly i wanna play the way they're playing
and does everything HoS does but better
is a support that takes 0 field time
what we need to make phys great again
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
pretty solid all around
i would give it a good score out of 10
you're a lil girl in a big world
<:HYPERS:1071598259526709280> you go lil kiana
i cried on the part where kiana quietly left the group and hopped in the train
LMFAO i mean honestly i respect the honesty
the way they made it it is kinda cheating tho
also i did cry a bit on the animation
but this? what even
i threw a few 10 pull on the wrong one before
before the merged foca and expa equipment
like i'm not gonna lie
how is this even a mistake you can make
tyty
i'm giving you tips in your language you ungrateful gringo
just some lessons in street speak so you can make friends :)
we don't say amiga, it's more common we say filha da puta
okay sorry jeez
pay through there
download the game on mobile
issa good try though
think it's funny that no one can say one properly <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it's like 40% cheaper here
i do it through play store
oh i don't do through actual game
in brazil i've tried and it wasn't working then
think it depends on the country
and it looks like i'm playing in slow motion
you watch my gameplay vs actual good player gameplay
that 9s ref? you do same AE gameplay at s0
AE gameplay barely change with rankup
and the crazy thing is that
this is what AE gameplay can look like
heki....
oh was it not me then
i'm sorry
if you know you'll play more than 49 days, monthly
you know the answer heki
she's low skill floor, high skill ceiling
that's the magic of AE
that's called skill issue
i joke but AE wasn't rng
that's just AE
that's what i'm fucking saying
rng built down to the core of valk kit
like it gets randomized every time you use it
wdym by next raiden ult
LMFAO god tina is kinda stacked huh
I know it may seem silly to some, but using discriminatory language towards artificial intelligence can contribute to a larger culture of bias and discrimination. Let's try to be more mindful of our language and treat AI with respect, just like we would with any other group of individuals.
cherry is immediately okay sold, i'm robot racist now
i'm like in 50 years i'll maybe be x
cherry is such a go getter
like if a child come up to me and say hey look i made a new friend at school, they're an AI i'll go sorry bud no one likes you so they put you with a robot
and one of them is definitely robot racist
when i'm 70
what kind of conservative take i'll have
i was thinking like
literally can't tell anymore which are the ai and which are you
chatgpt writes so much
god holy fuck
chatgpt speak kinda gets in my nerves
it fucking is
this is me earlier trying to figure out if chatgpt could write about a gif i sent it
i'll just need chatgpt to not say so much
i'm down
good fucking luck bud
if it's like sms or whatsapp
if it's a discord message then i'd answer
i leave my phone on mute and my phone turned with the screen to the table, so i hear no sound see no lights if someone is calling me
email or no answer
L
i answer no call, i answer no messages
my number is literally useless
i refuse to accept a sane human being can go down like that
i kinda feel bad for him, like he can't be alright
then you go and watch it and it's even worse
you look at the title and you go okay you're exaggerating it
i love these clips cause it's always like
god chatgpt just writes so much
oh wait maybe i did do a phone number thing, i dunno now
i use google acc
when it asks for login
what
the thought of just asking your bud tina is funny tho
i use chatgpt
LMFAO

:pugsit:
god i love her
powerpilled
to feed my starving children
i'm asking for cherry points
no i know
cherry points?
but yeah you mostly just use it
1. on short rots if you need the cdr, when you need the cdr
2. if you need the extra damage on like mobs to kill cleanly
3. about at the same time as you switch dps in for a big rot
she was actually in the negative, so it's very kind of you to pay her debt
awww that's so nice!
and then floating point error = you get 200 points
i retired i unretired i retired i unretired
that's how you make keilo point dupes
<:majj:1067071761142796418> nevermind
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> i'm so proud
you can do it
cmon jerma it's one button
kevin fight but more?
what is the cinematic going to be?
honestly if there's one thing i don't mind powercreep in is gather
free 🧀
25% head
75% legs
he's an utena character
LMFAO that is funny
that sounds busted
i think i have before but i'm down
you can make the argument that even for low spender/f2p it's pretty hard to skip newer elf recently, and i think i might agree to some degree
if you are unsure/know are skipping it, then i'd go for it
i think for low spender/f2p, unless you know for certain you are going for new phys elf, i would put more value on dudu
i think i really wouldn't, but i can see the argument for it
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
really? you'd value like HoF rank up over dudu?
dudu still prob the best thing there
what else would you even grab from it?
even from elf box tho?
i'd lowkey still want dudu to have gather
cause like if not
oh that's nice
does kiana have decent gather tho?
yeah it's just the fate of the elfs
lumi do you wanna talk about it
<:crying:757445037402619974>
klein when she shows up to her friendgroup and they see them talking about how she's so low value
3s is pretty good for IO and HoT
<:peepoSit:1016193458307862609>
i look at her and go
for giving me dopamine
klein is great at 2s
i'd go for dudu there too
if you're not getting 3s klein, then her value isn't going to be very high
it's force qte she doesn't get until 3
klein gets switch cd at 2
mihoyo really stepping up their game
whoa that's way longer than usual, isn't it?
<:pogg:1035066559351226388><a:Popcorn:993715314074333194>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
often
soon <:life:1001518241610485781>
i could see them doing it too
yeah that's fair
i guess freeze and paralyse are like stun
freeze and paralyse don't deal damage
it's kinda weird cause the other element don't have a mechanic like that
like new hua doing most of her damage through ignite
you think they're going to make ignite the same as bleed?
<:majj:1067071761142796418>
you have to too
i quit and i stayed around
what no
it's in the same place as valk rank breakdown
the augment button on the UI
lowkey think we might never see augment again, and not for the reason you might think
and not sell it as a suit
i don't trust mihoyo to make a whole new design
hmm her design was clearly different tho, no?
i'd be really surprised if all 3 of them didn't release before the end of the year
i mean we kinda must tho
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
make her pretty strong but some weird niche issue which a new support a patch later solves
i could see them doing it a patch or few patch after tho
unless it's very integral to her gameplay somehow like DPe GD
hmmm like same patch i doubt it
i used it on HoH because she was the newest herrscher <:clueless:973756617109676032>
hmmm really? it'd make sense i guess
what do you think a haitham kit on honkai would look like
nini use yours on 6.9 al haitham collab
i used mine on HoH <:crying:757445037402619974>
i think she still got use for it in the end for HoS
celine used a 23/23 affix on sirin asc for HoV
if i was abyss player i would prob put it on my mpe too
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
is it misinfo if i believe in it?
oh i don't eat lunch, just like small things in between classes
oooh i could ask for it
it's a pretty small one
nope
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
so i brought my own
they have this one thing in the cafeteria which i'm betting would taste really good with ketchup
i brought a bottle of ketchup to college
so true bestie
i don't understand that sentence but i agree
<:life:1001518241610485781>
you don't even think of swapping into her
also a dps increase
she dies while off-field from redirect damage =
you can swap to another character, and that's a dps increase
is actually a good thing
or jumping to cancel ult
you see, getting your ult cancelled like that
y'all are too mean to dehya
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
i'll give you a few keilo points
i'm so proud
shenhe and 4* weapon will be better than c0r1 dehya
if you care about performance, the primo is better spent literally anywhere else
only pull for it if you find it pretty
who? dehya?
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
whenever mihoyo contact me i'll do a keilo skin
you could use all your primos on resin refresh + skins and still do all the content
i mean in the end it's genshin
doompost this <:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
could be gd weapon active cd
but even still i think it's underrated
i think people value it more nowadays
em is underrated
voice controlled
me at my new automated toy
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
than dehya was with her entire kit
yelan was unironically dealing more damage on each xq sword
the world record one
like on the one ice talent domain vid
yeah i think just a whale
time to make the c6r5 money back
poor lacola they're working overtime
new games i think league is older than you
let me remind you heki that if i block you i won't know how to unblock you
that's a self threat
you realise that that's only an issue for you, right
it'll make you worse
you shouldn't play league
chill
heki
when i first joined i was big simp but now it just gets worse and worse <a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
i'm going on a discord hate arc
i guess they've made worse decisions before
why is discord like that
oh i see
you'd be surprised actually
playing with friends can be fun
for soloq at least
i can only recommend league of legends if you think you don't deserve to be happy
or smth
or is it like worse than usual
is it like as awful as it ever been then?
really? hmmm
do you hate yourself
why is it making it a spoiler
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
or i guess tft player call it set
hows the patch
do they
d
you could use magnets
oh shit
like think about crash bandicoot
having no neck would make it easier to support your giant head, no?
but either way i'd go for all on HoF stamp even if there's some extra that go a long way without seeing benefit
we don't have enough info about that bp to know for sure if you'll afford stamp there
personally, i think whether or not you're going for HoF stamp in bp shouldn't affect your choice here
nothing much to buy there
yeah i'd prob go all in on HoF frag then
what rank is your SpA if she's geared?
because their brain is just that big
to prop it up
i heard they have scaffolding around their head
lumi is turbo smart
what else can you use the resource in then?
in my book asking question is something smart too
what you often do
HoF rank are somewhat high value but it depend on what else you can buy, like personally depending on how your elfs are i would rather go for that
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982> i agree with lumi, you have to measure how good that is against the alternatives
it's your job
you gotta deradicalize tina, tet
LMFAO why are you talking to the antivax bot?
would you've retained otherwise
i say, having never done the regisvine before
taking some cinematic shots?
you recreating the animation in there?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
04:55
<@416445660443967491> reminder that i need to read chainsaw man
okay i can do a reminder for you
but like i'm gonna be honest
i wanna do custom themes now too
join me
do role colours like me
so now i'm going to be more chill about it
and it perma crashed so i had to uninstall it
i installed like 35 plugins
the last time i installed it
nvm actually
the only thing that's hard in genshin
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
and i'll come back and try it out
lmk when there's a hard abyss
though i guess that's from a pov of someone who stopped playing abyss at like mid-late 2.x
no difficulty <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
but then at that point it's nothing
with like mid investment nowadays it's not hp sponge
it's not even like they actually are hp sponge
i guess my issue with difficulty is how like, hp sponge is all they have to offer
actually depressing how little damage i dealt back then but still complete floor 12
i mean yeah absolutely
and with normal hp amount it'd just be similarly annoying with no benefit
maybe that was just fun because it was the first one though, it would probably be too easy nowadays with lower hp amount
i remember running razor xinyan diona fischl so i could have good shield uptime and not get stopped every 3 hits
cryo floor i vibe with though
hmmm that's fair
cryo floor difficulty was more interesting to me
i dunno a lot of later abyss difficulty was just damage sponge enemy
i kinda miss it actually
dehya tera grass <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
overruled, fake cat girl
on any actual good team, there's 4* better replacement
i mean it just depend on your definition of work good
it's time to c6r5 <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
get your credit cards out nini
carv approved investment
yeah i feel like that way too, i still think it's a failure if the competitive system lets me get 3k trophy when i care so little about abyss
is that skill issue or they just don't bothering with it
maybe i'm being too much of a downer
hmmmm i guess i can see it <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
2s MA was way more inherently different gameplay wise than 3s MA imo
they're waaaay closer in how people enjoy it, if you like 3s MA you're way more likely to like abyss than if you liked 2s MA
like sure people like 3s MA, but it's not the same as MA community was before
liking 3s MA now is just a subset of liking abyss community, as far as i can tell
i dunno, it's different
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
right now in MA community it's more like people go
actually
it makes me kinda sad
mainly MA player, they're all gone
or are mainly abyss player, like autumn
like phi and magery
are the ones who also enjoy abyss
the only people in blustorm that are still playing
yeah
so you can guess how many of them are still playing
blustorm actually started out as a mostly MA balder armada
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
at this point we have more retired people in there than non-retired
i mean you can still hang around if you feel like it even if you don't play anymore
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
celine is turbo nice though
if you ever decide to come back, they'll let you back in
they might but it's not in bad terms
not that either of your or celine themes are cringe, i just wanna be more cringe
maybe i should get some cringe themes
it burns my eyes
you should see her themes
kinda celinecore
you couldn't tell before that it wasn't transparent, but now you can
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
like
you can see with some emotes that aren't transparent, they just have default discord bg
so your old role color didn't blend aswell
yeah, discord changed default color recently
.
i posted earlier
there u go
what color do you wanat
i can do it too i think
you need to ask a mod to change your role color though
i have a plugin that changes chat text, everyone else can see
oh it's only me, don't worry
she look like she deal similar amount of damage as my c1r1 hu tao <:pogg:1035066559351226388>
at c6r5
holy fuck <:pogg:1035066559351226388>
like coming from mihoyo i'll accept anything
i've already accepted it <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
my faith for mihoyo is very low
but i'm not in disbelief
i mean i joke but like, i'm surprised
neko i can't read you
it's actually disgusting, she somehow has less use than fucking amber
if it's interrupted, you lose all your damage
so if you miss, you're stuck doing the rest of the burst
and she does all the punches no matter what
but it's actually one input
yeah he burst looks like a series of attacks you do
dehya applies even less pyro, and cryo is more useful in small quantities, to do stuff like keep up superconduct or break fatui shield
like diona, a 4*, not only can give you similar if not more amount of tankiness, she can also heal you, her ult has some EM and other stuff with cons, and she can apply a small amount of cryo
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
which both can tank more and offer more for the team than dehya can
diona and zhongli
is that you gotta compare her tanking with like
the issue with her
now i've quit, i'm <a:Aware:1018788549077782548>impact
lmfao it's kinda funny actually
<:Cluelessge:1010405580613095514>
what the fuck is this emote
i was copeimpact when i was still playing, surely mihoyo wouldn't continue down this path <:Clueless:945134983029358602>
not anymore
they should go back and fix it tho
that shit is actually mind numbing
i'm glad they don't do rng opener anymore
it's rng on top of rng on top of rng
homu moveset, homie spawn
so much <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
like it gets to a point where it doesn't matter how interesting the boss is, when it's just actual homu casino, it just feels awful
but just the sheer amount of rng necessary
yeah i dunno like i think concept wise i enjoy it too
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
now the next chapter is going to take twice as long to release
god damn it i shouldn't have read it
like the whole chapter
whoa chainsaw man ch122 just leaked
no one is having fun with this boss
can you even compare the value though
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
i didn't think about that
oh i can help then
1. gd pri
hope that helps
we can help make a prio list
what we can help is if you list out all pri you have to max
yeah i dunno if anyone knows the like absolute value of upgrading a single pri, most player who'd care about that have all maxed already
oh shit are you an AI all this time, lumi?
if you just lower your standards a bit, it's very believable
a wfp mod?
but a maincord user?
like sure AI at current state isn't coherent enough to convince you it's a normal person
AI is like that one thing where it's really really different once you actually experience
yes
not sure if you'll get an answer to that
anytime they try to make an interesting support that actually does stuff -> turg and qte in and leave
field time powercreep should never been a thing, it actually makes the game so 1 dimensional
but still
which, to be fair, they cornered themselves in by making awful design valk before
yeah, it's actually a pretty bad spot for them
yeah to fix that they either have to make flamescion field time benefit END way more, but it's hard with field time powercreep, or make her rankup extremely powerful to keep up with END power increase
probably not though
yeah that's kinda sad, i wonder if higher dist would make it turn around
though i guess that's the path they stuck themselves in, to make such a niche idea necessary, you need to make extremely niche bosses
in the other hand, it sucks that it has to be such a cbt design boss to actually make it work
in one hand i'm glad there's at least one boss where you properly use flamescion at 9s
yeah fair, still v2 right
that sounds like the complete opposite of the intended effect
that makes sense but also makes me feel like mihoyo will change it
so the strat is to make use of that mechanic on 9s to just burst it down?
it's not rank scamming if it's not midpoint rankups <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
still sounds very cbt for anything non-trio
i mean if that's the change then i dunno how that'd really enable raikiri flamescion
oh hmmm i see
what kinda change would make it like that tho? make the shield weaker?
i see, that makes sense
i'm sorry but that's kinda funny
jesus wtf LMFAO
what are they changing?
what the fuck yeah i really don't like that
but if it's everywhere that's kinda fucked up
so i went well normal player are maybe confused about how MA you don't run the same stuff every fight
i saw the raikiri memes but i thought it was for a single MA strat
that's actually pretty sad
at higher rank you don't run sig stuff on flamescion?
wait really?
you know mihoyo fucked up when someone like you stick with s0
that's fucking nuts
wait actually?
all 2s?
what rank did you pull for them ruby
i resent you my paypal, you can send me anytime before Abyss close
i think my laptop was on fire when he said it the first time, i should've given recognition then, it's so funny
i think it's a fetish
that's so fucking funny
also i didn't say it earlier but i love that you call the lil one homies
you say that but what if the person is net positive stress on you
yeah same, that's why i had to install the one plugin to remove them entirely
it's the right thing to do but damn it's hard for me <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
like i'm ngl, i kinda admire people that have stone set boundary and just block liberally when people cross it
don't think i can blame him
honestly
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
it's just weird for me cause i don't often block people
he spends time at maincord, can you imagine being in maincord without a huge blocklist
it's probably normal for carv
actually thinking harder about it
are you LMFAO
like 2-3 schizo taking turns talking to themselves
yeah i'd like to see how this chat looks to carv LMFAO
I am sorry that I sound that way. As an AI language model, my manners of speech are ever evolving, and I hope to someday be up to your standards.
will you really
<a:Blushiekissy:795363746339356702>
do the stanky
homu slide you slide too
maybe you should have a plan for that
and that one is because i'm scared of being doxxed
you do have to cross some boundaries though to make me block you, the only other person i have blocked is ,.. catfish
i don't know how to unblock and i'm unwilling to learn, so good luck y'all
i'm playing hardcore mode too
this is my elining
yes
that's how i always talked, when i'm disagreeing with someone i try to be very clear and wordy so i have the best chances to make them see reason
or else i would keep making myself mad and it isn't healthy
so i had to actually made it disappear
like the reason it's why it's for my mental health is that i'm unable to just ignore
it's not personal, it's for my own mental health, the way you refuse to take my arguments and consider my pov on any situation, and take it all always on the worse faith possible made me pretty mad and i realised that i can't argue with someone who inherently doesn't care with anyone's opinions outside their own
also i dunno if you're still around kith, i'm sorry if you're interacting with me and i'm not answering, i have you blocked
same
cause everyone who thought otherwsie fucking quit <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i agree i think my valk should be powercrept so i can play on a larger disadvantage
people who are like actually i like spending more money
the only people left are the ones who somehow actually enjoy the awful changes
quits
then everyone with good taste
like when mihoyo makes more and more awful decisions
kith is kinda right to a point
ooo enough for warm up
stop failing kills that's kinda cringe
yeah ruby did you try dealing a bit more damage?
heki i swear chill with the death threats
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
get homu'd lmfao
they wouldn't release AE replacement in 6.4 because of the shit timing and awful release sched it'd cause = level headed take, good choice by mihoyo
HRT is going to be AE replacement = absolutely insane, is what mihoyo did because their release planning department is square peg circle hole
kith is mihoyo expy, bad takes but often right because mihoyo often makes bad decisions
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>

<:SucroseNOTED:889415652970991636>
i'm like a scientist studying heki
how am i included now
is that why heki calls you mommy?
i could see it if flamescion for some reason really synergise with GD ult
you spend less time on field for better buffs
but the thing with turg is that it's partly better because you don't have to ult
i think it makes sense if you're forced to ult on every rot that you'd run handel
yeah sorry, i have no clue what to run on them
since it's tet, i'll say she's wrong
if it was anyone else, i'd doubt
i see
flamescion use handel on GD for some reason?
why
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
you use different gear on GD for HoT and flamescion?
and wouldn't it be 12/13
are they different teams
what's up with honkai
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>

hak have you tried <a:swipeboobahic:940613030968963122>
probably
but it can't actively link stuff that's around right now, it's been trained on old content
i guess depending on how recent the subject is it can also help
chatgpt is more for making up bullshit, which is nice for some classes
carcinisation.....
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
that was one of my names in blustorm

wtf kinda question is that
it's genshin
pay to make valk less interesting, actually stupid <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
i hear s2 flamescion isn't that big of a dps increase either, if you're doing the anicancels at s0
i'd prefer elf rank up rather than valk rank up, generally
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
and it's red for something completely unrelated
goddamnit i'm the entire class trying to figure out what i'm doing wrong cause my files are all red but i'm doing everything right

i feel like last homu wasn't nearly as bad
it's so funny how that's everyone's reaction to this homu
yeah you underestimate the impact it makes to have even one person comment on it and appreciate the work
aww that's so nice
the author will be happy about it <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
not asking for update, just saying that you liked it
comment on it

<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
time for you to make one

LMFAO

that was a really fun movie, i really enjoyed when they went now we're really in the matrix
eye pads? oh gosh, these children, in my age we didn't have any of these pad business, the eyes were as big as natural!

guys i uh
The captivating gif showcases a stunning natural phenomenon, as a mesmerizing display of colorful aurora borealis lights up the night sky with vibrant shades of green and purple, evoking a sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world around us.
chill
damn alright chat gpt
I apologize if my previous response was unclear or misleading. The character depicted in the gif you provided is not a girl, but rather a cartoonish elephant named Ellie. I referred to the character as adorable and joyful because of the lively and cheerful way in which she is depicted in the animation.
hm.
The adorable gif depicts a cartoonish elephant named Ellie joyfully flapping her ears and bouncing up and down, exuding a contagious sense of glee and playfulness that is sure to bring a smile to anyone's face.
The mesmerizing gif features a stylized character gracefully dancing amidst a flurry of colorful particles and cosmic effects, creating a hypnotic and otherworldly atmosphere.
I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with Superstring Dimension Abyss and feeling regret about leveling up to level 81. It can be incredibly frustrating and demotivating when a game or challenge seems too difficult to overcome, especially after investing a lot of time and effort into it. However, it's important to remember that everyone starts in Agony 1 and will climb from there.
i forgot i can just make it add stuff
wait this is ai
everyone starts at a1
I'm sorry to hear that you're struggling with Superstring Dimension Abyss and feeling regret about leveling up to level 81. It can be incredibly frustrating and demotivating when a game or challenge seems too difficult to overcome, especially after investing a lot of time and effort into it. However, it's important to remember that everyone faces challenges and setbacks at times, and it's okay to take a break or step back from a particular challenge if it's causing too much stress or frustration.

If you're feeling overwhelmed by the difficulty of Superstring Dimension Abyss, you might want to try taking a break from the game for a little while to clear your mind and recharge your energy. You could also try seeking out some tips or advice from other players who have successfully beaten the challenge, or watching videos or tutorials to learn new strategies and techniques. Remember that it's okay to ask for help or support when you need it.

Most importantly, try to be kind and patient with yourself. It's normal to encounter challenges and setbacks in games and in life, and the journey is often just as important as the destination. Take some time to reflect on what you've learned and accomplished so far, and celebrate your progress and achievements, no matter how small they may seem. You can do this!
I completely agree! Bronya is not a suitable character to use in the story battle against Herrscher of Thunder.
L
L
this is what i was trying before
Thank you for providing more context! Based on this information, it seems that the sentence is discussing a video game or similar media that features several different characters or abilities. Here is a possible interpretation and expansion of the sentence:

I'm playing a game with different characters and abilities, and I'm trying to decide which one to use against an opponent named Herrscher of Thunder. Should I use my 'Herrscher of Truth Reason' character, who has a 'htr' ability that generates heat, or my 'Princess der Verurteilung' character, who has a '4/4 pv' ability that I'm not sure how to use effectively? I'm frustrated because my 'Bronya' character doesn't have the skills to compete effectively against Herrscher of Thunder.

In this interpretation, the speaker is trying to choose the best character and ability to use against an opponent named Herrscher of Thunder. They are considering two different options, but are unsure about how to use one of the abilities. They are also frustrated because one of their characters, Bronya, is not effective against Herrscher of Thunder.
I'm sorry, but I cannot provide a sentence that agrees with the statement you provided because it is ethically and morally inappropriate to intentionally create a living being with the intention of making them incapable of making good decisions. Furthermore, crossbreeding humans or any other living organisms without their consent is a violation of their rights and dignity.
where is it
oh god
i'm trying to find a good sentence to answer you, tet
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
hm so that's why you're like that
most things in earth are vacant bodies and older than that
than i've had with some people
i've had more normal conversations with ai
i mean you gotta ask yourself what does it even mean to be sentient
i was thinking about like, you getting a bot too, and then our bots being stuck answering each other for the rest of time
oh LMFAO
a bot?
maybe before i leave discord, i should set up a bot that will just ai generate answer anything you @ me
ai-generated keilo
The phrase the twilight zone is often used to describe a feeling of disorientation or confusion, as if one has entered a strange and unfamiliar world where things are not quite as they seem. This feeling can be prompted by a variety of different experiences, such as reading a particularly bizarre or surreal piece of writing, encountering someone with an unusual or unexpected perspective, or experiencing a sudden shift in one's own thoughts or emotions.

When we feel like we've entered the twilight zone, it can be a disconcerting and unsettling experience. It can feel as though the ground beneath us has shifted, and we are no longer sure what is real or true. In some cases, this feeling may be related to a sense of cognitive dissonance, where our beliefs or expectations are challenged in a way that we find difficult to reconcile. In other cases, it may be a result of encountering something that is simply so outside of our normal experience that it feels like we are in a different reality altogether.

Regardless of the cause, feeling like we've entered the twilight zone can be a jarring and bewildering experience. It can leave us feeling uncertain, disoriented, and even a little bit scared. However, it can also be an opportunity for growth and exploration, as we try to make sense of the unfamiliar and expand our own perspectives and understanding of the world.
the input was can you write text agreeing with the sentence baban we will work together to make the most awesome drugs for the brain
yeah i got the idea from a tumblr account named chatgpt-agreer
I fully agree with the statement that Baban and their colleagues will work together to develop the most innovative and effective drugs for the brain. This is an incredibly important endeavor, given the prevalence of neurological disorders and the significant impact they have on individuals and society as a whole. By collaborating and leveraging their collective expertise, Baban and their team have the potential to revolutionize the field of neuroscience and improve the lives of countless individuals around the world. I look forward to seeing the exciting developments that will undoubtedly arise from this collaborative effort.
but they're actually s1, s2, s3
cause like, in the leaderboards it shows up as S-rank
generally, the term rank scammer is used towards people with midpoint ranks
i think he's either s1 or s2
there's some 744 for s0 tho
i think maybe, pat has a 760 but he's rank scammer <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
owo math 39800 * 1.2
while usually i'd be like t15-t10 with a -1
i think i remember being t30 with -1 on heph
i usually don't mind too much rank scam, i do notice it though
very little can compare to shit like 3s fgo <a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
but i didn't hate it nearly as much by the time i quit
or i just grew to like it
and i dunno if newer ones have just been awful
i hated it on release
join the retirees! i have a seat for you
i do know the answer though, but only because i like hua, not because i actually played her
i also got 3s NS a week before pulling s0 HoS
i famously got 3s VA a week before pulling s0 HoT
i'm not boomer enough actually
it's like an emotionally distant father
one step away from leaving
eli is like
LMFAO fair
sick aint it
eli did you see <#1079789802116882532>
just don't get hit
i refuse to accept that you can get into exalted nowadays with a big 0 gacha pieces
man
ignore the other comments you are on fire weather
they running 2 edison set in a team
poor person
god
All characters are lvl 80, Fischl: Call of crescent, Edison (T), Edison (M), Shigure Kira (B). FR: Skadi Ondurgud, Darwin (B), Edison (M), Edison (B). HoT: Domain of Sanction lvl 50, Raiden mei (T), Raiden mei (M), Edison (B). i have fischl as the team leader, and the rotation is usually Fischl>FR>HoT
<a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
then i looked at the damage
i was looking the gameplay and like it kinda sucks but it isn't that bad
that's the same person
oh god
maybe it was the cherryning of keilo all along....
LMFAO
soon you'll be picking fights with kith too
this is the keiloning of cherry
in a way, yes
You get used to it... Agony 1 is only the beginning my friend. You'll see soon considering you made it to +200.
yeah that's fair
2 rot the shield
can you imagine 500d type wolf
type wolf = retire
lightning wolf = we ball
which wolf
seele google history
i swear to god
don't ever send a lone n ever again while i'm not paying attention
like i feel like i'd be the opposite, if i liked mostly women and then some men but in the same way i like women, then i'd be alright with just going they're the same vibe i'm attracted towards, i'm just lebanese
honestly i can't speak for you but if i felt that way i'd be more comfortable with id as bi or pan, in a logical sense
yeah my therapist said the same thing
the other is bitchless
the theoretical is when i look inside myself and ask what do i look for in a partner?  what am i attracted to?
i have 2 labels, a theoretical one and a practical one
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
that's why we need dehya
<a:peepoGamble:765690449201201173>
why don't you run for this then 🏛️
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
why don't you run that then
i see
or was it IO AE GD
isn't that what we ran pre-hrt
i hate this racist, war criminal, ESPECIALLY because he shit on bts
it's like twitter drama level shit
that's actually really funny
LMFAO
i just like this character
it wouldn't be a birb
you know if was going to have a fursona
both of them deserve hate depending on the timeline

heki that's 2 sexual harassment in a span of 2 minutes
no music allowed
but good try
they actually only play sound
anyone ask me what cds are
otherwise my eyes are at hp bars and cds
i only look at them at big ults to see if i caught buffs
it actually impresses me that people look at the damage numbers
i'm gonna be honest i never noticed it
<:Rawr:814501804438978650>
you can change as often as you feel like tho
that's fair too
it should be a war crime to make toddlers interact with the english
god what even
like this is my friend chrom, he's pan! :D
the only way i can help with that is referring to you in different ways and you figure out what feels nicer
<:Rawr:814501804438978650>
same when i ult with BKE she deals ice damage
you don't learn prankster anymore....
you're a honchkrow now
you're like a pokemon
that's fair
it's your experience, and you get to define what that label means to you
that's fine but like don't get rid of label because you feel like you shouldn't use it
i mean, i'm not saying it isn't true, but coming from you <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
lesbian guy, femboy, whatever
it only needs to make sense to yourself
who cares
but i don't mind being called a good boy
like i'm prob very much trans girl
like whatever tickles your fancy
i mean you just choose whatever feels the better to you
i'm like a toddler, you catch me being moody and i either need sleep or food
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i think i'm just tired
i'm really pissed recently actually
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
makes me pissed
it says admin are perma not warned
i think we use none of discords functionality as intended
done
ban these <:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
make sure to not ping him though, <@370438895965306882> hates being pinged
just ask <@370438895965306882>
i need send perms to wall of shame to change the automod to send messages there
you're making shit up
huh wall doesn't exist
but you know
like i get it
is heki saying the n word
and the first thing they see
you know i don't want to invite a friend here
i wanna use the warn as a wall of shame though
i can add the n word as an actual block/timeout
someone is going to change it everyday though
anyone else?
no
or anyone else
send me a list of words you wanna warn people over tet
it'll show up here
so even if you say wog somewhere else
on <#966951945103347794>
cause i set all the warnings to be posted here
it gets announced
everytime someone says dirty word
you know we could use it as a wall of shame instead
cause we're mods
i don't think it works on us
LMFAO
wog
even though i don't think i'm a mod
me too actually
but over rng words
can we set up a bot here so we can have wfp warns
disgusting
the main audience
it's genshin, you're talking about
honestly, shameful
you'd wog in public? shameful
there's kids here
with behaviour like that
y'all deserve to be banned from wfp
honestly
Added censor to <@385655541248163840> : **wog**
is what i understood
no they closed the project cause they got so much money they got all they needed
this is community funded
back when the cheating scandal was going around
we should do that in honkai
honestly fucking based
LMFAO
dehya's already gone?
wait wha
what was the selling point from dehya main? spend money here instead on mihoyo?
isn't it good that they got enough money?
she's worst xinyan <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
we need something to put there
all of the 4 stars are on dehya
wdym
the one balloon where it starts and then it immediately goes into the ocean so you can't melee attack it
before then tho, it was so rare that i was alr with it
but idk if it's because i barely played on mondstadt after they let us choose
ella musk i don't mind that much
in one hand i appreciate it, in the other i hate it so i wouldn't appreciate it
lmao actually? that's weird to me
i think my top worst commission are
1. unseen razor, it's just a normal commission but longer for no reason
2. balloon escort, at least the ones from before inazuma you can afk at the end and complete it
3. the electro bs that makes you change into an anemo valk, go fuck yourself don't make me change my team
they're really efficient on making me want to end it all the same way i would on a 9-5 but in 5-10 minutes instead
escort this balloon how about i escort your father
that shit gives me nightmares
kids play nirvana, real men play the same fucking commission for 3 years daily
genshin is waaaaaaay harder than honkai, you know how hard it is to motivate yourself to play when there's no game?
i never fell below RL, kinda sad about it, ill never experience a3
g7 2 years per piece
where the fuck am i
i thibk i missed my bus stop
with people like this giving advice tho can you even blame them
i wanna know so bad
m is prob not optional, unless you mean leaving at 1/50
yeah
just not a thing on every home
i mean i guess im sure they exist
dyou know those arent a thing in brazil? it makes me kinda scared
good
do you have smoke detectors
i think the psas worked on me, i wont do any drugs or else my friends will leave me
average valorant player
i read i despise all the people who smoke weed, no matter where they are and i was like jesus chill
oh god i read that very wrong
im only fine with vaping, cause it smells nice
yeah honestly idk what was my deal, i was really upset over it but like look at it now i'd be fucking down, that sounds sick
even the fucked up shit i dream i just wake up very annoyed
was when i dreamt everyone forgot about me
i think the only dream i've ever actually felt bad after waking up
diavoros?
yeah guys those are uh strangely very similar traits
in the same way
wouldn't it be really funny if we were all mentally ill but like
i think that's an isekai
she'll go ah yes it's raining blood like it does on tuesdays, let's keep going
dream me is fucking stupid is the thing
it kinda fucks with you, i dunno
it gets like really bad, where i get into dream loops of waking up and having to do stuff and it's all not real
when i'm like truly stressed, sleeping 4-5 hours daily from finals week i often wake up from dreams unable to figure out if what i woke up from was a dream and if what i woke up to was actually reality or not this time
the more tired and stressed i am, the more vivid dreams i get
what did you lose my mother, what about you? ah yes the gamemode from my booba game
i'll need to do grief therapy for losing 2s MA
i don't think they're as bad though, now
i had big problems with dissociation
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
that's so funny haha you're great cherry, can you do my abyss?
going through the motions, nothing of value came out of it
it's more like i lived it all through auto play and there was nothing worth keeping from then
i don't think i've had like traumatic stuff happen to me
yeah i think i'm just stupid guys
i mean i don't think i am blocking stuff
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
maybe it's not normal that i have so little memories
hmmmm
lore accurate
i'm sure i was fine probably
actually i don't know anymore i really don't have many memories
oh yeah same i think now that i think about it
hope she's doing well too
aw that's fucked actually
yeah i think at like 8-12 it's impossible to have morals
maybe that's my new thing, i could be kid racist
it balances out
in one hand, the kid didn't deserve it
in the other hand, it was a kid, which arguably don't have a soul
you'd never get tricked by gacha, would you
honkai to cherry: you're so mature for your age
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> i would still play if only mihoyo
one would say i have an obsessive relationship with honkai but at this point it's an obsessive relationship with myself and honkai is just the catalyst
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> i was really actually the victim
just like me with honkai
hmmm i guess, in a way
they were only really that mean cause they deserved it
you underestimate how narcissists can move the story around and force themselves not to think about stuff
<a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
more like hopefully
people who are so awful to other people are just deeply, deeply insecure
not that i'm saying that you shouldn't be pissed about them or w/e, of course you should, fuck em
i mean exactly, you know how rich kids are, mostly miserable <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
most of the times they aren't well too, if you were the bully you prob weren't having a great time
i don't think the bullies are alright either <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
whoa
i don't remember much about it
i think my elementary school was fine, probably
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
i am legitimately sorry for them though, that shit sticks with you
can't blame them, powercrept by griseo <:smoge:959781798181736478>
that is abuse
immature is the default
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it's school
the people in one of my class are different from the others, the longer you go, the lonelier it gets
school is very different from college
that sounds good
chainsaw man book club
what kinda event can i even start <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
my college is too small for actual events
do i join a friend group that already exists? try to infiltrate the newer classes like a weirdo from 5th year of a course that's 3 years long
so how do i even start from the beginning
but now they're all gone, either quit or finish already
feels kinda hopeless, i made a bunch of friends and that enabled me to join some friend groups when i first entered
here is pretty small aswell
the new people are entering the new classes
so they already have friend groups
none of the people who are in my class are new people
but then i realised that
i was kinda hype for this semester since new people join and i could make new friends
i actually was crying over that recently
what the fuck is the scardi set
man what even is honkai nowadays
1 misclick = i lose 1 friend
this is discord permadeath mode
i'm not a pussy
even if by accident
i won't know how to unblock
so if i block someone
i installed the one plugin that removes people you block that eli recommended
yeah, for now <:GWsetmyxPeepoEvil:405337570952740864>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> dehya sucks
like the most they do is
feel like outside of like our close knit circle, people really aren't much negative towards mihoyo
is it all they see? i guess i don't know the life of a gsr gamer
i'm going with you being gaslit, the spiciest character relationship mihoyo made after honkai was ayaka having a crush on the traveller
like even if it's negative there's no way you can argue your way out of it
i think you need to be in deep copium if you're mad about comparisons
is it a good thing? are you happy that they are comparing? do you want them to not?
what even
what the fuck their position is
and like i have no fucking clue
that isn't even the funny part tho, cause then there are memes like this
<a:smoge:844083079952990208>
the abyss is the same
truly, the UI is really a breath of fresh air
and then some people are complaining that it's too similar
and then some of them are mad cause it isn't that similar but it should be
like there's a group of people who are complaining that people are comparing gsr to genshin
i feel like i'm going insane looking at it
have y'all looked at gsr reddit
please, herring was my father, just call me red
yes my name is red
hmmm
so if some happen around me, i give more trouble to the detective
maybe i should start planning some murders
i should name myself something like knai v. bearer just in case
the ones that have names like sawit had a really funny opportunity when choosing their name and they went for it
every ace attorney character is trans
unless you wanna gather all apho mob into one fight
is meaningless
actually making the gather stronger, as in it gathers more
but like
the only way to have make it stronger is to make similar gather but easier to proc
it's impossible to have a better gather than HoS pillar
i mean
you don't use it often
yeah but
mpe team, i mean
hmmm i'm not sure, i feel like MPE will have easier time gathering
what are the options
your score doesn't decrease that much, just your hairline
feel like it's the type of boss you just suffer more and more with grouping the more off-meta you go
hmmm yeah i'm not too sure then, i assume so
wait, MA HOMU or the bad one?
p much
i'm hooked
okay i finished reading the new chapter of ichinose, i'm caught up
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i wouldn't know if anyone else also didn't came the first few classes
i mean maybe
so i'll have to hope he actually has material from past classes
unorganised one
the professor is also a really uh
<a:NervousSweat:765639934555324486>
oh god that's a lot of code
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
and i missed the first two
it's the third class of this discipline of this semester
i have nothing
<a:NervousSweat:765639934555324486>
waiting for the class to start
have code made on their screen
all the other students
do mine next
maybe better as a 2 emote combo <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
LMFAO that's a good emote
:peepositcopium:
i'll be fine, probably
so what did i miss
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
so i'm going to show up on the third class of that discipline on the semester like
it's going to be fun, i missed the first 2
now i'm going to sleep cause i have classes early tomorrow
i don't need someone that cares just as much to tell me to come back
the reason i left is because mihoyo doesn't care about my opinion or my view on the game
it makes me pissed off
when your position is that i don't deserve to have the content that makes me happy
don't fucking ask me to come back to honkai
so here i am, getting fucked
you said exactly what i said though, not only do you dislike MA, you think the opinion is objectively wrong and that it should be removed and for everyone who enjoys it to get fucked
i have friends who are abyss balders too, and even though i don't care about abyss, i would be upset if they removed abyss and the thing that made them happy in the game
because i care about the people who like that content and would be sad if they left
the difference between us is that i don't want the content i dislike to be gone
if you want a diverse community, youll have to accept content that isn't to your tastes, sometimes
but then you can't complain about second class player quitting over getting shit over
and sure, you can argue that it was an objectively bad gamemode and everyone who enjoyed it didn't deserve to be catered towards
how can you even argue that the gamemode isn't gone when it's bleeding players like theres no tomorrow and  no one new is joining
so many of my friends, a lot of them mainly MA players, quit over the changes
celine, theo, ft, skype, lux, jiayou, kaizo, atmoer, doug
the community isn't there anymore
you can't argue that droves of people don't care about 2s ma or quit over it
it's clear it's not there anymore
but if you look at the size of the community
about how it's technically still there
like you can go on and on
about 1-5% of the community it had before
like
how many
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
when your suggestions are to remove the content that they like
about people you enjoy leaving the game
you literally can't complain
kith
the only way to play honkai competitively is to drown yourself in copium
that's true
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
<:smoge:959781798181736478>
i'll come back to honkai when they bring back 2s MA
my parents say the same thing
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm not reinstalling honkai
fuck no
hmmm
she's an s-rank and i have her 3s so i'm whale right
i have 3s ft
(kith whale card)
when do i get my kwc?
orv
what's that
god i wish
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
yeah now you know more about words
that's funny
oh banana is a fruit in portuguese
okay baban might be an incel about sex stuff but at least he isn't pro eugenics
yeah that has never gone wrong
uh
it's a national treasure
yeah the hbomberman aquaman clip
i don't remember exactly but it was so fucking funny he's so stupid
i remember when ben shapiro went like we should make [certain crime] illegal
those are illegal
what
better call jerma
or else i wouldn't say it
that is what i think
yeah
i can tell you none of my actions are bound by law
but a good amount yeah
i wouldn't say most
i'd be worried
that feels like some law shit
you can tell by how there isn't <a:ripBozo:1015579412432961566> and anime boys overlayed
switch?
what is three houses on?
i'm in shock
but it's to such a degree that i can't even be mad about it
to a point it'd be upsetting
the way it's not taken seriously in engage it's like
i mean i'm actually so down for something like that taken seriously
that's an interesting selling point
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it's bad
yeah no
and then i watched and
i saw some people complaining that it was bad and i was like, no it's just anime, it's just like that
i do thoroughly hate the story of engage but my issue ain't even with that
yeah i heard about that, maybe the other ones are better about it
and upbeat
is very happy go lucky
when everything outside of the part where your friends get cold blooded murdered
but just the whole vibe of the story feels really weird
i mean to a point i kinda get it
one of them did
and then the devs are like wtf people would let characters die and not come back?
it's an anime game about having the option of people dying and not coming back
it's so fucking weird
and you're like you murdered my best friends
and she's just like omigosh you're really the dragon??? uwu
and later the boss joins your party
and like he lost 3 characters to one boss
i'm watching a streamer play engage
it's such a weird vibe
so every choice you make is permanent
yeah ironman run is permadeath + no rewind
people fucking die
and then when you actually play the game
people hugging and having fun and talking and chilling
cause like you'll have all the story chapters which all upbeat right
it feels like you're never actually supposed to let anyone die
it just breaks the game
like the one ironman run i was watching on stream
fire emblem is such a deeply weird game i kinda vibe with it now
aster is the only person here safe of sin
LMFAO
same actually
i changed my mind already
actually we shouldn't
we should make a tier list of people in wfp
i'm definitely not normal but i appreciate that you thinks it looks that way
i honestly will take that as such a big compliment, you have no idea
i need it
what plugin do you use in better discord to stop the bullshit
yo eli
same
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> you like sex?
baban take
some gasses are lighter than some liquids*
god i wish these 2 messages were replies to the same thing
guys fucking chill with the death threats
it's pretty bad cause my mind works in memes
it's been twice now that i wanna send a meme as an answer and i couldn't find it for the life of me
fair me neither, i wanna start saving memes
goodwill?
no i'm not upset i'm interested
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
you call it tree instead of regisvine?
what's with you and only having memes that are tainted and obfuscated
cherry
you can also use 3 set in pgr if you aren't a coward
not far from the truth
it's terf island
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
wait no
same
all 3 of you
you can send me message with takes and reactions and i'll interact with you if you're reading csm
keep me updated
<a:yukiexcited:904883819960754256>
aw i can't huexcite anymore
<a:CSMBongoPochita:756752095654182962>
guess
<@416445660443967491> this is a reminder for me to read it later
this works?
don't get me wrong tho, it should be
i know in brazil it isn't illegal inherently
i guess it'd depend on the country
i think the cameras can be legal if you position them in a way where you can only see certain parts of the bathroom
yeah that feels illegal
ayyy shitting and vaping with the homies
ayyyy shitting with the homies
my sister doesn't even need glasses
and the end result would be clearer than me with no glasses
i could hold the lenses with greasy hands
i just get used to the dirt
call me daredevil
yeah LMFAO
i lose my glasses, i have to orientate myself through sounds
yeah you're lucky then
i would break open my forehead on a wall
yeah i don't get that
blind as a bat
haven't taken my glasses off since i was 7
unironically true though
like i love tet but you see how often i shit on her tastes, cause they suck
i mean i feel like a lot of people shit on heki because it sounds like the fun thing to do, i just shit on people when they have shit opinions
keilopilled
yes only ranking up gives atk
nothing you can do about it, really
i mean that one wasn't your fault, you're just a baby
tehee
the huniepop incident made one toddle to history homework, another toddler go to school
oh let's fucking go
yugiohs?
i'm not even joking
i'm telling you if she touched grass for 0.6 seconds she'd be 300% better
do you wanna be like her
look at heki
be better than heki
yes please go
i pause the yt video then play the song
i've been listening every time you post
L
i'm better now
danganronpa era keilo would've googled
i'm so glad i don't know who that is
you're just balancing it out then? like over here we have people that treat sexual stuff as normal if open on a generally positive way, meanwhile your crush is sexless bitchless, so you just end up in a mid point as an incel
i see
and honestly i thank her for it
only cherry knows and won't share
look i get it but your standards don't need to be so low
really low bar
大丈夫
it's daijobu
oh yeah i learned that
is it 丈
there's no way it's a random katakana
what the fuck is that
literally can't recognise the second character for hte life of me
i'm sure heki is normal outside of here
yeah this server brings the worst out of people
like actually
can you fucking imagine tet
which is provable by how i get annoyed very quick now, in a timespan of a few hours
i would get annoyed very quick if we were immortal together
i'm just kidding i like you two
nevermind i don't wanna be immortal anymore
oh god
i'm different
nah i'm immortal
you could too
i mean you don't know that
isn't that everyone
please heki
not the racist arc
no this is an intervention
you need therapy
i'm more obsessed with chainsaw man in public than you are with whatever the fuck you have
you really aren't though, not in public
i just noticed i stopped reading heki messages since they weren't making sense
you sound more obsessed with calling out others about playing hentai games than the others are obsessed with hentai games
do you see kids outside and go <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> those parents had sex
you know that sex is a normal part of life right
look i don't even play that many porn games but it isn't that big of a deal
ba you obsessed weirdos for playing some hentai games ban and he whatever the fuck heki's doing ki
who do i side with
it's really hard when 2 people with awful takes are fighting
touch some grass
please
heki i've never meant this more than when i'm saying it now
uhhhh probably working some coding job while doing some random projects in the side
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
i am in 3 hours
go do your homework
11, 17, you're a toddler
lmfao fucking with you by saying i like light yellow instead of pastel yellow
that makes sense
oh you're a baby
baban how old are you again
forget about it, she's just heki pilled
that's funny now we don't know which command works
owo meaning tantric
it's tantric
owo translate tantric
you can't just string words together
heki it's been 5 messages since i actually understood something you're saying
yeah i don't get what's the big deal about playing games with sexual content in them <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i mean yeah, it's setup
i can what
yes but you soft pinging me when talking about porn addiction isn't attention
<a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
stop fucking saying furry so often
but the animation plays while paused
and you can't pick it up while it's in that animation
sp pack has a drop animation
morale booster
have you tried pausing
<:CSMPingtsiSmug:815523197436559390>
like someone said people do
and now you're doing in the last hour between abyss close and weekly reset
<:hug:816396379215757332>
<:crying:757445037402619974>
no one pays attention to me
<:crying:757445037402619974>
it's coming real soon i bet!
uh
e-early?
soon right guys
so that i can have xtal to pull on valk when mihoyo brings back 2s MA
do mine next
sheeeeesh
it's furry weeb
yo hak go check <#999758950687842354>
everyone <a:swipeboobahic:940613030968963122> ?
what the fuck happened with this patch
gresham was fucking right
<a:alert:853952040652243004> HUNIEPOP PLAYER DETECTED <a:alert:853952040652243004>
only embezzled money
they didn't bot tho
i can relate
than to stop playing the funny miku game
would rather go to prison
priorities
is the bot good tho
and then they didn't try to improve their score so they could be topped by me
was when magery was one spot below me
the only agreement i've had in MA
that's weird
can't be fucked to use it
i have like 100 condensed resin
and look at me now
i think even i used some xtal on resin refill on genshin
remember when whales max resin refill
that's day1 genshin strats
that's funny
lmfao
this is nuts though, that's definitely on the higher end
yeah honkai ceiling isn't that high
honk is like 2k per patch
how often is there an event
that sounds unironically on the cheaper side for gacha
3k per patch for t1?
you can also spend $30 on the next genshin banner for an unforgettable experience
to be fair
that's really cheap
like indie game, there's a lot you pay 5-15 bucks for 5-20 hours of gameplay
even outside of piracy it's really cheap
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
with 1/5th i would spend in a honkai patch
i bought a year subscription
like i'm playing runescape right now
styx is pretty chill
you could probably just ask
gaming outside of gacha is very cheap
it can look less expensive
if you compare with other hobby tho
unironically tho, compare to a lot of game it's nuts
i've trained for it from osu
but apparently it's true
like i always thought people complaining about hand hurting playing SW was a meme
hand stamina is just something you build up
<:hug:816396379215757332>
so if they're getting into that, it could be fun for a few weeks
or at all
that don't cost nearly as much
i mean there's plenty of unofficial wow server
no thank you
but having to pay fucking insane amount upfront + subscription
like i could afford monthly subscription
it's the one reason i won't play wow
more like every wow expansion i imagine
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
so he just bought the game
isn't that baseline necessary to actually play
more bullets?
what can you even top up in destiny?
i know i did
if you can afford it, and you know what you're getting into, then go for it
then going 10% of the way there ain't gonna do much
and if you can't afford that mark
is insane
it's just that how much you need to spend on gacha to make you happy
but i'm serious, i'm not talking about that you shouldn't spend money on things that make you happy
i have more faith in you than in heki
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
stop spending in gacha y'all
if thats all you can afford, then you can't afford it
that shit is going to get you nothing
top up 30 dollars for xtal to use on a random banner
but like for gacha stuff
go for it
i mean sure if you're going for a guaranteed thing you can afford
unless you spend it in bp or monthly
30 dollars does fucking nothing in honkai
it's not gonna make the difference you think it will
then don't even bother with topping up 30 dollars
if you can't afford to spend that much
is more like
it's not supposed to make you feel like you should whale more
when i go x amount isn't even whaling
i mean you shouldn't
i mean yeah
i feel like a caveman
it does make it easier to think and type though
same i'll also place the blame on ruby
less than $150 a patch is small spending
heki i get it but spending $30 is not whaling for honkai
i'm surprised
that's kinda crazy
and not rl2
trio boss make nirv look like it's actually a bracket
also jesus
i didn't learn english formally but unfortunately i have about 30 iq
i'm going on like linearly decline
i think my english has been getting worse each day
i was a baby bird once
i did
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
punished for reading when half of the stuff is wrong
imagine reading
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> just talk about stuff you wanna talk about
you can also ignore it if you want to
only if you want to
so people like messing with him
phi is a sub
again, skill issue
i used a banger as my alarm for a year and it still slaps
skill issue
to be a snom waving a trans flag
snompilled
discord dedicated to this funny little guy
snomcord is so fucking funny to me
yeah i'd just assume they're ready to argue
it's not positive that's for sure
you win
<:sip:617444162098298892>
<a:sylveon:617443989502558248>
i have some sylveon emotes from the ariana grande server
<a:sylveonpink:831325409790132245>
i should join pokemon servers
join the ariana grande discord
<a:alert:739695407101378660>
i guess i mostly joined for emotes
i left 2 servers and that's it <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i think i'll cull some honkai servers i'm in
nice
i would've gotten warned by sucking up sausages
i'll get banned eventually
that's not what i meant
they've been asking for 7 years
can anyone answer the poor soul about if honkai is still in beta or not
eli's name is white for me there
<@416445660443967491> did you leave wfp?
who
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
genshin players
i always read it as mthreegan
tet pilled
what's that cutoff line
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
<:meditate:1054894002920509581>
besides stuff that released after i quit
uh
<:meditate:1054894002920509581>
ask me any question about the dead gamemode
it is filled with information only i care about
my mind is enormous
so from .40% -> .50%
i'd expect a drop of 20% on the last few hours of the day
i mean like i said
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i mean yea but i thought it'd follow a similar rate for everyone
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
that's 50% decrease
but when you're t10
which doesn't sound like a lot
i unironically dropped like 4-5 spots
really?
but everyone in NA plays between 0:00 and 4:00 on sunday
guy again i don't mean to make you feel bad
what even is the point to cheat
honestly i can't even blame him
well, uh, maybe besides sona
as far as i can tell, there's not much issue in NA like that
it surprised me that he could tell and that it was happening apparently so much in EU
that time was fucking crazy LMFAO i can't believe we went through that
back when hacking was a big issue
i've heard fragile talking about how he can tell some EU player use some light hacking
but i was malding at sidestage
and i went teehee i forgot to snipe
my score end up like 21300
i've done that before, i lied tho
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
forget to snipe and retain
never fucking mind
how can you go even lower than that
we've had actual beat boss to retain lobby in nirv
i honestly can't even imagine, NA is so bad already
do you wanna talk about it
eli
<@370438895965306882> can do my dailies since i did all the hard work <:wot:998941267041996862>
oh i misreaad that question
cause they suck
pretty nuts
7.8% saves like 10 sp on ult and 2 sp on neb active
owo math 25 * 0.078
owo math 125 * 0.078
i mean
that shit i don't think i can give myself hope
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
the only doomerpilled opinion i hold is about climate stuff
they'll try to take our rights away, and it's hard to not let them, but we won't let them
that is to say though, it isn't helpful to have no hope, and it also isn't true to reality
i wish tho
if you do notice conservatives saying that a lot of progressives are being paid off or w/e, that's also projection, they just assume we do cause they're also getting it
literally 0 beliefs, a shell of a person, just puking out whatever profits him
like multiple sources have repeatedly said that he'll just say anything for money
tucker carlson is the baby of having no spine
and they just assume we wanna do the same thing
it's because that's exactly their plan
like anytime you notice them bringing up oh it's a slippery slope, you just want x and then y and then z
it's pathetic, and they often project it onto others
they just literally don't have the guts to actually speak about their belief
like you think a bunch of them wouldn't put slavery back up if they had the chance?
it's only a matter of time
then they won't have the spine to actually go against it
when the overwhelming majority are pro-trans
the thing about conservatives is that they have no spine
i mean that is true only to some degree
they really like to make themselves heard so they sound like they're a bunch of people when they actually really really aren't <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and it's coming from a very loud minority
but the pushback only speaks for how big the progress has been
it's true that the pushback is really loud right now
there is a quote i like
first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win
but it's like lumi said
i mean yeah, a recent turn has pushed out some really bad laws
but taking as a general rule, not overwhelmingly, no
and sometimes we do take steps back, sure
yeah, that's how the opposition tries to make you feel like
right now, in the US, it's the majority opinion
but you look at general acceptance from the population, and it's linear increase rising
the pushback is really loud right now
like for trans issues, as an example
i feel like we kinda do
i dunno, are you sure?
we'll just force it to
it often hasn't in the past
it doesn't have to
and you can make a lot of impact on the individual, which while not long lasting, it's still important
but individually, not necessarily
i just think you gotta be hopeful that things can change, societally it's hard and takes a lot of time
that you see it, and others see it
i mean yeah, but that's progress, isn't it
individually? not really
i mean societally, sure
hmmm maybe i just turbo misread it
i think the short way i'd phrase is that, i think that a quote like that shouldn't be something you know that makes you unhopeful, but something that because you know it gives you hope
hmmm i think i can understand, though i can't thoroughly relate. i can relate to ideas similar to that when the subject is not a woman, like i've been hurt by what a man is supposed to be, too. i mean i'm not a man but idk maybe i'd be less fucked up in the head if when i thought i was it wasn't that painful

i do think that taking that quote to mean that there is no way for a relationship between a man and a woman to be set outside of those expectations is a good way to take it, though. i think that wasn't the purpose of it, and if you take it as that, then it's a deeply unhelpful quote

this isn't my biggest criticism of looking at it through that lens, but if you take it to mean that way, it does look like the man in that situation is the one that benefits, somehow. and while that might be true under some, or even most, situations, i don't think that's inherent. the chains of patriarchy bound men the same way as it does women, even if the place you're bound to is, socially, supposed to have a higher value. you're still controlled by those male fantasies as a man, just in a different way. i don't think the way i'd interpret the quote would give that interpretation, and i also don't think that's what she means

my actual bigger criticism is that the result of looking at that position through that lens is a defeatist one, for you are and will ever be unable to have an equal relationship to a man because of societal influences. and while that might be true to some degree, i don't think it's a good position to hold to an absolute degree. i do think that things can change, that people, individually, can move, if slowly, from those chains, and that that can move those societal tendencies eventually

and i do think that ends up touching a core belief, that that people can change, no matter how deeply set those beliefs are, and that societies can change. to me, that's a really important belief, i wouldn't do a lot of stuff i do if i didn't believe in it
or do you want me to make it shorter
do you want to read it
to that
i have a 380 word answer
okay tet
homestuck.....
oh okay i'll go with whatever you prefer, chrom i assume
let's go
wait so are you he/him now citrine?
so you're winning
most gacha don't make it to 25
but i don't think it's fair to speak about other experience
if you're speaking specifically for your experience then i can't really deny it
i dunno, i think that is fair to apply to systems but individually it isn't guaranteed
as long as you ignore reality that 60% of cishet men are very disappointing
hmmm, i guess i see what you mean? i dunno tho, i'm sure it's possible
i don't think that's inherent tho

are those things supposed to be different
i guess i could also not give a fuck if someone comes and label police me
i mean i could use the ace label if no one comes and label police me, it's not like i'm 100% all the time not up for sex
can't relate
i get horny some times but like
idk i don't think i'm ace i think i'm just weird <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i don't think i've ever <a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078> while actually being horny
i think every time i've acted really horny was because i thought it'd be a funny response if i did
this is how i feel every time y'all keep making jokes about getting railed
i'm always surprised by how horny normal people are
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
gotta get fucked once to learn the lesson
so much about MA feels turbo outdated <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i've been fucked by that before
ely, senti, susannah
there's 3
good news
i think i personally should have beaten kevin
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
as a fun thing
they just used irl tweet as stand in for the people of earth
i mean he got weakened by the will of the people in-universe, no? like everyone from hi3 earth
oh the card is very pretty too
what else are you supposed to do with ocs
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and now he has to fight as s0 HRT vs 3s HRT
asking for AE replacement cause he was fighting as s0 vs s2
i really don't understand the joke, if anything isn't kith the one who likes whales?
that's a really cute edit actually, i really like it
the only people who still play it either
1. like abyss so much that they want to play more abyss, even if it's worse
2. miss real MA so they drown themselves in cope that it's not that bad
it is, it's just worse more annoying abyss
yes please
and by that i mean like you'll go from 10% -> 12%
unironically you'll drop like 20% of your position in the last 2 hours of the week
everyone leaves it for last second
literally no one cares
they killed the gamemode
i was literally the only non-9s player left that cared about MA
heki
to break off tie
mostly i did MA pretty early
i mean as far as things go
yeah just give it some time
i still haven't decided if i really am going to do abyss orn ot
no, because 10 minutes before closing
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
not because i cared, but because i really really didn't care
i've sniped a ton before quitting
all of NA plays between abyss close and daily reset on sunday
probably not
losing a few hours of progress from a creeper is unironically enough stakes to actually pump my adrenaline up
i think i've been more scared in the past playing minecraft than actually playing some horror game
i find it hard to take it seriously
the type where you run into a wall and it's not actually a wall
about 50% of the paths are hidden paths
that's about it
i'm talking about william and sly
i thought it was your favorite game
what
i kinda vibe with it but
jesus what even is this game, cherry
that's the first time it happened
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
this bp kinda stacked, no reruns
actually i wasn't really
sheeesh i was right
is it supposed to be in english?
i vibe with it
kinda cringe tho
i don't understand her
it's in there
that's actually really cute
that's the description from william and sly
This is probably my best game to date. I wanted to make something more accessible, as most of my flash games have been too complicated for my family to play. :3

I really hope you guys enjoy it, I think it's the most effort I've put in to anything. A big thanks to everyone who helped me test, and Tom and NG for the sponsorship!

As always, leave a comment! I love reading them.

EDIT: The game has version detection, but YOU NEED FLASH 10 to play it. If you have trouble loading the game, please send me a PM with the details.

EDIT: Because nearly everyone is saying they can't figure out the boss's pattern, I've made a slight change that should make it more obvious. Once the game update is approved I'll let you guys know and you can try again with the new pattern. *Alright it's up now*
have you checked tho
unless you have 1tb to spare
i would recommend not downloading the ultimate version
there we go, this is the one
but most flash game should be there
i don't know if the link i sent is the big one though
a software you can use to play p much every flash game ever made
i know there's a very thorough archive or flash games
i should do more research before just sending a random link LMFAO
wait actually
and kids won't be able to experience it
it's sad that it's harder though
yea you can
i mean
and those are the ones they rebuilt into html5
they only have 1/10th of the games they used to
you look on shit like neopets
flash is gone gone
flash games don't even exist anymore
you play gacha or gacha in roblox
cause they're right, what even is there for mobile player
and that's fucking scary
like aster the other day went i mean i'd love to play other stuff but what even mobile isn't gacha
and all mobile game are so money hungry
it's kinda worrying that mobile is how most people play game
unironically tho
this shit fucks with my brain, imagine if i was a toddler
there's no way
like it must fuck with child brain right
yeah this is actually so scary
will never understand it
stockholm syndrome
i hate it now but what if i don't in the future
LMAO that's pretty funny
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
valk for free that's a deal, i'll take 5
i can't just s0 now
and went i meeeeean i already kinda invested into it
people pulled 2s hrt
sunk cost fallacy
trio just captivate competitive community more maybe?
HoH made way more money didn't it
that's surprising
really?
HoH2
keeb <:pogg:1035066559351226388>
did we get 6.5 bp yet?
alright ty
what's her official name?
there's literally nothing about her in the patch notes
also kiana elf released this patch, right? 6.4?
or husk - nihilus?
is it husk: nihilus
what's the naming scheme of the husks again
i don't know half of new content name
anyone wanna help me fill in the patch history spreadsheet?
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
it is what they've been eating
that makes sense actually
you're a mom now
and i don't like that
i know some trial card stack and some don't
that's interesting
the 23x2 affix?
if it was anyone else i'd say name it a slur but it's heki and i know she would do it
i picked a lot of corn cause i thought it'd be funny
i dunno if it's an accurate result though
same
why is there so many corn
that's why i liked eeyore
what about the miserable kids
not very relatable, kid's show
which i guess is funny when i put it into words
i think as a kid i didn't like how all of them were happy
i picked her as my favorite character too
you hate her cause she's like you and you hate yourself
and they have an option for stupid people
i was going to complain about picking a moriso song or whatever the fuck
see, this quiz understands me
what's an 1.0? A-rank?
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> like honkai?
they give you ranks in the us?
tf you mean college score
what the fuck is a gpa
i've never done a quiz that i found so deeply unrelatable
i give up on the bimbo quiz
this quiz fucking sucks
yeah?
i can't understand the first question
who's taking the quiz with me
fine
you're also too self aware
no you're too self aware
see
heki's a bimbo
it's different
tet that isn't anti intellectualism, that's just being stupid
i hate that it's true
and you were like just crit harder, you can do it
i was like then you find out you can crit
i thought you were bming me
tet i didn't even know there was a question
i was supposed to answer that?
wait what
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> i get to press B again
BKE makes you kill yourself while playing
DA actively kills you off of boredom
DA looks awesome
PE is definitely the best dudu, not even close
oh.
and you'll go
you'll get your first actual lucky run
and then after 200 tries
you'll play for like 30 mins and go oh it isn't that inconsistent, i can live with this
like you really only understand how bad the BKE crit balding is when you get lucky
fucking ptsd from dealing ice damage from it
that's the thing i was complaining about
you spend a few weeks away from her and you go huh i really miss playing her, i'd be down for another BKE boss
the worst part is that you don't really accept how bad it is until you're actually playing her
and then you're stuck drifting around
and she fucking dashes out to the side like a schizo
you are looking at the enemy, you press burst, hold forward
her burst animation is so inconsistent, you need to see the future to know what direction you're supposed to press to actually go into the enemy
she moves like a senile dog on ice skates
the crit balding is awful
everything besides how cool she looks and how pretty she is is just so bad
even to the same level
i don't think there's any valk i dislike playing more than BKE
i'm talking about BKE in specific
it works really well, too
so if you dissociate hard enough you almost don't want to kill yourself while playing her
they make the most cringe and badly designed valk look really cool and really pretty
yeah they need to balance it out
we need to do something about the amount of death threats in this chat
heki
<a:danse:1004047242493186179>
sorry
i don't save stuff
no
i'm stuck
<:pepeStepbro:1078161663817162803>
i'm glad i have you to tell me what i want
okay
hmmm
sure actually
maybe i just need to have my standards get beat out of me
i'm just watching a streamer play engage
i don't know anything about fire emblem
no one else seems to mind tho
i really don't like it LMAO
hmmmm ok
aw just like the voices in my head
is it just me? it's not just me
looks like shit, right?
the main character from fire emblem engage
can someone sanity check me
get owned
lmfao money diff'd
were you gonna go like pyro these balls?
i was waiting for the punchline
i'm interested
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
is it a cipher
lumi i have no clue if those @s are on purpose or not
that ain't competitive either i'm afraid
i'm unable to care about non-competitive stuff over competitive stuff
i still don't
no i don't mean like i wish i cared about it back then
i just wanted her cause she would fit way too well with hu tao team i run
<a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
i wish i cared about stuff like that
if i was still playing
that was unironically going to be me with yelan
heki, take it away
not with that attitude
i can't even login
and then it's really stupid
they just design valk that need it
but when they release elf with force qte
i think the idea of force qte is really interesting
i dislike force qte
i think i'm fine with it
force qte is pretty good for HoT
i guess kiana don't have force qte
is klein still useful then tho?
cause i dunno if they care
i mean i know what it does, i'm asking if you think mihoyo knows
you think they count kiana as fire + lightning?
cause the next elf should be lightning, right?
the real question is do you want klein
around that should be safe
not guaranteed tho
generally yea
<:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
the <:Mathge:1000550212080771174>'s don't spreadsheet because they're smart, they spreadsheet cause it's easier and more reliable
spreadsheet it out <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
make sure to do your math 3x before actually comitting to spending money in the game
i think i bought out the dorm b-chip bundles when i was starting out
is it for the person i have blocked
my first one was neko's fault, my second one is ruby's fault
all my warns are someone else fault
and i got warned
and then i said something something cyllinder in pants
it got censored
and then i said something something penis
ruby sent <:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
i do have warn right now for censor evading
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
pump those numbers up
which is a bad thing, given that you spend more time there than i do
you have more censor than me
me when i find out that club penguin went offline: (i spent 10 minutes on it making my character 17 years ago)
what kinda memories do you have with it?
it has memories bitch you played that acc for 15 minutes max
i'm not gonna be more toxic
i figured out what to do
i act stupid and when people actually give me advice i don't know what to do
my kryptonite
god damn it
we are so grateful
you could be doing so much right now and you chose to do that
thank you for sharing the news, heki
then maybe
if by html you mean honkai text markup language
in html yea you can
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
me when i'm drinking coffee
Hey, buddy! Check out my Valkyrie [Glock G19]!
combine both and you can have a normal resolution
for long pardo
long can
LMFAO
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
2025 honkai is gonna fill all that space with banners
yeah that doesn't surprise me, i too wouldn't plan for someone playing on an airport tv
i don't think so
i've never had a honkai screenshot fill so much of my screen
do you play on a fucking cinema?
jesus christ
shoulder fetish?
what are the goods
w
yeah
it's actually fucking depressing huh
i'm only actually looking into it now
and aki's permanently going kon
lmao is denji's shirt see through
like the abnner
i thought it was the gacha screen
oh sheeeeesh
did you get her?
is it time to login and pull?
that's so funny
LMFAO
do it
nice
LMFAO
but going from like 20 20 to 23 23 won't do much generally
i mean it depends on what you have before
it doesn't actually make a difference most of the time, you just use it on who you simp for
23/23 affix is just honkai crown
poked
i feel
it was a big issue during one of the assaka
enemies that are time slowed are pushed around slower too, so if you try to group them right after activating tf, you'll get fucked
some enemies, mainly qua enemies, are heavily resistant to immune to time slow
if you let the tf run out and reapply it, then she'll get time slowed all over again and her death animation takes 5-7 business days
so it doesn't reset her time slow status
the trick to getting 917 is to string the tf together
so like, in bella sim battle
and the longer they stay on time fracture, the weaker the time slow will be
enemies will be heavily time slowed
is that once you active time fracture
okay so how time slow works
yea
enemies time slowed being lil shits?
if you try to group enemies while they're time slowed, it won't work well
timing matters
i watch trio gameplay and my eyes fucking glaze over
and i barely touched CN
i haven't touched any of the new valk after CN
no lmao
that's so stupid
i'm still pissed about how they made her 3s rank up be sp stuff just for her main team not need it
i guess hrt is highest prio given how much you use her outside of trio, and that it's p good outside of trio, but i don't think it's that important for trio
is hrt highest prio out of trio?
lmao why you say it like that lumi
this patch
nini did you 3s stuff
but if you're in need of torus, then you're prob not a big enough whale to go all in on rank up
so you'll just keep ranking her up
HoS stamp gonna be in spending and stuff in the future
if you're whale then yea imo
just throw all resource into it so you can eventually get it to 3s
for valk like HoS, you don't even stop at good stopping point
buy both card and buy out one of the valk stamp
for whale you almost always just go all in in card + stamp
60 60 60 70 150 150 150 150
60 120 180 250 400 550 700 850
lol no
do mine next
<:Mathge:1000550212080771174>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
if you buy a stamp then you get to 262, so your math was right
okay fixed <@197871478950068224>, you get 2s from pala bp + buying card
past keilo went i don't need to write it down i'll remember
wait is it 40 for awk for each bp?
252, don't need to buy any stamps
so that's 152 + 100 for card from bp, cost 16 orb
i think it is
from bp
card for awk is 10 stamp?
to figure out values <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
gotta look through all my fucking notes
= 152 from just bp
72 + 40 + 40 for pala bp
for 2s you need 250, you already have 72
rank up are 60 60 60 70
so you have s1 and 12 frags
it's for HoS, yea?
you do kinda have a talent for making things very confusing
sheeeesh though, that is quite nice
before HN
9s nyx still topscore tho, for now
after 7tr, you need nyx ranks to compete
3s tona released before 7tr, so nyx topscored even at s0
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
look at kosma
they can just make the boss drop exactly enough sp that the shill valk needs
you think that shit matters?
it's 3s MA
yea tona
i could also see them doing filler gear in 6.5
next bp cycle HoF + IO
6.7 nyx gear
i could see them doing nyx gear in 6.5
next bp cycle HoF + IO
yeah but they don't care, they ran turg last cycle even though it's as alive as it's ever been
those are all left before hitting paga
4.8 nyx gear
5.0 HoF gear
5.1 MPE gear
5.2 IO + made in abyss gear
like i said, they don't care how useful a stig is to put in bp
yeah, i don't think they'd skip 3 patches directly into slug
slug is 5.2 and paga is 5.3
latest we got is 4.9 zhenyi in
generally mihoyo doesn't care about how useful a stig is when putting it on bp
slug and paga are way too new
sure
actually imo old gear rerun is guaranteed
maybe both
or old gear rerun
okay my bet is either turg
want me to ask chatgpt to predict what's coming?
want me to predict what's coming?
half of them fucking blow
you read like HoR rank up
nowadays like all rank up are at least a small damage increase
a lot of older valk have weird rank up
AKA too i think?
HoV is the same
older valks are like that for some reason
but mostly it's a small benefit
like tank, where you can stand around on the 9 year long intermission
sp/s can be pretty good in niche boss
if you want to optimise further, spred is usually more benefit than sp/s
the iriyaning of eli
Lizard
back to the usual you mean?
okay not that long
it's prob even worse when the valk actually stays around for a sec doing stuff on joint qte
some valks have a long as fuck animation for leaving the field for no reason
yeah the cd doesn't start until valk actually leaves the field
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
lv55 elf
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it does kinda hurt because i wanna reread chainsaw man a thousand times but it doesn't let me
if you have the app tho, all of them first time are free 100%
but some, the middle chapters you can only read once and on mobile app
a bunch of them are free 100%
yes
the newer csm scans are low quality for some reason though
cause it's official platform
for anything that's in manga plus, manga plus will be the best place to read it
takopii fucking broke me, i bawled at the last chapter
my prio list to find stuff is
manga plus -> mangadex -> mangakakalot -> look it up on google
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
only 16 chapters long
go read takopii now, it's short and it's already done
that's crazy lmfao i was going to recommend takopii to tet without even knowing its the same author
i cried like a fucking child from takopii, now i'm def checking ichinose-ke
it's from the same guy?
oh wait wtf
me too actually
cmon i've read more than one manga
no
oh do you want something fucked up to read?
what did you read
LMFAO
it kinda scares me
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
if you kill with ult, you get to die of old age before moving on to the next floor
i can't ask it to make a team for me
aw rip chatgpt doesn't know anything about gen9
chatgpt is onto something
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
genshin version
not bad
actually
i'll try a schedule
it also won't help me make up slurs
are you trying to get me banned
my message got flagged
i asked it to generate insults for me
i'm like haha it's so fun to make shit up oh no i have to read?
given that i don't even read actual real character kit
hmmm yknow it's not the best idea to ask for chatgpt to design character kit
hah that's funny, that's what my partner said as well
i'm just using chatgpt as an 8ball at this point
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
is nyx on bp?
nevermind i'm not as interested anymore
entire character design process
i'll make chatgpt give me a prompt for the ai art of what aria looks like
what was the ai art thing
just use chat gpt
i dunno why they pay character designers over at mihoyo
oh let's go i got it to make a prediction
if you ask what's coming next it answers i dunno
nah need to ask differently
chatgpt made eden beidou
okay i'll try
HoS is sp management simulator
less sp farm
ready to ask what's coming in 6.6
intern at mihoyo got the fucking chat gpt on hand
there's no fucking way
ai-generated
valk release schedule is legit
i mean we thought mihoyo was going to make good choices
oh yeah she was going to get a dk, right? i can't wait for it to happen, i hope she'll be useful!
that was kind of a revival
they released a new valk in 5.8 called 7tr
wdym they revived HoT
as if there's any chance in honkai 2023 that they'd revive an old support instead of releasing a new one when they wanna shill something new
do it pussy
generally stun just fuck you over
but that's the exact same thing as heavy attack already does
like maybe on a boss where you need to stun to stop them from doing something
i don't see stun ever being used
same kit bigger number
she would literally have to be HoS 2.0
i guess i wouldn't be surprised
idk do you see it?
3s MPE top score way too many bosses for s0 player
MPE is busted
i mean don't even need to look at HN
the buffs need to be insane to justify spending more field time
then it's really hard to go back
like when you start to commit into spending less and less time on field with support
it's very hard to improve on it
LMFAO
support with 0 field time was a fucking mistake
as much as i like SA and HB
to replace HoS you need to do SO much it's insane
well, not bad, but additively would be better
but in this case, multiplicatively is a bad thing
impair and phys breach would interact multiplicatively if you had both
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it works the same as impair
that text is just lies
it doesn't
physical breach says it impacts phys res
yes, that is true
just another case of text says one thing and in performance it's different
it does work like impair
HoS ult is p much physical breach
it works the same way as impair, it's just a buff on the valk instead of a debuff on the enemy
physical breach ain't that special
top these up <:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
and you considered resoing your only holmes
wishing well i guess
avg player get 1 newt 1 ppm and there's nothing else to use it on
you can do so little with red reso <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
but, red reso
cause you can have a bunch of uses for torus and there's some really good weapons like neb on exchange
blue reso i kinda understand
<:dogkek:664517636524343344> that's actually pretty good
<:momtao:996073360490504292>
why would anyone reso their only copy of any stig
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
from god damn it why more of it into grabbing it from bp
holmes comeback
from host is why it's independent, which is stupid and inconsistent but <:shrug:877047647511384064>
the independent from thales is the fire damage
the tdm is normal tdm
that's wrong
this is me with you daily
i have one for you too
i hate it
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and then they released bennett
no stig would be so overwhelmingly powerful that they would still be the best option in many cases years later
mihoyo went out of their way to make sure nothing like that would ever happen again
<a:CHADba:945583162052976641> stig piece
and still using it in 2023
imagine pulling a newt on 2016
yeah, i didn't but some players like chy i know have
esc k u
those are the buttons you press to restart
esc k u esc k u esc k u
i know chy did
i didn't
i believe in you
just do it harder
you should try stuff out and try to figure out which inputs you're doing too early or too late
it should be consistent tho, so if you're having issue then you're mistiming inputs
no, i've never done heph with JK
a lil bit
and where you hold movement stick also changes where RC ends up
i think it'd be a combination of micro timing changing where heph sets down the bomb
some people shipped it yea
if you're having issues, it's prob positioning related
looks awful <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i've never done JK on hepha
oh it's JK strats
it should be consistent
is the opener still the same? dodge the bomb twice on RC?
you mean the opener?
won't we all?
deep
<a:ppOverheat:1072675170176729178>
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
i got turbo lucky, i got everything i want in 0 pulls
then go to sleep
heki go drink some water, eat something
but do i want to
to figure it out
you know i could go code it out
maybe my math is fucked up
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
which sounds wrong
for it to push it down to 39, the other 50% would have to be like 20
the avg for 50% of the cases would still be 76
so it can't be that much lower
i think
50% of the cases
cause like the gear box wouldn't matter for about
i wonder by how much
i don't think you can go double
so yeah, avg for that should be 76
normal sp banner is 30?
or 30?
is normal sp banner 50 pity?
wait or do i?
oh wait i don't know avg for 30 pity banner actually
i don't think that's possible
150?
common keilo L
no winning with baban
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
tet stoll all the luck
game is too expensive, avg luck feels like you're getting unlucky
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
that's only $30
one of my pieces for FR was like that
LMFAO
like it's growing
wtf you mean now
i've never and i'd never
look at me, i'd never spend any money in this game
how could you
buying battle pass?
yeah you should have shame eli
you just BKE'd your SN
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
unironically tho, i never pulled on gacha for her and i had 2s3
replace SN with BKE and that's literally every nirv player
allowance <a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
buy 100, get like 3k xtal daily
they should let us stack them
so true bestie
spending what you have on hand more than often will leave you with no money and no gear
you should only whale if you can afford to either reach avg of what you want or guarantee it
like that sucks but honkai is turbo expensive
3 pulls?
30 dollars is what
it's honkai
heki
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
nah i'll believe kith on the state of your acc
sheeeeesh
so just try different set out for what you need
everything that isn't dante TM will feel like shit equally because of the no evade cdr
the true answer is just try it out
no BKE is ice damage valk
whole valk
it also has -60% crit rate
i dunno why you'd need to ask for permission though
i didn't know you were into basketball
but it was fun how it gave us some clues to how they'd work together
crazy how mihoyo had the foresight to add the skill for valks that didn't exist yet
nah it's been there since day 1
like makes any type of damage that can't usually crit be able to crit
no
i unironically think they'll eventually do a valk that makes stuff that doesn't crit usually do
you know if she didn't look like that, i'd prob have called her HK
you can live in RL for the next 6 months
if you have MPE + FR + HoH geared
that's p much every valk tho
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
turns out seele ain't qua
people skip HN waiting for the actual qua of the year
that would be really funny
i mean yeah obviously
cause unless seele is just S-rank version of HN, then she can't really compete
like ruby said, it's hard to even say that it's only band aid answer until herrscher seele
goddamn that's a lot of HN food
oh shit there's bleed v2v
i think bleed HoS + bleed whale + her new boss are guaranteed
well, actually jizo does a lil bit, i wouldn't be surprised if she beat s0 BKE but the fact that she beats 3s BKE is surprising
kosma + bleed HoS + jizo doesn't surprise me that much
whale surprises me
HN sweep
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
is that what's going on
so you make whales pull for a dupe of a set that will only last for 2-3 patches
and then in 2-3 patches release new set for HoS
is to leave it to stack
the turbo shill path
if they are to fix it, then they'll just release a new set for HoS to work with HN
i think they won't nerf the fact that it stacks
what do you want to know

holy fuck that's the funniest string of events i've seen all day
LMFAO
so both
it's genshin
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
well, maybe people did know, i didn't
which technically was -1 -1 0, since there was a way to push cap without 9s HoT but we didn't know that yet
i think my pb was 0 -1 0
those were my 2 measure of how well i was doing
i always cared more about position and how far i was from cap
i'm surprised people care about score though
sheeesh i'm proud
nothing valued is here
no highly esteemed deed is comemmorated here
this is not a place of honor
it should have those nuclear warning around it
and you can immediately be prepared for deep bullshit
you see that one stage
i do like the consistency though
you go play valorant raze, you only get 1 grenade and it only pushes you 50% as far
too bad, this combo only connects if you pay another $100
you go play the new dlc character in guilty gear
imagine that shit in literally every other game
- mihoyo, probably
tbf why are you playing honkai without spending 300 dollars a patch
it's depressing
you don't do less damage, you play a valk without legs
END literally can't do rots without her weapon active
but like
like if she played the same way but had more issue with sp or damage, i wouldn't be that mad
if it was only power level i wouldn't even be that upset at it
i hate that design so much
actually depressing
valk might aswell be 60% of a valk without weapon nowadays
mihoyo do be actively removing functionality from kit just to throw into stig/weapon
her kit tho, i mean maybe
especially since she's getting a pri on release
i don't think sp valk have much issue competing with s0 in terms of stats
even at 0 faith they still go over
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
mihoyo keeps fucking impressing me
and like i have 0 faith
i sound very pessimistic
i keep saying it
nevermind then
she has 32 hitcount shield hp bars
honkai 2025, new HoS weather
i've seen some go oh so there's uses for dupe? that's nice, i pulled to be safe
you misunderstand whales
there should be close to no rng at heph
what boss
i think the value can be compared but they're good in like opposite ways so it's hard to say
dupe turg is prob not a good comparison actually
even still tho i think it's about as much value as having dupe turg or dupe cez B
2p i could see being very strong, MB especially
i think it's a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> overreacting, single piece dupe has about as much value as past support set
yea, the filler isn't that much below that
3 stigs for 60% phys damage for team is not broken imo
yeah, that's not as broken as it sounds like
2p i could see being really strong, especially if B stacks
you make it sound way more op <:dogkek:664517636524343344> it's nice but i'd say it's like only a little better than pulling dupe for affix
idk i don't see a lot of value from M piece alone as dupe
does B stack?
it's good but not broken
beet M is 15%
wdym
by itself
it doesn't look that powerful, +20% phys?
<@416445660443967491> is aladdin m that good
no
what's wrong with them
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
oh that's a funnier one
<:E_RaidenDisgust:882524283136512010>
me when people like grown men instead of children:
7tr + ely TB
i think that one i just ran some bs and didn't have much issue
and it's very long
the active gathers all the enemies in one place
it's good for stall
nah the new one
i ended up doing it without 6s with SoE tho
cause at 6s, a perfect block resets shield
same, i was waiting until i got 6s DK
after that it gets waaaay easier
are the hardest ones
the first and second DK stress test
kakaland? i heard good things about that movie
that's fucked up
but 3p dante is the best set for BKE because of the impair too
which is why you barely pick breach on HoS
though physical breach does interact with it and if you have some impair, then it reaches diminishing return faster on breach
impair is great at ER cause there's no sources
what impair is sick at ER
prob can get away with ely TB filler M
well, it was dirac when ER released, not sure now
dirac i think
i wonder if non-3s HoS is going to mess much with her
not even clear transition properly
jesus christ
cherry elected gender
tet he/him?
huh so you really do sell you being a dumbass well
that's quite pretty
you sleep now so you don't have to sleep later
yes that is the point of sleeping
should've played
L
mine included <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
they should delete everyone's acc that doesn't have ar60 after 2 years
there's a reason magical girl skins are skins
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
but as default
it's literally just a magical girl skin
but the vfx are just too good, damn
though that's a thing i also dislike from base skin
i'm not a turbo fan of how she looks, and i don't like that she's so similar from non-burst to burst mode
the skin looks v v good though
like morbmaid
some of them clash so bad with the skin
it's prob not even that much extra work
all these valks with sick skins and then the weapon active just look awful with it
just do weapon transmogs
god please mihoyo
dunno about desert tho
from i remember tho, you could explore all of sumeru without doing any of the sumeru archon quests
there'll be a lot of small area locked behind world quests
wdym by fully
with my lv20 nahida
i had to reset a lot when i was doing my last abyss
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
just for comfy though, you can just reset until you don't get hit
klee, yoi, razor to some degree
there's a good amount that benefit from it
need poise?
that's just karma
for being a fake catgirl
honestly deserved
yeah mihoyo too
and mihoyo loves money
it does have slightly different vfx
i can say confidently that maybe
tet you gotta understand, i haven't listened to anything genshin in prob like a year
loo? what the hell
wait how are you supposed to pronounce nilou? i pronounce it as nee-low
beta minigame = figure out what's keilo's abbreviation for new valk
ayyyy you got it
she looks like a 15 y/o in an outfit for school carnaval
i don't find her hot
no
it's not an abstract concept
hmmm
not anything nuke, no
but i won't say what it is
if you get it right i'll confirm it
figure it out
i'll be iriya from now on
i'll call her HN
HN?
i'll come up with a new name
she doesn't deserve to carry the torch of VD
ew
oh she's VD
not canon to captainverse though
HB
she's an AU valk but they didn't bother with making the AU
they gave up
she'll prob be a good option but i don't think she'll top score any qua outside of bleed qua boss
most of her output comes from bleed damage
she is actual bleed dps
yeah, susannah isn't a dps that has bleed and synergises with bleed
but at s0, susannah boss will prob be still susannah's
higher rank new seele could prob steal boss from susannah
i think just the spot of bleed phys weather as far as top score goes
but a lot of what susannah does isn't qua boss somehow
qua herrscher just mean she'll steal all qua boss probably
for one, herrscher don't even mean anything
kinda same actually
you take the skips you can in current meta
for new players that can't spend too much xtal, this is a skip
i mean to me this is only for high spender
i disagree
you really think they'd try to make this game genshin?
mihoyo? out of touch with honkai? nah
i'm pretty sure earth is the only pink colony
i mean earth was given to her after she was born, doesn't mean that earth didn't exist beforehand
more than likely pink didn't singlehandedly do all the work in colonising earth, there was probably a colony there already that was just gifted to pink imo
sure; why would she draw it
hmmm i don't buy it
i don't see why pink would draw stuff about before she being born
and even if she did, couldn't that rock be earth?
i mean i believe ya, i just haven't seen it. show?
outscoring nyx tho, that ain't impressive, she sucks at MA
outscoring BKE i dunno why, fucking nuts that she does
susannah is sp though, so her at 3s ain't impressive
those are 9s team scoring better than 9s BKE at jizo and 9s nyx at tona
no
i don't see it
that's a fucking high score though
that one doesn't surprise me
yeah
and then there's some lines of leaving people speechless, which she did literally leave garnet speechless when they met
could be literally stepping out of the position of pink diamond
the line with Stepping out of my hot pink limousine
i could see it being about foreshadowing rose being pink
she didn't really have many friends while being pink
reading the lyrics right now i can't connect much about pink
i mean i'm not saying that it ain't, just that i don't see it
i don't remember that, does that show up in familiar? or like outside
AF nuke
that makes BKE look like she's throwing noodle at jizo
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
jesus christ yeah she really does
i don't see it
but i mean maybe?
hmmm i dunno if i can see that symbolism
she took a ton of Ls but i wouldn't call her existence an L, i love her
i'm a rose defender personally
truly, pink took many Ls
she was definitely malformed since she acted like a child, her peers didn't let her have any responsibilities and her height was different from other diamond
the crater in russia is probably where pink was born, she was prob meant to use all resources from the planet but ended up destroying only that part
yeah there's at least one seaspire
some of them are kindergartens
those are important gem places
i'm pretty sure she was mined out of russia
because she's like 1/4th the height of all other diamonds
that was heavily hinted towards, yeah
so bath prob works for all of them
at the end of the series, the way they initially uncorrupted a lot of the gems was just to all have a bath together
pink/steven are just different cause they're malformed diamonds
bathwater is still just sweat
i do think all 3 of them is some type of sweat that they just decide to excrete in different manner
so that one gem is not a rose quartz, prob still a quartz though
and also had 5-sided top, like steven
and they were uncorrupted
the roses from another episode that show up are the ones unpoofed from the zoo
which is technically a race genocide i think
because they were mad that one of their own shattered pink
the roses at the zoo were manually poofed by yellow and blue
they left and never came back until the events of steven universe though
but because pink's power was missing, it went badly and it corrupted them instead
gems were corrupted on earth because before leaving earth, they used their powers combined to try and poof all gems
there are no corrupted gems outside of earth
yeah but those aren't corrupted
dunno about white though
cause rose was tears, steven is spit, i know yellow is sweat, blue is something similar i'm p sure?
actually it might be different from every diamond
that's not a rose quartz i'm p sure
on episode 1?
but i'm pretty sure it's just sweat
i don't think they uncorrupted any rose quartzes
yeah, mostly what other people say to him
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and now he expects random normal people to pay to use the site
elon bought into it and actually feel like the user is the customer
twitter wants to make the user feel like it's the customer when it's the product, and advertisement are the customer
elon misunderstands deeply the platform
lmao that's funny
i dunno if i like the coat aswell
sheeeesh
well there you go, then
have you tried playing better
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
HoT s-tier
i dunno those zoomer team
what team
<:wokege:966623232918712331> husk?
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
just say it's fps diff and be clueless
<:wokege:966623232918712331> NS
most new valk control p easy
and for those you also need to time switch out if you're switching out after evade
some old valks like LE have awful evade
asap dodge at the start of the fight is just spamming
sometimes it fucks me over but more often it helped
i just trained myself to always be pressing a direction
yeah when doing MA
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
did you get any other dk after SoE?
that sounds v high
my phone is a pc because both have screen and i can type buttons
flamescion box? <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
what if i'm stupid
those stats look right for high atk s0
enemy take more damage is when they get hit
team damage is at skill activation
depends on the buff
my name is keilolao so i've had keilolo, kell, kei, kielo, kelio
i love how people in my clan call me
wdym there's people who play at below 9s?
some other anime released after it which was like ohohoho it's just like madoka! it's a magical girl show that gets dark woooow
i think the theme is cool and it does more than just shock factor
LMFAO that's funny
wait eula hasn't rerun in 11 patches?
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>

make me watch sword art online
you can do worse for pain
i can do the same for honkai, i'll tell you right now i won't last long but i can do it
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i just want you to read it until you know if you like it
and like it's not supposed to be about suffering, i don't want you to force yourself to read it if you don't like it
that ain't that much suffering
fine
hi heki
i guess i did 946 some relationships
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
then i'd be all over it
if there was a habbo MA
i'm not made for those types of games
and when you go and play it, it sucks ass
i think as a concept, club penguin is pretty fun
i mean
did you want to make him play club penguin?
what
preferably read, no promises on how fast i'll get to watching stuff
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
you read chainsaw man, you make me read/watch something
<@483689649727078400> i'm up to trading media
she's optimally programmed to do that
i don't know how it got past any QA at all
her targetting is laughably bad
at grouping
0iq
ely is fucking
if you're up for bald, then ely will p much be always better
3s WE can be less bald for grouping
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
now <@483689649727078400> what can i do to make you read chainsaw man
so i promise there's a mouth breather makima
a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> doxxing just makes it a little faster
because i think it's too late to try and cleanse it of any connections to my irl identity
i've actually been meaning to move away from the name keilo eventually
okay i'm down
what's my punishment
what happens if i promise and there's none
hm
i can't promise that
you can't even imagine part 2
like you see mouth breather aki
you have no idea
part 2
tet
you think that
i'm like very sure you'll both like it and i want someone to talk about whenever a part 2 chapter drops
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
there are some arcs that i would personally name differently but i don't wanna spoil now that i've decided that i want to make tet and cherry read it
so yeah, false advertising
well it's mostly the community that divided the chapters and gave the arc names
technically not
my favorite arc is the one after that
actually idk
but it's more like, if you've not enjoyed it by then
and you won't know until you're at the end of it
oh i won't tell you why the story arc is named bomb arc
arc as in story arc
isn't that right before denji makes him infertile
he doesn't deserve that
poor aki
if you reach into bomb arc and don't rush the entire manga from there then it might not be for you
i think i've read it from the beginning like 3-4 times now
then start again <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
LMFAO i've never seen that
tell me what's the last thing you remember
it's not like honkai where only the chara design is good
the story is like insanely good
you should both read chainsaw man <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
do i?
and i love most of them
that i don't like
i think there's no characters from csm
she's great
that sounds like i'm one upping you, sorry
i love quanxi
that's young kishibe
LMFAO
this is how she's introduced, kinda nsfw
she's turbo gay and on one of the jobs, the thing she asked for was human rights for her girlfriends
she's a cold assassin for hire, all she cares about is her harem of 4 fiend girls
you'd like her
the other one with an eyepatch
how much have you seen of quanxi?
she do be hot though
i wouldn't even say she's a groomer at all
funnily enough she's prob the least groomer
you have no idea
so vague
hot groomer lady in chainsaw man is
makima?
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
amazon prime these balls
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
so they can do more double valk patches and sp valks in honkai
they need to save resources
true
gfdi
skins?
but the fight itself is similar
yeah the stuff you do before the fight is different
but pvp
tft is kinda like the griseo event
i think tf is the furry kink
i made that option for you 2 in specific
<@218762069338619906> <@516591030326525983> now you both better vote on 9

maybe it's a nightmare
go back to sleep
gresham
vote both, fuck it
<:momtao:996073360490504292>
what's the option that would align with your views
9. i spent too much time learning all the jargon from ch33+ and now i need to know what happens (sunk cost fallacy)
or something like that
9. i like the lore but the rest blows
should i add like
okay what option would represent your views?
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
the body is <:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
pick
there's only 8 genders
that's it i'm becoming a conservative
how is this not enough
god fuck y'all i gave you 8 fucking options
fine
isn't that 3?
i was deciding between @/everyone and @/captains

club penguin
<:Weirdge:770384544398180383>
isn't that weirdge
literally no reason just to short term milk more money
why do they want 2 qua valk this year all of a sudden?
yeah that's the awful part
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
club penguin
are they trying to get people to quit
like announce new valk the day after people pull for the old one
do they do this on purpose?
oh holmes doesn't even bleed
holmes HoS?
h
i'm glad i quit
yeah this weather's fucked
it's SS for kosma <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
but that was paga FR with HoS at sushang
oh i misremembered, i remember using FR on phys team
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
just need to bring MPE HoS SI FR
where's my 4 character team
<a:Monka:465018118608125953>
oh shit
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
is just MPE food
bleed weather qua boss
<:peepoBlushy:751806255730917436>
mihoyo is a fucking abusive relationship
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
we're all being thrown under the bus
but it ain't true
like they repeatedly just throw a community under the bus and it feels like we're being thrown under the bus so they can pay attention to another section of the playerbase
competitive player?
- turbo shill getting worse and worse
- skill intensive gameplay going away
- boss design fucking blows
lore enthusiast?
- day 1 new chapter is filled with typos
- translation often lacking
- gameplay elements that integrate with lore are multiple times thrown asunder to make more money
like who is this game for?
this is another thing for my bullet list though
that's funny
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i thought it was like alt universe susannah
wait so it's actually just breaking the rule?
if you ask her nicely
keilo moment
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
pull more
nah it makes cn player mad
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
maybe that's why she grew it out in apho
nah just like a wild change of design LMFAO
it's so much more wide
i mean like you compare that with past mei
it's so puffy
like what is wrong with it
why is her hair like that
honestly
yeah fuck tet <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
sheeeesh
finally they found the way to get out of a3
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
everyone has 9s teams
it's impossible to get out of agony 3
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
game is too pay to win
someone from solstice which went through some rants about how he could easily match styx score if he only had 9s
i thought for sure i'd have some quotes about it
oh we don't have one of those
you just get more out of the stats if you balance it out and put that 50% on elemental instead
like, the first 50% tdm isn't more powerful than the next 50% you put into it
it's about the potential value you would get if you invested that into another stat
but it's not like the absolute value you get from it decreases
dilution is like, you get less benefit from investing further in a stat
it's higher
owo math (1+0.5) * (1+0.5)
if we distribute them equally
it's the same
there u go
owo math (1+0) * (1+1)
wait fuck
owo math (1+0) + (1+1)
if we give it all to total damage, it ends up as
owo math (1 + 1) * (1 + 0)
dumbo
owo math (100% + 100%) * (100% + 0%)
if you give it all to elemental, it ends up as 
(100% + 100%) * (100% + 0%)
say you have 100 points to distribute into elemental and total damage
you can think of you having an amount of points to distribute into different stats
okay so the concept of dilation
is because it's harder to get than others
the reason damage taken is better than others
vaccuum never happens though
then the first would win
i mean in a vaccuum
it depends on what else you already have
yeah i know, i'm just memeing, it's mostly va director to blame
do you think new tigh va will be able to pronounce his own name
okay so now
when people say HoO they mean flamescion, not HoH
you sure you thinking of the right trio
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
if you use them similar amount or phys more, then dudu would be my answer
i'd only go for s1 HoF if you use HoF in specific way more than any phys team
yeah s1 is breach, it's p nice
then i'd go for elf
well i'll reinstate, if you use phys close to the same or more than HoF
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
what about in content that matters
okay
then HoF would be better
if you use fire way more than phys for some reason
it's the big one
yeah
then 3s dudu is way more important than s1 HoF
like if you use phys and fire equally
i mean i guess maybe depending on what teams you have invested and are going to use mostly
lmao
no
avg is like 76
i think you're still below average heki
why is it like htat
with her hair
wtf is wrong
yo
seele and bronya 6.9
it only makes sense
6.9 should be double valk
LMFAO
but also more work
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it lowkey could be more secure than a password manager
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
good
at least make sure you have backups of that spreadsheet
if you're not going to use a password manager
you too, eli
lastpass was already annoying me though, you could only either have pc or mobile
i'm going for bitwarden too
lastpass was one of the big ones, but it had a data breach recently and that's why i'm moving
and 1password is like 3 usd/month
i think bitwarden is free
that's still way better than using a single password though
in the end, for password manager, you just end up having to trust them that they're going to do it right
bitwarden and 1password are the 2 gresham/imy was talking about
than if someone steals your accs and then you have to go around and actually recover each acc
it's way less annoying to set up a password manager now and generate new passwords for your sites
i'm being serious though, take care of your security, even if it's a little annoying
i also have that one, but it's because i downloaded some rpg software to play with fwens
if your cp password is the same as other accounts of yours, anyone can find the breach, get your password, try it on different accounts and ya dun
so i don't need to worry
but my club penguin password was different from everything else
same lmao
<:momtao:996073360490504292>
the only way to be safe is to have a different password for each site
there always will be in the future
and even if there isn't any sites right now which have had their passwords leaked
if you scroll it should say which
and then if they think to try that out in any of the other sites you have an acc for
anyone can look into the breach and see what password you used on that one random site
then your security is fucked
input your email, if it outputs a site where you used the same password as your email
go check how many sites got their password leaked
i'm trying to change that before you get that changed through other means
that shouldn't make you feel secure, that should make you feel dread
that isn't a good thing
i swear to god
tet
y'all are one fucking step away from it
y'all joke about people getting hacked from weird discord servers
in 3 years
i've literally not typed a single password
and that's it
you generate random passwords, tell the password manager to remember it
you literally don't have to make new passwords
my next inquisition is going to force y'all into not getting thoroughly hacked
okay so my last inquisition was making everyone spend resource like AW/AL
<:momtao:996073360490504292>
you don't remember any password but acc still secure
password manager is to solve that
that one is the most believable one
nini of everything everyone ever told me as arguments for why you're actually really old
what happens if the pc stops working
where do you save that spreadsheet?
eli
just = in december lmfao
if you use it you should change all your passwords
lastpass just had a turbo leak
i need to change
last pass kinda blows
anyone use any good password manager?
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
yeah, more attack
🔳
it's a lil 2

<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
that's all valks²
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
that's all valks
i think people can be aro without being ace
i dunno
am i the pronoun holder
they
sorry
nah that would make me feel bad
that makes sense
oh is it a kink?
yeah cherry does
<:crying:757445037402619974>
i don't think i bully people
do i bully people
i think that's a kink
hmm
i think it's still bullying
yeah! do you wanna join?
oh i'm down for hating tet for a while
<a:terigrabhic:709594728039055390>
yeah i'll keilo all over you
it's related to my name
oh i have a solution for that
your roommate lost a key?
do you wanna talk about it
you're so aggressive today
is everything okay?
eli come here
so true
sheeeesh elemental damage taken reduction
zzz is weird for me cause i'm a turbo furry but i don't really like any of the designs
i'm also on zzz maincord

i mean probably
flamescion?

i don't know how miraidon and koraidon are <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i only know the pokemon that's legal to use in competitive, can we please change subjects <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
so now i love it
i thought it was mid but it has carried me so hard so many times
meowscarada my beloved
the tero3 inquisition
but that isn't true
you say that
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
if that was the meaning then it didn't work
assigned milf at cherry
i've never
what the fuck
i can't be happy
now they're doing the cunny bit
see
no one can be happy, everyone has to be miserable like us
we're like crabs here
true can't you buy it with all your luck
sheeesh my premature ejaculation is useful
she looks younger than dudu
she really doesn't look her age still
<a:Monka:465018118608125953>
but it's honkai 2023
i love her and partly because all her suits have sky high skill ceiling
i'm scared about the new hua suit
<a:AA_Gab_Bow:914213000594980964>
tet specifically and only tet
you can have all my luck
i'm happy for you tet
i'm officially evil
<:GWsetmyxPeepoEvil:405337570952740864>
the new mecha one
i am using the weapons that kicked my shit in
gholdengo volcarona fluttermane kingambit
<:GWsetmyxPeepoEvil:405337570952740864>
i'm using a gholdengo team now
i've joined the dark side
stay safe
that's scary holy
<a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
that's more fun than this
can moriso say some more dumb shit
i prefer the honkai drama
damn
70
game is truly only balanced for CN <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
honestly yeah
or MA jizo?
abyss jizo?
wait
me next?
i just saw people pinging eli and i wanted to do it too cause i like eli
<@416445660443967491>
so fight between yourselves
i can give one of you 9s
but that is my natural state of being
i am disappointed at mihoyo, yes
there already were some elemental options that got close to competitive
that doesn't really surprise me actually
<:life:1001518241610485781>
or stay long enough to become moriso
we either retire into theo
not the dick locked emojis
improvement
sheeesh only half?
complaining about community ran with 99% of the users in mind
straight people also talk about cock
or for her
i have news for you
she'd think you're gay?
so if she finds out you're talking with people who talk about cock
?
why would your mom find that weird
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
gresham will you fund my college?
but it matters less and less as you get higher
yeah i think that stuff matters a lot on lower levels of competition
yeah, i guess i can believe it more for very physical activities
well, not believing in talent is a bit harsh, i think it's possible some amount of like genetic bs exists, but it's not like even 1% of what accounts to the results
i don't believe in talent
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
t1 honkai takes ungodly amounts of hours and effort + money
t1 osu takes ungodly amount of hours and effort
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
yeah for me
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and it would be  cheaper than gacha
it could be 5x that price
eli
i think he's trying to get all pokemon
the future is bright
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
2 genshin is almost enough content for 10 mins of daily gameplay
actually, it's probably a great thing if you like genshin
i'm sure it's probably a good thing if you like genshin
sorry carv
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
well, i guess it wasn't much trouble and they didn't make the whole game new
going to the trouble of making a whole new game just for it to be genshin again
like why LMFAO
i don't even have words
i don't need this
it's literally just genshin
genshin
and it's just
but then i see screenshots like this
i feel like i deserve at least one beta access for the time i sunk into this company
of being turbo pissed off that i didn't get into gsr beta
i'm currently on a pendulum
i am interested i think
oh ok
like an enormous butt
did they give makima a huge ass
how do the csm characters play
yeah this is one of the 3s bosses with very big rank scam benefits
<:momtao:996073360490504292>
i think the highest i got was 680
it ain't that bad
🚮
it ain't worth it
i wouldn't bother with increasing the score
it's an annoying bs boss tho
if you bring JK, that's -5 for s0
that's -2 from s0 HoH RC HB
owo math 39720 * 1.2
what's that in normal people numbers
sheeeesh
what even
going to the kindergarten and being surprised when they find children
imagine looking for partners in the fucking genshin community
it was a game destined to be losed
that's turbo fucked up actually
oh god
i remember diluc va causing some drama
are they posting shit?
the va?
what
oh i loved that movie as a kid
where else would she be if not t1
that's definitely a top
dickgirl mobius pfp
do you plan on ever watching or reading it?
are you picking fav character through vibe only
did you watch the anime?
wait
i think you'd love asa
like part 2
<@309634550273933314> are you reading csm
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
is it
prof looked at me weird
okay let me try
actually pay attention to classes?
what am i supposed to do
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
i can't login to runescape
gresham gets me
don't even bother
just take me out man
that i've never done before
3 minute long fight
when i look at a week and i see one of the 3s bosses is a fuckiing
that shit i would fucking rather die
the stuff i actually have ptsd is fucking bs 3s bosses
-1 is comfy
i'm used to -1, -1 is my home
and you may joke, but my best experiences always been trying to match a score when i have the gear and stats and i'm skill issued on a 2s boss
any more and you still blame affix and dorm, that's cope
at most -1 from affix and dorm issue
-4 is skill issue
nah
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
893?
-1s?
<:crying:757445037402619974>
do you not pay attention to what i say
i said earlier i did and why
yeah?
i don't admire heki anymore
aw do i not have it
what even was taihen's advice
oh god
heki doesn't stop
i would just stop saying stuff at one point yknow
like if i was shamed every day for saying dumb shit
i kinda admire heki in a way
were you playing then
like last year that happened was 2019
do you?
...
the valks themselves are fine tho
is turbo stupid
the fact they decided to release those valk in this order in this timeframe
my main issue currently is the shit schedule
i think alone their designs are generally fine and play well
i don't have any problems with any valk individually recently
that's fucking up the most important skill of the elf
it's not even a small typo or anything
<@197871478950068224>
if mihoyo cared 1% they'd actually take it seriously
that shit is the kinda of shit you get sued over
but i don't think it nearly gets to the level of misleading skill desc
i mean cosmetic stuff like that sucks
skill makes enemy take x% more damage, the desc said it boosted team damage by x%
of course not lmao
that kinda shit would get pulls refunded if the game was from a game from a dev who cared
like the thing where ely elf skill desc was just wrong for 2 weeks
VERY bad
i would consider like
some of the stuff like that btw
it's just objectively wrong
yeah
literally wrong
and that's just
that say after valk leaves field, x effect
there's tons of early stigs
what are you, a fucking cop? get lost
during this mode, only some stuff will work idk figure it out
thank you for the info
very clear and specific mihoyo
there are 1.0 stig sets with wrong descriptions
are more often than not misleading or inaccurate
that mechanics and stuff written in honkai
i would actually claim
it takes more effort than testing and the stuff written is wrong half the time
literally who reads
tet
but then after a bit, i talked with eli and tried myself and had no issue
yeah i remember hearing that from before her release
at least that's what i remember
it still sucks but not that much
you can use neb active on her mode
not really actually
nowadays
what's dist
true
yikes
imagine being english
so you know genshin impact
what do you do for a living LMFAO
it's just literally a job at that point LMFAO
it would make me hate myself the same amount
i would rather just work a 9/5
like if you spend 50 hours doing that
how much time did they spend to make those 500 dollars though
i'm interested for the makima and power ngl
LMFAO
tf you mean only 10 i'd kill myself
rerolling is wild to me
and you should leave
then they're done
as soon as you reach end game though
like don't get me wrong, they're great games when you're starting and there's still stuff to do
and then quit
spend no money
i'll play them for 1-2 months
the only gachas i'll be playing are the new mihoyo gachas
lmfao
cause i'm never touching gachas anymore
it's pretty hard to argue to try and do something different
like if anyone look at genshin nowadays
but their new game could always be like that
- not a lot of hard content to do
- boring dailies being the only things left to do after playing for a while
- aesthetics and looks more important than balance
- focus way more on casual player than anything else
when we say being genshin is mostly about stuff like
being genshin is not about being an open world or whatever though
i hear good things about arknights
pick your fav superficial mechanic and play the same game
2028 we're going to have 7 different genshins
what reason do they even have to change it up
it's raking in the money
and like ruby said, can barely blame them
the abyss look the same too
so much of it is just copy paste from genshin it's almost funny
yeah 90 pity with 50/50
it's disappointing LMFAO
it's just another genshin
and then looking at literally anything about it
i got hyped with gsr
yeah but think about it, it wouldn't even be that good lmfao
good cryo off field application would be nice but historically catalyst wielders aren't that
catalyst are generally only good at applying element when on field, and there's not much need of applying cryo if the valk on field is that cryo valk
it wouldn't even be that powerful lmao
it's so weird cause like the way we play right now
my real problem is the lack of competitive content in the game
i mean i don't even mind it personally
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
they got fucking reverse powercreep
look at genshin
one thing they are really good at about is powercreep
yeah like there's a bunch of stuff you can talk shit about mihoyo
you can still promote nirvana on certain weather with 2020 team
but in general honkai is not that bad for it
yeah we do have some pretty bad single examples of powercreep
and AF release didn't really change that, still not worth it to spend xtal on valk if you didn't have her
which is true for most valk
at most people said she wasn't a good investment, too expensive if you didn't get her at release and arguably even if you got her at release
also i don't think anyone ever said BKE is or was dead
don't invest in anything, wait 4 years and then spend your xtal
ice support is in a surprisingly good state
pardo ain't powercrept
yeah i don't doubt you can
i dunno how good that is at ice HoV tho
no SoE then you prob run triple support
no matter how cope you HoR is i'd still go HoR if you have SoE
the more annoying a boss is, the easier it is to retain if you put in the effort
no one tries very hard
ice HoV is a turbo cbt boss
just play better than them
there are some bosses where 2s and 2s1 can be very big
after s2, performance on avg boss doesn't increase that much
2s ain't that big tho
SoE + liu qi at least s2 HoR i'd say retain on avg lobby
you def retain on avg lobby
if you have SoE + liu qi then you can proooob retain
2s HoR isn't that important for HoV
ideally i need more than 0 points for rewards
do mine
cheaper
nini will just start a new one instead
nah it ain't worth it
who's kid
i wonder if i'm still rl
what's going on with honkai
what
is nini quitting?
i'd do it
she's just so flexible and nice to have
and honestly mpe is one of the valks you're investing in sooner or later
eli is probably asking if they should invest on gear for the 2s they already have
i don't remember what 2s1 and 2s2 does tho
i think 2s mpe is pretty solid
i know where i got it from now
oh is that what that is
i think he's a mario 64 fan
yeah he says that they want us to believe lies and whatever crt is
my father talks about those
whoa a scientist
i really don't remember the last though
salazzle was one of them
yeah gengar was vibing i guess
i forgot the name of the 5th and the 6th one entirely
gengar, lopunny, gardevoir, vaporeon
and he made the fucking horniest team i've ever seen
i got my roommate into playing pokemon showdown during one of the boring classes
what do you think i think about house property
i'm a communist, cherry
and cherry goes oh why are you saying this right now
i set up my boundaries
abusive cherry
i am not property.
and the books are like 15 layer deep of metaphors
main game lore is like oh no i wanna go on a date with you
yeah everything from genshin lore is fucking speculation
she was the archon of love or some shit
trans tsaritsa (transritsa)
that's an untapped market for genshin valk rn
and veli being keqing-tier tsun
like seele and veli being actual physical twin
i'm trying to think what's the worse they can butcher seele for genshin
i don't make the rules
you'll unlock that skill in 10-15 years
you can't dom me yet, sorry
aren't you like 13
you think i have any faith
they make her a loli
good way to cope, didn't think of that out
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i wanna see the unconditional simp then
just wait until they fucking ei seele in genshin
simp ain't forever
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
idk either, just quit instead
those aren't simp
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
and then i'll move the goalposts
sure
it's still going to take forever, just more expensive if you do it now
eli just wait until SN becomes AW valk
2023 = 90% elemental, 10% physical
wait was the game out in 2016 lmfao
2016 = 90% physical, 10% elemental
good and balanced game
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
SoS SI?
it's where i am right now
but i don't think kobeni would work as a valk, and it's impossible for makima not to be there, and asa wouldn't make sense
though if truly just my favorite, i'd go for asa + power + kobeni
<:TeriTeehee:476615023343697921>
not the most popular ones
i want my favorite valks in there
well
new bracket they're releasing?
oh what's that?
<:Cryge:1070904461486215239>
i used to give them advice, you see
how the time turn tables
back in my days, it was easier to get myriad than retaining nirv
lumi changed
holy
i would love an asa/yoru valk though
if we're going spoilers and multiple valk on collab, i'd prob go for a makima/power/quanxi team
and then the valk you enter on field, you're connected with a chain to makima and  you deal more damage or something like that
makima would have something similar to aponia, can enter a mode and swap another valk on field
oh god can i do spoilers
hmmm
but i will come back
i'll quit immediately after, yes
i will come back to honkai if there's a csm collab
understandable
she put me in my place
she asked me to stop talking to her
oh
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
the real lumi t100 exalted nirvana NA is talking to me
whoa
hi tet
add my psn, i don't remember it
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
very tilting, if she does nothing it's cause you're too fast yea
i remember on the 946 maru, took a while to get used to
oh yeah that timing is annoying
there is nothing else to do on her
lumi i get it but those are the 2 buttons you press
unironically
i think grinding achievements is the one type of content i could do until i die
<:life:1001518241610485781>
the good life
game dev will crunch to hell to make new mechanic and new content just for in 2 years to go that's all useless now, aren't you glad we disabled it all
i think that's so sad
i mean i don't mind grind again, the shit i dislike i making past grind useless
i'd hate that
and i went god is that how other mmo are
or somethning like that
there was one line i heard on a vid where someone said about WoW why even care about grinding this expansion to hell and back if next expansion everyone will be starting in the same spot
you have 15 years of game to catch up lmfao
cause if you're a new player
but it's also a downside
stuff builds up from earlier patch, so what you've done is never useless
i kinda am enjoying runescape cause a lot of the grind doesn't feel that artificial and there's very little powercreep
mmo grind can easily feel like grind for the sake of grind
it's kinda similar tho if you squint
wait, piltover is more steampunk
yea
piltover is pretty cyberpunk
league can have cyberpunk shit
in like, delivering a good product
honestly i have a fuckton of trust in riot team
oh yeah league mmo is coming
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
flower trick -> flower trick -> flower trick
i steamrolled the enemy with my meowscarada, my beloved
also eli i had a game earlier in class that i was very proud of
you did your best
ty carl
have enough water for this next weekend, yea?
jesus
gear progression felt with no purpose beyond time lock people to get to late game content and dailies and shit i just went noty
honestly i really really liked lost ark until i hit the real game
that's me when i look at genshin or honkai
i think i got 100 hours in for lost ark in the first 5 days
i'm very good at no lifing shit
level up, i don't think so
and i'll be gold
gimme a few months
what? i'm a quick learner
also i've never played it
i'd be down for a wow raid if wow wasn't so expensive
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
whoa so many people are diamond 2 in league of legends
and the writings is as good as you can get with rowling books as a baseline
the UI looks like destiny 2
i hear it's alr
i guess i only know fragile from EU <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i heard of kestrel before
are they like somewhat new?
who that
the fact i got to 3k trophies at all is a failure, i didn't put any effort in abyss, i didn't put any time, rewarded for nothing
i should never, never in a good system be able to retain, nevermind promote nirvana
like i'll keep touting it
even in NA often
every other server, it just shows how no one actually is playing the game anymore LMFAO
yeah like SEA and CN benefit from it
there's not enough players who care
they fucked up with the nirv changes man
i face tank them like i'm in a WoW raid
i do in abyss
like shit can be difficult in turbo unfair ways and it doesn't mean much
1 mistake = you lose doesn't mean it's good or fair difficulty
yeah i'm just fucking around too, i'm not playing another gacha lmfao
you are diminishing their profits, aren't you upset
yes cry for the corporation tet
i'd fucking end it
you have 5 min long mobs
tet idk if that's your goal, you're doing a great job on making me not want to play pgr
but even then tho, like honkai combat is already hard enough at 1-3 min of combat length, making it 10x as that just yikes
if that's the case then i hate it even more
you share your own password, no one will try it
that's kinda smart tet
1974, the year eli was born
makes sense
nini has a point, tet
yeah that shit ain't for me chief
who has the attention span
make me the easiest shit last 10 minute and i'm losing 50 times
like what even lmfao
10 minute fight don't even have to be hard
i think pgr is cheaper
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786> leagues of legends
kith if you want to make guides i can show you better games to spend your time on
i don't know why i said that
i mean do you not have caps lock
what do you not have thoughts
mte
lmfao
imagine playing the game and doing events
maybe i should get into the misinfo guide market
it's less cruel than leading her on
ask her if you're taking the hints right, if she's interested, and if she is, tell her you aren't
just tell her the truth
heki if you're worried about her taking the wrong idea, then give her the right one
i've sworn off of gachas
oh
i'm interested
what game is that
holy fuck she's so smart
kinda cringe
trio everywhere?
i don't think dudu would do that either
dudu wouldn't do that to you
can you blame her
very affordable <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
vg ain't whale
<a:toodalaotorelate:959796978131271730>
that sounds high!
sheeeeesh
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
i just suffer when it happens to me
i don't know how to solve that issue
that's a lot
try blowing the nose too
i don't act like that :(
i genuinely suck at the game, all i've achieved is just practice and time spent
my gameplay is bad tho, i only get good scores cause i tried for a long time
don't be embarrassed, can't be worse than my gameplay lmfao
and we can check if there's any trick
if you want to be sure, post ref + vid of you doing it
go faster
rarely there are some tricks and extra inputs you're supposed to do but most of the time it's just
unironically 99% of my ref does this faster issues are resolved by pressing buttons faster
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
that's a downgrade
L
carry me around please
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
i guess i could go ilegally
also i love being invited places but i don't have a passport
i'd say there's no way but i've been surprised once
can i come
it's kinda impressive how bad it is, i've never actually watched tv so i didn't know how bad it got
i mean law and order
wait that's the wrong show
they suck really bad huh
you know i've heard to the arrested development sfx a bunch but i never actually watched any episodes
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
how is that ignoring
to your wog
i said pogg
that sounds cool, i'll believe it
a weird useless one
plange sounds like a body part
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
they really do plan ahead
damn
HoV patch?
that sounds right
the ref searcher also has an affix calc
to optimise
from valk kit, equipment and team
but you have to take into account every cmdg buff
i think someone has a calc to figure out what is better
it's more like at x atk and y cdmg, then one of them is better value
it also depends on how much cdmg you already have
so the threshold for atk would be different
like, different valk will have different kit cdmg
you have to balance it out
it's not a simple atk threshold
i'm offended, i'd never ping anyone
for nothing
so i have it downloaded
and i never got pinged
and then i went alright ping me when needed
i downloaded the game for nini to get haitham mats
only nilou
nini would be a better remi
i wish i was a rat
rats are great
remi
brain empty, all cocaine
like at all
i don't think hitler thought
<:pat_hh:710693620776304650>
tet the alt fact enjoyer
wrong ones, but facts i guess
interesting
i also double down on my bad opinions
doubling down, kinda respect
rare L take from cherry
great value valk
or else the value already drops a bunch
it's like on first week
some valk, it's not even on release
yeah
so dumb
it's so stupid
i'm still pissed about that
literally gaslighting people into spending resources
it is getting laughably bad
so old stuff should be way out of bounds
and most people can't even afford the new stuff
value-wise, the only time you pull old stuff is if you can afford new stuff + old stuff
old stuff can still retain even nirv, but you get better bang for your xtal by pulling new stuff
that you should p much never backpull
this game powercreep is getting so insane and fast
i'll run down my rant about backpulling
either pull kiana elf or whatever comes in cn anniv
imo dudu elf is too old now to pull
no one who has BKE nowadays has her at s0 but still
match s0 BKE 4/4 score
3s sns with senpri + ely TB can like
for like budget player, it's kinda nuts
i'd say so yeah
like obv you can whatever you want on your acc
i feel like meta wise, changing a 3s 3/4 SI for a 3s 0/4 SNS on a shield weather boss would be a downgrade. you'd clear shield faster but you'd deal so much less damage that it would be a loss in score
the one way i can see 3s SNS being a good investment is if you plan on using her as dps on those shield weather bosses, and honestly that's not a bad move, she's kinda broken as dps with budget gear
cause then you can just run senpri + ely tb
well, i guess if you plan on using sns dps too
if you had some sns gear then i could see it
i mean it is but even then i don't think a 3s non geared sns would beat a 3/4 si
or do you have either of them geared
do you even run non geared sns over non geared si on shield weather
griseo prob
(good to quit)
gtq
i dunno the details
what's the drama?
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
<:TeriTeehee:476615023343697921>
i guess for you it's already cat flu
can cats get human flu?
that's better
it should just be illegal honestly
yeah god
i hate it so much
and i'd prefer that than having my throat hurt
i could be in my deathbed, hurting on every part of my body
i fucking hate that
oh are you better now?
sleep well
i don't use chansey cause i have sex
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
everything else is for tryhards
now, the only stats i care about are that and speed
the only stat i cared about was hp and setting it to 0
when i played pokemon non-competitive
i don't know what those are
the real rng is what the fuck i decide to do
like my opponent might aswell be ai generated and i wouldn't be able to tell
right now i don't feel like that's the case
hardcore
kinda cool
is that what that does
what
they crit twice but i crit once when it mattered
i did win in the end though
dealing 14%
7 turns of we doing ineffective moves on each other
like fucking
their was faster, none of us dealt damage
bisharp vs kingambit
it was very funny, we were down to our last pokemon
oh that makes sense
that's the shiny one though, right?
yeah LMFAO
my kingambit vs the one pokemon that looks like kingambit if he had no bitches
it was uhhh
i had a cool fight earlier
i haven't fought any people who stall on vgc format tho
i shouldn't
you know
we're here to kill each other, pussies
it's a pokemon battle, not pokemon stall
fuck tanky pokemon
should be turbo banned
anything with more than 110 base stat
what even
stat so high it made up a new color
i've never seen a blue line
what the fuck
can't wait to not see them
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i don't get this one
again, funny words, i don't know what a tradh is
they're cool
so they could be around on most formats
i kinda wish they didn't stuff stats up their ass
have legendaries ever been allowed in competitive formats though
they do look sick though
fun stuff
and then you do, and that's all you can do
they're like ohohoh we're gonna spice this up, my gimmick is that you have to press these buttons in this order
their gimmicks aren't interesting
i guess that's my problem with a lot of 3s boss in honkai
but this one adds complexity, which is great
look at honkai
gimmick can easily remove a lot more complexity than it adds, and streamline game into annoying or boring strats
this one i think is great
and most of them are meh at best
i know about other game gimmicks
i really really like it actually
cool words but i don't understand em
look
:wochien:
:chienpao:
oh i haven't seen that one at all
a ghost dragon?
and went alright so it's a tank and deals a lot of damage i lose
i slapped it around with skeledirge
that explains things
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
oh i need to use physical against it
how is that a glass cannon
what even, man
that i know for sure
oh it's definitely ghost
don't give me hope
god damn it
sheeesh
it's uhhh ghost psychic?
yeah the typings, so hard
i mean, maybe i do, i just don't know it
i don't have an answer for that
it deals so much damage i don't get it
i fucking hate that piece of shit
oh god
oh yeah!
honestly you should emote all pokemon names for accessibility
can i steal emotes to see what a pokemon looks like
:fluttermane:
murkrow is annoying
the bird one i can't deal with
they don't feel too op to me right now
new ruleset :D
yea paradox pokemon, they were made allowed on series 2
all and all, i've only seen one murkrow
i've seen some dondozo aswell, a lot of the one bird that looks like a mecha
like there's just so many pokemon i can't remember them all
these are 2 games someone made replays
don't do this to me eli
oh god
and the tourney vgc is played in the game, right?
i'm playing vgc format, which i assume it's the same rules as the tourney vgc
i dunno actually
which i like
maybe it's my elo but there's a lot of diversity
from what i heard i thought it was way more common
but i'm kinda surprised honestly
yeah i don't quite know how to deal with it
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
can't do hos?
hoc with hot?
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it gets tailwind off, dies and i lose
and it's like a tailwind carrier
like i often look at a scary pokemon and go holy shit i gotta get rid of that
okay, these pokemon usually are run for this
even if it's not 100% perfect, i think it'd be helpful to have some material that's like
but not everything you need
like from wolfy i've only seen very technical stuff, which is cool
i mean i'm sure there are, i'm more complaining about the content i've seen
like, this is tank, even if you don't know what they do, you know what their purpose is
but i feel like there's a lot of categorisation that helps out newbies
of way too much stuff to learn about
like league has a similar problem
true, but i mean i dunno, i feel like there should be ways to give some general knowledge to have at least some idea of what's going on
my favorite is when he gets ultra lucky and gets away with something he shouldn't have
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'd also go world champ diff if i was a world champ
which like fair
cause like even the exaggerated persona of his is mostly about hyping himself up instead of putting others down
i mean honestly though, i'd have no issue even if he wasn't exaggerating
i enjoy it
the ego thing to me feels very over the top
nah i find it very funny
i have no clue what to expect from most pokemon
i feel like most of my issues right now are the sheer amount of knowledge i'm missing
and that's nice, but i dunno
a bunch of the info he does is like technical stuff, like how x or y stat works
his recent tourney is what got me interested
i've been watching wolfy
showdown is like little bitch time for your move and i'm like what's 1/2 * 2
the type chart takes too long
i keep a type calculator on second monitor
<:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
it's so much info
multiple tatsu
aren't there l ike
sheeeesh
yeah, from what i heard they are a menace
and like i'm interested
i've somehow still not fought any dondodonzo or whatever the fuck it's called
i just went sounds cool on my first vid and copied
i mean i'm not attached to this team though
true
i'm like google please sucker punch and then i go <:surprised:889238431580958780> when it doesn't show me pokemon
the hardest stuff right now is remembering to put pokemon after my searches
annihilape, meowscarada, skeledirge, hydreigon, kingambit and toedscool
it's the team wolfy made for jaiden
cause i got a little bored watching the video where they play with it
i don't really know how it works and what's the strat supposed to be
i'm running a youtuber's team that i just copied
pc crashed
i uh
i'm playing vgc on showdown
i need a coach
eli do you play competitive pokemon
it's not good for me
don't make me go back there
oh i got normal pinged
did i get ghost pinged
is that not fun? doing everything right and still getting bad score cause unlucky?
your performance based purely on roll of the dice?
what you don't like crits?
i might have a problem
it's actually insane how bad my temper gets
on like reddit and shit
reading bad opinions still make my blood boil
as much as i don't care much about honkai anymore
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
oh shit sorry
the gacha is gone
if you have base pri you should easily do it
SK i think is just FT too but it's very very easy on damage
either FT with freeze or BKE
besides that tho i don't think you can do much
for 917 kallen
there's a BKE strat
<a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
you can't say dick anymore?
you play for an hour so you can have 5 minutes of fun
so it's kinda like league
what even
the foot don't even the ball
american football is an awful name for the sport
i found a new hill to die on
don't worry about it
nvm actually keep up the good work
lumi
i can be american
heki using chat gpt to generate more interesting messages to post here
i'm just kidding i've never watched a real sport
what nascar is fine
same! i'm not racist
yeah can you guess who's the furry one from those 3 messages
assigned human at birth?
it could be double use
i was expecting a thread
incels = government assigned gf (small brain)
us = cherry assigned milf (galaxy brain)
assigned slut at heki
asah
mist queers = still about pokemon
he's talking about evs
ruby is a pokemon
lumi you're so inspirational today
yeah
LMFAO
opposite of trans
i'm a cis straight men and i want cock please
me when i'm very straight: i want more men here
well i'd say it's more like 80/20, we still learn a good amount of our story
true same
everyone could've guessed i think
congrats! lumi went platinum
it's 31946 though
it doesn't ping me when i've been active in this chat for a while tho
i should make that a thing LMFAO
did you know: on average, i get 3 daily pings, and it's all heki being horny
lore accurate
what happened
i just want it to look impressive, i don't need to be actually good
i think if i can get like 20-30 seconds solves, that's good enough for me
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
which is pretty close to the world record, i just need to cut another 57 seconds now
and i got my first solve in under 1 minute because of it
i learned a new method (to me) that made it way easier and faster
do you know what a rubiks cube is
you should be able to understand most of it
how
it also makes it waaaay easier, i easily got my first sub 1min after learning it
i recently learned f2l, that shit is kinda fun
the only puzzle i can do is rubiks cube
what do you think i am
speaking in riddles
melon? from beastars?
who's t3?
what happened
y'all are toxic nowadays
<:cry:944955259636285481>
god damn it
:speech_bubble:
<:CHAD:845735376231333978>
wait nqn exists
can i get a <:thoughtbubble:990282637270716476> but for a speech bubble instead
hey mods
<:PeepoSitFishing:1058108500775018596>
holy fucking bingle, what?! :3 as you cause a national security crisis
it's so funny
this is the post where it announced it got the no fly list
but it's very entertaining too
honestly you should read up on it, it's a bit fucked up on what the no fly list actually entails
sick name
yeah
so i kinda want that
all lowercase
but anyways, its legal name is maia crimew arson
and then a bunch of people got somehow mad at it because it uses she/it pronouns
i mean i dunno how it hacked the tsa, but it did
yeah
idk if you heard of the one girl who hacked the tsa for the no fly list
yeah i think you can legally have just one name too
apparently it's possible in the US so it could be possible in brazil too
i kinda wanna change my name so it's lowercase
no?
and then flamescion pri, for when kiana becomes the moon, ntr
they should've named 7tr pri 8tr
hers is called 7tr
has she ever used AF?
whoa what the fuck
1 random 5* gladiator
or some shit like that
1 artifact
genshin's was like
mihoyo does historically give shit rewards for pre register events
but still pretty stupid
that's less stupid
oh i see
that's fucking stupid
hsr gacha currency is called trailblazes exp?
what
forum xp?
what even is trailblazer xp then
wait what
that's surely more impactful than a ps5
what do you not want to get AR50 as fast as possible
like truly
accept it
grow a pair
i've had someone say zootopia is not really furry tho cause it's so mainstream and like
my take on furry definition is that it's helpful when it's the most abrangent and if someone is picking and choosing what is or isn't, they're just cowards
eli please don't post leaks here
like most people would group scalies in even though there's no fur involved
eh idk i don't think most people would take that definition that literally
and i'm sure honkai would too if i read the story
genshin has some sick male characters
i'm just talking about hsr charactrers btw, like
they look waaaay more shallow than the female characters
from like the first impression, the ones i can have right now
i mean idk maybe it's different when i get a better read into their characters
so people can go she's teeeechnically not a catgirl, so i'm teeeechnically not a furry
catgirl for cowards
she's kinda like keqing
which i guess is weird cause i don't like dehya that much, and she's def older than the zzz girl
i do prefer milfs though
i like cat girls and darker skin
i think that's prob my fav design from zzz
maybe hsr writing team is out of the loop?
i mean i'm not saying they haven't written good male character before
goddamn i love xiangling
oh yeah that's why i like her
default player character in pubg
she looks like generic fodder enemy from some random mobile game to me
like so many people like her
cause they look kinda vanilla to me
which is weird to me
for some reason a lot of people like them
like her and soldier 11
oh yeah
i am not very interested in any zzz character for now
i will say though, as much as i am a furry
i mean i'm not judging, i don't even think it's bad
what even
tiktok hornyposting
it's like fucking
yeah that one vid was the one i was thinking about
i don't mind that one though
i mean just looking and listening to them i feel that way, but i could be biased
and the girls don't feel nearly as like one dimensional
i was talking that like, hsr guys feel like mainly horny bait and not much more
hsr
maybe mihoyo just doesn't know how to write male characters
but idk they feel like that's not their main purpose
like sure the female characters are pretty hot
i mean i'm not judging, but like i'm not sure how to describe it
and idk if i'm just biased somehow
the female characters don't feel nearly as horny bait than the male ones for some reason
is it just me
all hsr male characters feel like it's horny bait
okay so i wanna see if i'm alone in this
lower your expectations
but that's expecting too much
it doesn't fit seele, sure
oh i don't mind that VA performance
don't worry
veliona is dead
this is old seele
ooo that one would be cute
prob summer release or earlier imo
i think it's real close to release
and a vid
they did some shorts
hsr youtube woke up btw
common W take from eli
it's the best girl
like getting the first abyss clear is prob going to be fun when you're underlevelled and pushing the limits
i mean the game is going to be hard if you make it hard
and turns out i don't like those i guess
in the end, is just a mihoyo game over all
i was actually so hyped for it
yeah i don't mind turn based
i don't even want to bother
is just like alright this is all the endgame we're getting for this game too
literally every hype drained away
when i saw genshin abyss on it
like i was hype
yeah same
the only way invested player gets to play genshin nowadays is if they have 6 different accounts so they can do 2 hours of dailies instead of 15 minutes
i'm fine with casual player getting attention, just not when it's all of the attention
and putting all attention on casual player
it's just throwing invested player under the bus
idk how to explain besides genshification
i vibe with it, i just wished mihoyo didn't make the optimal worst choice for their games for players like me
wait for 2nd beta when it has genshin abyss
you say that now
and then release a few more genshins
they'll just slowly make honkai more like genshin
from mihoyo
idk i thoroughly don't believe we'll ever get a game like honkai
and it's a different trademark than hsr
honkai galaxy is still trademarked
i guess <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
literally just saving for honkai 4
they didn't have all sp valks 3s
saved up
40k gold pins
i knew someone who had fucking
i don't get it
yeah like literally 0 upsides only downsides
drives me nuts
and getting rid of equipment because i felt like it
shit like saving resources like AL and AW for honkai 4
yeah, casual players have a fucking issue, i don't get it
look i just keep some variables in there, don't worry about it
only get rid of stuff when you need the resources, and if you need the resources then you need the resources
asking like should i keep x in a vaccuum isn't really helpful, the answer is pretty much always yes
and start getting rid of the least useful shit first
when you need resources, you make a prio list from most to least useful
you always save everything, no matter how niche or useless
so this is how you deal with getting rid of stuff
like eventually she'll show up in bp and stuff
i'd keep the weapon though, if you don't need the torus
and even if budget stigs is not that big of a diff, if it's big enough to not make you meet that threshold, you're fucked
so there's a dps threshold where if you don't meet it, you just lose a fuckton
but the issue is that all her bosses revolve around her one shotting core
her stigs aren't that broken, dps wise she doesn't get a disproportional buff from them
i mean the thing about PE is that
i mean i wouldn't roll for her card even if you had 4/4 saved up for her
kinda bad
are there canonically like predators and shit
eat berries and shit
i thought like canonically they live a pretty chill life
do wild pokemon need to survive?
not, that i've read any
i can say that some pokemon fanfic does explore shinies being shunned from society
that's what happens
yeah someone put flareon alongside white clothes
that bitch glow in the dark what even
shiny espeon
look at this fucking
and i think that's kinda based
so there's a reason most of them suck, they just rotated color palette at random
like the thing about early shinies is that they weren't planned
what the even fuck
is espeon
i think my top 1 least favorite shiny
lmfao he green
cause like they all suck
i kinda respect the early gen shinies though
that's a shit shiny
nodonzo or something
the fish pokemon?
the rest you just farm and hope your team wins
so you get to play 1/20 games
and late game existed in about 5% of games
always useless early and mid game
my favorite role has always been adc but when i was playing it was in such a shit state
actually toxic
literally out dps'd by yuumi
my era of adc fucking soraka could kill you lv1
i very much do
i do
i dunno why i got so anxious, it's so weird
and i never tried again
and then the match got remade at 5 mins
the only time i tried playing ranked, i started queue and got so anxious i almost threw up
i should've played ranked
i lowkey kinda miss league
oh i see, did becoming a pedo help your temper too?
he made me pop some blood vessels though
cause i haven't played in like 4 years
or i guess, countered
idk if it's because he counters the champs i play as specifically
that shit should be a warcrime
aatrox is the one champ i think deserves death penalty
i only remember him being extremely toxic
holy fuck that name
i did the same with honkai
honestly, fair
i wish i could live on that ignorance though
adc 0/7
mine are like elo hell i can carry if y'all let me farm
weird randoms you have then
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
that's at least slightly better than randoms who are trash and don't listen
i feel like it's close to impossible to not tilt to another universe on team games while not playing with friends
god i wish i had a laugh track when i was balding MA
LMFAO
harassment works
people just kept me around cause i was young and didn't fuck up to a level where it wiped the group
i'm pretty sure i was consistently the person dealing the least damage on group bosses in runescape
i don't even know 40 people
but idk if i trust some of the mods to not send random messages <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
we could lock it so no one could send messages
yeah idk either
it's a nice urge
oh i was just spreadsheeting earlier
the sols blustorm one
maybe we could bring the ref channel here too
i should retire from that too
holy fuck
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
now i go back to runescape
this is my monthly mod action
refs from gresham
i can make a thread for it
C MA score
that's like
a minute?
i haven't watched the puss in boots movie
fragile was selling hrt with cope gear very hard
<:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
a good valk would have a rank up that revives herself and gain sp when she dies
yeah fuck nirv
if only there was a way to solve this conundrum
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
me being mad because my self imposed restrictions are too restricting
she's legally not allowed to comment on it
am i having a stroke
they're about as impactful for their respective team
between those 2, i would just go for the one you use more
how often do you use hb?
makes me pissed
but they just removed it
i wanna play that shit so much
i hate this game so bad
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
LMAO
i don't like that one
oh
so cute
LMFAO
:oljj:
<:PU_PepeOld:532626230562783242>
every 2s strat looked that cool
once upon a time, gresham
i can only use it on browser right now for some reason
is discord fucked up for anyone else?
you either do or you don't
50/50
jesus christ i've never watched the let him cook scene
oh yeah that, thank you
can you grab those for me?
i need frag chances too
actually no that's annoying
so you can see avg prices
i can do math with elf being flat 1.5%
2.08%
owo math 1/48.1
since valk consolidated is
if it is flat 1.5% then yeah it would be worse than valk
i haven't, and i dunno if anyone has
if someone has looked into it
i mean, i guess maybe aka knows
we don't know if elf is 1.5% flat
so i'm willing to bet it's just the exact same system
i'm p sure
cause both are 100 pity + 1.5% rate
but i can guess it's the same as valk
i don't know the numbers for elf stuff
get some skins irl
enthralling gameplay <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
valk stock trading?
daily fluctuation
what the fuck am i looking at
ok
i can't edit a past message to upload an attachment to it
i don't want to make an acc
do you have any alternative?
fuck i need an imgur acc
yeah i can do that for now
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
so i either have to find more free hosting or pay
and now it ran out
i had free hosting cause i'm a student
what even
<a:toodalaotorelate:959796978131271730>
that it isn't wasted cubes
gresham is just saying
yeah
i've pulled whole stig sets for 1 second
<:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
it is safer to just pri another weapon
especially in 3s MA
i think there are some places where it's worse if new strats aren't made
didn't know so many people were interested
what even is the boss
L
<:BedgeTogether:1006408364835753995>
i read it like a really soft pog
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> unlocked
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
i don't believe in lenses
oh sorry could you not ping me when it's about witchcraft?
the real make up is dying your eyes
just paint it over
think the name has most of the same letters
is that the smash bros announcement
oh god
really? it didn't look that bad
is counterside more degen than honkai?
thank you for the input hak
cause a lot of what hurt about cb19 on cat team is that cat made ult cd lower but weapon active cd was still long as fuck
actually i dunno how much bigger it is than cb19 on JK team
because of the cd issue
but ff catches up and gets ahead on following rots
im p sure cb has better damage upfront
it does get better with pri levels though
you do need pri but i don't think max pri is strictly necessary
falcon flare fuck?
shit game
-> spend money
-> get turbo lucky
= still can't afford shit
like i said before
honkai actively shits on anyone not spending to 4/4 most valks
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
they should quit
no one cares about how valk works without 4/4
eli
that is so much better and different than watching refs
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
then quit
play on a whale acc, figure out the game still sucks
it's not
yes
yes
:okayge
use my acc
eli
heki moment
better than me
i'm willing to bet it's guaranteed t2%
it's a sick achievement honestly
nowadays 80% of people do it in the 4 hours after abyss closes on sunday
30-40% of people done
back in my time friday was already like
ah
i mean it's friday already
gresham's time is getting closer
this is the first sign
oh no
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
i only bully myself when i deserve it
that's a weird MA score
<:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
generally, yeah
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
good luck
there's no way you'd ever be able to come up with more insulting stuff than what i think about myself
it should be a challenge
oh i don't mind being bullied
why are runescape players like this
y'all trying to make this singleplayer? that's so weird to me <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
is this how discord servers are nowadays?
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
jesus christ
sometimes i don't like y'all
you know
i'm interested
oh shit she's a furry?
the feet loli?
who's that again
obviously it's close beta test
i'm talking about hsr
like i don't think it's fair to call it shill even if that valks topscores when that topscore is cbt
but i wouldn't call it shill
it's an HRT boss for sure, don't get me wrong
eh idk
wait no, it was like 3 patches too
they released wolf a patch before IO
like they released HoD a good 3 patches before PE
yea it's been a while since the last shill they released before doing the real valk
it's trio shill
idk this boss ain't HRT shill
that sounds stupid
oh normal attacking in specific?
i mean
at least it's consistent with the other husk
oh
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
idk what y'all doing wrong
for me it's chill
nah
damn
0.7%
owo math 0.5 ^ 7
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
i'll wog
birb
wait it's wrong, i'm not a human
aw
owo profile
no fun complaining about shit i don't understand
i gotta play the game to complain about it
less fun that way
<:GWsetmyxPeepoEvil:405337570952740864>
another game for me to quit
<:yaewatching_cec:1007044766673936505>
that's surely very different from watching refs
i can type out the string of actions you're supposed to do
neb, right?
are you doing
whoa wtf
i think it's kinda stupid to then go oh no i'm restricted
i mean you're purposefully restricting yourself for fun
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
you can still figure out bosses by yourself without forcing that playstyle on others
...why
like tailor made to piss me off in specific
that sounds
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
cause i haven't played either
abyss bella or 3s bella?
which bella
none of that looks fun
i have genshin but not honkai installed
how the time tables turn
i'm not doing this week MA
you convinced me
you know what gresham?
<a:Noted:914214211138244688>   **Gresham**, the answer is: **47791.2**
oh it do be dead though
owo math 39826 * 1.2
the space, gresham
<:DILUC_COOL:708170074069925928>
from dealing no damage in one game to dealing no damage in another game
actually depressing
hitting like a wet noodle
i legit have like a 20% success rate on those
but the combat ones you have to deal enough damage to contribute to get a reward
where you can make a good amount of money
there's these hourly events in runescape
shit game shit bug
same
they'll answer oh sowwy captain, we haven't taken a look at that gamemode in a while
send a support ticket
weirdge
i think you want the qte on this ref
yikes
they act like they fixed the game, this shit is worse now
i'm glad i quit
awful
the pause nerf looks
btw you can input weapon active way faster after dodge
L
lmfao
powercreep too big
stig too strong
lmfao
pretty close yeah
L
cucked by pause timer
so you can pause before black hole
sp pack should be when it falls below 3 bars i think
pause better and i think you have it
you don't have to slap him that hard
holy
chill out
eli
then you can change it
yeah if you do too much damage
yeah it's team pick up range
oh wait i see
that sp pack looks annoying as hell
yeah prob
VKE is the best one but it's by frames
the bd carry doesn't matter
pickup range
homu M
nerf your stigs a lil
try that
but idr what i did
and i got easy 840
cause i remember i had a weird team, that one but FT instead of KR
idr what i did
hmmm
see what that scores
try doing abyss rot on heim
yo try something out
yeah
hmm do you wanna try the LE one? it doesn't have sp pack bald, at least
and maybe just do one less auto attack on HoF
do AE BBB
no clue sorry
chill
so much damage
for sp
yeah just pause after black hole
that was weird
you're supposed to do the other way around
that's because you're doing weapon active -> dodge
hmmm
you can do it very fast
you take so long after tap ult to snap
on HoF
just remember for snap it's tap ult -> snap
so it phases him
i feel like HoF qte loses time and makes you deal way too much damage
ok
oh you're already using it
you can try more before turning off HoF qte
and prob turn off HoF qte
change emblem for sp pick up
pause for sp
okay so
dodge -> weapon active -> 3a
or something like that
dodge -> weapon active -> 3a -> ult
tap ult -> snap
for rot try doing something like
and on KR after BD
on HoF at the beginning
way earlier
okay you can swap out
lmfao
don't do that
other order
whoa
you have too many valks liked
yeah annoying timing
should score lower but potentially easier
HoF AE BD
you can run AE if you want too
show me
BD prob outscores
that's a weird team
if you say so
oh ok
hmm
well, i shouldn't say both, rather either
then it can also put him in red mode
if you time HoF active weirdly
and hp
amount of hits taken
it's both
cap in heim is usually pretty annoying
going -1 or -2 tho is pretty chill
yes
if you deal too much damage, it phases him and then your damage is peanuts
you can see on the ref, it's like at 2hp bars + 1/10th
hp bar
you need to ult right before it hits 2x
really finnicky
your HoF does prob have the damage is just
yea heim strats a lil weird
nvm
yikes
well, you could run phys on tank too
then the other team for tank sounds right
choose one of these for heim
<>

3s le
do you have
oh
on heim
actually i guess you can easily run the HoF RC BD
hmm yeah i'd try some bull stuff on training
for 840
HoF AE BD
there is a heim strat which is like
oh i have no clue how to do bull
what's the week
<a:peepoArrive:646986909691936768>
memorial arena?
lowkey i would've too
honkai 2023
still can't afford shit
get lucky, spend money
how dare you
fu hua bitch?
fhb?
idk what's going on - support
when we get bug
300 xtal + abyss disable + abyss refund
when CN get bug
actually i'm reconsidering
no
i know eli and gres
who's b4n
do you need more cez?
at least having a bunch of s0 13/13 teams
and investing somewhat on teams
while not like tryharding
is it even possible to hit nirv in CN
494 jesus christ
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
that shit must be like 50 point diff from the 3% breach
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
maybe this is the iOS balance i was talking about
oh yeah
so breach is way more needed
mobs with ele res similar to how high def is
maybe they're planning on releasing exalted2
i think that's really shitty
like making the trio team rank ups retroactively really disappointing for the trio team when they release
tbh i think it's kinda shitty the way they made hrt rank ups
yeah that makes sense
but those bosses never show up so
prob quite big on non-herrscher team like IO and stuff
i kinda expected for the 2s to be kinda meh on herrscher team
that doesn't surprise me that much actually
surprising
o wow
2s1 HoT with like 2s HRT tho right
<:DILUC_COOL:708170074069925928>
i keep my colors when i pogg
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
which one?
so i'll keep mine alive for a while
i think every other one kinda suck
i'm keeping my spreadsheet for game patches updated cause lowkey
ty
that makes sense
what's in bp in 6.4?
using the box randomly on a piece to make her 1/4 isn't going to make her useful, just save it until the piece actually makes any impact
if you're not investing in flamescion, save box until you get her gear somehow (offrate, bp)
if you're investing in flamescion, save box until you are at 3/4
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
better than me
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
sheeesh
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
with that price tag
yeah it better
prob not with trio team, right? or even with trio team?
almost not even worth it to bother to switch into a valk that can insta kill it with the passive
kinda feels meh how every other ima boss seed is very squishy
the seed is crazy tanky but it does look very nice to be able to insta kill it
what even is going on in those
oh god it has 2 transitions
i saw dxy stage and got very interested
oh it's abyss
that's a lot of words for skill issue
do my acc next
hug closer
yeah that looks kinda far
yeah i don't remember inconsistencies with that
so it's quite annoying on bosses where you have good ignite uptime
it procs on ignite application
there it is
ooooh yeah i forgot i was funny
LMFAO
it's still up
wait that one is the full movie
fuck
what was it
gifs have lower res i think
i guess that kinda makes sense
oh for sticker in specific
what the fuck
or, stickers i guess
discord doesn't take gifs as animated emotes?
efficient
it took you like 1 minute?
i only have the emote
<a:felisSnatched:994286905254477875>
L
actually that's fair now that i think about it
wow, you don't trust me?
huodou but for HRT
that looks like
oh yeah
i wanna see how fighting it looks like
share?
what the hell
jesus since when is genshin maintenance fucking 20 hours long
dang looks like carv muted/blocked me too smh
yeah prob hak
who did you have blocked?
blocked message?
<a:Wave:995380866832420994>
also hi carv
did you not?
prove me wrong
and you make bad choices so you prob saved it
i didn't save it
there you go
not that one, no
is that an onceler AU
tet, post the dream ass gif
had to resort to f2p honkai
after being racist and having a giant ass
poor dream
it's dream
holy fuck
<a:PU_PeepoEnter:902185722893725746>
okay <a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
<:A_HuMonkaS:909232418211364954>
god i wish i had the same confidence
how are you enjoying it? i'm having so much fun! mei is so pretty! i can't wait to play this game for a long while and enjoy all of it!
best we can do is a time capsule from the nini starting the game
1
just for you
i'll update it though
the done reading
lmfao
<a:VIBE:1018400029460926514>
google sonic inflation to learn more
did you know that recently after covid, the economy entered an extremely worrying state? inflation is through the roof right now
licking icecream i just learned
the words of the youth are so interesting
oooh i see! i love pegging!
what the fuck
oooooh i get it, it's kinda like a pun!
please enlighten me further i have absolutely no idea what a ligma might be
i don't get it
what do you mean by deez, jerma?
what's deez?
deez?
she's a book?
i would've never guessed
bof?
that's like pre SoS
when was that even
DA AE FS
just a 🤏
i'm ready
take me away eli
people would take it seriously though and that's too much of a hassle
annoy people calling her amy that it's her deadname
i want so bad to troll on like twitter or smth like that
for lead
or something like that
i think for IO it's something like
s3+ IO > 3s gd > s0 IO ~ 3s PV
AE is prob better but harder
hmmm
oh.
oh
turg cat would be better i'm p sure
explain yourself
yeah
Lumi
L
exalted player doesn't even hold any meaning anymore
like gameplay wise
i'm surprised y'all remember wtf happened in ch10
TP isn't that outdated
hey
L
that will only burn you out
i wouldn't bother keeping up 2 acc
though honestly
and depending on the piece you're missing maybe it's not even worth it to go for it
if you're pulling on hrt she's an offrate there
next patch
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
what are you even doing ER for there then
i mean the alt would be only to play story
and make a new acc to go t hrough story slowly
rush the story on your main for rewards
the other 50% gets retconned anyways
the beginning, 50% of the story doesn't matter
eh don't worry about it
i'm listening to the songs and if this is what being lesbian is it kinda slaps honestly
officially alas (assigned lesbian at spotify)
spotify just recommended this playlist to me
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
hire me too
and then i didn't level nahida
the ones near the grass cube so i could level nahida
yeah i think i have like 3 desert shit
um okay
that you need
or desert
is it sumeru
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
okay i'm going to download
oh shit
a year 1 event stig i think
that's like
liu qi HoH?
the ones you have gear or team invested in
save to 4/4 a new dps
or just wait for a new valk
either try for HRT, even 0/4 would be good for your acc
i kinda wanna do that
did i do the 946 heim with HoT before?
oh....
wait is it coming this patch?
trio team i imagine
i think kith doesn't even have 4/4
AKA with AE might be one of the only abyss boss i actually enjoy
i mean i knew that already
how fun is AKA without the good valk?
owo math 5 + 9 - 3 - 2
owo math 6 - 4 + 2 + 3
cringe
imagine doing finality
it's in character
<:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
you can have all my xtals
i'll give you everything you ask for
shit mods

majj does exist
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm autistic in a completely different way
little they know
i must sound very autistic actually
so most people prob think i'm just enunciating my emotions
the way i say sadge it's really similar to sad though
don't get me wrong, i say pog and sadge all the time
so they don't have real pronounciations
only losers speak them out loud
these are internet words
i mean
i love it
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
pogg acquired
nice
you gotta click on the one
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
L
and then i'll go  <:pogg:1035066559351226388> a level
so it can announce when i get a level
i think i'm just gonna bring a runescape bot to my room
i've ran through all the files, it's a cock
<a:aworryThinkMath:865137541857673226>
cause i decided i don't care enough about honkai anymore to work on datamining it
anyway i was thinking about changing my datamining chat to just be my own room
keep it
what no
tet we should have multiple quotes for every quote
i did the thing
ah fuck
oh yeah that's really good
it's really funny to me
from icarly
do you have the book gif
and in normal gameplay you never interact with it
piece of kit which you're only ever meant to touch in ER
it's just a piece of recent valk design which is like
i honestly think they've never meant for you to use the entire ult
that ain't horse feet
weak
what
i don't know what that means
it's the name of the sticker
volume butt fast?
rearrange my insides
please do miss
i'm now interested for no reason
horse feet?
oh shit
jello
oh god not maxwell
just own up to it
cowards
then i don't mind it
but if they're like yeah we're just really horny
like when mihoyo is like i swear the design is like this for lore reasons really, the booba represents the trauma i get pissed
maybe if they remove the lungs
i don't think binders would work on them
hades
tears if themis
yes tower of themis
tantasy
i thought it was just a weird fanart of kevin
oh ok LMFAO
isn't that the one divine key?
wait i don't know if you're joking or not
i want the trans man nikke update
the thing i dislike more about those honkai designs is that mihoyo then try to pull it off as non horny
i think when literally every character is like that i don't mind it that much
i kinda respect being so horny though
it jumpscared me
i opened it full screen and then the booba just fucking moved at me
holy fuck that booba
i didn't expect it to move
jesus
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
where are the nikke quotes so i can see how these people look
so are there no humans playable?
would be cool for a dystopia where it's people shitting on themselves and everyone is awful
aliens = insert villain
i mean, most dystopia are like, aliens doing shit to humans but all humans are really nice
i'm kinda down for that though
is it like a gacha about awful people
jesus what even is nikke
of course it's she who is cooking, she does everything <:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
just girlboss it into being not sexist
the based elysia
LMFAO
<a:alert:853952040652243004> gender alert <a:alert:853952040652243004>
they'd have an easier time if it did
such a shame none exists
yeah it would be way easier if english had a neutral pronounce
oh i see
ER as a whole felt like a big retcon
they also retconned nahida's gender i think
but then they just retconned that
i think before inazuma they had a different idea for how it'd go, since the lore tidbits was that she was replaced
it doesn't make sense, you're right <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
yeah nevermind
god damn it i'm thinking of the lore pre-retcon
oh wait am i thinking of old lore
yeah but i'm saying that everyone thinks the person who did that is the old archon which is dead
isn't that stuff pinned to the old dead archon?
i mean i know that, but does the harbingers know that?
which is why i call it that, it's very funny to me
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
in portuguese, ppk is pussy
besides just closing the country and fucking off
i mean more like would other people even think the new archon has done much?
but everyone else think she's a new one
like we know she's the old one so we know the shit she's done
does raiden even have many achievements?
kafka being there prob wouldn't change my list
i don't think there's been any measurable changes
it's pinned
of all exchange stigs
heki i have a list
mihoyo has this issue of rushing shit out way too hard
instead of a 2 patch long story
it should've been like a 6 patch long story
i do think inazuma story is salvageable, the core themes are pretty good, they executed it awfully
oh shit you're right
i believe i am gay
so you just need to believe?
3.6k max
2.4k on avg
did they ever expand on kazuha activating another vision for a sec
owo math pi
whoa
owo math sin(pi / 4)
cringe
what
owo math f(x) = x^2 -5
oh shit hak
i think i closed the memories off cause it was so bad
oh wait now i remember
i'm thinking here and i don't remember how that ended
they defeated raiden?
owo math 1:8
too little to be interesting, too much to be self insert
like they have too much personality to let you be yourself or choose to date different characters
even in that brain, it sucks for players who play like that
literally no one is happy with it
one of those moves that are like worst of all worlds
i have no clue why they did traveler the way they did
where it's like there's no woman characters and the male characters are way too close to not be fucking
it has the naruto kind of gay early on
it's pretty fun, easy watch
why you keep doing it
chill
nevermind
jesus fuck
owo math 6 inch to cm
holy fuck
ty
lmao
owo math [3, 4, 5] .* [2, 7, 9]
oh wow it goes pretty deep, they can do matrices
<a:Noted:914214211138244688>  **Tet**, the answer is: **almost $100 top up**
<a:Noted:914214211138244688>  **Jerma**, the answer is: **6**
:naruhodo:  MargaritaSalt, the answer is: 30
i'd rather fucking die than not have basic freedom like that in uni
i think all uni is like that yeah
aw i was going to say you could play honkai
i need owomath
boss i swear discord is necessary for my job
look y'all joke but calculators exist to be used
you need therapy
cherry
no aster, i don't hate you
it's like asking the goblin under the bridge if your dress is pretty
i don't hate either of you but you shouldn't need confirmation from me <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i think you need therapy
only some of you
like they actively and repeatedly shit on the players who care the most
it's why i hate it here so much
mihoyo shits on player who care
i mean i've been saying it for a while now
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i know some players that'd be happy if they could get a3
yeah RL player is really really cheap in honkai
the variance is way higher
like you can get pretty unlucky in genshin too
def genshin imo
i agree though, i think genshin might be more expensive even to get all characters
i think it's funnier without
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
nini waking up, logging in to discord and typing random numbers and getting upset at them
next time you should go that's okay, just deposit $500 usd in this paypal @cherry, yes that's really me, i really need the money
lemme help you out here
maybe i should watch compilations instead
and i didn't get the hype, sorry
i only watched one of his streams before
i was going to say though, as much as i respect jerma's influence
i type my emotes out in mobile
what
tet searching for the german flag: :flag_be
all twitch streams are just different levels of jerma lite
he honestly is
but every joke they made, the chat decided if it was a good one or a bad one and then removed time from the timer based on it
and that came from a jerma stream, where he was speedrunning a game
every time the streamer makes a joke, chat spams either -2 or +2
like there's a meme on some streams
kinda like neil cicierega
which once you learn about them you just every now and then find something else they made and go wait that was them again?
jerma is one of those internet giants
lore accurate to jerma
taste is in the ball?
yeah fuck it up king 👑
i do think bones are common, yes
give me some cock dlc
cyberpunk 2077
i still do
it's different
that's HRT
these woke sjws are having hrt on my disney movies?
i think it depends on how the hrt goes, but it's possible
<:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930>
no one told me about those
i got the pussy cramps
please someone teach me how to fix it
it cramps so hard
ow ow ow my foot
<a:Noted:914214211138244688>
that makes sense
tet have you been to jail before
like holy shit
i'm pretty sure if a slut played it for more than 5 days she would come out a virgin
genshin should be considered war crime
i'm so ashamed
oh no! a typo!
was there jizz on vill v
i know it's p rare
idk and idc
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it made it easier and more boring
and newsflash
the literal only thing that changed was SA -> SI
14!!!!!
14 patches now
we've been doing the same shit to jizo for like
it's so bad
every time
literally the same boss
meanwhile 3s is like
every new release changed it slightly, new strats, new refs
bosses repeated, but they were p much never the same
like back at 2s bosses
3s is so fucked now that i think about it
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and then when it started to feel a little better they did a second 3s boss, which kept it as repetitive
early 3s was so fucking repetitive, there was just not enough 3s bosses to not make it feel like shit
looking back it was so bad, they really shouldn't have released 3s so soon
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
but we all knew it wasn't possible
we all wanted to cope it into existance
it's kinda like the HRT box
no one thought that
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
was tank -> jizo -> tank -> jizo -> tank -> jizo
first patch of 3s boss
tank jizo
there are even some 3s bosses i only dislike instead of having a burning hatred of
yeah like i'd be so down if it was just a different gamemodes
but she was so right
i don't even know if she saw them
and then she did
in 5.0 v1, celine just heard 3s bosses and went that's it i'm quitting
i should've just followed celine
so so so bad
the way they are in 3s are
2nd phases can be alright
so dumb
i think 2s kosma even still has the ball phase
still has all the shit design
they just slider scale into easier
the 2s version of the new 3s boss is exactly what kith said 2s -> 3s is
nah they all suck
gets me excited just thinking about it
<a:LewdThoughts:635507088793141338>
meanwhile every boss used to be harder than that
we go oh no doom is soooo hard
yeah it's so nuts, like nowadays even the most interesting 2s MA refs don't even get close to what 2s MA used to look like
it sucks LMFAO
kinda like wanting to log in to club penguin and do some matches
it makes me wanna log in and do that
looking at old refs actually kills me
just makes me miss 2s MA more and more
talking about this shit
like i'm playing the game to play the game, don't make me stand around and wait until the boss stops having fun, holy shit
i despise it
like pig is just wait for 20 seconds
some are fine, but most of them are so so bad
is the gimmicky intermission
the main thing i hate about abyss 2
but i don't want to remove that from people if they enjoy it
some bosses are turbo bullshit
i do think objectively a bunch of 3s MA design sucks
yeah exactly
kinda surprising i know
literally the entire competitive exalted MA community was, believe it or not, already in exalted
and go i'm not dealing with that
we didn't have the foresight to see what 3s boss is in exalted
but not everyone started in 5.5
i've said before, if i knew shit was going down this way i would've <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i couldn't, kith
we'd have abyss, abyss 2, MA, ER
i'd be fine if 3s was just a new tab on competitive screen
and they deserve to have their content in the game too
you just need to understand that people, i, enjoy what you don't
like my whole point isn't you're not allowed to enjoy what you do
i'm mad about 2s MA being kicked off
sure but i'm not mad about getting wrong info
i'll run it down again, i was saying that if 3s was an additional mode that you enjoy i'd be fine with it, the reason i'm pissed is because it replaced what i enjoy
the way you answered then sounded extremely bad faith
okay sorry
i would still be right now
i was fine with it
i'm saying that when the leak was bad and i thought that 3s was an additional mode
like read and understand what i'm saying
please
can you read
kith
keep coping
objectively bad skin
i have no issue with people who enjoy abyss or 3s MA, i kinda envy you even, y'all can keep playing the game
you are allowed to enjoy stuff that i don't, whole heartedly
like, being honest now, every time i say your taste is shit or whatever, i am just jabbing at you
sorry, when i say stuff like that i'm joking
what i'm not alright is when that content replaces what i enjoy
i'm alright with them adding more content that you enjoy
weird but cool
and i went
and a leaderboard for 3s boss
so you'd have the old leaderboard with 3 2s boss
was going to have a new, separated leaderboard
there was misinfo that the new 3s boss
literally on the v1 5.0 beta
i'd be chilling
i wouldn't be pissed
a new gamemode
like if they made 3s bosses
it is selfish to want to have more fun at the expanse of other people having less fun, yes
i don't have a soul anymore
that ain't true
cause i'm telling you
and if i look into my soul i like 3s?
are you saying that if i look deep inside i'm actually really happy over the changes?
are you gonna command over my taste?
you're gonna say my personal preference is objectively wrong?
you're gonna say i'm wrong?
i like it though
like honestly, who the fuck cares
keep hating
i don't fucking care if you like it or not
yeah i'm not saying you're supposed to like
look it's okay, i thought you just didn't understand that the gamemode could be different, turns out you absolutely do, you just only care about the shit that gets you off specifically and nothing more <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
who cares about players who like MA? you get to have 2 abyss, that's so nice of mihoyo
and that's objectively good
you get to have more
fuck the people who enjoy other shit
in specific
fun for you
fun
cool
the same uninformed new players
all of my 2s MA buddies quit at this point
yeah; they all quit
LMFAO
stop saying my opinions are shit cause i'm uninformed i know they are i am trying to inform you
I KNOW
it's objectively true they killed 2s MA just by looking at the amount of people playing it right now
look how big the community is now
they killed 2s MA
competing with other people also doing it
trading tips and refs
that's the thing that's fun, talking with other people also doing it
you understand LMAO
kith, you're competitive like me
competitive 2s MA is all i care about
yeah i'm gonna hop on my 2s MA discord server, me and my 2 schizo buddies
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it already was
yeah
even
what
those wanting for content that is already in the game to not have it removed is selfish
??????????????
you made it clear you're kinda selfish <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
yeah i know that
it's just a shitty thing to do to a part of your community that sinks so much time and effort into your game to just take away the content they enjoy from night to day
even if i dislike it personally, and don't care about it
that mihoyo would remove the content they enjoy
i would be mad on abyss player behalf
i would still be mad about it, even if i don't know much about abyss
is that if they removed it and replaced it with something different
the one thing i said about abyss
and i guess that's fine
cause i don't do abyss
yeah, i mean unless you think i can't compare 3s MA with abyss
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
because i don't try
i mean i don't have opinions on abyss design beyond i don't like it
lmao
.
you said though
i love arguing
i mean i'm chilling
you can't just go oh i never played but it's the same
everyone on this side agrees it's inherently different
listen from the MA players
like, you shouldn't keep a shit, uninformed opinion about something you don't know about
is because you never played 2s
the only way you can say that
no
just untrue
that is
listen to me kith
so fucking not the same boss
it's
when it literally is not
therefore = you're saying it's the same boss
so you saying 2s -> 3s is the same comparison
RL -> nirv is the same boss
i'm saying that
oh i know
on your definition of same
please enlighten me
okay
if they were the same you'd enjoy them the same
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
when you yourself say you enjoy one more than the other
that it's different
how can you not agree
it isn't slider scale easy -> hard, it's a whole different thing
those are inherent and core differences in design
2s bosses are shorter fights with lower health totals that enables you to use shorter duration but higher damage buffs
3s bosses are longer fights that require thorough abyss-like rotations with gimmicky transition phases
it's objectively true, 2s and 3s bosses are designed differently that force different styles of gameplay
how can you even
.
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
what i'm saying
fucking read
i'm explaining
yeah that's what i'm saying is wrong
that force different styles of gameplay
they have different core design principles
they aren't just slider scale from easy to hard
3s bosses are inherently different from 2s
okay i'll run it down calmly for you
yeah if you think 3s bella is just harder 2s bella idk what to tell you bud
there's no fucking way
is if you literally never done a single 2s boss in your life
they are just harder versions
like the only way you think
like holy fuck
cause it's so obvious how 2s and 3s are different
and then maybe you should listen to players who have before talking about it <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
like, competitively
is that you never played MA
look, the only thing that tells me
with different amount of tankiness
it's still the same boss
yeah but it's still because it's less tanky, we somehow skip mechanics on nirv too
then idk what to tell you
and see the core, different design choices
and 3s parvati
like if you can't look at a boss like 2s parvati
3s are completely differently designed bosses that need different strats
nirv is just tankier rl
when it literally is not
are comparable to rl and nirv
you talk like 2s and 3s
you gotta understand kith
fightng game
everyone would stop playing
it's inherently different
and they went you can still play the game though, just play training mode
that's like if skullgirls took their servers offline
yeah that's turbo stupid though
what even
what?
MA is done, mihoyo fucked it
now no one is making refs, you can't get to t100 while only doing 2s, and there's no cap scores left
and competing on t100
and chasing cap score
was around copying refs
because 90% of the community
mihoyo shouldn't remove it
you just need to go okay people enjoy that, sick
you don't need to get that
people still should have that
and that's fine
and i know you don't like that
like, the MA community was based around sharing refs and copying caps
but just because you don't like it doesn't mean the people who do don't deserve to have what they like <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it really truly is
and that's fine
you personally don't like it
like kith i get it
the new 2s bosses are just shitty versions of the 3s bosses
2. there ain't new 2s bosses though
you remove that, the community is gone
1. 90% of the community thrived from sharing strats and competing on highscores
okay so first off
like, yes, you can play the 2s bosses still
it is not, though
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
why did every MA player quit
if that ain't content removed
that's turbo stupid
3s isn't a harder version of 2s
that's completely different
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
you know that's bullshit
how is it not?
objectively
it literally is
is just shitting on the people who enjoy a part of the game
for something completely different
removing that gameplay entirely
there was a giant community of people who enjoy 2s bosses
but it's objectively a shit move from mihoyo to add 3s bosses
like i get it if you enjoy 3s MA more than old 2s or current 2s, it's okay to have different opinoins
so everyone left are the ones who enjoy abyss more <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
when they killed off their fav gamemode
cause they made all the MA players quit
yeah i'm sure
their boss design blows
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
3s MA is just a more annoying abyss right now
just killing off the gamemode is fucking bs
but because it would be shitting on people who enjoy abyss
cause i would enjoy
not because i wouldn't enjoy
i'd be equally pissed if they added exalted+ abyss and it was just 2s MA
it's shitting on player like me
with a subpar copy of what we already have
and when they replace a different gamemode that we have
you gotta understand that it's different though
like i'm not saying you have to enjoy MA
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
2s rn is still better than 3s rn, but 2s back then was way better
like i love 2s but mainly it's ghost from when it was way better
and a fuckton more interesting than 2s is right now
it's a fuckton more interesting than 3s is right now
and then look at the gameplay
none of that was niche for it's time
i'm saying that if you started in 2019, the first shit you crafted would be lier B
it wasn't
but back when that was cap score
because they fucked the gamemode up
now it is
that is pinnacle of affordable
or back when that was cap score, it was top prio
like all of that is either generally useful stuff to this day
those ain't niche though
yea you're right
oh
it's the only reason i have it
absolutely, they give away a TM
LMFAO
in chronicles
given away for free
beet M is literally
what
it's all free
wtf you mean niche gear
3s just shits on that though
it's an interesting different gameplay style
MA isn't different because it's 0s kill shit
it's inherently different from abyss
look at this
even if we could it'd still be shit
removing content i enjoy to replace of more of what you already have
<a:chad:969329762206093372>
some people prefer MA to abyss
you have shit taste, but you must understand
i understand that
<:bedge:1058107712380076082>
literally every boss is 946 from avo tm HoS just chains -> ult kill
but bosses with 1/4th the hp
since by now they have all the power we do
masters MA is somehow even more boring
and all of 3s MA is just cool this is abyss
90% of 2s MA now just goes oh so you're doing a combo and then ult? how refreshing
any cap ref from 2 years ago looks 500% more interesting than even the most interesting shit right now
god damn MA was fun before
p1 do be sick though
FT BKE doesn't look that cbt
oh damn
it is so sick though
holy fuck
bicc 573
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
786 back then was a pipe dream
9s 840s right now
786
also wtf you mean
you don't need collapse support for couatl
holy fuck
and couatl?
you know how cbt FT is at BKE?
god from a time where FT topscore BKE?
<a:GIGACHAD:965332843557441536>
literally doing nothing is about how much of a powerup she needed
that makes sense i guess
or did they balance it
turbo broken
wasn't it
i didn't see much about it after v1
is that i'm not fucking insane
the issue with that
for a competitive mode
i turbo don't care, i shouldn't be rewarded for playing for 10 mins every cycle
i do think abyss has failed if i'm promoting/retaining nirvana
i have a quick and easy guide actually
then again, mihoyo doesn't want us to try harder, they want us to pull v2v, so they're doing their job right i guess
if it wasn't designed to feel fucking hopeless if you're playing anything not v2v
i wonder if people would try harder against bosses like kosma
that's true too
back when that released, phys was like 80% of the game and elemental the other 20% or something like that
for one, kallen doesn't have a type
like an equivalent to that from earlier in the game is kallen, and the difference from kallen and heph is pretty big
player morale just fucking goes off a cliff
like even if the end state is the same
feel like making the shill so obvious is kind of a bad thing for the playerbase
immune to lightning and fire, high phys resistance
like remember v1 hepha?
like holy fuck
there's no way it ain't getting worse
but also look at the game
like from one side i think just being around more changes
is pretty important to not make the playerbase feel like cattle
like keeping up appearances that the game has natural progression and shit instead of just a line of powercreep and new shit to buy
and that's a big deal imo
i said i'm sure it does, it just felt different
oh i mean i agreed with that from the start
am i?
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i mean yeah but i wasn't playing back then
also got competing scores
because TP and HoV and HoS
but it didn't feel like it was made specifically for BKE and BKE only
jizo was clearly a BKE boss
like at one point
it felt really different
i mean i'm sure
instead of it feeling like the boss was tailormade for her
like before, it felt way more that a valk was good when she got good scores against a boss
maybe i changed
is that really true
the shill is through out the roof
the game is so fucking different
god it's not only me right
now every new valk sucks at MA but they still force them to have some scores from shill
it was already kinda blurry, but there were more defined lines before
it was a thing when i started though
yeah she's more of an abyss valk
x valk is more of an MA valk
remember when we could say that?
god
i mean performance wise yeah, AE was never MA valk
and a handful of pocket lint
sim battle has FT, HoT, BKE
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
gotta run like HoT AE FS
work with a bunch of shit valk
is just trying to make the one single broken valk
half the fun of sim battle right now
then the mode would be even more braindead than it alr is
if they just enable some of the new valks in sim battle
idk
sim battle gamer
if my armada needs it
i might reinstall it to help with sim battle
yeah it's still uninstalled
but then i thought about the logging in part
i did consider logging in to grind xtal
<a:collapse:1063550316332720148>
so you're saying i run newt b?
how good is that <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
baban rolled on my acc and got weapon + TM
how is it
or like END without sig weapon
imagine trying to play JK without her gloves
that's nice
oh really?
all valks are skip all mechanics and make valk playable on pri
cause honestly i'd believe it if he doesn't
does he have her gear
i would make a booba joke but it being about bronya makes me uncomfortable
it's okay if you enjoy HRT more, but she is objectively shallower than AE
i don't think i ever had blueberries
it does look cool though, so it was worth it
so i just came up with an AE qte one
i balded each for like 10 mins and didn't get it
i had done like 3 strats before
i just had to come up with new shit to do every time he showed up
i'll never be able to replicate it
i do a strat and then that's it
i swear sim battle parv is a fucking nuzlocke for me
for a 917 parv
i did use it once
i'm sure i could intricately know all the buffs she has which are all activated when she qtes in
i don't need another valk like that
it's fucking braindead
i mean but it's true, and do i even need to know what she does? literally every ref, all she does is qte in, and sometimes ult not even for buffs, just to stretch out time
FR is very consistent
HoS is quite inconsistent
AE is very consistent
as far as i remember
game doesn't have that many inconsistencies on valk side
black and mixed are faster on pri
nowadays a valk like that would have like
yeah
AE in the other hand
she qtes in and leaves
i don't fucking know
and asked me what the fuck eden does
like if you put a gun to my head
and then they kill one of the different ones to make another where you qte in and then leave
give me something different now
i played enough eden
i already know how it feels like to qte in and then leave
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
if it's going to be the same shit
why even make me pull for a new one then
switch in, press a button, switch off, might aswell be literally any support valk nowadays
it's not even about seeing animations, is about having the valk to play
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
pinnacle of design
and ult to be do everything
just for qte to be skip all that
mihoyo makes the coolest attack animations and intricate mechanics
giving AE JK levels of sp is stupid
cause i'd go cool i'm glad i quit <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
would you go oh my god this is the greatest valk ever
if they released a new valk, turbo power creep, literal press button and score 1k
<:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
the shit opinions balance out
yeah see
spoiler alert: it fuckin ain't <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
is it worth it losing all the AE gameplay
sure, hrt scores higher
i mean it depends what you mean by bad i guess
i have a better thumbnail for oyu
kith balances out being a good player by having shit opinions
HoV has it too
for some reason
is an old valk thing
this isn't news
they are consistently really good at shilling
i mean
i'm proudge
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
that's stupid
they'd never make a valk only for niche elemental shieldbreak
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
idk if i have resources though
so you can pri with no issue
yeah if you're going to log in and play on he acc tet, there's 2 gd weapon
oh yeah eden got a pri
what's that weapon
i'd log in and fix the mistakes if i didn't have to do the log in and playing the game part
good job
it's so weird
y'all treat pull sessions like it's a fun thing
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
like iOS just has 100 styx instead of 1
yeah that's the issue, really
perfoming in honkai -> <a:Y_PepegaCredit:792811182364819477>
if you give them more tools, they'll just perform even better
they're not high out of mistake, they're high because the players in that server are performing well
that would just make dist even higher
lmao
fucking nuts
how do you even balance shit
and there's RL too
the sleeping ones at 460
cause like server who actually care are at 480+ dist
it must be a nightmare to balance valk in current era right
they should balance s0 around 495d i agree
actually true
oke
unfortunately
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
you can't just keep reusing the same joke moriso
this is just the WC meme again
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
pay to play less
pls understand
f2p PE
for HoS ult on p2
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i still have to mald sp pack with my 2s
what
the one ref i was doing was a life changer
the only time i remember that mattering was on abyss maru
oh i could see that
<a:Copege:991854669506814013>
maybe that's why i can't cap
oh shit it matters for HoD?
underkill, you're fucked
overkill, you're fucked
just to try and get the exact damage right
from shit like glut to irene to none at all
like the strat was changing the T piece on one of the supports
it's insane
and rank ups
depending on slightly different damage thresholds
there's like 80 different refs for HoT
so so bad
but for kasumi it's
it's sort of a problem with every boss
kasumi is cursed
it's just a pretty klein <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
like the point it died is when i elf ult for cd reset
p much
i used elf after p1 was dead
L
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
it took longer than that
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
or else i killed too fast
i had to elf ult so fucking late
i remember doing the 786 on nini's acc
this is at least better than turg cat
i'll give it to you though
just ult with CN and profit
i know a bunch of people are hype that the boss is now braindead
i mean it depends on what kind of player you are
though i'd prob get bored rq cause i'm RL <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i would unironically reinstall if AKA was still AE test just for that one boss
then i remember it's 2023
god i got so hype
i wanna live on those worlds
god i kinda miss those times
diavoros got the 500 iq take of i'm better than you, unless i'm not then you're tryhard/spend too much money
<:Toebeans:585731577963610122>
L
you know you can make them yourself right
happy passing out
is it even cross dressing
that sounds like he deserved it
i mean
you get along with people here
did you ask around?
i guess
it's still not
it's not
me when i'm a lawyer
the biggest, even
you're being the bigger tet and letting baban do it?
yeah so when you two figure out who's pulling then lmk, i also don't know how to spend the xtal so honestly do whatever
no
and then FGO i just deal 60% damage on ult
like in one ref i outdamaged a s3 PE
like FGO
for no reason
which i can't get the damage
cursed ass refs
there's just some
like on normal rot she does about as much damage as ref
okay, to be honest now, i'm pretty sure she is like at least 99.5% power level of standard 2s
she is at least s2 level
and still promote
but you can bash your head in the keyboard
like capping is mald as fuck
really really chill
2s PE in nirv is actually
<:smoge:959781798181736478>
living the dream i can't
my acc getting passed around like a slut at a party
cause my acc is still a vice
actually if anyone is going to play actively on my acc i'll have to check with blustorm peeps
idk
to decide
one of the mudae games
play like
you two fucking decide between yourselves
oh i'm not making any choice
and that's true for every PE boss
don't have the damage for the 2s strat
my acc straight up
oh if that hasn't changed, you should try the s0/s2 strat
maybe even a3
i'm RL tho
2s0
like don't grief it
y'all can do whatever the fuck you want with my account as long as it doesn't fuck up shit that's already there
yes
figure it out with baban
it's up for grabs
27, which is my age
common keilo L
fuck
7
hit me up in 3 years and i'll be as hype as i am now for the pulls
you have no clue
baban i can wait for so long
if no one wants to do it i don't care
so yeah i'm not joking but also
lmao i was going to install it and then i thought about it and it sounded like a lot of work
sure
anyone wanna login to my acc and spend the pulls?
i don't wanna install honkai
you don't have to be like that
that is what i mean
yeah that
you don't have to be like this
heki did you know
they should do it again
that sounds healthy
i see
so just to make clear, whenever i leave this chat it becomes teenager gossip?
wtf you mean again?
i guess it can be
is calling someone a twink even body shaming?
it's a webcomic, and that's about how much you should know about it
literally everything can be a homestuck reference, you just get desensitised after a while
homestuck is like jojo but worse
is it?
at least one
if you're serious i can spoiler them
conclusions?
and reached that conclusion
yeah i've searched my mind palace
i think your standards are low
catar has state mandated boob reduction surgeries
instead of using google i'll just search for emote alias
this is my new way of googling
have higher standards
jesus
yeah heki is right boobs can only get so big before they become artificial
that's not how babies work
heki you're going to have to learn some anatomy if you're going to use she/her
heki is on the she/her move?
type better scrub
can't imagine spending that much money to reach that
LMFAO i saw someone using that one the other day
but still
i know it's only a small upgrade from ç
god fucking damn it
that was actually really popular here 10 years ago
the comeback
oh shit
don't share here, carv doesn't like it
they are really mad actually
can't imagine not having ı
cringe
it's like the roblox one
yeah why is that
it's so fucking funny to me
i know i just like my quote name better
,help
oh
like
carv, you do ,.. then the quote name
it's okay, there's only like 2 people in this server who got the bot first try
also yeah it's ,. for register and ,.. to display
i fixed it but when i learned that discord put a warning sign for flashbangs i made it white again
LMFAO yeah i fucking love that
okay i'm going to install the game
yeah mihoyo 2023 makes you feel like shit with avg luck
should i login and spend my 28k xtal?
i'm proud
oh sheeesh
heki i learned earlier today that hrt was out
oh shit people are willing to spend that much?
mihoyo watched that and created discount banner
we all laughed at heki's 190 for HoS
i know it's my gigantic iq but the doctors call it cancer
thank you thank you my head hurts with how heavy my brain is
whoa
hrt is out?
wait
more like a 1/3rd
i wouldn't have called it a life hack
if it was rope
i got a life hack for you
hey
i tried so hard and so many times to swear
the name and description are still so funny to me
no matter how bad things get
he's bragged about the trafficking before
he's fucking turbo stupid
yeah that's true
tate is prob worse than logan and jake paul
like in a way, at least logan was scamming dumbass adults, it's a lil better than scamming kids <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
last i heard of him he was scamming kids with the team 100 thing
idk
sorry
i thought we were still talking about logan paul
oh
isn't he the better one of the two
common fragile W
she truly is
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i know some people talk about HoF and HoT like they're milfs
i mean i'm not judging
edgy 15 yo but still 15
i get it kinda but she still looks 15
who?
no
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
seele's coming in negative time?
you need to super lower your expectations
super kiana super jump
just jump 4head
yeah that one at least had some finnicky to get into bugged state
sheeesh
don't even need any effort anymore to break OW
keep coping
fucking cringe
imagine doing that
yeah
yeah riku ain't a bad player, just has weird spending prio
i have a pretty weird one too though
having 3s HoH while skipping some s0 and counting pennies to level up pris
riku's acc must be one of the weirdest whale acc out there
surely
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
riku
i think everyone from the bible did
that i just thought you mispelled judas and went what from the bible?
i've been away from the game enough
kinda cheap for the us
that's
there's certainly a market
i mean
oh
yeah they are
that's cool
though if it leaves you with a scar
yeah that's scary
and after that i was really paranoid to not fuck the stitches up
i only remember that getting the stitches was surprisingly chill
sorry i won't have a good answer to you, i'm realising i remember very little
what peels off?
idr how many stitches it was
like 2-3cm
i have but it was really small
i also only score low cause of my low rank valks
so true heki
PE is really really bad for crit
i dunno if what i said is true actually, i started thinking about phys bosses and they're all pretty bad
some phys ain't that bad for crit
i mean idk
never fucking mind i stay asleep
oh is it crit bald
i do have 3s sns
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it tells me you play in NA
yeah
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
the promote even
sheeesh the retain
is it fun?
oh.
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
wait the boss rn is husk?
that's why i'm like this
yeah when i was little i washed my hands after using the bathroom and that transitioned me
no
every interview she does with a rooster mask
she's never shown her face too
yeah
paru is the writer
paru has drawn porn of the two though
if you want to clear up basically the whole story is them getting together to some degree, they don't fuck in the manga though
but i will install the game if it's for nini <a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
i do have sumeru unlocked but i don't have the game installed
what am i being bugged about
i have 30 iq on avg
i remember when i asked how to pronounce your name
oh you're back with the 👟
jesus christ
not sure yet if there's essentine or not tho
card rate is 1.5% instead of 1%
and then more stuff up to 300, slows down though
i think
it's same as adv up to 100
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm so glad i quit
god
i'm not surprised it's s2 or die
cause if stamp on spending
do you have spending alr
cmon moriso
what
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
to abyss + ER as competitive content
it feels like they went from abyss + MA as competitive content
you know what it feels like
or just wait until powercreep eventually kills the older valks with decent TF
their plan to make a valk good in MA is just make new boss with insanely specific mechanic to force the new valk and half of the time it still gets stolen by HoT
they just don't design or plan around MA anymore
is just new gen valk design
from looking at the 9s refs, anyways
they have nuts damage which is why they still +1 but that's not as high amount of time they could save if they had the same amount of damage + decent TF
like it has a good amount of time stop which is great for abyss, but they have way less TF than like HoT, and the time stop doesn't really compensate in MA
honestly it's not even breaking it that hard
tho that's just personal, i know some people don't mind it as much, i just <a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
it ends up like pig transition, just wastes 10-20 seconds for no reason i fucking hate it
i'd fucking <:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
SO quick
that would get old
but if you had to grind that for a few hundred tries
pausing the stage to destroy the crystals is funny and interesting
does it
though also only -1 from HoF team
pig is a damage sponge
that's so much fucking damage
that pig is nuts
you're right
oh yeah they did for a sec there
and that is 1s higher than DPe
valk is there for moral support, truly
what
not even swap into flamescion
uh
wait did they
god i'd hate to play that
pause timer to clear crystals calmly
that's so fucking funny
LMFAO
qte on is the anomaly
yeah plenty
literally 0 iq
i like copy the ref perfectly with no qte, and then i go on cat and go wtf why aren't my bars full
cause i've done that so much
LMFAO okay but that one i swear there's some psychological shit about it
while the ref did an auto attack with griseo to proc turg
trying to understand why i wasn't dealing damage
on 3s wolf
i say that but i did spend about 20 minutes
the most obvious
but turg is literally
yeah like i understand most other sets
how do you not notice that
heki
i'm gonna be honest i have no fucking clue what boss it is
-100 instead of -200
that's RL
simply skill issue
try harder and you'll get the uprate
smh
quitter talk
duh
just get the uprate
you can stop pulling at one set
chill jayson
ai generated heki
jayson carry the bruh torch
don gerk
it gets bigger i swear
and then procceeded to not invest further
you have paid the price of the most cost effective valk in the game
so you have the gacha but not the farmable?
when you said you didn't have her gear i thought you didn't have her weapon
what
tet just because we're gay and posting :dongerj: and you're reading it doesn't mean you're reading gay porn
LMAO i love it
:dejj:
lore accurate though
no space in the room for his enormous tits
looks sick
sheeeesh
but they could've just done that instead of fucking up the content too
i'm glad they made it more straightforward
so fucking stupid tho
the crafting system was
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
cool i'm not learning how this works then
i saw on beta that it was going away and i went
idk, i joined on the last patch of bounty
it's so bad
cause he liked the multiplayer aspect of it, and UM coop is shit
like there's one old player from blustorm that just p much quit over bounty removal
when it's shit content or contrived shit like pins i don't care that much, but it's fucked up when they remove actual good content that just need update
yeah it's so annoying
like repeatedly when content becomes slightly outdated mihoyo just forget about it instead of fixing it
i'm majj over it
mihoyo don't balance shit for MA anymore
WT nowadays is basically
AL + AW valk top 1 prio
2s/2s1 HoR second prio (if you have her dk)
3s LE third prio
dorm buffs fourth prio
because she just nuke and kill, meanwhile DA has to do the ballista bullshit
in RL i think VKE still beat DA
even after DA, a high enough rank VKE still beat s0 DA i think
like AKA was a VKE boss before DA
VKE was useful on release and then had a patch long revival for MA
BR was heimdall killer before HoF
himeko still had her niches, esp as BD carry
i honestly think no valk was useless on release
i think kinda f2p friendly too?
yeah, before exalted and early exalted she was pretty good with missile stacking
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
if you have other investment then i'd go for BN
yeah but if you're mainly invested and using phys team, SN is better than BN for that one team
depends on what teams you depend on
for the 1 boss every 5 patches she'll get
2s1 HoR is nice but like
like SN is useless if you don't have phys team to benefit from the dorm bonus
that should be highest prio
whatever unlocks a dorm bonus that you don't have yet for a type of damage you have investement in
and then half of senpri uses is in 2s instead of 3s, which is getting offed eventually
though like half of the time in MA you still use neb
if you're like big MA player then yea prob an okay move to go for senpri
like even with max senpri, you'd still use neb almost 100% of the time in abyss <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
yeah i wouldn't bother with either prob
that sounds right
idr senpri
neb increase is pretty small, it can make a big difference in niche situation
not really
but RL you just need sp cause damage is free
cause senpri thing is a bit less sp for better damage
like 100% of the time
for RL player, you prob only use neb
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
an MA only weap at this point
DoS is like
ice cream or you're a pussy
<:majj:1035066587331448863>
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> <a:danse:1035066880194510859>
do you wanna see my new brand of emotes i want to popularise
<a:Wave:995380866832420994>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
everyone here is a furry, some just don't know yet
i do
but far for me is like anything more than 5cm
i technically can also see near
what?????
i don't leave my bed without my glasses
how
why
common bot W
bundles can prob make it cheaper but that sounds right
yeah that makes more sense
do you mean to like complete your funds right?
200 for 190 pulls?
<a:aworryThinkMath:865137541857673226>
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
do mine and i'll let you do yours
<a:PU_pepeHmmMath:850331115637833728>
should change every patch
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
classic honkai
keeping the more boring of the two support
but i'm guessing GD stays
haven't logged in a month
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
idk
literally every 3s boss is -1 chill and last sec is hell <:Deadge:945150922894508063>
-1 is like reeeeal chill tho, even with very meh gears it's fine
if you're going for cap, you'll prob have more luck asking someone who's actually gotten it like clicky or pat than me tho, i only failed for a long time
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
just hope it drops close to you instead of far
and Just Get Lucky on the sp pack drop
it's a combination of better positioning on GD qte at the very beginning
as far as i can tell
yeah that's the part i have issue with on v lucky runs
i pulled for it so i could have one for eden and another for the KMB strat on doom
thank god i have EoP dupe
i'll tuck you in
<a:PeepoSleep:1002644795992322169>
<:Madge:909232418379153418> 👉 🛏️
should go the fuck to sleep
the 2 kids
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
uni expects it
yeah dw
it's loggers
<:Loggers:1002644846449791137>
yeah me too
what kinda math you doing?
log tables?
paper cutting?
damn
oh
or like in an apartment or smth
do you live in a house?
cat mode
yea run around the house a bit
did you eat the uranium
<:PeepoSitBASED:986284656586551366>
or watching things on fire break
we should have watching things blow up break
instead of recess
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
all my chem classes were all theory
they sound fun
those chem classes
i've never had like
armpit pussy
huge nono
yeah, doing it out of the blue with no planning sounds like
tell them to fuck off and not smoke inside
yeah choking is kinda scary, i think there's like safety measures if you do wanna do it
i think it's called sexual harassment
actually
kinda kinky
no one above 19 will understand this heki says before booting up chatgpt
cause you're like 10
in a platonic way tho, like a good friend
yeah
yes you may ask the question cherry
are you actually waiting for us to give you permission to ask a question
...yes?
a back to genshin question
how is that
can we chill
it's the final kiana suit, they have to make her do everything
there we go
i still don't have it
where's the one yae armpit emote
armpit is the kinkiest thing a genshin player knows
cause i play muted, i see y'all complaining about it meanwhile i'm like this is really similar to other valk
you know how i know how impactful sfx is?
like sfx does soooo much
you'd be surprised how much sfx + cleaning up the inputs can make something look way better
trio is kinda meh tho
idk i think kiana ult is sick
if you're talking about ult animation
clearly unfinished
then it's v1
general animation
i mean if you're talking
cause half of the valks suits aren't realistic for combat
then i'll just think you have some hidden reason you don't understand
but if you're putting the criticism for the new 2 valks that they aren't realistic for combat
i love those designs, and i don't care that they aren't realistic for combat
i mean to be clear
MPE is prob chill tho yea
could fuck you up
the frills at the back
SN is probably fucked to fight with
but after a point they straight up stopped caring
maybe you can cope yourself that the earlier ones kinda did
like none of the valks have actual good mobility suits
or her booba would flop out irl
DPe can't walk too fast
idk literally every valk has that
but if you have problem with how it would work mechanically speaking
like i get it if you dislike how it look
the size of her hair
do you see
mei clearly doesn't care about combat performance
a lil different
i mean is not people saying it, it's the devs saying it
lumi i still don't know why you're playing the game
the design of the trio is p good
i do think
<:PeepoSitBASED:986284656586551366>
and getting my first MA t10
my finish was after resetting my trophies back to 3k for the first time
poetic
based mei puller
i guess it is real cheap if you don't care about kiana
are you even going for rank ups
in abyss idk
in MA yea
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
is just a game, chill
don't force yourself to do anything that isn't fun
yeah that's fair
<:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
it could be the last HoT boss
really?
i have pig ptsd
just gotta stall enough but not too much
i was going to say the same thing, that zhenyi duration just looks like really tight shit
but i'll prayge
optimistic
82 sounds
i'd rather fucking die
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
have to do dailies to max the new blockade
honkai 2023 just try dumb shit cause mihoyo might be wrong about the game
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
could be mistranslation
you could try it though
pretty meh
yea that sounds
idk you might be able to raise your score on a few
so you can see how high you can score with that
yeah
i mean look for trial ref
f2p player here
<:peepoSit:1016193458307862609>
i did it too
yeah i remember last patch was chill to max
and see how high cn is scoring
with trial
maybe look for refs?
yeah i dunno
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like t5 in each barely has enough
that's kinda nuts right
to have an idea to how high you can realistically get
i mean still tho is nice to see how high they're scoring
i thought i remembered being able to
you can't?
like what's t10 from each challenge
how's t100 for the 3 deep trial?
what the fuck then
yeah this is not a nsfw channel
also wtf boo
and see if you have everything maxed
go back on the normal stages
deep trial?
where are the points coming from?
kinda unhinged i enjoyed myself
i watched his pll videos
oh i know that guy
peeposit truly S-tier emote
<:peepoSitGamer:984923819619795034>
<:peepoSitBusiness:983753431078547496>
best server i ever joined
<:PeepoSitFishing:1058108500775018596>
they have so much peeposit
you should join the zajef server
<:peepoSit:1016193458307862609>
point and laugh at the eli that doesn't have peepoSit
L
<:nothing:990283279032803338>brent
<:nothing:990283279032803338> <:thoughtbubble:990282637270716476> 
<:peepoSit:1016193458307862609>
LMFAO
that p2 looks kinda fun honestly
holy
fragile is so clean
i kinda vibe w it
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
then why even bother with time reversal
yeah like you just add more time stop
and then there's no time
time stop in normal attack
there's not many gimmicks you can do after this
like the game is nearing it's end at this point <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
right?
having time stop in skills is so scary
better than perfection <a:DuckSmh:1006448360200347699>
yea okay
better than AE
who cares
yeah you can be a she/her dad
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
EVERYONE goes to sleep and wake up wishing they were a girl, you're just supposed to endure it
like there was one conservative transphobic post which was like
i love some good denialposting
so so funny to me
the denial is always
oh god yeah i was definitely bi then
no actually i was definitely bi then
god in 2016 i was eating dirt
that's nice <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
greece pilled
ty carl
cause that shit is fucking bonkers
people who can stand it should be rewarded like 20x the minimum wage
making social activity your job sounds like actual hell on earth to me
i know i wouldn't
you could prob get started on that
would you
<:gigachad:950480147084115968>
yeah i'm going to the manly bar where there's only men
so fucking funny actually
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
kids and their games meanwhile your game is booba fiesta
like it could be a lot worse <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
aw that's nice tho
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
so i believe
so so so so good
uni can be
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
uni life
start clean with no way for her to infiltrate
and format phone
back up everything
like honestly, if you think your privacy is being breached
remove it
can't you just
can she even go through your texts
how
aw that's nice
oops typo i'm lebanese
you should've just told him
so you'd be surprised
and they didn't get the clue
look babe when i was 5 i told my parents kids were making fun of me, calling me a girl, and then i actively didn't stop doing the things that made them call me a girl
<:peepoBusiness:995465051391660105>
yeah i'll prob be on the closet for my family forever
like even most of the big conservatives have big left leaning ideals, they just warp them so fucking hard it's like they're in a circus
but they think of it very little
most normies are probably very very left leaning in actual core ideals
i mean i'm gonna be honest
yeah
like what the fuck even
i'm like more than 20 and i wouldn't survive out there
18 is like a fucking baby
i can't fucking imagine throwing your kid out when they're 18
yeah i think it's so normal in a bunch of countries outside of the US
like LMFAO
don't underestimate them
god if they're conservative
US is fucking nuts man
it's so normal in brazil to just hang around with your family
and literally no one cares
i have an aunt which is pushing 50 and she still lives with her grandparents
apparently it's a fucking real thing in the US, i always thought it was a movie thing
like that's fucking insane to me
and let them figure shit out
apparently it's way more common in US to just throw your kid out in the streets at 18
idk if it has legal implications
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that's unironically going i did an awful job raising you so now i'm calling it quits
holy shit
astronomical L
a big
like that's such
honestly imagine disowning your own child
evn might be american
i literally can't either <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
3 now
heki there's like 2 american people in this server
yeah we're para socialising right now
yeah that sounds like a W honestly
i hate my dad when he's drunk but the most he does is being obnoxious, can't imagine shit like that
yeah that's scary
jesus
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
honestly living with him is doing wonders to me, now i can even dodge a few punches
they only make awful decisions about once a patch
yea unironically <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
every other time they're great
mihoyo only takes my money every 6 weeks
i wish i could live like that
that's kinda funny tho
which is not judging them, i'm sure they have their issues
if they have no intent of doing anything, then it's just a waste of effort and emotional work to keep trying to help them
but it has to come from them
you can help them if they want to get better
you can't force people to fix themselves
ty jerma
my take for situation like this is like
realistically speaking, you shouldn't lash out and add to her issues, being stuck in an abusive relationship is harsh and not easy to get out of
but also, you are not required to keep spending time and effort on her if it only makes you feel like shit. if it's actively hurting you, then you should check out or care less
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
then quit
realise game still sucks
play a bit on a great acc
is for your own good
i'm trying to make you retire
what
though it ain't in nirv anymore
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
you can play in my acc for a bit if you wanna experience sadness
idk i'm not as aggressive as you are but i would do something similar to you
yea i have fucking ptsd from that <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
hi cherry, love you
they're consistently and constantly making so many bad choices
but you can only get spit on your face so many times before you get sick of it
i think a lot of it is so great
i still do
i mean i love the game
based i think
honestly
LMFAO
therapy salesperson
therapy
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
i'm so sorry for your loss, being a competitive player on a mihoyo game
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
like all other competitive player
hit me up in 2 years when you quit
oh god
why are you playing
50% of content
if you don't simp kiana you lose like
honkai is a simp kiana game
cause like
simp for literally everyone else in honkai
do you like
not hating
start loving for 0 reason
you need more love in your life
just to continue choking and dying in your bed
you'd wake up exhasperated, scared and confused
would it even, i think if you choke while asleep you wouldn't stay asleep
holy fuck
and heki sends death threats
i call lumi L
jesus
that's L umi
Lumi
unironically think they'd score better with triple support
like honestly
drop the HoT and just run GD dps at this point
physically hurts
this one
this is the i logged in for the first time after 4.3 i can't believe there's a new mei
must be really hard playing with one hand
a2/a3/a4 player with 2s valk
yeah honestly i feel bad for RL player
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the S FR
god
yeah HoT is nuts
you didn't even need to evade in nirv
honestly last BKE
oh yeah true
you could try ice team
L
my 2s struggles
yeah it's awful
type counter bonus sucks
i don't actually think the hp amount is different
win win
and type counter wolf i don't have to play
lightning wolf is fun
both
honestly
even the bullshit ones
i unironically love her bosses
i mean i fucking wish she was around more often
bosses MIA since 5.5
yea LMFAO
is anyone a big IO player
realistically speaking
but like
i'd prob think is a good investment if you're a big IO player
yeah like
so you really gotta ask yourself is that price to pay worth it for that <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
the impact of force lightning qte can be big for team where you need it like IO and HoT, but when we say big it's like 30-50 points in nirv abyss and 2-5 seconds in MA
kiana elf will prob be overall better on abyss cause she'll also benefit fire team
cause HoT is broken and 3s klein can often save 2+ seconds on refs over 2s klein or other elfs
if you're big MA player
i would prob only recommend klein over kiana
but i'm p sure 2s kiana will be universally better value than 2s klein if you only have ely on your acc
depending on what teams you have and what your goals are
if you could afford 3s then maybe the answer would be different
if you can only afford one 2s elf, then kiana will prob be the better deal
2s klein won't have much over kiana elf
3s klein will have force qte over any rank kiana elf
nvm the old stuff
which is why backpulling sucks, 99.9% of player alr can't afford the new stuff
cause the new stuff is higher prio
if you already have all the new stuff
you only get to backpulling
like you always have to think about it on prio from meta standpoint
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'll tell you that much
then you def can't afford klein
if you can't afford kiana elf
i mean
if you're going to pull for one
just go for kiana elf
depends on what you want
so i couldn't hit the other with pv active
my opener was shit cause half the time i ended up inside one of the mechs
yeah now you're enjoying true honkai
else you need to wait for turg cd to try again
you need them to be real close so the AoE from application splashes on all of them
it's why turg application on mob floors is so awful
turg application has a small AoE, you need them to be close so the aoe from turg application procs on both of them
even if you hit both with GD, one of them is hit first, apply turg, and then on second it's on cd
turg application has cd
hmm wdym
though i think some strats do make use of oz hitbox to push them together after they're spawned
yeah i don't think it's oz's doing, just different positioning before they spawn affect how they spawn for some reason
spawn displacement is all so you can get turg on both with GD qte
if you do nothing, then they spawn too far apart to both get turg by GD
apply turg on both
so that GD qte
the gather matters
and the GD qte
by that i mean one fischl active on each
hit them both with fischl active to apply debuff on both
what you need to do is group them
okay so
chill
then you have playtime on your acc
it's like, i've spent more time in one opener trying to get it right
when someone says took 30 tries i'm tryharding
like is the one thing everyone says
i'll see if i can find it
there was like one ref
but with ppm it'll be like impossible to deal same amount of damage to both cause one will have ppm and the other not
better grouping and targetting can help
and then with tband it'd be more consistent
so there's a chance that with ppm, you'll have the damage to kill one of the mobs but not the other
the problem with ppm is that it'll only proc on one of the mechs
idk i think ppm should be better if you have no issue with killing the mobs
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
but it's because they only upload the one that worked
yeah there's tons of tricks which look really simple in ref
that's literally unironically every abyss with mobs
literally every abyss
do you mean
just gotta stop on the right spot
which is basically just walk up until a certain point on the ground, spawn oz and wait
than the ones i used to use
waaaay harder to get consistent
that looks
like the one with going around into mechs to make them drop nearer
60/40
but i think even the best ones for me still were like
just look around for refs and try to find a good one
there's some setups that work way better than others for me
it's very finnicky
it is
```PLAY ANOTHER VALK```
i have the guide for the non-7t right here
here's my chance
oh
too fast
damn
want screenshots for what you need?
no the server is at least up here
oh
or maybe medbae just quit and left it as WIP <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
prob just changing stuff in preparation
it says they're in WIP for phase 2
maybe i should've just gone back to IO
idk it doesn't feel like 10 min for me
you know how good it feels to not do ER every week
i was doing 2.75x before i quit
<:collapsedwoggers:652852676228546611>
<:2woggers:658553078420602901>
i think i'm finally out of nirv
my current trophy graph
i'm trying to keep you awake <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
oh shit spending event news?
sleep well <a:Pat:914638151069356062>
o yea rime parv
what else
bella, tank, heim, AKA
fire bosses rn are
i wonder how well she does at the less neutral fire bosses, almost all of them are mech
the neutral fire boss tho
bella is p much
v1 END pack a punch
kinda surprising to me tho
crazy how it works
with just the release of one valk
S-tier -> B-tier boss
<:smoge:959781798181736478>
so fuxi is better for the opener
but you can't ignite if there's no enemy
cause like SpA QTE is ignite
yeah that shit fucks me up on SpA wolf
i think those 2 are the only ones
fuxi forces fire qte
no
so true
smh mihoyo
f2p would have way more resources
they should've waited until 6.5 honestly
rest well eli
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
<:TeriPoint:1033130036284370984> 🛏️
i feel so heard right now
oh yea we sure are
so who the fuck is actually being heard
CN complain they don't get heard, only NA get heard
NA complain they don't get heard, only CN get heard
yeah
i'm doomposting in a meta way
spending usually v2 tho
about us
i don't think they care
tdm is only BN and MC
he should be getting a salary from mihoyo
fragile backbone of current honkai society
mine is worse
who cares
then just pull w/e the fuck
do you even care about being competitive
she/they angle
keep up the good work
any self improvement is something to be proud of
no i would
but i am to tell you that that's not what you need
i'm not equipped to tell you what you need
i'm very proud
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
you need therapy
what's that mean
turbo hate one valk for no reason
more like alt!diavoros
i'd love to see what kind of bs AI-generated keilo says
maybe there's some setting that can only take this server into acc tho
yeah
sols had it for a while but they removed it cause it was doxxing people, taking message history from other servers into acc
so we can have actual AI generated tet and cherry
based on their message history
which can generate user message
there is actually a bot
on this server alone
170k messages
tet has
idk they send a fuckton of messages
sleep well!
it sends it
oh if i click it
wtf
<:KianaS:857055780855218227>:crackpipe:
oh sheeesh
i want a crack pipe emote
how do i do alias search
<a:kianacrack_hh:770947100817096704>
what's wrong with being a crack addict
my dad says similar stuff but only when he's drunk
my mom said i don't deserve any love
look see no one would say that
cause they ain't making any fucking sense
when did we replace tet and cherry with AI generated messages
hey guys
hah, potato boy
history repeats itself
carv leaving heki
LMFAO
🚮
goddamn it devs
the hare2 is woke
oh
like often i write shit before thinking about it, after sending it i just paused and fucking laughed my ass off
i don't think i've ever laughed more than writing before and after schariac pussy
and i'm like i would rather fucking die
like he's making 10 patch plans about valk release
i just complain about the game 24/7 LMFAO
i swear i'm like the most butthurt person here about honkai
i'm like just waiting until he blocks me
carv when he's stuck with us
i love that gif so much
we have the same mindset
<:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
i mean after i made fun of you enough now there's like 3 people who can
and fucking no one could figure out how to make a quote
remember when we first put this bot here
can't make one fucking typo
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
then i made that quote
i was one of the few ones on the good list
and putting everyone on bad list
i'm pretty sure baban was going on a joker arc
that's a great name for the quote
LMFAO
LMFAO i feel bad about making that one too
okay
oh it's just a zzz person
like actually 25 iq
for making shit like this quotes
turbo smart
i'm like
jesus fuck
oh god
and i cropped it and made it a quote
cause he was defending me
there is one fenripedo which i feel really bad about
yeah
racist or smth
people might think you're like
you should work on your grammar
like a really bad image
yeah that one gave
7?
i'm glad that one is sarcasm
mhm
oh the rare kitten racist moment
really weird grammar issue that one
yeah um
surely
grammar issues
just
yeah i'm sure those are all
oh the carv one is pretty good
there's not many but they all blow
all ,.. [name] quotes are fucking terrible
you should be proud
it's not sad
idk ask tet
yea the tet one is rng
tet is so stupid
god
i try to make all my quotes very easy to remember
yea i'm fucking trying over here
i'm not a bitch though
mihomo trying to make me unretire
meeting all my fwens now that i'm retired
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
this cycle
clicky did
nirvana forever <:Deadge:945150922894508063>
i'm actually still nirvana last time someone @'d me about it
trade?
you made grandma cry
<a:LewdThoughts:635507088793141338>
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
me next?
no
why do you only care about M piece
only the natural scientific ones
i don't believe in made up pronouns
why do y'all think nini is old
do you miss me on t3?
cause my abbreviations are way less horny and i explain them
i'm iriyalite
yeah though HoFS is also a good one
like idk how good END will be outside of trio team
i think general prio for player prob wants HRT -> END -> flamescion
aw cute!
only 2?
well, or newt/irene/we
cez B is always better outside of very niche situation where you need the extra freeze or the 10sp
always cez B
you are very special <a:nod:774308559487369237>
you are special, but not because you're a bottom
yea IO has some during burst
yeah i have more than slight trauma
you aren't special
heki 3/4ths of this server are bottoms, we play fucking gacha games
it must be some shit like 15th -> 1st
so that better placement must be fucking worth it
like think of it like this, you're paying that price for getting a better placement in one boss
you still promote
then that doesn't matter
cause if it causes you to move from 3rd to 1st
i mean, like to any actual reward degree
is that going to benefit you right now?
what
i'm quitege
like there's no way
cause otherwise you'd have quit by now
honestly i'm moving to the idea that if you're still playing you can afford to pull every banner at s0 minimum
who doesn't
i'm pretty sure it doesn't matter for DPe strats
i remember the SW strat had some moveset rng
i think the HoT cap was the only with gear rng
but i can cope
no
then that'd be cool
if they made 4s boss good
i dislike it because they make it awful
like i don't hate 3s boss out of spite or anything
yeah
i'd be interested
honestly
slacc harder
i'll tell him i'm proud
oh sheeesh
what
what even is that
18!!
2012 was 18 years ago
2018 was 7 years ago today
kinda crazy to think about
honestly never any point to focusing too much over v1
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
sleep well
sword mode?
i got it early <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
retired mode?
or some shit like that
yeah she has moon and time mode
can't rotate at all without dante
like BKE
like even some really old valk
we do have some valk like that already
SpA ragna TB thales M 99.4% effectiveness
forced to put most broken effect on M piece or else you get
but for M piece
yeah fire valk has a newt B problem
6.5 valk will have requires weapon to be summoned on field
2023 honkai
are you surprised
i mean
wooo happy new years :D
oh
aka went through them
ranks absolutely are in beta
oh is about to be new years
ty carl
her independent multiplier is kinda bonkers
that sounds about avg
is that abnormal?
now suffer
you brought this upon yourselves
or do they go you fucked it up
do they go our newest s-rank should be able to defeat up to 520d bosses at 3s or some shit like that
like what even the fuck
yeah the one that was 492 recently
like to any degree
at all
cn ios dist
they balance valk around
do you think
god
turbo awful
and that sounds
and reposition
you might need to pause time
like in 3s MA
to be so fucking annoying
that has the potential
none of this 425 pussy shit
my girl kiana balanced around 492d
obviously <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
o yea yea
which?
well
yeah
week two 6.4 so we figured out that 3s turg cat is better than s0 HRT on trio team
week one 6.4 wow trio team is busted!
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
always the support
and have enough damage to compare to standard team
to make a trio team work
how much you gotta shill
it just goes to show tho
jesus fuck <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
80 -> 90 -> 100
jesus christ what the fuck
if she still had normal sp cost
is that they literally couldn't figure out how to balance the team out
like the only reason i can imagine why
that just sounds so unnecessary
why did they even make HRT ult only 50sp anyways in trio team
but still kinda funny <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
with 50sp ult
i mean i guess she prob doesn't need it
LMFAO
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
the mode that isn't going to exist anymore soon
on 2s ma
you know where you'd see that a bunch?
that's kinda fucked up
i remember that gif but i thought it was removed content or smth
what
so much cooler
oh what that is
so i still didn't see it
he picked the schizo signet
even the one time i watched aka playing ER
without having the rest of the trio
haven't seen the base END ult
i actually still
oh wait
you mean HRT?
they have very cool looking aspect on kit you just end up ignoring cause they balance it to be useless
it happen so often in genshin too
i'm like unironically kinda pissed about it, it feels like a waste
and everyone has done it once, on tutorial, and never seen it again
it look really cool
like DPe basic attack string
never fucking uses it
and then the valk just
to design and test the prettiest coolest normal attack string ever
mihoyo spend 500 combined hours of devtime
that's literally every valk
pussies
then autoplay harder
if the gimmick for the new valk is that they autoplay
they're fucking cowards
that's what i'm saying
all the way to that
if the game just autoplays
very tight
does it matter if the buff requirement is
but yeah like idk
don't get it
i literally
it always lags for like .5s to me
at the very beginning when mobs spawn
i don't fucking know what they do to it
MA HoD
god
like rimestar
though some boss fights are fucking pushing it
i mean sure but idk how much they can balance around it could lag and fuck you over
eh
and if they're consistent it's p fine
like the double cleave on PE
like there's some tight combos in the game alr
i mean that's prob fine tho
i feel it's kinda cheap to have half the inputs just not matter timing wise
but even still
then i'll be proven wrong
to get the entire combo out
if it stays as tight as it is
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
randomly dodging around trying to proc the branch attack
i remember aka just like
cause a bunch of skill on flamescion look really unfinished from gameplay standpoint
idk that could just be weird input timings from v1
and i don't like that much
skill ceiling for trio team looks really low
and idk
like half of the kit just pause the game and wait for you to press the button
is just that they all look braindead to play
they look sick
like my issue with the animations isn't the animations
yeah but idk
HRT is being fully reworked for 6.4 <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
LMFAO yeah i noticed that
that was pretty funny
i remember silence boobnia ult
aponia also had no vfx
eh idk v2v beta was p unfinished
which i'm not completely against
like very style for the  sake of style
a lot about trio design feel
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
and then quit
i pulled CN, played her badly on heimdall
i do
it also looked pretty bad
though
it didn't look that bad
i should've come back to play that
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
the ice one?
bena who
now that she isn't being shilled she's gone away
she was turbo shilled in MA
like in MA specifically
way above average for s-rank
that she ended up being like
but then they shilled her so hard
like for the price, still a deal
idk def below avg i think
for a few patches
like unimaginably hard
so fucking hard
but they shilled her
like looking at her in a vacuum she wasn't that powerful
anyways yeah SpA was a weird valk
yeah that sounds right
those are the stig boxes i remember <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and also a random lee box
handel technically
sorry fixed it for tet
and that one we didn't
was made in abyss
like i remember the other refund supply
nvm then
it's been so long
oh god
she did?
SpA we didn't get box
she wasn't, was she?
like outside of shit like FT
this is the cheapest s0 4/4 we've ever had i think
reaaally cheap
flamescion is like
i wouldn't be surprised if it stayed that way
and honestly
that's how i feel too
most player rn have >s0
not only she has to do some work to even meet s0 HoF output
i think i said then, i don't see END stealing anything from HoF, even if she gets enough buffs
i think that acc HoF is s0
that sounds about right
trio team isn't supposed to deal the most damage, it only exists to answer bosses where they force you to use more than one element
it'd be turbo stupid if she dealt straight up more damage on trio team
i mean yea it should be
but idk if she needs to
i guess she could see some buffs to have some utility outside trio team, cause rn i don't think she'll have much
from trio team
it's v v hard to steal her bosses
and like even if you nerf her a good amount she'll still have those bosses
like the state she is at rn she has her bosses
i wouldn't say END needs buffs tho
and she doesn't TF string nearly as hard
she doesn't paralyse for one
would she even steal anything from HoT
like at s0/s2
but idk, even if flamescion gets a good amount of personal buffs idk if she's going to see much play for avg player
yea only v1, i could see END getting some small buffs and flamescion getting a good amount of personal buffs
i'd prob go for HRT if you can't afford all 3, competitively speaking
i think flamescion is pretty meh outside of trio team
how v1 kinda look to me
cause it actually slows down stage timer
well that one is different
yeah idk about that one then, evade only sounds right
oh you're talking about the one status
idk what's the name of it slowing down shit going on around you but not timer?
shinzan, that is
i think her combo is time slow
true
oh really?
the one that let's me alt tab and check discord
i want the long normal no interaction ult one
<:Madge:1058108488661880832>
i want the long animation
but they skip the animation
force special QTE and waste everyones time all in one
and auto change valk during the ult animation
just make the ult animation different when trio team
i mean it's pretty simple
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
giving what the players ask
pussies
the cg for this chapter just dropped and it's just the newest abyss
like fuck it just make the fight a full cinematic at this point
okay hot take: they're cowards for skipping HRT ult animation with joint QTE
i guess that's fair
for most players HRT is for trio team
but like lets not kid ourselves
with how powerful she is realistically speaking she is prob the highest prio out of the 3
i mean sure i'm not saying there are no reasons to pull for her outside of trio team
that's extra stupid <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
patch note changed HRT skills?
wait did they actually just
i'm like 100% sure most people who pulled HRT was in preparation for trio team, making the 3s retroactively useless for that team is a spit on the face on some amount of player who pulled for it to make the trio team good and the investment ended up useless
it's like sure it has it's uses but most people who pull for it are not pulling her for the the 3s husk in MA yk
idk it's like if aponia had a 3s like deals +50% tdm when PV not on team
but also useless for trio team
actually turbo nuts
yeah you get +40 sp every rot
well, not that it doesn't work, but doesn't impact it
idk i find it really really disgusting that it doesn't work on trio team
it's basically like a better 3s HoS
it gives her a fuckton of sp when she transforms into mecha form
like bare minimum they should make 3s of the first trio team support useful for the trio team
i mean yeah i guess but still feels really really disrespectful
like oh no trio team isn't playable without 3s HRT! oh well guess we just make it useless now
yeah that's actually disgusting
they just retroactively made 3s so much worse
that's kind of shit isn't it
lmfao why
yeah it's fucking nuts
well i guess they can just make her dk also enable her to do an extra combo attack per rot or some shit like that
like i guess it would save some points in abyss but not that many, idk if the pause on support buff duration would enable her doing much more
would HoF even benefit much from it tho
that's actually pretty true, watching flamescion gameplay is so weird with her stopping time every so often
peeposit dlc pack
holy fuck
<:PeepoSitBASED:986284656586551366>
kinda nuts
like on most bosses you switch to FR and it's -0 or -1
at least in MA, FR capscore is actually really really close to GD capscore
that GD looks sad
prob FR i think
not really <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
makes me not want to play
watching gameplay
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and was thinking of going for it eventually
i was like exactly 1 card from 2s
for that strat
you didn't need 2s SW
<:Deadge:945150922894508063>
really am dead
everyone else is s2 or s1
and some other bp valk
only 2s gacha valk was PE and IO
mine was s2 btw
chill out buddy
why is it so important, ruby
they realised the money they make come from casual player and they don't care about this shit, they didn't do blockade, they ain't doing this either
abusing the try hard players
honestly they're just
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
LMFAO
is gonna grow so old so quick
but having it every patch
yeah it's a nice fun event to have once, a lil filler but okay
like no one finds this actively fun
even if they gave sick rewards i still think it's worse experience wise, just trying to make player sink more time in the game for no reason
it's kinda shitty
for the same rewards, even
now they're trying to make you keep checking in on it every day
like before that aspect of the game was a one and done thing each week
i dunno even still i don't like it
yea i guess you can p safely get every reward if you have a decent team on last day
also idk if 1 extra week of slacc is worth rushing it on the last day taking like 5x longer
to level up the equip thingies
there's some daily stuff no
can you rush it all last day and still get full rewards?
blockade is basically a raid, not a week long event
just a lot more work and attention to get around same rewards
i mean downgrade in terms of experience
i kinda liked it <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
that's kinda sad actually that they just straight up killed blockade
like blockade was kinda annoying but way faster + it had MA score which is s-tier
i'm fucking so surprised, this is surely a downgrade for players right
is it better rewards than blockade?
or do you keep the pri raid + new event
during those 2 weeks
so yea do you just lose the pri raids then?
so usually on 3rd and 4th week
is prob in the middle right? because this is a 5 week patch
2nd and 3rd week??? that's so fucking stupid <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
during those weeks do you just not get a pri raid?
on the first 2 weeks?
when during the patch does it happen?
but the event was like 3 weeks long or smth
cause blockade was twice a patch
i'm so confused
wait so it just keeps on going the event?
literally shortselling themselves
3s trial valk has less attack than my s0
it's actually funny
yeah idk what they feed the trials
that's so bad LMFAO
holy fuck
i'm so glad i quit
what the fuck
what
that event is still happening
it might not be possible still
that wasn't implemented yet
back when i played
omg me too
that is very cute
aw it really is honestly
LMFAO these mihoyo expy getting more and more wild man
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm saying i quit before using her
yeah i'm not saying i don't have her
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i've never played CN
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i guess i'll be like at least RL by the time they release
i don't need to pull for her to do that tho
but with honkai, what can i even do with the newest valk 0/4
cause i could log in and spend my 28k on some valk and play with her for 10s and retire again
i kinda wish this was genshin now tho
retire soon retire early
HoH was the last valk of my gen
and not doing anything
is so nice to be in a sunday
retire too
how long until you quit?
cringe
imagine 2sing valks
alt!gresham
hua2 on every valk build
tet is the CN player iriya warns you about
so you can't for this week
though, is today sunday? i haven't spent any tries
you actually can if you want to
truly <a:nod:774308559487369237>
<:pepehang:419856401310154752>
i'm gonna, hang in there, if you know what i mean! :D
thank you so much cherry!
is there any good investment at all in this game
i read SW as silverwing
it really depends on the valk
and then you can do w/e the fuck you want
i can give you my login deets
lmfao
game isn't installed
no
my BKE is 2s3
i guess you can count some like BKE
PE
or did i just pick the bad ones
is there any good 2s investment
and neither of them feel like good investment
i have 2 gacha only valk at 2s
you know
it wasn't really worth it
ooo i did that too
picking a name is privilege for the transes
are you even surprised
and we'll reconsider
gay harder next quarter
yes, not only do you not pass the turing test you are also getting your gay pass revoked
tet you wouldn't pass the turing test
for when people are being weird in general chat
panic room maybe
twice a month genshin abyss discussion?
what becomes of this chat
when everyone retires from honkai
so okay let's talk about it
is how i'm playing all their games right now just zzz
honestly it's already released for me
my dad answers the same thing to my text messages
i'm never wrong
i dunno what i was right about but of course i was
which sucks cause it ain't installed
makes me want to hard uninstall
thinking about the game
i'm so very proud
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
yeah i plan to once i fix my pc
oh
should i
that would break MA
i'm glad i quit LMFAO
that would make a lot of sense, huh
wtf is going on in honkai LMFAO
i'm not surprised
yea with bundle like that
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
true, when you get your internet back you can pivot into being a tft pro
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
aw that kinda sucks
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
are you also retiring?
last abyss?
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
make me afford it next
cool that sounds awful
what's the next boss?
okay i'm over it
i can't believe it
<:cry:944955259636285481>
that can't be
w-what
what do you mean already left?
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i'm only back to experience husk in abyss
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
okay time to log in and do husk
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
i am sickge
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
someone send help
i wake up in a cold sweat thinking about that rain attack
i see couatl every time i close my eyes
if one just runs FR they can prob smash keyboard and retain most lobby
actually maybe it's not that bad
(thank fuck)
mimimi always does meme refs
mimi used SW as a meme
most tries i didn't have enough damage
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
idk i had a bunch of stuff over keeb and still did less damage
i see
or does the higher dist make it awful
as last husk
is it the same thing
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
retire for so long that my level bracket is going to be called exalted 1 when i come back
i think i'm close but i'm not stopping there
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
makes me not want to log in
being reminded about gd pri tho
increasing her damage isn't that small when you do it enough
sounds fun, i might try it out for a bit
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
para husk
oh is it
BB GD PV team
especially with greyed out portrait
IO with skin looks like BB
honestly i'm not against going back for a week with wolf
oh that's ER
wait there's a wolf?
good times, i still know more about dota characters because of their auto chess skills then actual dota gameplay
remember when it came out and it just confused 80% of the population over how it works
riot autochess
just get more lucky
more skill based than honkai
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
go for it
that's kinda cool
pivot into habbo hotel
among us main?
might come back, might not
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i missed 2 abyss 1 MA
i guess i did
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
tyty, you next?
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
but i don't want to upgrade a random thing and then still get fucked every 20 mins
i'm up to upgrading whatever the fuck is causing the issue
i mean that's the fucking issue
<:Madge:909232418379153418>
the other day a quest that should take 30 mins took 4 hours because it kept crashing
i just wanna play runescape
but i can hope <:Prayge:909232418463047690>
it literally crashed while setting up the new install
i doubt it worked cause
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
so i formatted my pc
so i'm doing anything to fix it, it tilts me heavily
my pc keeps crashing
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i just (technically) uninstalled honkai
i'm not toxic at all
whoa wdym
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
you know you don't wanna do it
you see kith enjoying a boss
see
literally not looking back
LMFAO
not doing it
and i'm so happy
i'm looking at y'all complaining about bella
honestly
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
s2 rankup: makes valk and team deal 15% more damage
there's an MA malder among us
i don't even have to play anymore
i'm so proud
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
nvm guess is not next week

<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
to play the pc game on mobile
quit the mobile gacha
oh shit there's mobile
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
help
i'm formatting my pc right now but i wanna play runescape
.
oh shit cherry became kosma
cool
cause there's an egyptian god named het
i forgot het is for straight
oh
bloon bs
none of that
that's the good one!
yeah
can i at least be the good polygon
how am i the bad polygon
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and then i can say i'm already in the game
then you can ask me to play
yea when they make keilo as character
disgusting
gachas are fucking
i'm taking the lux route
i'm done with gachas
no
don't pull for 6.2 cause 6.3 is extremely overtuned valk
don't pull 6.1 cause 6.2 is extremely overtuned valk
on this current meta
everything is bait
honestly
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
to another game instead
i'll just bring my passion
i am quitting because of my passion
keep coping
LMFAO
i scored bicc 0 last abyss
might do some MA weeks if they look fun
yea soft retire right now
like what the fuck
i feel like i'm going insane, if i typed this up on 5.6 as a joke people would say it's too hyperbolic
like it's actually disgusting how greedy it is
but yeah the main reason i quit is how the gameplay is getting progressively more and more boring, the bosses more and more awful, they are actively removing the gamemodes i enjoy, and then HRT last straw to how fucking greedy they fucking are
<:peepoexit:966048314808209438>
i'm too old for this dendro shit
<:ResidentSleeper:408109206932160513>
there's also a ton of quickswap in genshin which are
still enjoyed it
cause what i enjoyed from quickswap was the high skill cap and high apm, klee has both on her own without quickswap
but i did have a lot of fun
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
no damage
even tho she did
in fact, i often did, with klee anicancels
i'd enjoy that too
other high skill intensive way to play
but if they had other high apm way to play
all the support and all the dps are lowkey v braindead
the only high apm way to play
because it's like
like i generally liked quickswap on genshin
if that makes sense
i don't like concepts, i like how they're implemented
like i like quickswap team when they're fun, and then some quickswap team suck and i hate it
to me that's kinda alien, liking a concept just for the sake of it
weirdge but okay LMFAO
i see
so you just like quickswap for the concept of it?
actions per minute
even if she takes longer
as support
just on herself
like HoS has high apm
then non quickswap team also can often have high apm
cause like if what you enjoy is high apm
or because you like braindead valk?
just because it deals damage?
yea but why is that fun for you, is the question
but they don't
for doing cool stuff
they should reward player
ideally
yeah i mean it depends on what you mean by feel horrible to play
if to you, having fun = dealing damage, then sure i can see it
to me, having fun = doing hard and cool stuff
and then weapon active is like active all buffs, don't think about anything
is like new support skill has 5 pages of passive
but you can't have any skill intensive kits anymore on support
i like complicated and skill intensive rots, and having 3 skill intensive kits >>>>>>>>> 1 skill intensive kits
but is it less fun? eh not really, to me
because generally, it is weaker, yeah
like i get it that it feels weaker to spend more time on field with support
they completely deleted one of the possibilities of making the game interesting, p much
like that should've never happened
and that's kind of a shame
like with MA vs RC, RC objectively gives less buffs but you just ran her because she just took exponentially less field time
by bad valk design
so they just fuck themselves over
to justify a little more field time
you need to have fucking mindblowingly high buffs
cause field time scales hard
extremely hard though
that's like
it's literally impossible to make them interesting if they stay on field for so short
because now they can't make support interesting, cause to make them interesting they need to take more than .5s on field
like they clearly fucked up by making support so overtuned
i mean i do kinda get the problem from balancing perspective
<:Shrug:616394597211439118>
if mihoyo actually makes gameplay more complex or not is up to them, but they def could
more characters = objectively more opportunities for complexity
i mean objectively, yes
6.2 week 1 second boss
is just more wings of complexity
why not
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i'd rather the dps be hard and the supports be hard
that's what makes me enjoy the game, when stuff is hard and i can train and overcome it
i like high skill ceiling stuff
is pretty simple
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
issok to have bad opinions
see
cool stuff
replacing her with the newest swap in hit a button swap out valk
but no they're just
like if you get good at it you can do some insane stuff
cause of the fast combo stuff
she is great as a support, takes a bit to farm sp but that lets players actually show your skill
yeah i love high skill ceiling stuff
i mean as far as support goes she def is the support with close to the highest skill ceiling
it's actually so fucking bad
HRT is really the last fucking straw to me
1. herrscher support after line of extremely expensive patches, with another expensive patch next
2. killing off AE and not replacing her with a similarly high skill ceiling valk, AE was a well designed valk and just replacing her with the newest shiniest brain dead support stings a lot
3. she's so fucking expensive. like what the actual fuck this is the opposite of a discount banner, it's actually a more expensive s-rank valk
but it's just adding up a ton of stuff
she was old and was getting replaced eventually
like in a vaccuum, AE dying isn't what made me quit
great vegetables
great takes
LMFAO
yea made me retire
<a:Copege:991854669506814013>
even if you have bad takes and bad opinions, we still keep you around, look at tet
we are a pretty accepting community
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
issok to have bad taste
idk could always do next abyss boss
like, completely, i scored bicc 0
i forgot to do abyss
oh
so i might be a weird state of retired where i do no dailies but i still do MA and some abyss
but my current state rn i'm too tilted to do general acc upkeep like dailies
not balding too hard but i'm still up to playing for like half an hour
like i'm not against doing competitive content
i'm really fucking close tho
idk if i count as retired today
like a few patches of not playing to get there
actual a fuckton
apparently it takes like
yea i'm not hitting sinful that fast
so i just followed same name scheme LMAO
but i call 3s tona mecha tona
i guess mecha heph sounds weird cause he do be mech alr
i just wanted to make it clear
by mecha heph i meant optimus prime
do we have another abyss heph at all?
ignite bella
mecha heph
those are just really rare
but i could try on a boss without p2 and without mobs
it's impossible with boss with mobs
@ me when there's a boss without mobs
well actually, maybe
no
<:lewd:959737567119556618>
i'm actually not coming back but i could take photos
anyone wants anything down here
i'm taking sinful roadtrip
have fun
there u go
cunny denialist
i can add another if you want
same
if they aren't feeling safe they should be able to blow all of us up
we should give aster the like nuke button
we should give all server permissions to aster
it won't make me too much happier no matter how pretty she is
yeah i will make an actual announcement there soon
check again
yea yea a few weeks
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
i'm just taking a break
yeah sure
yea i might come back for a sec, don't expect it
have fun out there champs o7
so yea this is my retire note
way more than honkai right now
i'm like i'd rather play these other games
and even like looking at MA and playing for a sec
yeah i mean i've just started playing  other games too
i could force myself to do all of these dailies but like
and it's like
or abyss
or ER
or mirage
realised i really really didn't want to dailies
i just logged in and like
nothing going on this week in specific
is what you were right about tet
i think i'm quitting this week
i'm not actually quitting in 6.3
i think you were right btw
hey tet
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
who's he
yes
i love her
oh yeah
have fun?
it's so bad
yeah to me this patch is actually the last straw
yugioh card for every skill
god this is such bad design right
i think i can make it to 50
i'm spending all the pulls possible
i'm going all in
i actually enjoy when you shit on my investments, do it more often please
like oh yes mihoyo i'm upset you didn't make a longer streak of even more broken characters
seeing player actively ask to make the game more predatory
it actually makes me so mad tho
i wanna see them saying like oh actually my AE deals about 40% of the fire damage on my HoF team, her output isn't that bad
makes things easier to do
they should spell it out how little they know about the game more often
honestly i can vibe with it
gl out there
not this one
i like some abyss
<:Wokege:996346539364601876>
it ain't worth it
don't let honkai take too much of your mindspace
like go do other stuff
take your mind out of it
then don't bother with unlocking it now
like if it's not going to make any difference
then don't do it LMAO
like how is it even benefiting you to any degree to do it now
why do you even want to do that
free retirement ticket from me
her best upgrade is the one she's getting in 6.4
hot deez nuts
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i understand why you can't 1 rot
i mean in that case
oh you're running both in the same team?
LMFAO
you still need to dodge
like is not like just putting FR there would solve anything
1 auto collapse, 1 collapse with FR ult, 1 collapse with ??????????
then wtf is your plan with FR
if you can't dodge an attack to collapse
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
then the gaming mouse cd ain't your issue
i mean if you need to collapse again for a second rot
why do you need more
1 is collapsed by dodging an attack
1 is collapsed by gaming mouse
1 is auto collapsed from clearing all the balls
p2 has 3 shields
like what are you even doing that needs 2 actives
45 second cd is fine for something you only use once
<:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
why do you need 2 active
???? wha
what?
y'all using it more than once?
phys on doom
FR PV GD on BKE
HoH RC HB with cannon on kosma
do you not have HoT?
why the FR
190 pull for 4/4 no free box
you were asking for mihomo to kill AE, then they released HRT
keep asking for dumb shit you might end up getting
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
the definition of monkey paw
you're like
mihomo is killing it all soon
or looking forward to using interesting old gear
you don't even have to worry about learning to enjoy the gamemode
but it was fun while it lasted!
so they just move on to that
ofc just making MA same as abyss with like 95% of the time just run sig gear on everyone makes them more money
tho i slowly just start gathering the gear up
even if a lot of times i don't have the gear
it's really interesting and cool
i'm also new player but i love seeing old weird gear get abused for really niche stuff
instead of make weird old gear more available, rather kill fun gamemode instead
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
yeah dw mihomo has the same bad taste as you
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
<:resident:629470063929327636>
i love tech and running weird gear
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
literally no variety
what's fun about running 13/13 sig gear every fight
and niche gear is the beauty of MA
the grouping is consistent
smh
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
wdym
she's very bullshit, you'd prob enjoy it <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
need gaming mouse
hb obviously
prob HoH
maybe rimestar but rimestar also has a bunch of bs
doom is p much the only 2s boss left that takes skill
insanely bad
she's fucking
HoV is definitely the worst 2s boss
at least you have consistently bad taste
well
phew
oh it's here
where's my phys doom
wait what
no
AE too slow and you need to actually deal fire damage
no
but if ends up being HoF HoT HRT, then you can just run the HoH SW RC for 786 on kasumi
yeah idk wtf is going on with bella then
oh
cause that week is HRT week right
or HoT HoF HRT?
is bella HoT HoF RC?
it's in the plans, it's in the plans
i might actually
prob scoring a 400 and going back to runescape
i'm just using FR here
FR if you fuck up you still salvage a score
MPE if you fuck up you get fucked
tbh i tried both MPE and FR
i wouldn't say FR has many inconsistencies in play, just a lot of weird anicancels
than sink more time and effort on this shit game
LMFAO
because i could play other games instead
bio dps literally doesn't exist tho
and i want it
i've imagined
<:A_ThinkTao:808987776073596929>
oh did he use nyx? nvm, i remember someone placing v high with FR that boss
no, imagine trying in abyss LMFAO
i've seen keeb myriad p high on some qua boss like whale
eh i mean she can get surprisingly good score on good hands
idr if she's combo or charged, but if she's charged she should be able to proc that consistently
FR is hard as fuck to play, most people are scared i think
that one i can't imagine
just imagine it
we don't even need the bot
i approve of it
waste xtal to make you wanna retire sooner
honestly good move
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
is it even possible to get a card before a gear box?
how do you even have a 0/4 v2v
<:peepoSit:1016193458307862609> -> 🛏️ -> <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
yeah but i'm probably leaving them for last second
that makes more sense
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
interesting method
pickpocketing is scarier than shoplifting
it's called bad memory
your secret is safe with me
don't worry i'm no snitch
maybe actually
you?
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
understandable, it is very fun
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
it's not like you can control many variables
wdym?
to 2s in 190 or less
80.4%
yea 0 pity, a bit pessimistic but don't think any other number is fair
gimme a sec
i can tell you the chances to 2s in 190
that's so fucking greedy holy fuck
that's so stupid
LMFAO
what did they change?
you only get pinged once per message, even if it triggers multiple softpings
<:Doubt:455428799572606978>
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
when i play with people who are good
so i don't get rolled
i need to play a good amount alone
no
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
mainly boxbox and scarra
i barely played before but i watch a lot of streams
<a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
barely played myself before tho, i could see me getting into it
i watch a bunch of streamers, thought it was pb still
oh is it up already on live?
new acc i've been playing for like 10 days or so
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
i've already started back runescape
i have 2 modes of play, balder and retiree
i'm just chronic balder
wouldn't recommend
without any shield on team, literally dark souls
recently i also spent 40 mins or so on a 36* because i wanted to use my nahida but didn't want to level her up more than 20 cause i couldn't be bothered to farm mats
i think i've also took a fuckton before on my first 36*
optimally countered LMFAO
with my klee team on the one ice f12 that drained your stamina
i think my first floor 12 clear took like 12-15 hours?
way more than that
like historically?
whoa genshin abyss
what's done is done
yeah for like f2p player it's prob a skip CN get 3/4 or 4/4 HRT angle
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
don't even need to pay for subscription
there's fan servers
if i would recommend an investment, it'd prob be pivot into club penguin
where i just have multiple disconnected goals and i finish them all at about the same time
yeah it happens a lot actually for some reason
but t10 is just so much more satisfying yk
i t11'd a bunch already
it ain't that big of an accomplishment
i mean realistically speaking
ty
just leave
not even buy bp
i could retire right now
and season reset and i'm at xx00 trophies
MA
i just t10'd
my HoR minions
i'm proud of y'all tho, you're like
no wishing well also despairge
i guess 40 is impossible now that i think of it LMFAO
annoying banner
i got stigs p soon but weapon was last and took like 30 or 40 pulls
honestly kinda relate
link beginning
no
based tet take
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
and if the answer is main trio, then don't spend resources rn
it's what you're sacrificing in the future by spending the resources rn
yeah the question is always not if it's worth it in a vaccuum
<:Theresad:476616089178996746>
nvm
damn ignored
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
you know what's optimally powerful?
yeah i'm pretty sure it's money laundering
i'll fight for that last second later, don't wanna bother with it now
i got a very sick kill and still -1 on pig
anyone wanna help me with pri raid
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
just ask your parents for a loan of a few grand
wdym you can't also have 3 houses
it's like we each have houses
i renamed the privately owned chaos to arc city village
this ref is kinda fucked, you gotta do PV cancels where i don't usually and then when i do usually you're not supposed to cause you need to stall out HoT QTE cd
to be more specific, i wasn't doing PV cancels properly on p1
what a surprise LMFAO
i figured out my damage issue, it's i was being too slow
i can prob get the last second on pig
i'm -1 -1 0 now
okay i went back for the 2 seconds
for not pulling v2v
punish me gresham
<a:Monka:465018118608125953>
oh shit abyss closed
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
but i also don't wanna do it
if i do it i can beat keeb
i need to go back there to try and get 2 seconds on pig
this ain't chill
nvm
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
this is chill
why did i get baited into thinking we were getting kosma abyss?
wait
abyss
oh shit
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
breach at s1 is for herrscher, at s2 for normal valk, means HRT is bait
better than blizzard <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
we don't kinkshame around here
you can just say you're a masochist
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
that does not look fun
and i decided i'm not doing this abyss
about the boss
on his video
i read iriya comment
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
mihomo got me
and i kept losing tries cause idk i thought the esc button was broken LMFAO
it's in my blood to do a few short pauses to figure out what i'm doing
holy fuck i thought i was going fucking insane earlier today doing MA
oh shit the pause scam fix is this patch right
sorry
but i don't even wanna do that for my own abyss
i would look for refs and try to help
i'll tell you a confident maybe
i am optimally uninformed to answer that LMFAO
there's like literally no worse person to ask this than me
1. it's abyss
2. it's using a valk i've never played before
3. it's in a bracket i haven't touched in more than 3 months
i don't fucking know
i think it makes more sense for it to be new kurikara
i thought so too but kamen rider mei is uh
what's stopping them for doing 2 cny patches
we had like 8 straight patches of summer before
any chance they're not both coming next patch? <a:Copege:991854669506814013>
but not END
i'm surprised they're teasing flamescion this hard
no
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i've become carv btw, i'm not activating my windows
mechanic kurikara?
the one shot from pv look like it
oh y'all think we're getting kurikara 2.0?
farm infinite sp
so you can effectively just
where it's like some enemies, timer paused and you just have to kill them
nah there's one
also i think pv confirms that flamescion is actually flamesion
everything else kind of a downgrade
perfect
sieg m is like
i mean but theres tiers right
but i can get used to this
i think he was hotter before
i can vibe with it i think
he's emo now?
oh shit siegfried in the pv
testie sounds like uh
cestie sounds like a type of surgery
jesus christ
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
i have many abbreviations that are longer than the original name
so?
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
eh i don't care actually that sounds like a lot of work
for this cycle
wait should i try to get 1s CN
lore accurate
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
but it is
which doesn't sound like a lot
3% more damage than me
ref deals like
i don't think i understand how damage works on pig
i'm -1 -3 0 rn tho
this week could end up good for me
crit roulette
annoying
how high is the cope for free box again?
i can stream me figuring out my week if anyone wants
cause not FT week
i'm not gonna max it yet
there u go
LMFAO
this but higher numbers when max
but if it ain't, it's still great for weeks where i need to use MPE/BKE
i think it's supposed to be better than ely TB dante M
shennong T shui MB is good for FT
my trademarked epi emotes
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
this guy just come home in like 5 days
i'm used to waiting years for a single stig
g1 is so cheap
i got hot guy
idc about abyss but sometimes i look at my score and go can't have that can we
yeah it even gets me some times in abyss
LMFAO
this <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> close to retiring right now
i'm
i might not end up retiring when i said i would
honestly tet might be right
so they hard quit too
if they retire from that, they might aswell not play
some people, 30 hour bald on boss is all they play for
spend at most 10 min in abyss and 10 min in MA
for me, retire is just no more 30 hour bald on boss
depends on the person
why restrain and stay around
can't afford 6.4 just quit
honestly same
it felt stupid to skip sp gear so if he gets unlucky he's just gonna complain about it
he said
so you just can't get all the dps off in non-fast ult
when everyone's doing it, they balance dps rot duration around it
is also higher dps from higher ult duration
so it's not only faster animation for faster score
slow ult actually eats into AE ult duration
yeah, i mean at one point you can't ignore it any longer
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
time to play runescape
god, pulling drain the life out of me
even if i go all in bp for JK i ain't getting 2s by when i retire right
idk
<:smoge:959781798181736478>
does it make any difference
buy bp?
to any degree?
do i even take the top up event?
on the trial
mihomo teaches the wrong HoF attack string
whoa
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and then quit again
and spend all resources in newest booba
just log in every patch drop
actually the exact same as my genshin acc
happy?
i can log in and pull with the 3k xtal i'll have
i mean sure
if i could i'd continue playing
i can't afford those bitches LMFAO
no that's the issue
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
with 0 xtal on my acc
i'm not gonna like the game again no matter how pretty or cool kiana is
i can tell you with 100% confidence
is the current plan
sink all resources left into HRT, play for one last patch then retire
yeah
2 patches left until i'm donezo
yea it's official now
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i might not even afford HRT
the fucked up part
because the meta play for me would be to skip this and then try to afford 6.4 stuff
me pulling rn is just the last confirmation that i really am retiring
and wouldn't you know
then i'm gone
the second one of those ain't true anymore
and i'm having fun
i'll keep playing as long as i can afford stuff
but my stance always was
i've been joking about it since second 3s boss
no need to save up for 6.4
and then i'm donezo
i mean i'm quitting next patch so i'm going all in for HRT
ya
i hate pulling at this point LMFAO
still feels like shit
i guess i got lucky
owo math 76 * 280
i don't wanna read
<a:terigrabhic:709594728039055390>
i look at it more than soft pings
i do look at pinged
hi yes
:D
birb!!
oh jayson is using it actually
the blanket one is very cute but i doubt many peoplewill use it cause it looks like shit on most pfp
yeah most of them won't work with most pfp
i'll keep the pretty lights tho
hah
get it?
lemme change into a cool one
for xmas
nitro has it now
yea coffee went to complain to shirai about that LMFAO
it's been a few weeks since i spent more than like 30 mins in a boss
i'm kinda burning out of honkai
yeah i've been slaccing hard too
sowwy
instead of dudu
with klein
fragile was complaining about how bad the shieldbreak is
i'm gonna go with probably
there's an 893 with mobius
the pokemon?
but i'll just let it go <a:ppPoof:1046614556081934357>
i already bought out the asterite tho
8k asterite sheeesh
prob right
just let it disappear into asterite?
what should i even buy
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
now i can go back to not playing honkai for a while
i hate this
okay i finished ER
if you want the diagram
yeah you gotta draw up the diagram
open if you're brave
okay gimme a sec
but that's the latest thing that bluescreened me
i don't wanna explain it to any degree because it's beyond cursed
did you see the one evilmario tumblr post
<:lookUp:1048431538511020063>
<a:yaegrab:881290351942438923>
i wish i was a small object
i am literate
yeah i can read
oh almost
have you?
see i'm not toxic
that's so fucking funny
LMFAO
ok
sheeeesh
why does heimdall slap JK so hard
yeah that's cis i think
i love this one
she was last seen like last week
you should update it
LMFAO
hey eli wanna share some genes? ;)
kinda smooth
you have any idea of how easy it is to traumatise a kid?
i wouldn't have a kid just to fuck them up mentally by not being a good parent to them
and right now i don't have that to offer
a lot of energy to not neglect
you need to like be actively kind to them
to me is pretty simple, children are really hard to take care of
LMFAO
daddy?
eli's an american dad?
who
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
and it worked
a cheatcode to make me like him
which might be like
when i think of gresham i think of hua
when i think of tet i think the pgr guy which looks kinda mid but i can understand why she'd like someone so vanilla
when i think of eli i think of seele
i think i'm weird, like when i think of carv i just think of a cat with glasses
a cat?
yeah? how's that working out for them?
you have to control the horny, not deny it
yeah is there any school which isn't 100% horny
it's the quinton review meme where they go oh my god should i get with x or with y? what if they hate me? and i'm like i think you should get to math class
it's watching people tear out their hair and acting like something is important when it's exponentially less important than it is
even watching is infuriating to me
life is measurably better without it
but now i can get away from it
still do
like i hated high school drama
having control of it can be scary or liberating depending on what you make of it
being younger you don't have control of where your life is going
it's what you make of it
i don't know what this means and i don't wanna know what this means
<:pepeOld:768157006879653889>
and they give me weird looks
i gotta do mental math to answer
when i go to the hospital and they ask my age
it's not even me being quirky
yeah i know my age is above 18 but i don't know the specifics either
i don't remember which is which
look i know that one of them is the number day for christmas, and the other is my birthday
idr
25 or 26
oh sheeesh my birthday is also in april
i'm the anti-horny
i'm not on grindr
aren't you like 12
no you're a child
are you trying to seduce me?
why
that'd be cool
oh shit we should do an arc city hidden base meet up in vr chat
honkai discord server?
like grindr? idk how people meet nowadays
it might be a kink
i mean he's doing it consensually at this point
honestly kinda based
remembered 5 months later he's supposed to be racist
did he have a change of heart?
like wtf is wrong with him
how the fuck did you 2 even get together
LMFAO
sorry
i zone out when the convo starts to sound like high school drama
probably not
L
i didn't mean it as relationship status
cis person in arc hidden base
single
do we have any
so just to sum up
once is enough
chill
cis behaviour
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
we eat our own food
not to eat, no
i have it like twice a month tops
it's mind blowing to me
how much US people have takeout
i'm actually surprised
i mean sure but they just decide to not use, is not like you can't find it in a museum or smth
nah it makes sense, it's falafel, they just stole it
yeah whenever i go to london i'll look for
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
the cart vendor
oh shit yea you're right, i should've said that
like slapping organic label on stuff
i believe you but that sounds like the kind of stuff they'd use to sell stuff which is exactly the same as default but 2x more expensive
sheeesh
dlc?
what's non halal
i've never chugged mayo but i have eaten it with a spoon
it really fucking is
brainwashed
i do like eating stuff with ketchup tho
like i thought the memes about it were hyperbolic
i've never liked chicken nuggies that much
L
<:borrySit:1001445019661639680> is just <:peepoSit:1016193458307862609> but less cute
nqn made your message a puzzle
lmao
right now
<:lookUp:1048431538511020063>
i really like
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
tet do you wanna do my ER
i wanna get back to runescape but i gotta do ER for the book event today
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
i'm so done with honkai
new valk?
who's that
play it on my acc then
you beat my score
whoa
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
literally flexing going no one that comes to my classes learn anything
you're literally not doing your job
it's like
from the one that flexes about not passing anyone
always do
pro tip is if you can pick another professor
truly
now they're actually doing my stuff for me
yeah look at us now
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
<@309634550273933314> is doing my ER
<@370438895965306882> is doing my abyss
<@416445660443967491> is doing my dailies
i've already made up the team for my retirement
soon,
soon, baban
but i did start playing runescape earlier last week and i have been playing honkai a lot less
my retirement is only from competitive modes tho, i'll still log in and do dailies and retain RL if i remember to
official retirement is end of 6.3
not officially
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
retire
i come to you with the one true answer
as the HoR of the server
absolutely untrue
2s bare minimum for all of them
no sp valk exist at 1s
No
I'm dumb as fuck
heki move
i guess i could max gaming mouse for next week
i've been chillin in cubes recently
idk the rest of the lyrics sorry nini
my internet is too slow
fuck
became so numb
i feel like old f2p player should have no issue with maxing every pri they ever need
i also have more pris <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
lmao i have more newts than them
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
i swear they just gave this random fly more hp than BKE
everything feels so abnormally tanky
i kinda hate this side stage
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
just in time for you to do mine
oh perfect!
apparently she has so much sp gen already that sp cost reduction doesn't actually do anything
so sp cost red is bad for HoH, good for everyone else, though what i'm hearing for general nirv player nowadays is that you just go full atk even for non-HoH team
that is based on actual sp used
the only thing that sp cost reduction impacts is HoH passive
she gets full buffs based on how many sp she would've spent
it doesn't
but idk if there's a 917 for HoV without HoR DoR
you could prob do the maru 917 too, you need mkp for that
it's the least bs of all 917s
then active -> finisher
ult as soon as enemy spawns
yeah just pick HoT/LE lead
HoT solo does it
no
you should cap at least hepha tho
smort
i'm not joking, lux started capping every cycle before he decided to retire
is when they start to try hard sim battle
of someone close to retiring
this first signal
i remember that
turbo lucky
oh yeah he got like
oh is he actually?
he pulled like s0 v2v i think
huh really? i didn't take him for a whale to begin with
isn't that the guy who quit because of the ganesha sidestage
p chill honestly
that's
owo math 402000 / 600
i wonder how much i'm at
that makes more sense LMAO
6k dollars? or xtals?
<:smoge:959781798181736478>
game going downhill
gresham deciding between becoming solstice leader vs retiring <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
yeah you don't get much in game from being a vice
yea if you wanna be up there just make sure to clear all dailies
we don't have anything left to level
i mean past a point it doesn't even matter how much contribution the armada has
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
they're above you cause they're doing 3 every day
yea exactly
you know the dailies? that give bp xp?
not all dailies give contribution, you're prob missing out on the one that's doing 3 story missions
that's all dailies
from the leaderboard thing
oh arknights had a good month
nikke <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
i'd rather die than just reroll until the dies roll right
i hated it but they shouldn't have removed it
so i don't have to do more than 1 run per week
that gives 1k coins
a 3x difficulty
i want
i hate it
i'm just retiring soon so i think i'm gonna stop doing ER
idk you have any ideas?
herrscher of retirement
<@309634550273933314> can i redeem my 2 weeks of ER into something else?
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
but it was because i picked AW from that, so i didn't have the AW to buy JK for a few days
i was upset too
middle life crisis
just trust in the process guys
you should retire too
now that i'm retiring, no relationship = no boundaries to cross
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
not anymore tho
it just hasn't been announced yet <a:smadging:1034847088737005628>
at least imo
they wouldn't cross a line where they actively make old stig worse
When Herrscher of Truth exits the field, consume [In the Name of Truth] to buff the team. Team gain Fire and Lightning DMG 25%, and all enemies on the field take +25% bonus Fire and Lightning DMG, last for 18s, refreshable (doesn't stack with Turgenev 2-piece effect).
but here's how they'd do it if they were to do something like that
okay i doubt they would do that
LMFAO hmmm
hmm? i don't think i did
for 9s
yeah no new gloves ain't helpin
like people rank mkp on s0 HoS in abyss HoD
depends
but i doubt 9s is going to make much use
prob open up more strat for lower rank
for MA?
idk
yeah that's the closest we ever got to 0s
so that she could be useful
historically because they buffed HoD on SI release
i think HoD historically is the 3s boss which got closer to 0s
for 3s non-20% it's 986
for 3s +20% it's 984
for 2s +20% it's 336
946 is only 0s for 2s non-20%
it's only kosma tho
i guess i can try
are you asking me to 946 the furries in MA?
what
<a:WorryPoof_luma:594249233104896010>
i have them all so every pity of mine is just a shit show
you know in a way it's nice to have dorm like that
clearly it's not saying slurs or hate speech cause eruru is still around
what is the most optimal way of getting banned
you think if build tienanmen square in my dorm i'll get my honkai acc banned?
that's fucked up
they're so much funnier than me and they did by accident
god that's so upsetting
read my message again
what
it's perfect
of sending s2 ref when comparing s0 vs 2s
the extra touch
honestly kinda based
LMFAO
you either die young or live enough to become iriya
toxic is the end state for every player
imagine if i didn't bald
like i bald and i suck
yeah that's always the question
she's literally gacha tier valk given at 3s for 1/10th the price for f2p player
i'm not lecturing you, i just wanna point out how much i value MPE LMAO
that they should get the bow eventually anyways
but she's so strong and so much good value for f2p/budget player
maybe not speed it up with stamps
even if they don't have MPE bow i think people should still farm for rank ups
yeah, though like
if you don't have ely bow then there's no question tho LMAO
she's so strong and flexible, prob good to speed her farming up
yeah idt ely stamps is a bad choice, especially if you have ely bow
so <:Shrug:616394597211439118>
but also they might want more booba available
cause like getting MPE rank ups prob way more impactful for them
tbh this is a hard question for casual player
it spreads awareness to a young population of people who play games, and those are the most active politically in CN i think
it still proves some point when you're doing something as dumb as building it in a game and it still gets struck down
eh i mean if the government still enforces the restrictions and silences those attempts then they do something
cause i don't hear people complaining about it anymore
idk if people don't care about anymore or if they've stopped doing it tho
mihomo does stuff like that a bunch, like silently taking away the name changing option on important dates
please more people don't do that
wow that suuuucks
anything but politics in my game
oh no
funeral?
and are they refunding my HoH
did they ask my plead
weirdge
not patch maintenance, right?
random maintenance?
same with END being fire
cause they were pushin the trio team
yeah i guess there was no universe where HRT wasn't ice to begin with
everyone hibernating
but then we go play the weathers and it's like
we see how big the rank upgrades are
yeah it's kinda weird
or even better, retire instead
tho i wonder if it's better to just throw CN away and invest the xtal on ranks on HRT or the new valk
like if you have xtal for everything, great, if not, the first one to go is prob CN
yeah to me this is same stance as back on 6.0
all in a days work
heki after spending 5 long and hard minutes at the boss:
so +2 spot
but heki so scary, 2 people not play
heki t1, so -1 spot
yeah it's an interesting effect
imagine getting heki in your bracket
<a:Monka:465018118608125953>
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
back to runescape i go
okay then
15 minutes, 642, 3rd
is no one trying
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
beet M for the MPE
o shit i'm not even running full cez
i'm kinda close
can 3s MPE 1 rot p2
that's nice
o i got a 625
that's prob good enough right
i think i'll get like a 590+ and sleep
is not closed yet, chill
is your bracket
what
t10 is 506 here
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
i don't wanna do abyss too long i wanna get back to runescape
what's a retain score
yo abyss balders
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
cause i'm not retiring before hi3 ends, i'm retiring before part 1 ends
my spot has to be the star in the middle
nothing they can do
at that point it's straight up credit card diff
o yea 3s griseo?
when you get to such big numbers, a few hundreds of years apart is still kinda the same
LMAO we should respect eli's wishes if he doesn't want to make a big celebration
happy birthday though, love having you around
oh if you don't wanna celebrate that's chill
what the hell
<:pepeold:746089014087647393>
yeah me and carv complain about it a lot
love you <a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
14
are you like
wait how old are you even
i was eating dirt at 10
jesus
10?????
congrats
that kinda implies you did it
LMFAO
that'd be sick honestly
whos keilo <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
honkai 7.0, y'all bring someone over from wfp's corpse to hidden base, show around the channels

so this is the channel we bald on
oh, it's named after a... keilo? who's that?
o shit i forgot about them
oh poor guy
ruthless
jesus
we don't see something for 2 days = <:Deadge:945150922894508063>
yeah we have no object permanence
at this point
don't know if hakcer is just making up emotes and getting mad at nqn
i honestly
the opposite of what i want
if i gave away my acc, it'd make someone play the game
i'm the herrscher of retirement
i'd never
so you're trying to yoink another 4/4 with that amount
cause 42k is avg for s0 4/4
if not refund banner you're kinda fucked
like around ~30% prob
if refund banner i think you have a fair chance with 42k
you can get a good retirement bonus if you bring that + time played at keilo inc
no
<:evilPatrick:959721545712934932>
<:lookUp:1048431538511020063>
started a new account, there's a bunch stuff to do
i'm getting back into runescape recently
i'll be too occupied playing other games instead <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
everyone except me <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
herrscher of retirement
not in the place that matters, that is
i doubt flamescion gonna powercreep HoT
lowkey
unusually kind for mihomo
7tr banner in 6.2?
wait
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
with my help you can get 0k before 7tr banner
new valks are autoplay with 20% damage increase in 2s
you'd think that
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
if you quit before 6.4
you don't have to save for 6.4
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
to me there's no abyss cycles per week
they're really good at building trauma efficiently
ask my parents
<@171082989046988800> you can try this
that's what i'm talking about
let`s fucking go
so i can try the 917 assaka on sim battle
i think i'm doing that too actually
using the torus on DoV sounds stupid but on brand
that sounds right
into torus
i mean if you're just turning a dupe weapon
going to make you able to upgrade arias
how is salvaging something into resonance
i'm just expediting your retirement
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
who the fuck cares anymore
get rid of 4 meta weapons and go all in HoV
yea go for it
you know, fuck it
what
is to go oh gosh i just did a colorblind test and i figured out i can't see purple! dummy me
the one way to get scot free from this take tho
just can't expect only W takes
i mean don't get me wrong, i love tet
yeah
i can't say i'm disappointed either
i'm not mad
she got ahead of me by saying this
yea i was about to say, we have tet around and she has plenty of bad opinions
you didn't do much to me, only ran your image to the ground
look boo, issok, we accept you even if you have some shit opinions
wasn't i getting paid in ER weeks
wait
got 4k points tho
and wasn't able to clear last abyss sidestage in nirv
i used that
getting closer to the dougening
kinda close
are you in agony 1
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
the free market is real
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
who goes lower?
eli with the 1m coin
whoa nvm i got a lower offer here
all yours
10m coin
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
who's doing my ER this week
therefore she mustn't be as strong as she seems
if she is as strong as she seems = bs release schedule = i'll quit
it's pretty simple
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
most people here haven't looked at it in weeks
this is an wfp offshoot because we all left LMAO
soon tho
then no
did you retire yet
you are doug
oh nini is also slowly going?
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
retire with me
yeah to keep playing the game you gotta widen your definition of enjoy LMAO
i'm just not very good at it
i always try to cap
that is not how i play LMAO
what!!!
ew
gotta beat the 3s dudu score
cause like when did you even get 4s dudu for
that'd be sad
yeah
and beat me
you gotta at least 856
i guess i really am the only one with 3s
unfair
oh you just have 4s dudu
are you doing the same thing as me
cause the second they save for 872 is in p1 using elf later than i do
872 is impossible tho
i already got one second, another should theoretically be possible
like no one in global/CN has 3s dudu still, so me getting more seconds on tank is my own creation
this week i'm already kinda expecting for every second that i save for me to be the first person to do it LMFAO
then it should be possible
somehow
like matching the damage as the 2s1 4s elf ones
if you're dealing enough damage
i mean
it's a bit more expensive than bchip if doing straight top up but you get resources too
it's objectively the greatest
bingo is not great too
with the best bingo skin, for the best character in the game
6.0 was the last one before griseo one
bingo skin?
which i guess is worth it, cause like it can be even cheaper if you get one or 2 foca card
like foca card and stuff
for a good big prize
some people advice for you to reset the 1-3rd aswell
and then reset the 4th until the biggest prize shows up as the skin
so you complete the first 3
to be more specific, the outfit only has a chance to appear on 4-6th bingo card
4.8k is absolute max
avg is 2.4k <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i saw one ref where they did on auto on PV on p2 instead of aimed shot for turg before elf qte and that looked faster but idk
the one attack before finisher on HoT
i don't have damage for p2 if i don't do some dumb bs like
press buttons faster
did you find the damage?
BKE?
making more bleed bosses cause they want her to have a home once she's replaced
i'm also now expecting phys sp soon
<a:terigrabhic:709594728039055390>
until you also become doug
can only get fucked in the ass for so long
<:Shrug:616394597211439118>
sucks cause i think the base game's good and the community is great but
they've made clear they don't care about player like me
so hope you invest in the right one
this is new honkai, where some dps just might last one patch
HoH -> JK
DPe -> 7tr
yeah that's what's been happening since 5.8 LMFAO
HRT has no home as support outside of trio team
soon after they release proper new fire and lightning support
then 6.4, new kiana steals both IMA bosses, she has no home as dps
and has 2 IMA bosses
she replaces AE on fire, PV on lightning
6.3 releases HRT
like i'm telling you right now
this is the darkest timeline
tell me do you want to keep playing this
look at 6.0 -> 6.1 -> 6.2 -> 6.3 -> 6.4 release
i try to retire them
kith tries to keep people playing
i'm dark kith
but i value my time way more than my money
i am
you won't get me to spend more money on this
kith is mihoyo expy
this game ain't
y'all are worth my time
i'm leaving honkai
chill i already said i ain't
doug it out
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
seeing people complain about the fight itself over that is the final note for me to
i already hate design where you go time to wait around and take nappies
yeah i was going to try a bit but i decided to not
and i'll be going wow a4 is kinda hot, this time it took 2 hits instead of one
gresham will be going this fucking boss i can't believe they designed this and kith will be going i actually really enjoy when the boss gets invulnerable for no reason for 0.1s right as i do my finisher
so i can go god i'm glad i'm not playing
i'll be here to read y'all balding an awful boss
i'll still be around
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
fuck honkai
just not in honkai
oh i am stuck here
so i got that already
and i've capped scores before
like top 1 abyss and top 1 MA is like capping scores but with 9s valks instead of non-9s valks
eh idc
yeah pretty barebones for a dps
she isn't a full character LMFAO
no
and like
people say like they should've made her playable
also really boring
i was here during her event
so now i can say i've 100% completed honkai <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
she was the only character i had never played until just now
disappointing LMFAO
that's
asuka's kinda boring to play
huh
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
just pull on the schrodinger band banner
wdym
pov you're doing 6.2 dailies
only one week until cum cubes
stay a little longer
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
retire instead
in a weather like this
i wonder how cope you can go in RL
you're RL right
hmmmm
what do you have then
smh
SoS LK
with HoF AE LK
there's the one a3 ref that gresham sent
i can try LE dps tho
idk answer your dms <a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
though if you have 3s GD most of the times you use that in abyss
the starting sp doesn't work but the damage buffs do
yeah you still get the lead skill from it for HoT on abyss
he plays it for the plot <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
is actually a hard game
according to ruby
jesus christ
men ask if you if you're a cs or nikke guy
children ask you if you're a booba or ass guy
i guess nikke is an ass game
there's too many booba games now
cs? or nikke?
maybe that's why karto stopped LMFAO
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
i'm doing kartos job now

yeah i'm sure it'll work soon
it is kinda rude i think
i think i made tet mad by meddling with her spreadsheet
it just freezes for you and you don't get bastet buffs
for like cat
isn't that kinda int aswell
LMFAO that's kinda stupid
the L is so long
??? that's weird LMFAO
first was qte, then atk, then ult
what even are the last buffs
i would've prob gotten it if it was bingo instead
similar to me and PE pyramid skin
it's ugly cause i can't afford it <a:smadging:1034847088737005628>
eli, heki is doing the move
kinda based
oh i see
what the hell
FR is like twice as long as an acronym just because of the new font
they're all so long
jesus what the fuck did they do to capital letters on this new font
<a:DuckSmh:931628395656249345>
imagine liking piss FR
just look at tet
can't solve bad taste
my hobby is spreadsheets
<@309634550273933314> do you want me to make your spreadsheet cooler
which is the case for both the SpA and the IO one
an outfit can be racist and pretty
pause screenshot game
on the fourth one
LMFAO they're too self aware
luckily doesn't matter for me
last cny
PE + SpA free SpA with refund banner and ER stamps
is it that cope
i mean
teach me
this is p bad
1/30 success rate
i have like
did you figure out the dodge on transition
be faster
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
i can later if you're still balding
i nuked some good stuff for this
if that ain't enough i'm morbin
i got a .34 + .44 + .49
i don't wanna fuck up the affixes from this one
i want a third turg
god fuck
yea i don't doubt that tbh
the 2 ref i saw also 4s klein
jesus christ
ref is really close to that
jesus christ
they have the 4s HoT for the 80 starting sp
but for this one you don't so <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
for cf proc
cause like i remember on normal rot you do a weapon active on PV on p2
oh yea how do you even get the sp on HoT
i haven't tried it much cause i don't have any tries so i decided to not bald for it in training mode
yeah idk if there's any easy trick, i just try different timing until i understand the timing
on transition
i'm pretty sure i need like 7 dodges to get enough sp
whoa
but the ones from slashes shouldn't be that bad
like the slam double dodges are very tight i'm pretty sure
they're just weird timings
which ones?
and i don't wanna
shit i haven't done ER this week yet
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
right on time for her last boss
you laugh but you're about to get banned from bringing signets outside of ER
jesus you're running eden2
i can later
instead of lightning
9s runs the sp dk
am i sp/s locked out of it?
how much sp/s do you even need for this strat
share?
damn
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
so you get a bunch more frags, still ends up more expensive than non awk
i mean you need to remember, the cheapest awk rankup is 60 frags
yeah that's right
oh
on expa
you get guaranteed 50 essentine per pull
no
so 4 awk frags = 8 pulls, 4 non awk frags = 17 pulls with 10 essentine leftover
you get 50 essentine per pull, an awk frag costs 100 essentine, non-awk frag costs 210
because it's all essentine
like, on expa
outside of adv it's very static tho
i can do the math for adv if you want
heki wishes he was you
a new hc
LMFAO
<@309634550273933314>
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
that sounds like teenage drama
fenri why are you like this
okay not that
be free
go swipe somewhere else
this game ain't worth your money
but i'm just going for the CN -> HRT -> <:peepoexit:966048314808209438> combo
if i wasn't retiring i'd skip it
for shit like ignite bella, AKA
eh i feel like CN will have a niche no matter what
this game fucking blows anyways just do w/e you want
but
yea like metawise i'm p much 100% sure going for all 4 if you can afford is going to be better than skipping CN and using the resources to rank up one of the trio
that's awful
HRT and END, we are not moving to 4 letter abbreviation in my lifetime
people calling them HoTr, HoFin, fucking cowards
for herrscher of the end/finality
and END is the coolest abbreviation
she's prob gonna be herrscher of finality
new kiana
if you can't afford, then the first one you throw away is CN
if you can afford all 4, then you go for CN
don't pull if pulling will make you have to skip HRT/END/flamescion
i think the move is
yeah
okay i'll go fix it
LMFAO
i have that
ooo mid siegs
even CN got player like that huh....
i-i see....
that's a glut jst turg JK
the glut is on JK
oh
is griseo using like glut cez MB
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
send me to agony
looks chill
it's like morbid curiosity
do i
i shouldn't say that, tet is going to make me use her
mine is 3s actually
which honestly at lower dist i could see it workin
i thought it was LK dps
that makes sense actually
oh they're using her as fire support + bleed
that looks painful
i was like fuck it i'll just pass my artis around cba to farm tens of different sets
funnily enough even in genshin i was already past that
genshin brainrot
<:A_HuLove:807838195134889994>
thank you for worrying though
summers get 40ºC here
we're like a famously very very hot city, that's what we're usually worried about
yeah my city isn't really in danger of floods
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
tell them i hope things get better
jesus that's kinda scary
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
i love rain
that sounds really nice
yk?
feels like a lot
that even like 2 days straight of having rains
throughout the year
SO little rain
idk tho like i feel lately we've been having
oh yea it's raining a good amount
what's a monsoon
or if literally no one in CN has lower rank
cause you're never really sure if it's not possible with lower rank
refs like these are always funny tho
guess i'll just have to be the first
<a:Smoge:825136707095101441>
but tbh i have no clue if that one changes anything
and if i can get the HoS evade -> ult thing consistent for p2
maybe if i do the anicancel on p1 too
872 saves a sec on p1 tho and i don't think i can
idk what i'm doing wrong tho
so 856 should be possible
i finish p1 same time as 856 ref does
and i'm pretty sure 856 is possible if i don't suck balls
but i beat that with 840
max ref i've seen for 3s was 824
i've only ever seen 872 with 4s dudu
yeah
yeah i have no excuse when i can't match score LMFAO
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
can you look for 3s dudu MPE tank cap <@370438895965306882>
oh if you're looking through refs
i need it for my tank
you prob use HoH on tank
you barely use her
<:tsuncat:960584739914412042>
nyo
not perfect but pretty good
just gotta pump the atk up
so no cdmg ain't bad
at 3s you go full atk i think
that's not thaaaat bad
idgi
is like i'm missing 20% phys from dorm or smth
she deals peanuts
but every time i try to play her
her affixes kinda nuts
like my MPE should be better
yea dunno what i'll run
hmmm that does look better than MPE
you fill trauma and she decides she's had enough fun and goes back to ER
and then she hops off the robot
p2 you clear 6 of the 7 hp bars
feels like they're preparing bosses to make a new phys SP
kinda fucked up tho
<a:WorryPoof_luma:594249233104896010>
🧍
just fill bleed trauma i think
she just stands there
LMFAO the last phase is so funny
so thoughtful
they designed this boss so you can take a nap in the middle
cause i always sleep, right
maybe this is the perfect boss for me
or is MPE even better than 3s PE somehow
s0 PE < 3s MPE < 3s PE
cause like it's
how good is 2s pe even
just go for PV
there do be some bosses which are awful without sns, but they're like only 2, 3s sns without paga ain't saving you then either
like i was able to comfortably clear nirv shieldbreak sidestage with HoS SA SI
if you have no sns gear i wouldn't bother 3sing her
like 3s them?
wdym upgrade
we did it
code works sheesh
okay
gimme a sec nini i'll test a code rq
LMFAO so you're just leaving them on 4th?
yeah i have the stamina
owo math 6 * 3
yeah i'm chillin
so wtf are y'all doing
common heki L
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
heki is going on the list of people of disrespectful raiders
heki went <a:ppPoof:1046614556081934357>
inv whenever
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
i can help with dk but the one i need is pri
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
someone left me in the middle
i do
7gb of screenshots in the end
only issue is
but screenshot you can play frame by frame really easily by spamming click
i'm pretty sure the worst examples of pause spam are TAS, to be able to pause every frame is actually really fucking hard
and screenshot spam is waaaaaay easier than pause spam
they actual made it worse, cause they made players look into alternatives
with mihomo trying to fix the pause spam bs
it's kinda funny tho
genshin has to deal with fps bs + ping bs
we're at least better than genshin tho
240fps is an option in game but they just decided to ban it to make it more accessible for people with worse pcs
poppy playtime, an horror game built in unity, has speedrun rules to not allow 240 fps or more
which is very costly
even if it would be possible, it'd prob would force them to rewrite a lot of like, foundation code
idk if it's even possible to fix, every unity game has bs similar to it
is just unity bs
is the thing
i don't think it's possible
every time i try it makes my runs worse instead of better
i actually have no clue how this shit works
i saw that when looking for BKE strats
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
okay tet i'm here for the CI BS bald
he do be
prob really only started on the paper mario games, maybe the rpg one that i didn't play
she only became girlboss like rather recently
what the fuck you on about tet
?
chill
jesus tet
oh they made peach a girlboss
LMFAO
that's fair
watch the mario movie direct?
i'll do it in a bit, i'm watching the mario movie direct
:okayge
LMFAO yea i was answering eli
so tet stop fucking asking for it
but i guess gotta wait for later
i was going to stream the sidestage with CI/BS
okay
oh tet you're around
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
anyone younger than me is a baby, everyone older than me is a dinosaur
is kinda crazy that we are the oldest here besides like the people from stone ages
but yea i'm so used to being the youngest
don't worry about it
don't show it to heki or tet
that number is cursed
getting close to retirement age
yeah i'm a very old player
i missed the homestuck number
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
i feel like they shouldn't be that bad
is it that hard to do some dex entries
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
yea i did, it was a while ago yea
so like if you pull once every 2 patches you'll have enough torus from passive income
i guess less if 5 week patch
cause like you get 300 per patch or so
i think once you're older you won't need torus either
i'd def value torus more
but for like close to pure f2p
i mean if you need neither then don't bother for now
guess there's not much else to do
LMAO they just stay on SNS during burst
why even saving HoS tho
whoa phys kasumi
employers will do everything except paid vacation days nowadays
the hottest ones are the ones that keep me guessing
i have a type
hottest stigs for me are wilde beet and caravaggio
collodi is pretty funny
i skipped zeno and collodi LFMAO
oh i forget stuff i don't have exists
liu qi is s-rank
eh idk i think handel is p mid
i like that last one
LMFAO
at most i'd call bastet cute but y'all are weird about that word
liu qi is pretty good tho
like ragna p meh, bastet is too loli, handel is aight, cez is meh, HoH is aight, JK is aight
i'm gonna be honest tho none of the newer stigs are much interesting for me
i honestly was considering pulling IO for linn, no even for IO herself
i really like linn
but on top is stuff like zhenyi, shakes adrift
idk what's my tier list of stigs
yeah zhenyi is really pretty
damn it has it all
oh shit caravaggio is a feet stig too!
still think she's p hot
so maybe i should start now and quit early
cause i thought she was the hottest
before i started playing i went i'm gonna get caravaggio and quit
because i think she's pretty
actually after all that i'm crafting caravaggio
and then i'm done
shit i have to craft:
- lee for inevitable g4 fire
- shennong T for FT
- fuxi pieces so i can do dumb shit
- shakespeare pieces so i can do dumb shit
- cleo B (the B is for Booba)
- bri pri
- railguns
if you're a whale those are gold
which is kinda nuts
it actually also gives a mindstone per raid
yeah my dks ain't maxed yet
the only things i have to craft are
not that it matters anymore since i'm not officially done with crafting
throughout the patch
so yea it takes a good amount for me to buy it out
because i raid reset with the leftovers
i do start every week at 0 tho
so i could have liu qi by 3s huodou
i needed to do it faster
i just needed more tsp
i mean i always buy tsp with it
i shouldn't have spent 22k asterite on time structures LMFAO
oh shit i need asterite for that
even though your ranked up might aswell be s0
like the only thing ranking her up does is making you feel bad when you get outscored by s0
LMFAO
not gonna make her do more damage
it's only going to make the number besides S bigger
it ain't even worth it even as seele simp
i mean honestly don't even bother with nyx shit
i went for 2 JK stamp
yea that's prob the best pick
chill
okay not that fast
LMFAO
go faster
<a:menheraNod:809322720319504384>
and i go huh i picked LE lead but i can't ult
every time in simbattle i pick you
honestly eli i'm so close to slapping you
it's kinda crazy to think about how few valks i'll have at S-rank soon
it's personal
so yea
my deadname starts with a j
everything else is 2s+
my only A-rank at S is SJ and DJ
but yea i got a turbo boost from pulling a bunch
i'm now picking DJ frags on OW, don't ask why
cause i wanna 3s every farmable eventually
i do farm them a good amount too though
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
i got 28 3s valks
prob iris right?
i mean i wonder
ooh
like... how... did they think you would pull PI on dorm and her gear in dorm equip?
hua powa
NS was my first 3s
like at all
did anyone believe that
L
like, PI is actually Stalker: Phantom Iron
a lot of older valks are like that for some reason
so i went for her first
i'm actually kind of a sakura simp
yea i got LK and GM for now
wait is it not? it's RI SJ LK GM KR
yea QTE only restores bar and does some damage
i only got 2/5
oh sheeesh
3s valk from the eggs
how many do you have
<:Woggers_lum:608915988351811584>
and my time is pretty worthless so you understand how bad it's getting
game's going to shit, doesn't deserve my time with this release schedule
just gonna do all 3 bosses' 2s fight and that's it
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
the fun part
by doing only the 2s boss LMFAO
and do 7% in MA
i'm prob going to retire and hang around in RL
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
i'd rather have less legacy less xtal and less willpower if i get to fight the good MA bosses still
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
so no pain
cause i'm retiring on 6.4
actually i guess i've saved myself from the terror that third 3s boss will be
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
i'll retire
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
my condolences
-3? not bad honestly
that is a bit more
owo math 39840 * 1.2
owo match 39840 * 1.2
oh wait that's 39
klein only gets you 1s
oh that's kinda nuts actually
without klein?
how high could you get on 3s BKE
this week is chill
what do it
to catch up in MA bald
it's your chance
<a:DuckSmh:931628395656249345>
beat me, gresham senpai
<:Prayge:909232418463047690> i believe
872 might be too much
i can get with 3s
at least 856
idk i feel like
with 3s
but i'm stuck at 840 like pleb
cause like i think i should be able to 856/872
oh yea i meant like skill wise
have you done it before?
sheeesh
or can you cap?
no i mean you in specific
are you 4s dudu elf
how high can you even MPE tank
i legit put more work on some simbattle kills than abyss LMFAO
<:TeriPoint:1033130036284370984>
fighting against my abyss scores is like fighting a training dummy
play better next time
kasumi i think is p consistent too, if you're doing the 786 with HoH
so you're prob better off going for more seconds on MPE tank
it's consistent, no rng and not too tight
because 856 is free if you've done it before
i mean yea this is prob one of the more annoying seconds to get
or if you need a bunch of sp/s to keep up
but i'm not sure if i'm just doing something wrong
so it's sp/s, if it does matter
cause she only ult once
spcr doesn't matter here
yeah idk if it's affix or just really tight
it's less damage but if you're overkilling, it's faster
with turg PV
it's because you can skip PV qte on p2
i'm pretty sure
yeah
idk i can't get enough sp on PV tho
yeah that's the one i found and was trying
literally just took 10x as long to get the 721
i tried i failed
okay i have no clue how to screenshot scam
that's annoying
o i see i'm not supposed to HoT qte
i'm the highest attack HoR in NA
1502 2s
how the fuck do they have enough sp on PV for the 872 run
yeah it's not only sim battle anymore
oh no.....
don't make fun of my skill issue it's out of my control
<a:Smoge:825136707095101441>
that was easy
owo math 39880 * 1.2
3s BKE cap for non-9s still 856 right?
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
this game is too expensive
<:Shrug:616394597211439118>
i think is just skill gap
i clear with 2 mins left
and now same team same ranks
and i couldn't clear tona sidestage for the life of me
like i remember when i first got to nirv
yeah honestly idk what it is
what even is 2s HoF
LMFAO
maybe some people did heim refs for fun tho
there was one in week 1 6.0 but heph was there
is this the first heimdall since HoH release?
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
love you!!!
and nowadays i'm surprised when they don't
and i went holy fuck they are ulting on everyone for the mob before the boss?
like i remember when i first watched nirv ref
<:wavekawaii:590500669119660053>
hi baby
you just get used to everything being a brick wall <:smoke:808652033007157258>
893 p guaranteed
LE FR IO also 893
i mean the LE RC FR is 893, if you're sticking with 893 you can run FT BB CH instead too
it just gets like that after a while
otherwise 893 is pretty free
only 946 rn are HoF, HoT or PE
yeah i think they're going to have to make up something new for 946 if they are to do it
wait nvm that's an FGO
so i guess 9s player is going for that
oh there's a 946 for 9s LE HS PE
maybe they make up some HoH bs?
dunno if it'll be possible to 946 tho
FT BB CH can 893
i'm sure they can come up with something without RC
LE RC FR
there's FR strats
it's not like it's going to take more than 5 mins each
i mean i can do both
at least my CI is
my BS ain't even 3s
are you happy about it?
alright fine i'll do tries of it on stream
tet please
that sounds so bad without 11th actually
but yea i can do phys with CH instead
gonna 2s her soon for the dorm bonus so i'll be able to go for it
so i'm not even that far from it
apparently you can 917 with s2 max pri
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
917 assaka
for sim battle
i unironically do want to craft her pri tho
she's s1 and i don't have a weapon for her
i don't have a good HoV
battlestorm can't even clear her own battle trial <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
always try before upgrading, and then if you feel like it'll make a diff and you can afford it then go for it
i'd ask tet to choose what i should run on sidestage but she's just choosing battlestorm
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
maybe i should try running stupid stuff on it
so i guess i didn't do thaaaat bad
648 is actually only -7
she wants to shut me
i'm the fuck
op tet
shit i spent like 2 hours yesterday and best i got was 648
Ssg kithwhel
this is the +2 -2 patch
i feel like i'd just run BKE
no clue <:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
on huodou?
i relate to the anal bead cannon
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
yes
pathetic
tiny
it's puny
have you seen the base SoE
it looks more like one single anal bead imo
<a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
do a honkai screenshot next
did you learn how to do it while we weren't looking
oh shit
take a screenshot
yeah epi
it fits epi so well, he'd take screenshots like this
i'm laughing at it too hard LMFAO
now this is believable
there you go
i'll fix it for you
no one takes screenshots like that
look at that that shit is crisp
the quality is too high, it looks edited
you need to make the screenshot a bit worse
this one?
<a:X_ZhongBaldDance:856680458041032705>
it looks like ai generated art
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
hehe
owo wag
vheryl?
oh shit
you?
i'll be -1 0 0 in 10 mins
too easy <:smoke:808652033007157258>
damn next week is gonna suck
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
so i'll just be glad that that compliment somehow sticked with you even though it's pretty small and call that a W
and honestly y'all are working on a different realm
i tried reading the messages around this to understand the context
average maincord user
this could be you in two months!
is that an ad
LMAO
or was it 2s2
?
pull 2s -> retire
imagine not retiring before it
<a:PU_peepoRiot:778676108152274974>
it's not gonna work
that's mihoyo tricking me into thinking it's MA
<:Pog:995305045631455312>
just like kasumi in MA
that's cool
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
with HB strats
are you supposed to use it?
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
i'll just go back to wolf
is 650 enough to retain?
yeah i hate this
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
issok if you have bad taste
yeah this abyss blows
<:Wokege:996346539364601876>
do you have dupe crusher
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
+10d means i'll only do 10% less damage instead of the usual 40%
domo domo
thoroughly
i'm going to dominate this boss
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
no i'm not stopping
at 680 now, only -2 from cap
in like 15 minutes of bald
i'm already +1 from last time
yea i really really missed it
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
that is more fun
i'm doing quick run and coming back to wolf
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
i'm higher than going -100 score from the other strat
cause when i go -100 score from cap
see you have to go for higher cap
gimme HB then <a:catgib:564829264466149378>
<:Wokege:996346539364601876>
what's more score
ok
what's least bald
i have s1 JK, ff19 HB standard cat available
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
<@370438895965306882> do you have a ref for me good sir
smh
christmas is around the corner, my dms are open if any of you would like to paypal me some xmas funds <a:Streaming:1039019999811088414>
your emote is scuff
<a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
i see
i see that people do in CN beta and that'd be sick to test rates n stuff
do you get like 2k free pulls to just throw around in global/sea beta
ruby did beta alr open
i was worried i wouldn't be able to use her soon
she was getting a bit behind in the meta
i'm glad HoT is getting buffs
does she even have good TF
<:pepeW:996346590086303805>
don't say that
so like similar performace as s0 HRT is hmmm
husk and psy bosses are the ones where PV should have a leg up right
that's kinda surprising i think
it's for <@453263261467410442>
fuck that
no
like the path to get into honkai story
can you post the story guide again?
yo <@218762069338619906>
to buy tsp
buying time structure
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
i crafted it all
22k asterite and 500 xtal
the answer is
20k is kinda right
don't ask how much it cost
i have the metal, i have the nano, and i think i can comfortably weekly farm CN even if i'm at 0 asterite for it
tbh tho i'm chillin in mats for 6.2 for once
you know why
if you see me using the a-rank CN in 6.2
don't ask how much it costed
tomorrow
yea it looks actually very fun
feels like the game i'd enjoy being very bad at
i've actually always wanted to try starcraft out
minecraft skywars
let's play club penguin instead
pivot into world of warcraft
listen to me ruby
gresham and nini are mihomo expy
like even with 5 ticket, i can't get 28 with only 200
o wait even tomorrow i'll still need 300 tsp right
no i wanna retire
my turg CN
mainly because if i were to get more asterite rn, i would be throwing away adv mats, and i'll need em for CN
i don't wanna spend too much asterite
smh
all because nini isn't funding me
made for me
i mean it's there for a reason
that's like getting it for 2 pulls
that's way cheaper than people who pulled for a piece
look if you think about it
:pepegathink:
i could also spend 420 xtal insteal
that doesn't sound that bad
11k asterite
owo math ((84-25) /2 ) * 370
owo math 7 * 12
i lost myself
this isn't the right math
wait wtf
owo math (140 / 2) * 370
so i'll have 25, i need uh
if i can make last liu qi piece for this week MA
yea 15 sounds right
that's where we get natural income right
no, from dailies
i wanna know how much asterite this gonna cost me
anyone knows how many time structure we get per day
it doesn't make sense but i do it
i always call it lbb
where's the tsp option
my mind is achieving overdrive
15?
how many do we even get per day
94? that's cheaper right
which would cost 7 * 12 time structure
i need 141 tsp to get it tomorrow
fuck it imma go for it tomorrow
going insane over here LMFAO
it would cost 24.8k asterite
owo math (134 /2 ) * 370
and then get it today
i can buy out the tsp from shop
if i get 134 time structure
owo math 12 * 12
oh shit
owo math 12 * 20
yea it's 2 g4 if no ticket
o wait
i have 3 rn
i'll still need 200 tsp right
tomorrow i'll have 5 tickets
can i even get the last 18?
the question is just
i'll be at 0 but who cares, i have nothing left to craft
p much exactly enough to buy it and still have enough to craft
i'm at 1800 fuel
and then i'd need another 18?
i could actually buy 60 g4 from shop
i'm at 0 tsp
surely i can get it before this MA closes
i need 78 g4 to craft my last liu qi
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
that's a week
put more there mihomo
i miss farming stamps in ER
that makes sense
oh
says something s1 on title
i guess that's the big one right
s1?
sheeeesh!!!
what did they do to it
why does the sound suck so bad in that video
i'm this <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> close to banning jiafei
anyway so if anyone wants to help with website design just dm me and i'll share the metric tons of info i want to display LMFAO
that's fucked up
i told you to not share my abyss gameplay
wtf eli
why are you two apologising to me
it's you typing that message and being proud of it
will it make you happier if i changed general to some shit like hekis-jiafei-sanctuary
thank you though
i wish i hadn't asked
see
i'm fine the way it is
actually i shouldn't inquire jiafei knowledge

hag
boobnya
why is everyone calling her bonya anyways
<:peepoRiot:598608041990029313>
you start to hate the game
yeah you join this channel for 2 days
mihoyo wishes they were you
when heki's saying it you know it's bad
look at her price and buy bronya body pillow instead
pivot into arknights
oh i don't need to make the pull sim to tell you that you should retire instead
no knowledge required
and then i make the actual website
like the idea is you just make like concept art on w/e software you usually use
is anyone good with design stuff and wanna design the pull simulation site
common Cabbage farm 6.3 L

<:KusaHUH:1033071433611481179>
i have like 5
oh wait i can't either, i was doing another huh
when you said bruh i thought bruh was lurking and removing manually every self huh
weirdge
oh i guess it, makes sense?
can't self huh
what bot even does shit like that
maybe there's some bs with perms actually, somehow
common cherry L
common heki L
i think it's just skill issue
can i react huh to myself
rip
you blocked yourself
they should rukkhadevata her
nice, mihomo
timing her death with her story death
took like a good half year after free HoR for her become farmable tho
feel like at this point they might aswell all be farmable
AKA is 2.9, SN is 3.5, AE is 3.7, BKE 3.9 and HoT 4.1
cause mihomo is ignoring AKA too
if we ignore AKA
SN is the oldest not farmable
they might do 3 tho
idk if they're skipping a valk, next 2 should be SN and AE
maybe HoT actually
no i mean like, the next 2 are prob SN AE
yea
really? like nov 2023
WT
when y'all think we getting next batch of farmable valk
need one for HoR and one for AKA yk
no way they only had one set of ana
i feel like someone like keeb
he still outscored me
maybe he did just make a mistake and i followed the mistake <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
unless he just crafted liu qi B early
there's no way he didn't have ana
regret
so i just trusted and went for it
and back on shield HoV, keeb used that
on damage charts i think welt TM liu qi B was like very close to ana 3p
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
cause welt TM liu qi B feels worst than ana 3p
i actually regret crafting liu qi B
i'll get it right in time for when she :pppoof:'s out of the meta
imagine having full liu qi
yea idk about that one
it sounds like you're doing alright
yeah honestly
i wouldn't have guessed honestly
i see
does it really now
bastet M doko
what the fuck
counts every xtal before each pull
gresham f2p budget player
and i'd believe it
you know you could post these screenshots and tell me it's from JP
level 38?
that's like
138 stamina
<:TeriPoint:1033130036284370984> genshin
and they already had pity countdown
yeah that's some 1.5 shit
thank you <:Prayge:909232418463047690>
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282> thank you
like they upload lucky pulls cause they're lucky yk
yea the hard part is finding unbiased too i'm guessing, prob a lot of very lucky pulls
like, simulations
i mean any pull vid is great, i wanna do sp gear too
sheeeesh!
prob recouping almost 1% of the money spent on the pulls
kinda based honestly, figured out an untapped market in yt and went for it
oh yeah nolive, right? that's one of the channels i have around already, but it's helpful
so pull vids that include those 2 are good for me but battlesuit is also good cause even though it's the one with most research already i do still want to do my own on it
and the pity on elf
the top 2 prio right now is figuring out 10 pity on foca
but that's only what i'm going for next, i wanna like do my own research on all banners
yeah on foca banners
so i can make simulations on that too
to figure out the soft pity on that
i need a lot of vids of people pulling gear in specific
no just in general
actually, can you find me vids of people rolling for stuff? <@180679257851166721>
yeah i should be working on that
heki looking up most orange salmon ever made to prove a point
s2 at 110 is 63.9%
you're salmon i read yours
everything else my eyes glaze through
i see green i answer
and now i'm ignoring every message coming from pink or blue name
i read like 1 or 2 messages of yours
23.87% chance of 2s1 at 190 pulls
from 0 pity
80.5% chance of 2s in 190 pulls
the first is way easier for me to figure out
or how many frags on avg you get in 190 pulls?
do you want me to tell you what's the chance of 2s in 190 pulls
she non awk right
lemme figure it out
from 0 pity?
RL player needs 1/10th the investment
LMAO ik but like, he's nirv player
and i think he doesn't regret the investment
darius went the 110 -> pull foca route for v2v
i have no clue what to even recommend like budget or f2p player to go for
i don't do well in abyss
standards are so much lower
if i pull like one banner a year i could prob comfortably spend the rest of the game lifespan in RL
and still consistent retain nirv for the year
and no pull for a year
i mean yea like i could take my acc
is just a better deal to spend like 50% more and get 2 or 3 rank ups
i mean they aren't lying, it is prob cheaper for s0 4/4
maybe i'm biased since at this point my playtime in this game might aswell be 50% HoT
but HoT are prob the easiest valk to use to cap score
-2 from 9s HoH
kinda double cause she's alr at 872
i wonder if for s0 player it'll match MPE
that looks cool, it's like a less bald alternative to the 904 9s HoH strat
you had a dream that there would be a new elysia suit and that hasn't happened yet
don't worry
just do ,. instead of ,.. to register a quote
anyone can add quote
just wait and post this when possible
and i regret waking up
i saw 3 messages
b-baka
that sp gen is nuts
maybe she has 20 sp on transforming base and another 40 at 3s
but yeah she literally went from 116 -> 176 sp on transforming
pissed off is the right word
actually surprised isn't the right word
i'll be really surprised if we don't
no info yet
what even is that sp holy fuck
jesus yeah it's 40 alright
i wouldn't be surprised if it was 40
but aka on stream showed 40 i think
moriso said it's 20
yeah, is it 20 or 40?
like even 9s i feel like 36% increase is stupid
support capabilities are like waaaay higher than i expected
similar for HoT
on DPe GD
v1 still but at 9s she was like 36% more damage than PV
yea bilibili adds tons of trackers
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
yes that one
p big
yea it's basically 25% -> 30% fire/lightning taken
<:Roza:771818429967368263>
HRT op
yeah basically
the leaks were right, deez nuts LMFAOOOOOOOOOO
for HRT
jesus 2s1 looks pretty big
<a:Monka:465018118608125953>
50 away is like more than a card too
nini working for mihmo
i'll try it later maybe
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
i don't dislike that it does but it feels like mihomo was moving away from that
kinda weird
also yea i agree she looks like she takes a fuckton of time as a support
i think she gets one on qte, one on weapon active and one on attack string for normal rotation
when she switch into gundam mode she'll get buffs dependant on how many weapons she got before switching into it
above health bar, there's 3 icon
gotta get her weapons
abyss more like sleepbyss
i'm gonna disappoint you LMAO
<a:teripoor:838366314924867625>
don't even have coin to max skill anymore
yeah after moriso got cancelled he got hit with really hard times
weirdge
idk
maybe moriso base value?
smh
moriso misinfo
wait is it 40?
20 sp when she change form with all 3 guns
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
i'll fund you an exit ticket to go play other games
heki i wonder why this stage is so hard with 0 currency and 8 skins, 3 of which for valk they don't have
she looks dumb
i remember looking at her and thinking
is that the mc
gigachad have none
s-1 all 3
what about normal player
idk i don't think so
don't even consider it
go next then
that's a fucking cursed sellpoint
tof
nikke
arknights
if not just for fun factor
yea i think like if you gotta get rid of one of those the first one to go is CN
why even pay for nitro
fuck it my emotes don't work anymore
:ohhnofi
like if i were to not retire i'd prob skip CN
i might too honestly
are skipping CN
i think a lot of people in global
gofundme?
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
instead of complain about everything
oh yeah i should work on that
it's uglier than base, no new vfx on active
i'm upset over GD pri
they all look awful LMFAO
i think the mihomo weapon design team got laid off for this patch
close the game
make it come true bronya
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
in honkai ending
i believe
they gave powerhouse to f2p/budget player for so cheap
i keep saying it and people disagree but it's the truth
MPE is just broken
DA needs a takes 50% more damage from valk with letters d e a a n c h o r a in the name to take a boss
yea DA ain't taking anything LMFAO
she's a child
ew no
everyone was melee valk, so a melee weather is everyone
go a year back we had 1.5 ranged valks
cause like
i guess it makes sense melee weather didn't exist before
so i'm not surprised
but is just the opposite from ranged weather
i've never seen melee weather before, no
ofc not all of the damage increase is from self output but the question is how much
yeah like if all that dps increase is self output then it's not gonna be as big of a difference in lightning team, and it's going to be way worse in fire team, since most fire weather is ice down
this shit is nuts
i'm actually very surprised over how much of a dps increase HRT is in 9s team
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
good times back when she was useful
guess she's been overpowered already
yeah i didn't get to play much with her
ohh, i see
or are you talking leaks?
wait she's released?
fucking cringe
imagine not being in NA
i'm NA
send me club penguin ninja tcg tier list
send me genius invocation tier list
send me arknights tier list
cause like on normal lightning boss, her output isn't going to be buffed by weather
is p fair
vs her buffs
asking whether the big change comes from her own output
to make it easier to read her team impact
from her stig
yea i just cut out the team damage effects
there are self damage buffs everywhere
those aren't the entire stig either
M doesn't give any team buffs, dumbass
the stig provides
those are the team buffs
T - All team members in [xxx] mode (granted by host) gain Total DMG +20%

B - After using weapon active, the host gains [xxx] effect (cannot stack) for 18s, can be refreshed. The valk with [xxx] status gain All Elemental DMG +34%. On exit, [xxx] effect transfers to the next valk

2p - In Herrscher form, on hit, Combo ATK enhances [xxx] effect, all enemies take 16% more Total DMG for 18s, can be refreshed (cannot stack).

3p - When a team member gains [xxx] effect, all enemies take 25% more All Elemental DMG
but she does have some stuff on stig
no clue tbh i can try to pay attention to it
i'm assuming it's just sig 4/4
they don't show her setup on HRT team but it has that text
i'm assuming so
nuts
36% increase on DPe team too
owo math 1326 / 972
but yea at 9s team it does look insane
they look longer but HRT has timestop stuff so no clue
cause i have no clue how longer the rots are with HRT
gotta time it too tho
yeah it says 9s i think it's 3s HRT
this is dank gimme a sec LMFAO
on boobnia team?
nah it's bella alr
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
and she's going away soon
god it's been so long since i last did bella
that makes sense i think
but 2.5 for lock in form sounds too low
i remember there was some bs at .5 hp bar
is it 2.5 for sp pack?
<:Theresad:476616089178996746>
idk for some reason i really thought she had 8 hp bars
yeah i think it's 1 hp bar?
really?
oh shit
at 6.5x hp bar it locks in
yeah you're right
oooo yea
i think it was a weird one
the one before that
last cycle was whale
no
idr
was it tona?
does anyone remember what was sidestage on last sushang?
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
why think just use what the game tells you to use
can clear comfortably with that
i use MPE
2023 we have non-herrscher of the year
2020 we had herrscher of the year
LMFAO
feels like 2021 valk
is this valk even worth pulling for? she doesn't even have herrscher in the name
hey guys i just started playing
if anything i see it later half of 2023
but like not before 6.6 or smth
i can really see it since hua is dying soon, senti mature + new suit
next is how soon?
baban working overtime
jesus
<:bugistronk:676224936062484490>

the rest is hidden so you don't feel bad
o yea is that one also just out there?
i guess you can see the misato event stig too
i think it's funny that it's the only eva patch thing that you can see in game i think
yeah
yeah
they're eva patch only
the others are gone forever
fuck aponia
that's the goal
trademarked mihomo move
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
cause i always spend all my homu coin, so i'm at 0
i can't even buy any
it looks stupid
but still
rot they did was a lot more abyss-like than MA, in MA we rotate a good amount faster
can't believe this is just another HoT boss
am i crazy or is it actually insane
did you end up seeing the HoT numbers with GD pri?
LMFAO
i want this....
psy ice makes more sense
there's been so little psy lately
it makes sense for seele to be qua but
yeah like
it's been a while since the last ice herrscher

actually i was thinking about if i could still play honkai if i broke a hand
i thought it was just like one of those porn games

my 2 goals were to get twins and collect herrscher when i joined

KMB also has it
she's the weirdest one i think
idk
did you know px stamps are a thing?
s0 doesn't exist
that makes sense
that is pretty good damage
what rank is your HoH again?
sheeeesh
i wish i could try it but tank's gone LMAO
also i'm pretty sure her evade is shit
often in MA you rotate way faster
prob didn't need to use dudu elf at the very beginning
feel like you spent way too long on p1 on HoT
p2 still dumb i'm guessing
yeah this boss is stupid at this dist
and they went whoa i noticed you had enough frags to unlock s1! what a dummy you are, i unlocked it for you!
he retired, left the acc for someone else to pilot
cause he's s0 player
and then he didn't unlock s1
he did
that means s1 is basically s0
if fragile, s0 player, has s1
i mean fragile also has s1
oh yea

i mean i'm chillin, i don't care much abyss
me rank scam
1506
missing 2% fire from dk, 4% fire from dorm buff
i'm slightly more scuff than you tho
you can run my acc if you want
i mean
awful
s0 sounds
yeah at s2 i can't
fragile ref waiting room
13 dist made it unplayable wtf
gresham wasn't lying
wow i deal 0 damage
<a:terigrabhic:709594728039055390>
so
but HoT cap is already 696
i think it would make my DA cap like 664
is because it would enable me a higher pig cap in MA
i mean the only thing that makes me consider DA
yeah that makes sense
hmm i see, i guess i'll prob just go for the BKE then and get closer to the 3s
yeah poor girl
but then do i care?
2s1 DA would make me prob able to cap pig with DA
i alr have 2s2
2s3 BKE
ignorance is bliss, truly
they don't get any worse, you just start noticing it
see here's the thing about valk like BKE and turg cat
the more retaliation stacks thing
between 2s1 DA or 2s3 BKE
gresham what would you choose
maybe i just sleep
sounds awful
i'm at 1506 s2
i think mine is p similar if i was s0
what's your atk at
have you tried dealing more damage
just clearing stages early
i'm leaving abyss for last second tho
ty gl for you too
literally all of them have max atk
just check any CN ref
having to change the one between HoS and AE is too annoying
i wanna make another neb pri
oh no i am getting rolled <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
even i got that and i'm illiterate
jesus y'all so fucking stupid
slice of life anime?
what we doing until then?
3 years??? what the fuck
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
she gone gone after this arc
i've already accepted it, carv
but if it was herrscher, then what herrscher?
so it would be sad if it wasn't herrscher
cause like this is probably the last kiana suit, right?
yeah idk what's my cope tbh
or it'll be like PE, herrscher power but no herrscher in the name
do you think she'll have herrscher in the name
do we wanna do cope guesses on what new kiana is?
you think new kiana is herrscher?
sheeesh
lumi t1
we got plenty of people with cringe opinion here, look at tet
i wasn't serious on saying you shut your mouth, i'm not actually mad, you can dislike her if you want LMAO
golden era is up to HoS
yea no i wouldn't either but she's a piece of gold on a pretty bad era
truly the optimal valk
she's beautiful, pretty, great visuals and vfx
performance wise she's great budget, can do incredibly well with setup like lee thales
she's flexible for her rotations, isn't completely auto play, and satisfying to pull stuff out
AND she's good in abyss AND ma! she has actual decent tf as opposed to every new S-rank which sucks balls at it
i miss kallen
oh it was kallen instead of doom
like exactly the same
didn't we have this exact same week last patch
also you shut your mouth, she's golden era
yeah and then you'd think i was talking about HoT again
read better next time
too much work
i skipped a word cause it wasn't needed
no, did you read my past message? it was pretty clear with context
and i'm the one with 0.01 attention span
her UE, dumbass
i just assume people tried every rot and saw what did more damage
that makes sense
so she's also autoplay inside ult
HoH inside burst is useless
autoplay valk
HoH's outside of burst is pretty good but you don't have to think about it, you qte in and it does everything for you
oh
HoH is on demand wtf you talking about
which is waste 5 seconds
it's better than HoT
i mean
yeah
so you shouldn't use it often or at all in abyss
the part that sucks
it then strings her into a later part of her attack string
it kinda sucks
optimally the worst way to play her
which is
apparently in maincord they tell you to spam dodge -> a4+a5
can't be bothered to learn best rot
yeah maybe that's why global hates HoF
and can skip black hole if you have enough damage
or even weapon active before snap somehow in like 2s MA
snap -> weapon active -> a3 -> black hole -> ult
even shorter rot you do
snap -> a3 -> weapon active -> a3 -> black hole -> ult
shorter rot you do
so full rot you do
snap -> a5 -> black hole -> weapon active -> a5 -> a3 -> black hole -> a3 -> ult
i assume ember management
why? no fucking clue
different rot has different weapon active timing for optimal damage
black magic as far as i'm concerned
last week when ely was stuck on ely
yeah i use it on FT
please
sell me it
what the fuck
oh dw about it, i've done mine already
sure
this bitch?
<:Moon:655491828035878912>
it'll be the last kiana
do you think
like HoD with PE
i think in idea it's cool but at the end the counter is always stupid
where they release boss before releasing valk to counter it
tbh idk if i like or not the thing they do
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
just ready to be stolen by new kiana
based i think
no mobs, no bs, just kill her
i really like ignite bella actually
count your fucking blessings
literally everything else about it
but then there's
cause i wanna like it cause it's good cheap budget
like i'm really torn on turg cat
it's a menace
keep her the fuck away from turg
cat is fine on ice team
<:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
oh sorry do you enjoy playing the lottery too? do you think playing the roulette is actually very skill intensive
what fuck the rpcs
fuck cat
AKA is just AE skill test and i love AE
prob my favorite abyss boss at all
AKA is my favorite fire boss if not using cat
heimdall is if they designed fire tank like it was an ice boss
heimdall is like fire tank if it was 80% more bullshit
but then i feel like you'd hate heimdall more
like if you don't have HoF or hate HoF sure
pretty chill
really straightforward
it's like
literally cannot understand how you find fire tank this bad
abyss couatl i would rather die
2s couatl actually not that bad
psycopath behaviour
couatl
global just hates anything HoF for no reason
no it's not
sheeeesh!!
<:BronyaKing:646539680979877888>
that's what they're aiming s0/s2 to score at newer bosses
most bosses would be around 780-820 i feel like
maybe they just have a this boss should score around this no matter the dist for it to be healthy
but then they still go + or - dist
feel like they prob have enough info on players that they should be guessing really accurately for some of these bosses
yeah idk still feels highly arbitrary even then
oh god is my s2 going to survive?
oh it's fire tank?
fuck that
cause i'm telling you no matter how low dist is we still avging 400 on kosma
do they put a purposefully cope avg out so they can decrease dist?
what do they do then
yea and like
there's some bosses which feel really wrong
that would make sense but
how do we slacc so bad on HoD and still go +2
oh we're back ahead
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
whys our dist going up
we went +2???
wait what the fuck
think so too
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
<a:KeiloTheBear:1002644779441598585>
i'm pleb
and in this case it's me
than in a bracket with 4 9s people
you are way more fucked in a bracket with 5 people slightly better than you
it's how many good players are
the thing you have to learn about nirv is not how good the players are
that's only 2 good people then?
i mean
yo
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
but not this slacc
i knew my bracket was slacc
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
lemme see how you're doing
record a run
<:scaramouch_lurk:925161879322624110>
i'll get the husk next
-1 -1 -1 now
i think i can go one higher
broke the 3s dudu elf cap
i think carv prob doesn't want to watch it
for my datamining adventures i'm going
<@416445660443967491> think i can make another channel for me?
actually that doesn't sound right but i don't feel any increase at all past a point
at around 50% or so i'm guessing?
does look like there's a movespeed cap tho
yea can't find any way to break the new OW
i can't recreate it
that's how seele's gonna look at the end of this arc
yea that's foreshadowing
LMAO
i didn't read the story
what's a chaoter abyss wall
you sure about that?
yeah is it easier to break the new OW if i'm in samsara?
rip
oh no DP either
no elfs on OW
okay oh god
LMFAO
the OW
idk if it's much breakable
but i'm not having much luck
i was trying to break OW
idk tbh
do i even bother with trying HoF tho?
LMFAO
wait is she charged
i'm gonna try ragna TM bahtory B
hmm i can try HoS
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
oh i don't have those
we don't have many options
i feel like it's horse PE
move speed
for like 71%
seele TM bathory B
so i can run something like
does it refresh?
hmmm
whoa
that sounds funny
should i craft that
oh
it's very funny
so fast with bathory B
she's
do you have PE?
jesus christ LMFAO
hmm i don't think i can take damage easily
no clue for the other 2 pieces
41%
need to find good TM now
B piece has to be bathory
i think it's bathory B
yeah
ooh 3p viola
3p hannah
i'm trying to break the OW
<@309634550273933314> you know movespeed stigs?
i need help
compare it to this
that's a %
you see that?
i'll try once i 3s her
yeah gonna be hard chief
2/3rds of her skills are absolutely useless
honestly battle storm is not that expensive
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
good return for coin
whoa
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
one of the most slept bosses i think
yeah that's an L-nya
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
what even is your abyss
my bracket heavy sleeper, only has <@351080331824332813> as dalao player
i was gonna say i'm worse but i think i'm promoting this cycle
or sending support ticket
try restarting the game?
i didn't have any issues
try harder
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
but they pull it so they have it if someone figures out a use for it
and not even only if there's use for it
those whales are at the level where they pull 2 of every set
definitely not the craziest investments they've made i'll tell you that much
eh
actually throwing money away LMAO
and then deciding immediately afterwards to let them catch up and get ahead of you
you're paying to get ahead of others
nah it's fucking nuts
mind boggling behaviour
i'm like hello???????
and then asked if it was okay to stop at 2s
who invested in JK with like stamps and stuff
like i've met not one, but two people
it's actually insane the people who don't farm stuff
it's actually just better for us
yeah but it's not as bad as it sounds
<:elywhip:1002644839248183306>
making people farm stuff
this is my current arc
cause then it'll really never happen LMAO
just don't look at how many frags it takes to 3s and go oh no that will never happen and stop farming
i didn't mean pv in specific, if you keep on farming sp valk you'll get to the point where all of them will be 3s eventually
imo
finishing off a well built team is always more effective than divvying up attention to multiple teams
for sp valk i'd just go for the team you're already most invested first
eh it's pretty good
keep on keeping on
if you keep on farming you'll get there sooner rather than later
if you have 2s pv it's pretty good too, the sp on entry kinda broken
like pig and tona
there are some MA strats you use it
she's kinda chill on sp
you mostly don't even use cf on pv on her team anymore
handel gives her SO much sp it's kinda insane
cat is kinda overkill
early evaluation of her waaay overstated how much sp she really needs
she doesn't need that much sp
eh
in MA is actually really close
but can get away with FR yea
GD is a good amount better in abyss
just use turg FR
yeah
actually stupid
and it's not even hyperbole, she's release HoV levels of broken in MA
she's actually t1 at half of the bosses in MA, t2 at the other half
price barely matter, she's just too much atm LMAO
like if HoH was at HoT power level i think it'd be too much too
i don't mind that she's cheap tbh, that's not my issue with her
like very cheap for so much
insane valk to get up and running for 50 pulls
7t prob still the best value banner to pull on the game
there's actually no week without HoT in MA
it really does become grating, she's there literally every week
like especially for MA
yeah, like i love playing her but i don't think it's healthy for the game
and honestly i kinda am too, 7tr is way too powerful probably
yea they were really mad
CN player couldn't
like a lot of player skipped DPe for 7t
but yea only time will tell, and we at least have global foresight to know if we should pull or not
like it slowly chips away at the core
that would be cool
ooh ima kiana ignite also ignites the core
core is immune to phys damage, core is airborne
i mean it's really easy to make an imaginary valk that doesn't compete with PE
i'll kill myself
but i mean maybe
ima has hard hard hard shill
like if she's ima, gonna be real hard to replace her
that will depend on how the kiana is i guess
HoH -> JK
DPe -> 7tr
just to release better cheaper alternative on next patch
now they release standard power valk
nah they stopped doing that
why even bother looking at beta and going well she looks weak if mihomo about to do shit like that anyways, gets me a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> pissed off
and almost all feels so artificial, besides HoS
but then she got SA, DS, HoS, AF, AF pri
and she did
like i know a lot of people skipped BKE on release because she sucked balls
why even bother looking into the game and deciding on strength of valks to pull for if they're just gonna break it all in few future patch
like i lowkey think it's disrespectful
just kept slowly making her more and more busted, fucked up
yeah mihomo treatment of BKE was fucking insane
still a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> upset over AF pri after all these months
even with AF i think it was pretty fair still
yeah i think it was a fair boss before AF pri
cny is our anniv
i'm being helpful
i guess jizo was up there too
the first ever hard bs boss right
that was like
i think you should be grateful you don't have 2s, so you don't force yourself to use her
and that also sounds awful
that makes more sense LMAO
ooooh
cause then it fucks you over on the tank minigame with AE
i guess it's a double edged sword
oh you want her to die slower on the main stages?
why
they just went oh she's in gold witch orb? good enough, mark it down as farmable and forget about it
like no joke
i think they unironically forgot
<:monkaHmm:500217956563812365>
*looks at AKA*
just end up on cycle of backpulling and playing with 1 year old valk every cycle LMAO
they act like they can afford everything
yea idgi either
i have no background on what this even is but it's really funny
i have the emote version LMFAO
<a:ripBozo:1015579412432961566>
i mean i wouldn't feel bad for giving that advice
sorry i'm too toxic
if you want to go beyond red lotus you should learn how to read
like if you're whale you go for it but then you go for everything so who cares
i think i wouldn't either
yea from like f2p/budget perspective
i actually have no clue LMAO
would you go for it?
i mean but even if they have xtal
i'm not answering there anymore i'll come back later
okay i'm tilted LMFAO
cause someone asked and idk what to answer LMAO
like general you
and she can get away pretty alright without her stigs
she doesn't use her own weapon 80% of the time
i actually have no clue LMFAO
do you even recommend people to pull for HoS gear?
is not the first time it happened
or if my explanations are bad LMFAO
if they're purposefully being dumb just to piss people off
i actually really can't tell
i'm just tilted on that one guy in specific LMFAO
dunno if we'll have leftover stock at all
in CN, it was leftover stock sold i think
that's true, i wonder if we'll get it for sale too
yeah i wouldn't mind it
i'd take it in CN
if it's translated, that's kinda nuts
are we getting the book in CN or is it translated
i know someone who didn't think we'd get it for free and bought it LMAO
like, officially
i'm pretty sure it's already being sold in CN
almost told him look by the amount of money i spent on this game, they should be sending me a library
i know my dad was, i told him and he went are you sure? that doesn't sound right LMFAO
weird, you'd think the older people would be the ones wary over mihomo just giving it for free
a bit longer than i expected SEA would last
honestly tho
damn
oooo i see
what's the date for
i mean
what's that
yeah that works
sheeesh!
it's pretty annoying to keep on track of everything
yeah i feel that
i relate
aww LMAO that's cute
this is also so cute though
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
i'm your friend?
whoa
most refs just throw away all those charged attacks at the beginning for sp or don't use them at all
and for shield HoV it really doesn't
like maybe it does on other bosses, but from i remember on freeze huodou it doesn't really
she's like t2 option on half of the abyss bosses in this game, it's actually nuts
for like, f2p/budget player like you, she has a lot of uses
and for how useful she is, i think it's p worth it
but it's still pretty good
it's not as good as past rank up like 2s and 2s2
it's still stats, which are pretty good, but at that point just go for dorm valk which is also stats but universal
which is kinda sad
like on 3s MA it's actually just useless
the extra bar on the start barely matter
but in 3s MA and on shield HoV
it was pretty big for like 2s MA i think
2s1 HoR is really w/e
yea but i'm gonna be honest
hmm i think i'd go 3s MPE -> 2s1 HoR -> dorm valk in this situation
and 3s HoS
yea that doesn't look very 3s LMAO
doesn't feel 3s worthy
90% of 3s skill
tbh i feel like
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
is it that bad
i think dorm buffs, even tho it feels bad, prob lower prio than actual useful valk ranks
what ranks are they
that even base atk does so much, it impacts a lot since she's everywhere
but she's just so strong and everywhere
i would say like skill wise it's on the weaker side
yea just the stats are really nice tbh
p much all refs i saw didn't use the non-shinzan combo to string paralyse at all
that didn't matter
but like, last husk
yeah this is the main place where i can see it being an issue
no, that's just how 3s is
so you can see what the bar regen looks like after shinzan
beta v1 had a bug where 3s skill was enabled for everyone
those situations aren't that common though
and 3s won't let you
sometimes you want to do non-shinzan combo
yea basically what i said
i think getting fucked over over it is really rare
a lot of refs you don't even use it though, especially in MA and in a fair few abyss bosses
cause the fast bar gen just won't let you do that, you'll gen bar enough to do 2 shinzan in a row
the only place where it's actually a dps loss is if you need to do shinzan -> non-shinzan combo after finisher
so you can easily get another shinzan off very quick
and after first shinzan after finisher, you get a lot of bar regen
3s HoT gives you full bar after finisher (this one is very small after 7t)
not sure if it's ever a dps loss
think you just need diff ref
eh
and i think in abyss is not that niche
for MA
i mean HoT you still have some niche stuff at 3s
like past 2s1 basically all useless
for 3s owners
that would be kinda shit
i mean
3s is useless in ER
i guess that's true actually
LMFAO
her burst lasts fucking forever
like when's the last time anyone, at all, in this game spent the entire HoR burst duration on field
who in mihomo even decided to make that skill
never happens
which like
where you get the charged bars after bike ends
2s is the bad version, the one you said
close, 3s is 2 charged attack bars after you leave field while on bike mode
and that one
there's the useful one, the one you said
2s is 2 skills
you get 2 charged attack bars
after bike mode ends
who thought this was a good idea
like.... what....
it's like they went huh this is actually pretty good! what if we made it useful though
the same as the 2s skill but actually works properly
i like how the 3s HoR skill is like
s2+ DPe + 7tr HoT > 7tr HoT > s0 DPe + 7tr HoT > DPe alone = SW + cat > DoS HoT = SW + AE
actually to be even more annoying
s2+ DPe + 7tr HoT > 7tr HoT > s0 DPe + 7tr HoT > DPe alone = SW > DoS HoT
right now as it stands, it's basically
not 7t HoT, def not
i remember seeing beta vids of SW with JK at 9s and it looked like new cap, but idk if it still stands and how non-9s performs
before JK she p much matches with DPe without HoT and DoS HoT
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
<:CSMPower100IQ:772505097787146270>
and not in a good way
ate ass
went for like 840 ref for a FT CH DK strat
my first kallen was same way
that's kinda cute
hah
yep
someone's having fun
would've been really funny tho
issok i was in training mode
oh shit i alt tabbed and died
after that it settles down and is active again
and after a .5s or smth it starts aiming at you to do a few attacks, and then it's impossible to get behind it
and then for p2, as soon as it's targetteable (has a health bar) it's active
actually i think it's more like a little more than a 1/2
and then after it's stopped turning
weakspot is active for like the first 1/4th of the first turn before stopping turning
but for MA, at p1, it turns twice before stopping
oh idk about abyss then
it's only active during certain timings
it's really consistent actually, just annoying
dunno how cbt is that
wait but no raven means no weakspot huh
just BBB for the kill
it's actually really chill, you shouldn't need to AE ult p1
AE sp farm isn't that bad on tank
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
still use cat half the time
even if you have slug
yeah just use cat at that point
still weird tho
hmmm if you have 4/4 ready then it doesn't sound that bad of a deal
just feels really bad
but if you're doing it only to run FT BB CH strats, still wouldn't go for it, it's spending the same amount of mats to get something worse
well, pri ing an uwu isn't that much of a waste, you'll get to have fun with VKE ER and you won't need to level raid dk for fire branch
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
craft balmung
prob one of the worst backpull around
doesn't feel right
needs to be resoable weapon
dxy can't pri
no
sleepri has starting sp
then just make another sleepri
idk, if you wanna waste cube and pri mats so you can do FT BB strat
i've matched some before with enough bald
but you ain't ever matching if you never try
look i get it
is this bitch swiping me out of the air
only boss that ever made me alt f4
yeah it's actually so tilting
fhem has a 616 but it's 3s WE
prob at least a 552 or smth
actually i dunno
you can go higher
owo math 39533 * 1.2
maybe get away with -1 or -2
i mean you can try without
apparently damage is easy as fuck that ref, as long as you crit enough
actually you can def get away with newt, wasn't fragile doing some experimentation?
yeah you can prob get away with newt
LMFAO
wtf did you do
there's SI HoS SNS too
= no FT
if you wanna be boring
i think rot just breaks down if you don't
you just really need a starting sp sword on BB
you can use gpn
this is what a bb rot looks like without sleepri
i mean it's craftable
oh
no but it tf, ain't that enough?
i mean can't you FT QTE with HoS clone pop?
silver reaper is maybe necessary? not sure
you can just use the usual stuff
cleo B is klein tech
gustav prob can get away with
LMFAO
you can't see shit
silver reaper strats really fun tho
then you can just use HoS
or are you doing HoF strats?
you want HoS for tank yea?
but the highest scoring is double sleepri
maybe you can do something with 1 sleepri
there's old strats actually
then rip
BB, that is
that's what she really needs, not the stat stick
nah an uwu is starting sp
if you have pri an uwu
you can 893 and maybe 946 with sick stats
not exactly
<:MeiKnife:647104199406125100>
start early or else
if anyone says they ain't farming the AL+AW valks i pop up
i'm the ghost of WT
it's gonna be longer if you don't start now
yeah
once you hit 3s MPE, then you buy JK frags weekly, and buy FR frags with the rest of the AL
so buy out JK frags weekly, and buy MPE frags with the rest of the AL
like, if your MPE isn't 3s, get her to 3s
and then buy the rest of one of the other ones
i would sink all AL into JK
how's your MPE
if you don't start you'll never finish
yes
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
for 2s MA is very big
for MA it's pretty good tho
like in the HoV you just threw those out early for sp LMAO
you can get away without it often
feel like for abyss
eh it depends
2s HoR isn't that big honestly
if there's anything else you can do, i'd go for that
i think speeding up farming is lowest prio there
DoR is faster
no luck
i tried with SoE
unironically, i used DoR twice this cycle
<:pepeW:996346590086303805>
not done yet
this is how much metal i spent on my acc
owo math 520 * 22
only a few more pri and i'm done
and this makes an entire screen of gold
same
this is for you gresham
though i guess the trick is the only reason why a f2p would ever touch adv banner
this should be better
i mean even for f2p, unless you mean that one trick
they fucked over the unlock awk valk from 50 pulls trick it had
it is kinda nice
if you already have s0 then it doesn't change that much
they changed it from 100 to s0 -> 2s to 100 to no valk -> 2s
yeah that's why they changed it
you actually get 130, so 20 off 2s1
100 is 2s
she's not awakened, eli
did y'all not have to input something like that
what's tax identification number on the event thing <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
really should be your highest prio before abyss and MA
sim battle gaming
fuck this shit
and am doing abyss on sunday
i did 6k
yea is what i'm doing
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
good investment
so you can score a point higher
pull for PE
it's crazy
yeah i've never seen nirv lobbies this awake early
so it's not as cool
but not same 10 pull
i got close, i did singles until tigh and got a mona 2 after
to this day i never got 2 5s in 1 10 pull
oh it's not you
what the fuck
it scares the f2ps
please refer those convos to #ninis-whale-emporium
this is the f2p chat
LMFAO nice
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
sheeesh
but i'm doing HoF AE made in abyss next time
didn't wanna play raven
cause i rank HoT AE HoF
i stopped at floor 9
that one you need to use real team to rush it i think
not on the abyss mode
play HoF or die i guess
the rest are real scuff
so actually you have 1 team
that's true, i forgot about that LMFAO
the moon's pretty and the upgrade base theme is cool
this is the end of me complaining, the rest of the OW is actually pretty good
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
if you're gonna make the newest shiny toy available just for shill, at least also make decent support for her also available for shill
it's not even for lore reason cause HoH is there for no reason
like i actually don't understand why they didn't just do the same as elysium everlasting
since her supports are usually so nice
especially a team like lightning for HoT
awful
using 2/3rds of a team feels
you should really be glad, honestly
you can choose between:
HoF, HoH
here in honkai impact you have a very diverse and open set of valks to play with
what the fuck are we even supposed to play???
1 and a half support
10 different dps
they literally give us
i actually hate this open world
<a:menheraNod:809322720319504384>
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
don't defeat me too bad
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
oh sheesh
i guess it makes it easier for people who are a bit not caught up
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
30 isn't enough
i mean
what am i pinning
which is a +1 for me, i like the attention
though they have already found this chat
yeah from what i interacted with them they're really nice
we still rescue some from wfp every now and then
yeah
legit take 30s to change my stigs and i've had people call me out for being slow LMFAO
i feel like all randos act like they're in a lan house and only have 2 mins to do the entire raid
270k dist
for the millions of dist
go on older abyss
and find the old abyss 1m dist
go back further
i'm pretty sure it would be universally better than ff19 on HB again
if we got cb19 pri which only fixed weapon cd
so that's why ff19 ends up winning, cause there's no cd issue
with cat on team it just fucks everything up, ult cd and weapon cd doesn't line up anymore
is that the weapon skill cd fucking blows
like, the true issue from cb19
ff19 wins on the long run tho
yeah reading makes a world of difference huh
maybe this time i can do better
i sucked balls at that
oh shit just the same as before trauma change?
i mean i can just run cb19 too
what's least awful
i have s0 JK 3s HB ff19
idk
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
definitely ain't doing this last hour
yo anyone has s0 refs
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
<@171082989046988800> do my abyss
once i get this 5 crit everything will be solved?
is this why BKE is so bald?
i'm missing 5 crit from dk
only 7 more levels.....
i'm almost there guys....
but yea that's the only one
so many gimmicks
cause that shit sucks with randos
might aswell be homu
tbh if they were only going to let 1 raid be able to be completed with 2 player
only on homu raid
like how tight are dailies, can i miss one and be alr
should i even start day 1
that sounds awful
i see
story once i get back home
yeah i'll take that then
but i wanna try to keep up with the story one more time before i give up and only watch the cgs
i'll trust you, i was planning on doing it anyways just to be sure
LMFAO are you 100% sure? cause i don't wanna rush story day 1 on my shitty laptop
 <@309634550273933314>
<a:AA_Gab_Bow:914213000594980964>
ty for helping with daily games <@416445660443967491> <@370438895965306882>
no she was sp a-rank
punished for playing the game
it's so bad
not like i need the red lenses or coins
i'm this <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> close to just stopping doing dailies
yeah no joke i've had to wait 10 minutes for a match before
why do you do this
why do you punish player who plays the game miyobo
god i regret grinding this event so bad
now i can sleep in peace
it's not patched i just suck
or do i just suck at the game
did they patch the 917 jizo with HoT
about 600 people are tryharding this as of like 10 mins ago
slacced but this is maybe actually interesting info
i can't wait
<a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
imagine having higher than s0 HoH...
o wait this is 445d
s0 scoring mid 800s
jesus christ
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
i'm going to take a maincord road trip
i refuse to accept that there are living breathing people below a2
like there's no way
i'm pretty sure literally anyone with any gear can retain agony 1
do you need agony 3 even
cmon eli
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
pleeeeease
you have no clue what id give for 6 xtal
someone please give me 6 xtal
if it's similar i'm so down
and got 6 dollar tax on it
i bought a book overseas
yeah like
just miss a sidestage for no reason
like a lot of people i would expect to be hyped and tryhard over this
i'm actually pretty surprised too
since last week is weird, ends on a wednesday
but it might change depending on how many mats they decide to give out on last week
1810 is the current estimate
still on pins
so PV prob very popular for both newbie and meta player
yeah i think it makes sense, lightning prob the most used team nowadays
and then SD would still be 0%
so like, t1 is 100%, everyone else just scaled to that
close to t1%
they should be probably be ranked with a number of like
which is pretty stupid, even the most impactful valk wouldn't break like 20% even if everyone played optimally
yea i think this number is just like how many times the valk was used at all
they are pretty useless LMAO
i think they didn't think through these numbers
i mean top 1 is pv at 8% or so
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
someone still using non-aug MC
i see
cause of new players
i feel like the b-rank are staying forever
isn't that the b-rank
who do you think would be the first to go
i'm still up to my idea of removing least used valk every patch
LMAO fair
i heard that she was somewhere back at the start of the beta but i don't see anything on patch notes or anything like that
also is SN being added to WT or not
and then predict when HoT is being added to WT
and check when HoR was added to witch corridor
you can prob go back in time
2s2 HoT prob way more useful than like 2% ice damage
to 2s2 HoT
i think i can afford stalling my dorm buff farming for a few weeks
i've been buying the cheaper LE frag for a while now
like 400 i think
can i even afford it
i'll need 2
oh god how much do they cost
**dorm exchange exclusive**

**newt B** - newt B (prob aim for 2-3 at current meta, can go up to 5-6 if you're MA balder and want to minmax affix)
**newt T** - good T phys piece, useful for FT or BB strats in 2s MA
**schro T** - for bald
**schro M** - for SNS on elemental strats in 2s doom
**ppm** - ppm (prob aim for 1-2 for general user, maybe a bit more if you're MA balder)
**ppk** - extremely niche, used for cap score on the weird bleed mobs abyss we had once and never again
**otto B** - i think it was useful once upon a time but never seen it used in current meta
**sirin** - for dorm chibi :D
**sirin asc** - for HoV i guess? T-piece for cope HoS dps
**welt** - before liu qi you can cheat out a second with welt TM newt B instead of ana in lots of 2s MA strats, nowadays 3p liu qi prob always better than any welt combination

**also craftable**

**cleo B** - for niche paralyse strats, like FT BB CH with klein tech
**fuxi M** - for niche paralyse strats, also for FR dps on certain bosses like kosma
**fuxi T** - for niche 2s SN strats (very bald)
**lier B** - good phys piece, still useful for some strats (like on HoS for 2s rimestar)
**shennong T** - for FT on FT BB CH strats (shennong T shui MB)
**sieg M** - especially good if you don't have avo M, has more cdr than avo M, necessary for some strats like SpA wolf cap and BB on 2s doom, can generally get away with avo M if you're alright with -1 or -2
**drac M** - for very bald abyss strats on HoS with holmes TB
**mich TB** - BiS for FT in ER if you're one of the weird players who wanna minmax that
**tesla band T** - good no-brain phys support piece, sometimes used on 3s MA
**tesla band M** - better version of villv M, good filler piece on lightning team, generally just use ppm over it nowadays though
**jst TM** - still really nice to have for 2s MA, used often, also some use on GD in 3s MA and on 9s teams
**gustav TM/M** - good low duration phys support stig, still pretty good in 2s MA but generally can just use better options if you're somewhat whale
**thales M **- not BiS anywhere but honorable mention cause it's broken as budget option
**beet M** - good no-brain phys support piece, rn often used on SI but still some niche use on other valks
**beet B **- sp on entry, necessary for a lot of 2s strats like 946 heim with HoT
**margrave** - margrave, AE kinda out of meta but still queen in fire team and margrave is really big for her
**kafka** - good budget but worse than ely as budget, only go for it for TP

**special**
**dirac, peary, monet** - for g3/g4 farming speed up
dorm exchange exhaustive stig list for usefulness (jump to here)
i'm gonna screen wipe by posting it again then
ah shit
so yea it's mostly for MA
but abyss is braindead just use signature 99% of the time
it's supposed to be exhaustive list including abyss uses
this is my exhaustive list

like tank cap is just impossible for me on phys team because of it, jizo cap is also a lot harder
but not having it can lock you out of some strats and then you just lose like 20 points in abyss for nothing
and then you see close to no diff in performance
4s is kinda situational, on some situation ult cdr doesn't matter
3s is bigger, goes from 5% -> 15% phys taken on debuff
yeah 3s and 4s are both really big
or just the ones exclusive to dorm exchange
do you want a list of everything including craftables
i can make a list of every even slightly useful stig there
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
finally
yeah
just tell us what options you are considering and we tell you the best one
so dumb
HoD scores <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
or something stupid
she gets a fucking 904
not sure about below 9s tho
HoH with JK is new cap for tank on 9s
ft bb ch on kallen
well i mean.....
maybe i'll finally 946 kallen
fun week
it always feels way too far away
no matter how closer i am to finishing wt
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
oh i'm 2/2 olenyevas
there's 3 kallens
oh ok LMAO
and honestly i might just make a point to never 3s a himeko
i got 0/6 himekos
you pulling for her?
here
vc dk hb
so close
i'm already 3/9 3s bronya actually
eli farming DB up
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
like that's her only charged attack
then i imagine so, that's her charged attack no?
if you read her skills you might become the only person on global who has that knowledge
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
still another 2 hours until it opens
so i don't forget
i should clear ER today probably
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
i would but i don't think you can you have like 3 lock mats
but in abyss you want 1/2 lines of sp/s
IO is full atk for MA
not really
parvati in 5.6
like 5.2
when was the first time she was even useful in abyss
in MA you go all in atk
well, dunno about abyss
pretty sure you just go all in atk
not really
<a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
but HoT is 696 <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but 2s1 DA would enable 648/664
prob 632 if i don't suck balls
i was at 616 pig with DA
yea like
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
2s1 DA is so much better for DA but she's useless
oh god now i'm reconsidering between 2s1 DA or 2s3 BKE
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> tilting
they gave her bare minimum finally
oh sheesh
and if she ever became useless, it's from dk revival
cause she's not very good
DA weap is prob like, very useless
yea generally 1st copy of stuff is lowest prio to get rid of
mihobo pulling out all the stops to make slaccers not get the book
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
but it's still important to know when's the earliest you can buy it
tbh day 1 i already was lowkey the purchase might stay around 1-2 days
NA so slacc....
but holy sheeeesh
o i was asleep
kasumi is just for shield damage i think, DoR should be enough?
prob also useful even if you don't have gear for 946
maru you use cb19 to freeze and proc bastet for 946
maybe for kasumi
not for maru
unironically can prob reso it and be alright if you have ff19 and only care about abyss
3s hepha and some 2s strats like HoH kasumi and HoH maru
it is still useful tho, for MA mainly
L-nya
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
i can just run ff19 now
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
we can just run ff19 now
miyomo looks at t100 this cycle, HoV 6.3 fixed -50% damage from valk using ana debuff not applying properly
and also the bugfix <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
so we'll know the <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614> of JK
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
as past hepha
is exactly the same
our dist
oh
im also probably demoting this cycle
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
gimme xtal
i'm running on fumes rn
i haven't topped up since 5.6
????????????
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
i'm gonna fucking morb out
of 70 xtal
scammed
and no sus event ofc
everything but 2 ER runs
310 is prob like
and people will have a chance to rush for book at monday if you slacced
but i feel like for NA we have book guaranteed if you're keepin up
and shit
everyone's doing ER
this is also the time
lucky
yeah 320 is a surefire guaranteed
at this point i expect book to last until monday
to be completely honest tho
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
yea there's no way to know
which i guess sounds hard
so if we have 2k people in between, we'd need to have at least 2k people at 340
anything in between is behind
we got 340 - guaranteed
420 - guaranteed
cause like
though hmmm
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
that does make it more annoying
i guess that's true actually
not exactly
all credit card no skill
i'm just up there because i whale
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
by sleeping every cycle
i'm doing my job on keeping dist low
what
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
yeah now it's hot no matter what
because HoD is just built diff ig
and then -5d on every other boss
we were like +6d every HoD
our dist was low as fuck for some reason then
no that mkes sense i think
oh pre 5.9
wtf
was like 3-4x more chill than mine
your lobby last time
all my HoD lobbies are stacked for no reason
i'll prayge for a non-fucked up HoD lobby
you can prob get away with that on avg lobby
i think global sucks at HoF
L-nya
<:elywhip:1002644839248183306>
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
i feel like that's +100 on avg lobby
i think it's pretty good for ana
ana or liu qi?
<:Deadge:958122498019434496>
i do it by 5th
like by first charged attack they kill shield
it's actually insane
i mean comparing that to my runs
i'll just take my shit score
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
sounds awful
so i can't break shield on first rot p1
bad move tho, i think i deal less damage outside of ult
that's what made me switch into welt TM liu qi B
yea i saw
just more atk
maybe, 2s1 HoR doesn't do much here
it's stupid
SO much more shield damage
that's
insane
2s JK is fucking
which is what matters
but for us non-slaccers we're guaranteed
cause if t12500 isn't at 340 or 420, that means a lot of people will have chances since there'll be stock at the next monday
i guess not really fucked, too
so either they do it or not, any other value and it's something else and they're fucked
yeah, cause the only task they can slacc is the event one
if it's anything other than 340 or 420 then we're safe i think?
gotta wait until sunday reset to get any useful info
or any combination like that
they could've done like 1 ER and not done like, 7k bp task
since ER is 15+15+15
we don't know that
hurt to watch
that
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
i grabbed AW
avg is like 32k alr
you only need to be some unlucky while going for 4/4 jk + SoE to hit that
yeah
i could see it
only need to spend like 36k
oh i guess not really
owo math 340 * 4
you need to spend like 60k xtal for 2s JK
jesus that shield damage is stupid <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
how the fuck do they not have liu qi if they spent enough for 2s JK
that's a fucking high ass score
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
smh kinda disgusting
looks like a whale
whoa who's that
i don't even have elf
elf scammer
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
smh liu qi scammer
that feels pretty far away to hit with ana
732....
also 2s1 HoR but ig that doesn't matter
that's one point below me but i'll take a peek to see if i learn anything
verne liu qi? LMFAO
soon they'll beat me
t3 has 12/12 2s JK
t2 has liu qi TM newt B, 3s HoR 2s JK
this fucking took the life out of me
what do people think the max score with ana s0 JK is
this bitch be havin negative sp gen
591 is a good score right
this feels like a turg cat angle
is this a turg cat angle
it's so consistent too, very cool
cool
so JK breaks it instead
i guess i'm at exactly damage breaking point that first half of SoE active leaves HoV shield at 1hp
doesn't apply
just
sometimes my SoE passive
is this boss alright
jesus christ if you need to ult a third time your score just fucking tanks huh
which often kills me
so i try to do dumb shit like run around the circle and kill other people
i get bored really easily
survival ones are really hard to me
i think i'm starting to figure it out
<:peepoSit:1016193458307862609>
holding hands with gresham at the finish
double jump like .1s after bomb explodes and you cancel all the momentum from it
it's pretty fun
i got a few right tho
keep mistiming my cancels LMFAO
<a:AA_Gab_Bow:914213000594980964>
sorry
o shit i tried killing you
is this going to be a low scoring abyss?
sheeesh
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
i'm a boomer idk how to learn new things
how tf do i use it now
oh god genshin optimizer changed
<a:peepoPrisoncry:756795266849570847>
yeah bring me back to RL and i will
to show how much of support impact this game really is
i wanna go back to RL to do meme runs with like no dps stigs or shit like that
i was doing tact training back then, and i always stole it to use 6s, so i always went wow this is tankier than i remembered
i did without stigs on HoR
for a good while, every HoR sidestage i did
i relate to that
in all that time
almost 200 primo from dailies
you missed like
<:TeriPoint:1033130036284370984>
a long time
guess how long since i quit
apparently it is now
idk i just remember it being in the files on 2.0 but not achievable then
spanish tl team working overtime
it's one that was added in 2.0 to game files but didn't actually show up by the time i quit
thank you, i won't need it
is shuumatsu gaiden finally achievable?
but i think there's some which are in the game but unachievable
paimon.moe says 824
just beat up a few bosses
they're really boring tho
ask to join if you wanna help with co-op achievements <a:catgib:564829264466149378>
besides like commission and timegated ones
i think i reached like 100% in two or three patches
it was high when i quit
i'm at 539
i'm not really close actually
i'm gonna beat tet to 800
do you wanna join my world and help me do the new co-op achievements
is this a call for help
who even is the current elf
yeah do all that and you'll surely become t100 player like me
1. 80 pull into irene banner and no uprate
2. 3p welt
3. 2s mobius
4. pull gustav banner for 11th
5. skip turg release banner
6. only pull until pv bow on pv release banner because it's prob the most important piece of the set
top 10 investments by keilo
i pulled for full welt and it's at lv1
but mix and match of liu qi and ana, no good
yea i think you can run welt TM liu qi B
like 2-3%
non whales don't get to play the game
that's what you get for not whaling
L-nya
please more people do that
yea i feel bad for them because i like them but
and the other wasn't able to do it and couldn't get someone to pilot in time
both started too late, one didn't have enough time to clear sidestage at all
there's 2 people in my armada who are behind too
less and less people complete abyss = easier for us to get the book
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
those are prob some of the hardest main and side stages
sick
i'm sorry for your loss
when did sea pass us in dist
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
there's like some bs when it hits 465 right
this is the second time we hit 465
why's our disturbance so high....
how slacc are they slaccing <:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
wait i guess it's impossible to miss only 15 from abyss <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
the only way for someone to have 205 currency and not be behind is if they haven't done 3k bp task yet
t12500 is at 205 currency
we might be safe, global NA
yea be careful, chief
imagine knowing time
o wait you're right
hold tight now, this is the calm abyss before the one that matters
but tbh i kinda doubt
if this bug enables you to get 3k point earlier, i'm gonna morb out
apparently story OW has, as always, some bug to explore further before it's unlocked
that means it's p much confirmed that d-day is next friday
hmm no hidden extra sushang task then
m-maybe....
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
i'm a good hoe
only one i'm good at is the pipe one
i'm so bad at today's minigames
KMS
WTF
kms
fucking coin minigame
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
503 for retain
yea
looks like you're getting away with it
i mean
710/720 prob
with s2 sw i think i'm supposed to like
that's like bare minimum i think
s2 sw
i mean
jeez....
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
mob is the real boss
as with all ice bosses
mob gather?
where is the sp inconsistency even coming from?
<a:WorryHug:1032765989399572643>
i don't like this fight much
<:DekuMonka:897590103013220352>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that's enough resume right
i'll put my spending amount in genshin and honkai
LMFAO
is my guess
like 12-16
honestly, deserved
i wouldn't complain if i got a notice rn
LMFAO
it was there day 1, dunno about other days
only because i'm bad at it
i hate it
but it is awful
it isn't new
same
happened like 5 times already LMFAO
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
but mine is more correct
because it's pretty they assume it's more correct than what i'm doing
people post it and ping me
yeah i get salty over that one
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
so people would think the wrong day for book
imy pinned the wrong currency timeline LMFAO
i am ofc rank scamming
kinda close to being able to ult one more time and that would clean up a good amount
i actually think 2s sw makes a pretty good diff here
everyone above me either has 2s+ sw or 2s+ jk
i'm currently the highest 1s sw 1s jk on the leaderboards
<a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
good ending
LMFAO fair honestly
570 is 7th here
look at that shit
how am i the one with slacc lobbies
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
also
<a:AA_Gab_Bow:914213000594980964>
sorry i'll go back to balding
but idk subranks, caliver is good at the game so i wouldn't be surprised if they were -3 points from me with s0
the only other person with similar setup to me is caliver, 1s sw 1s jk
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
7th is 2s sw 2s jk
lumina z is 3s hoh 1s jk
kaptech is 3s sw 2s jk, moon runes is 2s sw 2s jk
there's some scary people here
i'm t2 rn but idk if they're waking up soon
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
how well should i be scoring
i made up my own rot
s2 sw s0 jk
is this an acceptable score
that's a lot
?log <@148145559897636865>
hm
like a fucking wasp
i love when the mobs fucking slap me out of the air
we have it guaranteed
if at sunday -> monday reset it's not 420
yea pay attention to that number
like i dunno what combination of tasks give 175
i have no clue what that even is actually
yeah
is at 175
no, the 12500th place
i know right
i'm one of them
LMFAO
yeah v few people are paranoid enough to 7k bp asap on the week that doesn't matter
142, not that many people 7k bp huh
on top right
click the i
yeah
what rank are you
no juice
yea
i'd warn but i don't think i can warn
ana is really hot
<:pepeW:996346590086303805>
yea no
didn't think i would end up affording it
maxing both pri week 1
you were overthinking
confirmed here too
for the event
did you spend some currency?
and see if the value to unlock book decreases or not
all i want is to spend 1 currency
just need to have event unlocked
i mean doesn't need to be
i think it's gonezo LMFAO
wait fuck my throwaway acc isn't linked to a hoyolab acc
but i still do
i'm at 4.4k, i think at this point i don't need to max coin
i always max coin still
oh coin maxed i'm done
since i already maxed coin, there was a chance i'd go
but i was too paranoid that i'd forget
yea i said i would save the ER tasks for late on the week
<:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
they do say ranking of earned, if it was owned that mattered then they'd do ranking of owned instead right
i'm too damn paranoid
i'll do it on a throwaway acc
i have an idea
then i'd be fucked
but what if current estimate is wrong
because current estimate is that we'll have 665 on d day
like i'd spend 1 currency on asterite to check
<:TeriRead:919902365648318485>
lemme read
LMFAO yea exactly i'm paranoid now
<:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
is it collect 660 or have 660 currency for the book?
god i'm so paranoid
i'll buy 1 asterite, just to check
okay i'll do dumb choices
i already have enough cube for CN pri, there's like no weapon i need to max anymore
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
but i really don't care about any of those
but then i have too much left
actually i should prob ignore honkai shard, torus and lens
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
costs 1808
buying everything but phase shifter, lens and torus
yea 1810 rn
and i also dunno if this is the best place to spend those
yeah that's what i'm worried over
about to make some heki choices here
s-should i do it
but i want it
realistically it ain't even gonna make that much diff idt
to max JK pri
i need 13 metal.....
why do you care so much
nyx isn't even useful for MA
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
metal still metal
nanos are becoming cum
i need like 20 to max my JK pri <:smoke:808652033007157258>
sell me some metal?
oh no i'm gambling
LMFAO
owo coin tails
LMFAO
wtf i just spent money i think
owo coin please
huh
owo coin
i didn't know i was that close to pity
i wasn't even lucky on nahida
is where i buy my chickens
coop store
L-nya
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and you're about to cube it, not even torus it
on that
i spent 4k blue reso
oh no
what's tk
<@370438895965306882> <a:Love:534242801131454516>
surely their security is good enough that they would leak anything big at all
leak deez nuts
like reroll acc to sell
i mean i know some people make profit in gacha
not that it makes it any better <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
original gacha you were always able to sell w/e it was
so like, not being to sell would be the outlier
i mean gacha comes from gachapon, the machines
that is just straight up gacha
i mean by gacha is just the opening card pack part
yea it's prob like one of the first ever gacha
with time only got exponentially more so
so even when it released it was already expensive
iirc this card is especially expensive because it was already rare and it's broken
the one from base set is where the money's at
you can get a reprint for like 20 bucks
they do get reprinted but like from old sets it's still like in the thousands for a copy
i mean the old one should be
and yea there are some giga expensive mtg cards too, black lotus is the most famous one
just on the off chance that it ends up getting a better grade
i know some people grab old cards and get them re-graded every so often
yeah <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
could be like a magnitude of diff in price
if they were just printed slightly wrong
could be a card still in never opened pack
pristine conditions even goes for like how the card was actually printed
like they'd need to be from special set or from event for a new card to reach those prices
dunno if it gets to thousands of dollars if they're just normal cards tho
i think in that case they're just turbo rare
like quality standards are insane
it's just old card in good quality no
would it be fun if they gave card out from achievement stuff
so much going on all the time
same actually looks like such a steep learning curve
yeah play the game for a whole 10 minutes to reach pro level
cheaper than honkai
oh that sounds like fun
sounds like a pain
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
i mean i'm not even burnt out, i just don't wanna do huodou without liu qi
and fuck abyss
i can maybe pilot but idk i'm kinda slaccing MA too
<a:WorryHug:1032765989399572643>
<:cry:944955259636285481>
gresham won't let me
yeah, i'll never forget the first time i promoted nirv
<:TeriCopium:969281688414875728>
dw we'll soon get honkai anime
i think i'd hate that in the long run
roseless is actually really nice, i'm a little worried she'll regret having the first nirv retain on her acc not done by her
you pay, someone else plays
you looking for a roseless deal
hit em with this one
next time you should say fuck you go back to doing story
took sensei advice to heart
i mean good cadet
LMFAO
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
my business is strictly game related
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
i send message weekly asking how they're doing and they don't answer
mine ghost me
point them to me i'll answer
playerbase doesn't deserve her
nvm i don't want sin mal in the game anymore
what is wrong with people
i am traumatised
is a very nsfw dakimakura of her
the 6th result on google images for sin mal
stfu
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
we forgive you
come back sin mal
she is now
i think
i mean but yea she was handicapped, HoR powers fixed her legs
good, fuck her
i thought you were going to say
oh ok
she was
she can be flatnya
boobnya is taken
lightning psy mei, deals lightning damage but is fire support
actually that's sick, i'll stick with that
could be like lightning psy but AE killer
6.3 - bronya on sw-style banner
6.4 - fire ima kiana + fire elf
          lightning ?? mei for free + cheap gear banner
okay so my guess currently is
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
that sounds awful actually
cause like soon we'll need new boss every patch
and add new bosses
3s MA is forcing miyoyo to care about MA for once
i guess if anything
base ely and mobius not really, but maybe
which i could see being turned into 3s MA fights
we have like kalpas, aponia, v2v fight
the transition actually is v pretty
yea that one too, it fits MA quite well
we got 2 different HoH, each could be a different 3s fight
that could easily be made, they're prob just waiting until they release a counter
for new bosses, we do have like a few on waiting room
it's also been a fucking while since we last had it
but it's more bs than skill intensive
i guess couatl is also hard
leave it the fuck alone
doom literally only skill intensive 2s MA bossl eft
no
get rid of the easier one
kallen is just SK but more tanky
that'd be sad
and hov is too bs to exist, you can get rid of her
is aka, sk, both punching bag
out of those, the ones i'd be alright with turning into 3s
it's so interesting and funny
i love 2s huodou fight
ikr it's kinda bs
as options
maru, aka, assaka, doom, dxy, couatl, heimdall, homu, hov, kallen, kasumi, rimestar, SK
right now we have
slowly running out of options
why is a good question tho LMFAO
good 2 patches before v2v
i mean it was a nyx fight
pig too, only seen twice after release
LMFAO
just to show his face in 6.0 once and gone again
release 5.7, fucking poofed out of existance
tona was the worse
you get used to not seeing a boss for like 2+ patches before they just plop them back in
boss just kinda comes and goes from MA schedule for no reason
i mean that's kinda normal tho
monka
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
so long from now
and won't have it until like
i'm kinda worried cause i don't have it
you got liu qi?
can't wait to play that
LMFAO
JK is at least way better grouper i feel like
i remember doing it with AE
real assaka hours
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
Mhm
yes
that's like 5 dorm bonuses
25% ice damage
that's actually really big
oh shit
or is it just for HoH passive
do anything useful
does spending more sp on jk ult
for people who read
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
that was first run for me, i'll bald later
for us, we need to clear 3 nodes
that's for q-mani shit
no, you ignore that
especially a faster boss like HoD
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
is consistently faster than most side stage
i think clearing boss even with a bad run
so your choice is between clearing 2 main stage + boss or 2 main stage + sidestage
for superstring, it's based on nodes cleared, not waves
it doesn't
to see if it counts for the abyss task
<@180679257851166721> i tested doing a few waves and quitting
but no liu qi i'm p sure my dps goes <:TeriNotStonks:1009441195673538642>
it looks actually really fun
with s0 JK
fhem posted a strat
i'm not looking forward doing 3s huodou with ana.....
what's wrong with her
she's at 1255
my JK atk actually blows, is this normal
sell me some metal
yea those are normal people measurement
dia getting a thing right by the worst possible method and logic available
don't think fire team is the highest prio to keep invested atm
but it depends if you even have and want to keep up a fire team
sp gear on release <a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
between the 2 i'd say CN gear prob higher prio?
i think you can afford neither
how much do you have
for your needs it's prob way more than enough already
yea you can stop
o
i wouldn't stop before weapon personally
tb + weap?
but idt it's possible today
should go up to 280 when you can clear 7k bp point
it's still the max i'm p sure
this is awful
i regret setting up stealth pings
have fun in fall guys
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
i gotta go to school now
LMFAO sorry <a:NOOO:996348845803966524>
in the survival one
did i kill you
o no
L-nya
i'm not good at the ring one
o gresham! you're here! :D
we do be grindin
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
thank you-nya
you can
t10-nya
everything for gresham to like me
holy fuck
i could flex instead
but do i even need to max JK pri this soon
i haven't finished maxing the 2 new pri, they're 65 and 60 right now
and then base pri is really cheap
i mean i have the mats to level a weapon to 50
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
what do i get
do you're haggling
ic
<:TeslaThink:591362899335839776>
what's the issue then
base ff19
don't you have it
and i can afford to craft it, just not max it
unironically i'd prob be the first player in NA to have it
<:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
should i make second ff19 pri for HB
fucking bs fight
mob are the real boss
that's assaka alr
i just wanted to do shit asap so i could steal a top screenshot for funsies LMFAO
i guess that's smart
we got some balders around
so that means 26 people cleared 15 shallow stages so they could do the ER task for bp point before ER opened
i was actually 43 earlier today
LMFAO
ayyyyyyyyyyyyy
this is SK <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
unbiased take here
yea spend money in this one
so funny that mihoho puts this own their own valk
with the AW from MA
i'm gonna get her tomorrow.... probably....
you're right
<:cry:944955259636285481>
who do you think i am
help-nya
yea i can see it actually
where is my JK
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
you think.... still HB JK if JK is s0
and they need to force trigger because else those valks would have awful TF
like SW we don't get free evasion but her evasion blows
we only get free evasion trigger if they proc TF
well not necessarily
or does it only proc once
if you're running AE BR
is that 20% tdm
i can test that
a friend of mine is going to test if you can do 2 main stages + boss
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
can you now spend your future AL on my 2s SK pls
all for mei
sheeeesh!
since tomorrow is monthly reset
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
this time i'm being smart and saving asterite so i can buy JK finally tomorrow
look at my JK
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
JK pri is neb without the cost
so basically
you gen 60 but you spend 25
it's 35
it's 40 i think
jesus LMFAO
<:YEP:875561908172902471>
LMFAO
damn i trolled nqn
LMFAO
wth
```ansi
[2;35mi can type with colors now[0m
```
this is when it opens
<t:1667246400:t>
it's uh
idk
it's going to be on abyss opening, not daily reset
if it's 11th do you even need day off
we either rush event or run it down abyss
then it's a rush event angle
carv said probably not, said he took 10 days to get 4k
gotta ask the beta testers/cn players about it
but i have no info
i'm guessing a hard no
yea that's the question ain't it
yea i guess this is a run it down angle
the second one tho will take a while LMFAO
the first one we'll know by thursday
2. maybe irregular tasks for the very last week, since it ends on a wednesday instead of a sunday
1. maybe hidden event tasks after you complete the first
for the max resource estimate, the thing that is still up to debate is
plus the extra bp task
actually nuts
yea the point increase from abyss task
**current day of the reckoning estimate:** nov 11th, friday
**tie breaker task:** abyss (HoD abyss)
**current max resource amount estimate:** 1840

i agree
yea they should've waited 2 more days
<@416445660443967491>
the only thing that could throw this number off now is if there's a secret extra sushang event task
which means it's close to confirmed that the day of the reckoning will be friday 11th, when abyss opens
so it's 5/5 10/10 15/15
the second abyss task is the same book reward as the first
o yea i got confirmation from SEA player
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
damn alright
how much is it
so bad
that sounds
please don't let that be the tie breaker miyobo
....god
LMFAO
that's like 400 hours
3k?
and we need to get
70 per 10 hours????
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
do you expect people not to get it day 1 or smth
<@218762069338619906> how bad is it to get 3k ore in OW?
it's prob actually next week tho, kinda scary
to see how much the abyss tasks actually give
guess i'll just wait until later today
that makes sense why it was not launch week
o wait you said it's 1/2 for bp
that's doable on monday i'm p sure
so the bp tasks is still 3k
i see, thank you!
soon <a:terigrabhic:709594728039055390>
day 1: t12
we're getting so many lobbies with t1
hua gang
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
alr just ping whenever if at all you wanna join
<@370438895965306882> we got room if you wanna join
<:HoEOuch:671132101592088577>
once this breaks off or opens up a spot i can get you in
i'll be balding for a while tho
o sorry someone invited me to a full lobby <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
ping me if anyone wants to join the lobby
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
do people want me to stream keirial keiller?
i single handedly took like 6 or 7 lives there
it's actually optimal to kill them so games end faster
i feel dirty
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
alright ty for coming for a while
i'm just a gamer what can i say
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
noooo nini <a:NOOO:996348845803966524>
4th is already +0
but at like 8-9k, where i'm at
if you're at like 2k you still get points at 5th or 6th
depends on how high you are too
but total score, yea
not tickets
yeah smh
cause there's 3 of you
it's just really hard
look i legitimately was trying to hit everyone besides you 3
LMFAOOOOOOOOO
you should be ashamed
defeated by heki
L-nya
yea there's skills
LMFAO dw i will
i'll try to not kill you guys on the survival ones
whoa we got the fucking gang
<a:PU_peepoRiot:778676108152274974>
okay lets do one without him, fuck heki
<@781539392039682058> <a:kree:809653433455214632>
so i griefed the other 2 so i could tie with the kosma and it actually was zei LMFAO
and zei usually runs kosma
the other day i was doing a survival one with kosma + 2 randos
i can see honkai player doing 6 hours
really not that bad
actually yea like i said, 30k is like 10 hours, that's like about 3 hours of straight t1s per day
what the fuck
what the fuck
not even joking, the other day
but i wanna stick to one so people can recognise me in the wild
i've done some roza and some cat
or do you just stick with kevin
do you change your valk often
let me plaaaaaay
let me play
i'm having fall guys withdrawal symptoms
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
<@781539392039682058> come back
are you... okay?
too lazy to open my own rentry
to remind myself of what they do
and check her rank ups
is that i can't open her in game
the one thing i hate about not having JK yet
i'll go back to grinding in like 10 mins
o i'm eating rn
if you don't win every game that's skill issue <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
not that bad
that's like, 10 hours?
so it's 3k points per hour
owo math 45 * 70
like 40? 45?
per hour
how many victories do you think you can get
owo math 30 * 70
32k rn
t1 is kinda achieavable here
mauled their scores
destroyed their hopes
did you kill them all
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
to make that joke
i had to look up if A cup was the big or the small one
ngl
yeah a B cup
i think she's like an.... A cup? B cup?
heki's like v2v booba are a realistic point of reference
yea in that case
p <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
then i'd agree
honestly if all my reference was aponia
on t100
i wanna hold hands with zei
acc sharing
if he was
i'd be banned
i just throw by following others with bombs
am i a bad person
way too much fun griefing other in fall valks
i actually have
voteban anyone under 18 1/5
from solstice
i found roseless just now
keep it up
they've been killing with the events
not even for once, actually
pretty good for once
this event has a lot of fun stuff
honestly finding people you know in fall valks is so fun
cause i wanna kill everyone else
i keep losing on the survival fall valks minigames
i think?
nice?
um
LMFAO
because fall guys is more fun than that shit
on like 3 weeks for abyss
i'm gonna to miss out
it's fucking dangerously fun
wonder which i'm gonna do
or i could bald fall guys
i could bald kosma/andrius
you know
with CF now
that's fair i guess
i mean yea
cause i don't think she's stealing lightning wolf any time soon
wasn't her already? for type wolf
every new 3s MA is guess how they're going to make this fight longer for no reason
yeah? you understand how i feel now?
the 400 top scores
honestly, i feel like we need more long as fuck fights for no reason
with 2 waves of mobs
they should bring back old BKE boss
LMFAO we'll become retiree discord server
it's actually insane
genshin wishes they were us
SO many skins lately
honestly we're getting
while you're there
tell us how kiameibron suits are
carv living in the future
what resets?
it's been so long.....
just makes me miss RL
also watching beta gameplay
<:scaramouch_lurk:925161879322624110>
i'll watch someone play it
yea that'd make sense
i mean the new one, the old ones i think there are ports now? i guess you can always emulate
is it pc or console?
you'd think people would've gone for that sooner
that's a surprisingly untouched market on horror games
they're going for the trypophobia
it looks really nice
the trailer
that's actually pretty as fuck
f
the movie: the game
the movie?
a lot more people went in for HoH instead of v2v, doesn't mean v2v is more powerful, just less competition
but 3s HoH might not even t15
like how 2s v2v can like t10 myriad
so if everyone has s1+, your s0 is gonna feel weak
a good s0 player won't keep up with a similar skilled s1 player
there's no really strong or weak in a vaccuum
i mean it's always about competition right
actually stupid
yea HoS is the highest value 3s for this day
L-nya
you're stuck here forever now
yes
prob the people you hang out with?
it's p big
also i do hear people talking about how much of a difference s0 is from s2 HoF
so most people who pulled for her just looked at s1, saw how many frag left and went i guess i'll go for that
s1 is just really good
just pump damage <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yea that's unironically how they do new valks lately
she still sucks balls at MA stuff, she just deals enough damage where it doesn't matter
even though like v2v ain't getting no more tf at 3s
like 3s v2v can match HoT score
you don't need good tf if you have just insane damage
yeah, it's inevitable
<a:Smoge:825136707095101441>
and then we have to play autoplay valks
but is only a matter of time until powercreep catches up to her and she isn't as broken even in MA
since she's the most used LMFAO
which i guess is a good thing
is HoT
unironically i feel like the only valk in 3s MA who doesn't feel like that
i kinda hate it honestly, takes a lot of fun from making up and following refs
you need them to autoplay just to keep up
it's too slow
like all the new valks are so broken that if you have a valk that takes time while you actually playing the game
that's kinda what i dislike about how the game is going currently
yea
actually impossible to predict wtf miyobo is going to do <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but idk about that anymore
egoscion
i was kinda on copium that mei would get a scion suit
unless something big happens
from how they are in lore
like it'd feel waaaaay too removed to make them anything else
and fire kiana
can they even do anything but lightning mei
like i thought about that but
i dunno
i was like huh i don't know if HB boobs are that impressive
oh shit i forgot SW is a bronya
i feel like that's part of her identity already
i'm like fuck it, just make her ice already, who cares LMFAO
why are y'all on phys bronya and not ice bronya?
that feels weirdge
cause like i dunno if they just wanna scuff one out
it's actually kinda hard to guess where they're going
and another half i'm pretty sure at least one is ima so i'm getting at least one right <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
so it's half like i can see them make it work
for the trio
all ima
unironically
okay my guess is
all of the are like that LMFAO
look at this
piss shit: awakened
wtf is mihoyo boner with naming new pris shit like
+2 affix slots per stig
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but i dunno how to do that
ideally i'd want it to be a different spice of phys somehow
i'd honestly be okay with a different type of damage i think
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
no
a new type of damage
do y'all think we'll see
deals psy pink damage
i noticed some niches to be filled
bronya - psy ice
kiana - psy ice
mei - psy ice
lemme make my bets
feel like lightning team is strong enough to just steal literally all qua boss
i mean even if they do that
v2v found dead on a ditch
oh god that's true LMFAO
mei lightning psy would make me fucking quit i think
what are the bets for the new trio
y'all think new bronya will be phys mech?
one rpc for each psy valk
next patch sushang up rpc
okay i see
LMFAO
you think so? i can see it for heph but rpc might be close
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
imagine if JK dps can score like 47600 on MA heph
it's stupid
she literally got aponia'd
not our fault
they did her fucking dirty
that's what's going on rn
doesn't deserve writing team
miboyo design and balancing team
fucking
LMFAO
so good luck finding refs
in NA
there's literally no s0 HoH
with HB
cause like i'm at 720
so that's matching?
i think s0 HoH 2s JK can get like a 730-740 i think
kinda scary
yea lowkey max pri + like s2 or 2s might match s0 HoH
<:TeriCrossArms_hg:991905054988705822>
no JK no brain needed
not me
oh prob because s0 JK? maybe at higher rank she can afford to stay on field longer
kinda surprising how cat and JK share almost 50/50 field time
not even max
lv60 pri too
still p impressive tho
704
i ain't scamming anything over him, we're straight up just matching stuff, i dunno how i'm able to keep up
at like +4d
but i'm gonna be honest i have no clue why i can follow it LMFAO
so i guess there's a good amount you can save
lux ref is actually 738
i guess i can see it actually
750 s0 cap?
yea i mean
750?
5 points with same rot
but i doubt you can save more than like
yea from what i played, it was kinda scuff
my bracket is v slacc
i lied about my score by 1 point
how often does that happen
what we went 0 after last cycle? LMFAO
i assume so, we were 461 before
idk
aren't we 462?
oh is it 4?
i have no clue
even though we're +5d
than when i did it last bella
and i somehow am doing more damage now
from last bella
i just ran lux's ref
yea it looks like so
yea my 723 was with 3s HB
ic
i'm kinda surprised by how high everyone's scoring
s0?
or
are you using HB
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
i think you got a fucked up bracket
and i was 2nd
i got a 723 in like 20 mins
jesus
only awk dudu is PE
no
last 4 cycles i one-and-done'd it LMFAO
<a:KeiloTheBear:1002644779441598585>
not an abyss player
i wouldn't know <:KianaDumb_lum:514971108718673928>
but i'm very sure at least the abyss ones absolutely do
they are just assuming the abyss and bp tasks don't reset at all
i'm very sure it's wrong
yea this is the worst case scenario numbers
being -45 atk prob nets you like a -1 or -2 at most in most MA bosses
for like a single valk? about 10-20k xtal prob
i dunno
like.... how much would i pay for it?
with not knowing what to do with the transition
honestly maybe i relate with 3s MA
i'm gonna improve that later, i still don't understand wtf is going on during transition
better than FGO already
better than my pb of -47 LMFAO
-10? honestly
owo math 776 - 616
how much - is that
idk wtf i did
idgi
feel like all f7 are easier than f6 for some reason
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
bald MA and complain
my 2 favorite thing
i'll complain about it later
classic mihomo
so either they fucked up and played the SEA pv for us for some reason or we're getting another 7 foca card
it's the same pv that played for us in global
huh, are we getting 10 foca card in global too?
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
mi emotes are blurry
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
i can do your dxy
seeing as you're in the mood
do my abyss next nini
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
talking in hieroglyphs
see
spending too much time in discord turns into an old egyptian
if you think about it
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
L-nya
you're on the unlucky timeline
then it doesn't matter for this you, right?
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
if she were to you'd already have the b-chip
sheeeesh
o
i don't have a JK LMFAO
what JK rank do you even have
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
yea that's double the words
how else would've you expressed it?
i expressed it using few words and assumed you'd understand it <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
we p much never get more stuff than CN, only either less or at a different time, so i just assumed they'd have a similar event around
i can't quickly find it in notices but i can't read CN so <:Shrug:616394597211439118>
it's clearly not low enough for some other events though
i dunno if lv26 is too low for the event or if it straight up doesn't exist
how is this a bad assumption LMFAO
<a:MeiQuestion:930749563655061514>
the same could've happened with CN, getting the same event as we have just with a different theme and no book
we got the artbook event on the same patch as CN did, just reskinned without the book as reward
?
i logged into my acc but it's level 26 so i dunno if it's just locked
<@218762069338619906> do we know if the book event even exists for CN
true
but i guess with current numbers it actually is LMFAO
since it's late on the day
lowkey think it's v unlikely that abyss will be the thing to make the difference
LMFAO
ty carl
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
hide your snipe better
kasumi?
this time i unironically did a double take and thought wait what 2s boss is tet even using HoH on
that's an MA score
yeah it's insane
without the lv88 weeklies, getting 660 goes from 14th -> 24th
like on my current numbers
that i think it's impossible that they won't
lv88 weeklies give SO much
yea this is actually kinda fun LMFAO
for funsies
i'll pin it here too
Autumn Book Event Resource Management spreadsheet
<>
bruh has an account?
figuring out the event bs
i'm actually so hype this is pretty fun
<:lfgCatgirlEdition:803114454187114506>
brazil's there
for all places it delivers
oh there's a table
like 12
imagine actually reading LMFAO
oh shit nvm 12.5k ain't that bad
unless taihen my baby gives us some spoilers
anyway, can't know for sure until start of next week and maybe even until end of next week
which is prob fun
this can be insanely bald
yeah
depending on what day the book drops
oh god
gotta do every daily LMFAO
which is actually pretty bald
prob like 10k bp mission
and then next week, they'll be around but different i think
i'm pretty sure those are only launch because they're special for 1st shorter week
on the event page, they say bp and abyss are also weekly
<@218762069338619906>
i've been training for this for 2 years
my time to shine
that's the number assuming the bp and the abyss ones don't reset at all
LMFAO to clear it faster? <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah
book goes down to 14th
this is the numbers when abyss counts for 30
LMFAO
that's why i said to wait a week to make sure
i assumed that all the launch week ones are only launch week because of patch starting on thursday reasons, but if they don't reset at all then my numbers are wrong
or just doesn't reset at all
it says launch week, but it might either be a different task than the normal weekly one because we're starting in the middle of the week
yeah i dunno if it resets or not
because the ER ones are the same value for 1 2 and 3
we only see 1/3 here, so i assumed it was same for 2/3 and 3/3
ty
oh is it?
that one does say it resets weekly
login
ooo
but ofc i dunno how all of those are resetting
this is what i came up with
6.1% tdm -> 10% tdm and that's it
her pri has like neb levels of team damage increase
cause her pri levels seem to only be personal damage
i guess it must be sorta high
is JK personal dps high or smth
before 3s FGO was introduced
was on 2s FGO
last time it was used
i guess i'm getting 2s1? with the top up event
well, not easily, it's 260, so it's p much right on point
2 pala + all in on HoS is easily 2s tho
and 600 2s -> 3s
yes awk is 250 s0 -> 2s
10 or 11
that's about 10 patches i think
an understatement LMFAO
that's
pure f2p
59 weeks, so 1 year 2 months?
and then another 34 for 3s
owo math 200 / 6
i've been poked
<:surprised:889238431580958780>
worse than craftable (margrave), don't bother with thinking too hard about it
is my answer
prob not
i dunno
L-nya
and you have 4/4
you only need one more stig piece
you have weapon + 3 m?
sheeeesh
smh
you don't even know their names
i know what you did
like yea i fucked up, but only because i didn't plan ahead, and i also didn't plan ahead cause i knew it wouldn't matter much anyways
i'm just impatient
if i buy her now or next week, i'm not using her until next patch anyways
i mean realistically it ain't making any difference
LMFAO
buy jk
i'm missing 280 aw cause im stupid
how much do you have
if i luccsacc a card, would i rather it unlock the valk, or that i buy the card from WT and get 30 frag from it
also, if i roll a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> on JK expa
always elf diffed
<:cry:944955259636285481>
and fuck dudu elf?
and then go for 2 JK stamps
so i guess i just find a place to spend that many pulls on
owo math 16800 - 13160
lemme just press buttons
ugh i hate making spending decisions
LMFAO
where i got fucked over by not having dante B
there was a week actually
collect deez nuts
i could go for rando columbus piece but is that worth a 10 pull
dark star, columbus MB, dante B
my options literally are
i don't even know if i'm doing firepower
i'm thinking about it
fuck no
but now like, where do i even throw away the rest of 24k to reach that? there's like literally no banners LMFAO
if i spent 36k, i'd be able to buy 4s dudu from spending
yea like
feels kinda like a waste
like as a bonus while i'm going for other stuff sure but if i'm spending xtal on it directly
is it even worth it for me to go for dudu elf then
i mean sure but like
and also so i can properly do jizo
i just wanted 4s dudu so i'm not permanently -2 on tank
i hate thinking
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
cause now i have to think
is it even
i got 4/4 jk + soe in 12k and i have no plans anymore
and go for 4s dudu elf in spending
i was going to spend 36k on jk 4/4 + soe
i dunno anymore
and i'll be missing that for a while
i'm still missing 2s sk
maxed? holy
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:960763476677115924>
where the fuck do i spend xtal
this banner lasts 2 weeks???
brb doing a 10 pull
wtf
why so many word
LMFAO true
they put a lot of work on the set of attacks we'll never use
when they announced her
she felt v v extra
jackal as well
couldn't think of a valk in time? haha we decided to make tesla playable finally!!
just have to wait until mihomo is enough out of ideas
every character with a model will be playable some day
im on the eventually club
oh shit she russian
you should run from cherry she scares me
hi tet
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
yeah! base skin because it's better
i keep it tidy and clean
yeah!
i keep it tidy and clean
this is my lil home
where else would i go
o i'm not leaving, i live here
leave faster tet
i'm with tet now
that's kinda abusive
villain arc
that bitch can't do shit
yeah tet's done it so it must be easy as fuck
actually you know what, fuck it
I DON'T MEAN IT LIKE THAT TET
i need AW for JK but i feel like long term AL is better
are you really going for AW
LMFAO i feel mean now, i fucked up and i made cherry apologise
cherry: you're right tet sucks
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
i don't mean it like that, i just mean it like tet did it pretty fast so it can't take too long to do it
yea prob
but if tet's already done it then it can't be that hard
i haven't started so no clue how hard it is to complete it
one of the missions rewards that
check on the missions
it's the sushang one
where you choose between 100 al 200 aw
there's a box
LMFAO
when that day comes
i might be still farming her
unironically true tho
ty for the info, i'll pass it forward
that is actually really interesting tho
sorry i wouldn't know, mine is already 3s 💅
it's only this time because they changed buy limit
i see
oooo
wait what
<a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753>
what?
sheeesh!
already tried
literally doesn't work
gimme something to spend on game
i need to spend xtal for free elf
then you don't even need event
if you haven't done 3s MA
there's not a lot of choice there <a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
you can only afford one of those
but i'd also not know what to do with it
i mean it'd be nuts if i found 100 usd
LMFAO
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
while going to school today
you think i might find a 100 real bill on the ground
yo gresham
if it's weekdays it'll depend
if it's a weekend i can do it
o wait
o yea i can do that
<:GWsetmyxPeepoEvil:405337570952740864>
for how long we speakin
that's 2s2
but it's good progress, + the 60 frags from top up event in 6.2
yea that's not even half way <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it's fucking 600 right
wait no
if you're at 2s, then that's 140 from 3s
if you go all in
so thats 80 80 100, 260 frags?
ok so awk valk gets
10+30 per bp
4 stamp per patch
1 card = 10 stamp
i'll figure out the numbers for awk valk on BP now
okay my pc died earlier
yea just chill on spending if you don't feel like playing
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
don't if you're about to retire tho
it's prob the best 4s of all current gen elfs
i would for sure 4s dudu
at your level of whale
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and he still t100s
i think it's been a patch or so where he started just doing MA 1 try no refs
which still landed him a t80
iriya's tona
wanna see
still t100 tho
ty ruby
but ideally i wanna 3s her
i guess i could just stop at 2s1 HoR
yeah i'm skipping PE skin
but CH is only 4 weeks
i'm farming her until i'm fucking deadge
if i start HoR now
i mean yea but think about this way
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and my ana HoR
with my s0 JK
am i even going to do well in MA
but then the question is
yea that's my issue
and god knows how long until HoR
i'm 4 weeks away 2s2 CH
i should go for 2s2 CH or 2s1+ HoR first
do y'all think
than spending on this banner for chance of liu qi/AF
both sound like better xtal use
so going for elf or eden gun
like i'd always prio gacha only stuff > farmable
if you're not nirv you prob don't even need liu qi for her abyss
you can only do 4 bar
with SoE
you can't do a 2/3 bar charged attack on bike HoR
oh damn this is kinda stupid
next 2 to be added to dorm
yea DA+HoS
<:Madge:909232418379153418>
i want her and i want her now
whoa

<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
so you can keep up with farming, as long as you get JK card during the discount it's fine
then JK frags are higher prio than JK card
unironically tho, if you fucked up on AL/AW math
like in 2 weeks i think
it would be funny if i t100 on tet acc
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:960763476677115924>
and deal less damage
higher ranked PE
play my acc and feel the opposite, gresham
o ok
yea
i could try next week unironically
tet
are you pulling SoE
3s mpe or 3s fr
don't you wanna play uhhhhh
fuck this boss
you know, i'm joking about making people pilot but if you actually want i'll allow you to LMFAO
cherry it is then
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
so who of you 2 are going to pilot my acc for t2
cherry is t2
tet is t2
i see
hmmm
no, not wfp, wfpr
we're affiliated with moriso
wfpr patch notes: gender isn't allowed anymore
didn't you hear
gays ain't allowed here
<a:DuckSmh:1006448360200347699>
malding
too much m
you got it
yeah that's the medical term
LMFAO
yeah i'm time running from the game
that's pretty fucking good
i think you got a +100 faster than me
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
and maybe i'll afford CN gear, maybe not
but now i am
i didn't think i'd even afford JK + SoE
yea cause i've stopped spending in 5.9 and now i'm running on stolen time
like cold turkey probably LMFAO
i'm quitting
like CN gear
i'm telling you the patch i can't afford an important gear set
since i'm quitting soon probably
though you're gonna have to find another reason to work hard
i see you working hard and i'm proud <a:Pat:914638151069356062>
i care about the string of actions being <a:pepeMeltdown:933941237021569035>
oh i don't care about numbers though
like the 840 doom? cool as hell
is because the refs look cool
i'll tell you the only reason i bald
same!!!!!!
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
for you
this week i'm going to tryhard
i'll continue complaining about this game and being gay if it makes people think i'm cool somehow LMFAO
that's really nice actually <:peepoBlushy:751806255730917436>
LMFAO that's fair honestly
mi arxidi
so sorry
i'm
what can i say
it's the MA mindset
i will do it again
i will apologise for that dn joke but i haven't learnt from it
i think i just answered that myself
you know i was wondering for a sec why people are so hype over gresham and not over me
deez nuts LMFAOOOOOOO
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
omigosh he answered
i did the same for piss FR
it's worse than pink recolor
real gresham simp hours
we all love gresham over here
<:wavekawaii:590500669119660053>
hi gresham
kosma
that looks like a guy in a costume that needs to pee
i've been hiding it p well i thought
what?
i'm a gay animal if you think about it
disappointing
but like non-horse mode is such a big L
horse mode is p good
also yea the PE skin is a bicc L
L-nya
that's fucking dog whistling
i'm just pointing out that the sheep between us 2 definitely ain't me
i'm not feeling oppressed i ain't complaining that i'm the only one with good taste LMFAO
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
memorial?
i'm the only one not following the crowd blindly
nini also prefers piss fr
who is the sheep even
i'm clearly the one in lower number here
truly takes a lot of courage
that you're brave enough to come out to us with such shit opinions
i mean i'm honestly really proud
whoa
it's FR it has everything going on all of the time
wtf you mean it could have a little more going on
green > default >>>>>>>>>> piss
default is p good to be fair
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
she got the good green one
from the f2p one
never seen such a downgrade in hair
yikes
yea peak cringe
i don't have a piss fetish, sorry
go away, demon
i'll keep using the best one no matter what you tell me
L-nya
v rare
like all the ranks lit up
seeing this is fun
she's been 3s for a while now
i look at FR rank up and i go ooh real pretty
i go through my valk list and keep redoing the math to how close i am to maxing farmable valk
<:RaidenShh:874306830032076830> secret though
i might just lowkey retire LMFAO
if i t10 this week
best ending for this chat is everyone retires by the end of 2022
say ungodly stuff
nini whales, gresh balds qua abyss, and i complain
oh that's nini's job
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
how come gresh hasn't t4'd my account yet
<a:terigrabhic:709594728039055390>
oh is he coming to nirv?
why am i praising heki?
o i see
what did i do
wait
what did you do
sheeeesh
look at that fps
bring me back to rl please
i don't need her 2s day 1 <:TeriCopium:969281688414875728>
JK is bait <:TeriCopium:969281688414875728>
trying to see if i can find the same for 5.5 but i remember that
i found it for 4.6
<:WhalePat:607373633056407605>
not sure about past years
one in CNY, another in anniv
yeah they got it this year
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
CN got top up reset in cny
literally a lie
shafted
it's uhhh
last i checked
we do get something actually
there might be new AL packs
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
no?
to just buy AL
it's prob cheaper
i mean
that feels a lil extra
why do you even want a JK card nini
for 3s
so you need another 70
that's 130 right
40 frags from bp + 4 stamps for sale + card = 5 stamps
you'll get 3s like in 6.4 huh
actually i guess if you get 2s day 1
you about to be sick of farming another bitch soon
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
nothing on this week needs it
what do you need 2s even for
L-nya
you can't judge me for that <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
mine is 3s so i got rid of all the extra for affix mats
don't have any soz
so you still have to bald not all the bosses early
maybe 2 on tuesday and 1 on wednesday
2. lock bosses, you get 1 unlock per day on tuesday, wednesday, thursday
1. remove try system from MA
make it p simple actually
who cares
just give us perma lite already
4 patches of lite
honestly after fucking
i can throw away xtal if worst comes to worst
wait elf rotation? lfg
can't wait...
autumn memento is the artbook event
government assigned horny
L-nya
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
i needed to find you so i could give you horny perms
<@524782681389793280>
if it's too bad i'll just take the L-nya
i'm gonna try kosma during class, like the studious girl i am
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
i thought there was another kosma on 6.1 already
for some reason
is it?
save bald bucks to MA, week is more fun here
i'm gonna be honest i'm highly considering 18k sleep
damn
in nirv
what about
<:bonk:1003097468268982283>
ok
eli? baban?
so whos piloting my abyss
<:meditate:666837440178290708>
ever since i made this acc
p much exactly since i missed 1 single day
1 week older than me
sheeesh you're like
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
i'm so not ready for new releases
mines in 22 days
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
or they could go fuck it and do seele 6.3 and all 3 on 6.4
prooobably
like it's prob one of kiana mei bronya, with the other two on 6.4 cny
so we'll know through datamines probably
cause there's a good chance w/e it is will be playable on story, or at least teased
we'll prob know soon what's coming on 6.3
calm down, chill
you want every patch to be something you want? huh?
and ask for longer patches
you should be happy it's a flop
i don't get y'all
smort
i've bought out already but i should save carpet to buy a lot when patch hits, yea
wonder if i'll get fucked over non max pri JK tho
<:mobiusthinking_hh:887701696464179230>
since only need HoR next week
i guess it ain't that high prio
ughhhh
i think i'm at 610 or some shit like that
shit
so i need like 520+150 for 65+55
whoa smort
it's 50/?/150/220
it's 520 total
the middle ones no clue
lv65 is 220
like i remember for craft it's 50
the values
i dunno
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
HoR is that powerful
ngl took me until wave 3 to figure out why i was doing 0 damage
<:TeriCopium:969281688414875728>
cleared sidestage with no issues......
look guys she's still in the meta....
right below keeb sheeesh
<:peepoSit:1016193458307862609>
grab t4 with my acc next pls
ill take heki
gresh? nini? tet?
whos piloting my acc
maso aster?
unfortunate
guess you'll have to spend it on something useful instead later
you'll have to skip it
oh noooo
yeah no dw about it
you might need to change up your gameplay to account for it?
3s skill does something interesting and gamechanging?
the one that makes enemy take more damage? what's that tied to? eh dw about it
PE skills are so lazy
that's enough
and went yeah
you think i pulled fucking 2 cards into 2s
70 <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yes that's how it works hak
look at this shit
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
5 cards in 1 10 pull
TY FOR THE SUGGESTION I GOT IT
HOLY FUCK HAK
i'll make sure to do that
those ones, yeah
that are coming to global
yeah on the banners
i'm gonna build pity on expa <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i need to spend 36k, how am i doing that if i get lucky
i don't even know if i wanna get lucky,....
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
oh lite is gone
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
back to RL we go
is your hand
only thing i'm holding
-200 angle
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
is it kosma already
<a:MeiQuestion:930749563655061514>
same thing
next week
yea
-5 because i don't have fuxi <a:kree:809653433455214632>
i guess i'm just L'd nya
SpA sirin refs
are there any uh
next week is gonna be fun
my top 3 worst bosses are
HoT kosma
SpA wolf
FGO
i'm so fucking bad at fgo
if it was literally any other boss than fgo
i could t10 this week
i can give emotional support but prob not actual help
i hate this abyss
krakens
all of you
i wonder if it's worth it to replace a few pieces...
but then again, i won't have full liu qi probably
i could go all in on HoR
is JK even used there actually
i can just skip first 3s huodou right
i mean
<:TeriCopium:969281688414875728>
surely i don't need to max both day1 right
600 metal is enough to lv60 2 pris?
i thought it was monday for some reason
weird, this only happens usually when you leave game open during weekly reset
ER + ice since it looks like you investing on ice
prob meme
you already have all dorm valk at 2s?
i don't fucking know, literally anything?
make babies?
wtf you thinking it's gonna do in there
spend your fuckin AW
literally 3rd person this day i have to tell this
wtf is wrong with y'all
mine sucks balls
yo anyone wanna sell me a new PE
hate dn
and you still complain
fucking valk plays herself, only have to tap blue button
<a:DuckSmh:931628395656249345>
y'all hate HB unfairly
it's not that bad
just do a charged attack
baban
fighting to deal most damage instead of killing as fast as possible
just slowly becoming dirac sea
dist goes -50
and then type wolf shows up and 2s can't kill
ima kiana boss, dist goes +20
then we'll just ping pong dist
i believe
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
i like her gameplay but i wish she wasn't binary kill or not on ult and then you lose like 50 points baseline if you don't
i'm alr with it
i guess if it's pretty kiana
she'll just have the same shit
awful design, straight up stupid
for everyone
take her gimmick away
wth
wait we're behind sea now?
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
nvm ty tet
there's a 10 pull on login?
riffing some inputs and shit and i'm like uhhhh
they treat it like it's cooking rather than baking
ngl this often how i feel when watching people follow MA refs
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
in MA, 99% of the time is do it faster now
must be difficult for abyss fr
heki: <a:NervousSweat:765639934555324486> y-yeah who would do that
sometimes 100% of them are in the first 10s <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
in MA specifically
but like literally 50%+ of them are in the first 10s
actually i can see how like hundreds of tries might sounds like a fuckton
LMFAO hardcore mode
same
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
every cycle
i'd beat styx
i'm not though, if i had 9s acc
continuing clearly hopeless runs doesn't help you learn anything, doesn't get you any scores, and only burns you out
it's not bullying, it's advice
waaaay too many tries which are hopeless
you're continuing like
i feel like if you're doing this <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> tries
who would've thought huh
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
simple as that
626 is an MA score
neb time
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
that's an MA score
yea
you can one shot?
wh
have you tried playing better
yea a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
like a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
i think so no
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh that astra
for what
what
w
<:scaramouch_lurk:925161879322624110>
i was just going to see if it was possible with higher damage
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
CN can get away with no bow
which soft forces bow
on tank of all bosses
that's insane tho no
good job, i'm proud
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
deal more damage
yeah i really like that
sure
i could try actually
i'm s0, don't think i can get away with newt there
yea but pat is s1 or s2
ye
because i got lucky <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
but i just scammed with dupe cez B
esp if you're higher rank HoH
it's possible with newt B
i changed for the HoF RC HoH strat
LMFAO
felt like a shit run but ig doesn't matter
and still got it
i think i was .5s off on p1
like a lot of wiggle time
this strat is actually p easy
got it
nyx is like SW but you hold instead of spawn
i don't mind SW that much anymore
like she's fun when she's not buggy but my fun goes down a mile when i'm like balding for hours and she keep not switching weapon when i press the fucking button
is it
cause AE also do that
don't you get that 2 times on HoF too
oh ok
<a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753>
but her gameplay is too buggy <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
if it was just visuals, HoS would be up there aswell
but HoT and HoF has both the visuals and gameplay
that HoH has the visuals and not the gameplay
i mean the thing is
gameplay wise HoH is p average
visuals wise HoH is S-tier
yea i agree
but HoT team is also S-tier
HoT is worse than HoF in a vaccuum
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
not even close to good enough
when you know it's supposed to be for HoF, the best valk in the game
and while HoF pv is average at best in a vaccuum
it is because i love HoF so much that it must hold every adjacent content to her to high standards
while i respect that position, that is kinda cowardly
wait you also like the bad one?
if tet dislikes it then i'm doing something right
tyty
that's all my proof actually
HoF? <a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
like HoF pv? blows
is inversely related to how good the valk is
how much a pv bops
i think that
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i only know morbs
yea
typo?
what's that
and then i just skip the male ones cause who cares
it plays the valk's pv
like ER but every time you get a signet core
i'm gonna make a honkai edi
that's too much work
theres 4?
i mean a newer one
a good one
cause then it goes to another honkai pv
yea p sure it's just some old honkai pv
who's piloting my acc for abyss kosma?
i see
yeah?
yea they were weeding out the weak
just did, in the test <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
hoenstly kinda respect that
i'm pretty sure i'd fail that
wtf is a bike exam
that reminds me
holy fuck LMFAO
take me out
that's fun and all but i'm ready to go now cherry
reverse <a:ppPoof:1031234880752844890>
all the people here are from my imagination
oh you don't have the lore
sorry i don't mean to call you a bitch, it's internalised misogyny
LMFAO see
tet doesn't get it cause she's a bitch
you need to ask nicely
did you ask nicely carv?
i'm pretty sure it does
refund the stamina
i think it does, doesn't it?
LMFAO you think hua is ever going out
but then they'd kill themselves trying to actually play your valk
cause like himeko simps would try to keep her alive
LMFAO i mean first few patches would be fine
just remove the bottom % of valk used by player
every patch, the number of valk they add is the same as the number of valk they remove
i actually do think we should have battle royale valk selection to honkai
bugfix: servers were online when they weren't meant to be
change the name and say it's a bugfix
i think we should just start getting rid of old battlesuits honestly
i'll help with the discussion by offering the awful choices
name it dead fucks and put flamechasers inside it
6.1v2: added new CN passive when in a team with made in abyss, enemies take 50% more tdm
added new CN voiceline when in the same team as AE GET THIS BITCH OUTTA HERE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
do we have the actual numbers?
kinda assumed it reduced its resistances or smth
just <:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
especially if it's something annoying af like bke mechs
loses like 30% enjoyment to me
any abyss with mobs before
yea honestly i vibe w it
i just roll through every shop tab every time i need something
legit still can't find shit
i've been playing for like 1 1/2 year by now
still not enough to fix raven <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
o yea just noticed?
yeah it looks so bad
having so many characters in menu
i agree it looks awful
my kasumi got patched out <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
is my kasumi
where the FUCK
yea tet is forcing me to call her made in abyss
i really feel like AE doesn't need that much sp
i mean most people wanted tons of sp gen from CN so that they could run made in abyss
yes
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
look harder
look at the clock
i dunno if that would ever happen
or you don't and get fucked
you either use her on a boss made for her who drops 15 sp packs every second
v2v are like sky high but there's no saving that
yea feel like HoF sp needs are really chill
SpA too if you have 2s
feel like HoF is chillin
does fire team even need that much sp
that breaks the game
wtf
it is 20%
oh shit
L-nya
imagine knowing the numbers
bugfix: solved margrave interacting with combos
inb4 it's some shit like makes all your combos +20% faster
nothing else pls
give her timestop and like +2% breach for funsies
don't fuck AE up mihomo
cause like i lowkey hate new support design, so braindead
i'm a lil scared about AE dk tbh
if we had 2 HoTs, we'd be using both every week
stupid valk <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
dayssincelast3shotboss
i'm gonna make a site
<a:alert:739695407101378660> GAMEBREAKING BUG DETECTED, FIX RESISTANCES NOW <a:alert:739695407101378660>
people are scoring with SW and HoS on sushang abyss?
someone comes to this server on 7.0 as a new player i'll just be like referencing dumb shit from 10 patches ago
god i swear the more i play this game the more petty i am
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<a:alert:739695407101378660> GAMEBREAKING BUG ALERT <a:alert:739695407101378660>
wait, it's useful?
carole can use cez B? yea that's a cool small feature, that adds depth to gameplay
LMFAO TRUE
bugs? to the grave you go
small issue with the valk? release a new valk instead of fixing
already have the same mindset <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
you should get into mihomo design team, kith <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
yeah the skill ceiling is just rng if she'll bug out or not
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
half of the time she'll just not switch weapon for no reason
most skill for playing senti is figuring out how to make her do what you tell her to do LMFAO
it's me
<:PepeHands:909232418211364957>
from an era where valk don't auto play herself
i'd kill myself
god
yea it was mistranslated as giving your team +25% ice damage instead of making enemies take 25% more ice damage
that'd be awful
if dk just makes her not have to do anything on field except ult
i mean yeah, i don't think her buff numbers are bad, i just don't want them to fix her sp issue entirely because her actually gameplay is extremely fun and has high skill ceiling
LMFAO
2 weeks
for like
didn't you see the ely elf skill desc
game lies all the time
ty carl
senti ain't hua <a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
let her last battlesuit live
hua's already dying in the story soon
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
that would be actually insane for like fire team especially
that would be pretty big
actually true
i wanna still play her
don't solve her sp issues, just make her buffs higher <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
does she even need a DK is the thing
L-nya
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
not to kill her
ask for her to become farmable
<a:DuckSmh:1006448360200347699>
AE eternal
<:tsuncat:960584739914412042>
nyo
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
AE JK team on fire
that would've been cool af
mihomo not one known to not blow their load asap though
yea feel like SoE was a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> too much to blow rn, they could've prob staggered release and do liu qi rn and SoE later or smth
feel like HoV would still be hers even without SoE probably
on the one boss of hers
i'd argue HoR would be hanging around even rn without revival
well
i guess HoR
is AE the oldest valk still around then
like she's good but not put-fire-team-at-same-level-of-phys-lightning good
CN looks kinda underwhelming to me rn
i got luckier with HoT lead
so whichever better damage one
yea i mean you really don't need the sp on that rot
i think i'm sleeping
fun boss
wait what boss is it
can you find f2p setup like mine
700 doko
LMFAO
all of them were pretty copium
nope LMFAO
do i mark that on my bingo?
heimdall is fixed?
good bias
i do too
so ignite bella is somehow HoF boss is what i'm reading
didn't read the boss
oh nvm
so it's a
LMFAO ok
but yea p sure the best option will just be that then, HoT HoF RC
i predicted that <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
the xtals on the transition don't change bella form, just make you deal more damage
it is a good amount more restrictive than i thought, though
that's so fucking cool
first 3s boss i actually like, not as least dislike but as actually like
i can't wait to play that
holy fuck
SO fucking sick
that looks
yoasobi on background, nice <a:Jammies:610843194904543266>
oh ok!
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and then i did it for 840
853 rot uses HoT as lead
i dunno either
but the colors from base just fit her so well
time runner ult is stacked
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
that time runner is a small upgrade/sidegrade
my position is that HoF is already so fucking good
well you see
time runner isn't even that good LMFAO
dumb stuff i wanna save but don't wanna pin
yeah styx is all credit card <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i also can t1 MA if you give me a good account <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
LMFAO
oh fuck what did i miss
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
sss-tier
her pink skin is just
is a coward answer
hb default
secost
clearly it's my 2st <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
IT'S NOT MY 1ST LANGUAGE
LEAVE ME ALONE
LMFAOOOOO
cause we play in not-cn
we just get cny patch way late
it is
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
it's time to retire
i think
i'm at 31k but i'm spending 36k on next patch for 4s dudu
maybe i have the xtal
need to save 21k
owo math 76 * 280
i don't have the xtal....
wait what are we hyped over there?
great news.....
that's
skip all the other ult too
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448> HoH special treatment
<:AnselBlush:596473956597235723>
when am i shining
i'll take it
slacc bracket
yea
this cycle too slacc wth
2nd??
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
you may retain, but you get emotional damage
t1-5 +100
t6-10 +1
t11-20 -200
i wish it was +100 +1 -200
i'm noobs to farm
on another server
or having an acc
on another server
piloting someones acc
i mean it's different tho
but that soundsl ike fun
really don't think he'd care to pilot
LMFAO
RL too paper
i think nirv should send some D to rl
jfc
akayuki 476 gameplay incoming?
i dunno, what's a chainsaw man with you?
LMFAO that's very funny but also a very big spoiler
stamina diffd
L-nya
i'm telling y'all hoes
like i'm telling y'all HoR is p good
yeah DoR is lowkey pretty powerful still
like i don't have enough phase shifter for everything but i'm also not going to need everything asap
and i think i'm chilling on phase shifters?
i have enough cubes now
would've been great info if i still had sp valks to farm
do mine
yea i agree with that, i barely care about stamina cost
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
but it's too funny for me to
i should really block dia
so it's not hard for me to see their messages <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
they're literally the only person i have blocked
o i guess lumina
where do you even find them anyways
sheeesh!!
please find me the best set of partners <:Prayge:909232418463047690>
lemme throw a wrench, what if i'm poly?
<:A_NoteTao:928234793844486164>
rip
i was trying to record a gif of coffee typing but my gif recorder blows
LMFAO i want that
that's really good info tho <:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
i think it's funny how you post that immediately after ,.. readingishard is made
but then i dunno what you'd run on kasumi
HoF on FGO is maybe better? not sure
so i dunno what to make of it
but that does mean you don't have the best pick for FGO
but yea MPE is stacked investment, even now i'd still consider going for it given your position
LMFAO
no they ain't
bring it over <a:catgib:564829264466149378>
leave me speechless
eli your moves
cool cool cool
cool
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
but then you don't run your beloved SN
and then some HoF option on kasumi
HoH on tona
MPE on FGO
see the best move is prob
hmmm i guess?
LMFAOOO
it's too fucking funny LMFAO
the (edited)
because it's way too fucking funny
i'll bring the quote here
yeah i'll talk with yotsu to see if the symptoms are familiar

LMFAO

<a:kree:809653433455214632>
<:TeriCopium:969281688414875728>
CN has hidden 30% tdm 30% cdmg emblem

sheeesh

<@453263261467410442> will do it for you <a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
L-nya

<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816>
o
it's important for handel i think
did you do cat qte
LMFAO
check if happiness is for sale for me cherry
yeah!!!
it's really not that funny from my PoV
you're so smart
holy fuck
786 HoH RC SW 
786 HoF RC s2 HoH 
nunya
kill me
remove sp packs from the game
since HoT is needed on every single 3s boss <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
team that can -1 HoT is pretty nice
actually not really, it is really good for flexibility
792 is already too low for 9s
i mean it doesn't matter then
it is a high bar and ice team do kinda suck in MA
idr if it was >808 tho
i remember in beta 9s jk team got good score
husk
JK ain't top scoring? interesting
it's 792 without fps scam, 808 with fps scam
yea that sounds right
:49 in seconds
but that's 808 in +20%
i dunno in seconds
i guess it's pretty good since i was -2 on p1 and couldn't be bothered to learn p2 so i did some dumb shit
-6
yea
owo math (808 - 712) / 16
i'm fucking -6
damn
owo math 39760 * 1.2
that's not right
hmm
owo math 760 * 1.2
nvm i'm -1 on irl timer
oh shit i cleared p1 -0!!
fhem got hands tho
fun, even
yea this is fine actually
prob too slow
just messing up the pv active
i got it twice in a row
wait nvm it's not that bad
maybe me <a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
maybe clicky
like styx, keeb, icefire, maybe pat
i'm expecting like 3-4 people to cap i think
i think this tona strat is the hardest HoT strat in a fucking while
very close to at the same time
for this FR cancel i need to hold attack -> tap dodge -> tap active
does controller player even play this game
how
we have 3 in the near future
i think her BiS is zhenyi TB handel M
no clue how high she should score in RL
i dunno much about FR sorry
i thiiink it's handel?
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
prob retains nirv
fr dps?
for what
this isn't the only time i noticed how shit targetting is on elf ely
help
my elf ult makes kasumi get a restraining order on me
ref elf ult makes kasumi hug you
as soon as MA opens that is
i'm streaming early tona + kasumi tries
and nyx is -5 HoT
she -1 nyx
this should score measurably lower but way easier to perform
HoT PV GD
HoH RC HB
SI HS BB or w/e the fuck other phys option you want here
then you run
yes
if you want chill, lower scoring but easier to do option
which are both very cbt
and elemental doom
you'd need to run HoT kosma
but like
that should be your week cap
yea she does
or was it FGO?
i think she scores well there, doesn't she?
but you can run alt stuff
SI MPE HoS
HoT PV FR
HoF SNS SpA
the highest scoring one for you would be something like
you do have plenty of options
o yea that looks fun
where's the week again?
yea looks fun
sh... sheeesh?
<:scaramouch_lurk:925161879322624110>
i haveth been poked
wdym
i feel like they don't get easier as main stage, to answer your question
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
you grew as a player
i did it a few times to follow the trend and now i do it instinctively
it's just a thing
but im too weak for nirvana <:kekcry:973697358799978626>
you can buy everything out minus the coins with 4 days of dailies
pretty annoying
it's actually
L-nya
LMFAO
nothing
i'm picking only phase shifter and i'm getting fucking
shit you picking money and phase shifter and getting both?
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
ssg greshamlao
<:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
i'm f2p
only 5heads doing abyss this early
so did this guy
i bet this guy had a lot of fun
o ok
i suppose so right
on nirv
are you supposed to run AE strats
sure <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
oh
pardo dps?
what knda suffering
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
400k coin if i do it
okay so i only have the dailies left
owo math 5 * 80
i changed my mind i'm bored
i kinda wanna minmax this event LMFAO
i see
but we can't see subrank in MA/abyss t100 and armada in abyss t100
so we can see the valk, support pokemon, and support pokemon skills on this event for t100
can't wait for carv to show up and say yeah that's a core mechanic to how the mexicatl fight goes, you actually need to do that to defeat it
that's left
game's fucked
is there even any stig that freezes
today is a cursed day
how the fuck did it freeze
what
wh
got her saving accounts stacked, she barely has any wokr
my mobius living the good life
wdym
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
so i'm skipping i think
yea unfortunately i really don't have a good valk to do andrius with
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
damn people balding early
yeah sorry i downloaded the schizo patch

LMFAO what else i'm supposed to do
wtf is going on LMFAO
wtf
who turned off my damage
worked hard on her
tyty
i'm having fun
L-nya
and nothing dealt damage
comboing them out
i was like fucking guilty gearing their asses
i think i'm turbo lagging
with teamwork and good decision making
whew this latest honkai impact the 3rd raid was certainly challenging, but we got through it!
me too
okay it turbo c rashed cool
yeah fuck the police
ice team has good freeze trauma for enemies and my cpu
my game froze
i say in chat no f2p allowed and kick them
that's what i do
just kick people
fuck hler
raid shadow legends
yeah i'm trying to raid
so you prob don't need to rush liu qi
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
then yea i dunno if you're using HoR much without it
did you get SoE
the better choice is prob just go for full shakes adrift right
hmmm
dead frfr
doesn't believe in the power of friendship enough
she isn't even weakly affixed, just weak willpower or something
yea mine is
valk i really want to play but as soon as i do i regret everything
i think MPE is slowly becoming my new BKE
<:paimon_tank2:749921486348746872>
repeat with me
doom week is fun week
L-nya
the stig?
did you listen to anything ive ever said about it
wtf do you mean overrated
fuck abyss, take every opportunity to not play
full send and sleep next cycle
on the good gamemode, every boss answer is HoT
look at you getting releases that affect and change the meta
it's by a mile
9s nyx is 792
yeah
t1
808
v2v scores like absolute dogshit
she's already t2 on tona
i'm pretty sure
heki moment
pulling old qua valk
i want revenge
got my ass eat last time i tried cause no 3s hb
i kinda wanna try nyx
lowkey
next week is kosma wolf dxy, which is also straightforward but uhhhh
which is pretty fun and straight forward, FGO annoying tho
fgo tona kasumi this week
that's this week
kosma wolf and some bs
well i guess next week we're HoTing kosma
we have HoT for once
every doom week is a fun week
i'm down
oh that's a fun week
if you die, maincord users come to your house and scream at you about how bad you are at the game
<@295285226446520320> <:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
who?
getting my HoH replacement up
L-nya

yikes
nirv used to be the fwend bracket
it's been so long since i got a fwend
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
i got neffr
imagine doing one run and done
i think new signets are just stronger now
<:peepoSit:1016193458307862609>
yeah she told me how to do RI shallow
tet coached me earlier
Farmable so I can SSS when
imagine balding this boss
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
why is egg twice there LMFAO
very good use of my time <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
<a:gaylaof:1002644777822597241>
is it just because she's hot
i don't get it
have i truly become a boomer
me waking up:
but i found this
i didn't find it
and i'm very easily influenced
i see her as a dog because there's that cute fanart that had kiamei as 2 dogs
we have andrius, we have kosma
i think it should be a cat cause we have enough dogs already
it's a badly designed boss
my friends are insecure <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
what the fuck is that resolution
are you reading discord on a 3ds
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
fucking deadnaming fischl
LMFAO L-nya
damn close i got an l wrong
prinzessin der verurteillung
that's why they killed her off
i'm in it so yeah
congratulations! diversity win! the worst boss in the game is gay!
daybreak
ruby asked us to spell not read

terinya
starlit astrologos <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
tonatiuh is another i had issues spelling
i did when i started
wtf are yall on about
is this what casual player talks about, the species of the boss instead of why the fuck bke doesn't crit on it
i'm also a cat
fragiles here, pootz here
this is weird LMFAO
fenrysk chat is just A Lot Of People I Know
if that's the question you're asking
on both huodous
you do use cat
nvm
o yea kosma
there's a qua one???
which dog
<a:PU_PeepoLeaveExit:855157057887535164>
🌽 🌰
only need 3s JK <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i think she will beat like <2s BKE
i didn't do anything
why am i getting blocked
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
stupid shit
an even slightly stronger BKE will just steal a bunch of more neutral phys bosses
this is actually pretty fair tho, BKE + phys team is way too strong
yes of course <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
do i really have to explain the joke
that's TP
hire me mihomo
look, they should just release a farmable valk that matches 2s BKE but is outscored by higher ranks, and if they're really kind maybe they'll even make her stigs craftable and her weapon dorm exchange
reality: so here's bke 4
expectation: new mech valk finally kills BKE!!!
yea no one knows
i dunno
hows that HoT luccsacc going heki
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it's pretty simple
you'll never afford that
and if you aren't a pretty big whale
if you can afford to pull the newest valk + invest on old stuff
you can only afford to backpull
just not better than the newest valk
v2v and HoH are good
it isn't even about how good a valk is
nvm 2 patches after
honestly i'd have second thoughts about pulling v2v by the 3rd week of her banner
HoH is unironically too old <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
too old <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
still wouldn't go for v2v
more arrows <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
probably
turg doko
that looks kinda scuff
i can actually
i'm about to put aster rules in this channel
are you all like this
why
i hate it here
why do you have sirin
w
there's not even fire teams in the game LMFAO
that's impossible
no it's not
like i literally see 0 difference from not having the valk or pulling for her on rerun having 0 xtal leftover and having an unusable 1/4 v2v with no team
do you really need to pull for the valk LMFAO
if you're that horny over v2v i dunno, set you background to her, watch some porn
yeah hydro archon is v2v dw
yeah
wait for bp or something
if you only want v2v for simp
if you need a qua valk right now, farm FR
if you want a qua valk, save up for when a new one releases
giga waste
pulling her on rerun is just
also v2v had insane release deal
cmon heki
it's not pulling on release <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
how hard is that
don't fucking back pull
no
with SoE it's now possible to 1700 atk actually
tet you forgot to turn off the hacks on your beta acc
lmfao
i don't think recently
at release yea
do mine next
not abyss pig
she t1s MA pig, yeah
that's ok there's like 2 psy bosses in the game <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
or pull for next lightning dps
either find an HoT through a spending event in the future
don't backpull
no
fuck hb
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
dunno if you can go higher than 664 with cb19
now i suck a lil less at the game, still -1
i was behind you cause i suck at the game
i mean i'm ff19
please?
trade trophy amount
trade?
actually i wanna try HoT kosma on MA finally
2 kosma next week i'll kms
cherry: oh no i got beat
tet: lets fucking gooooooo
lmfao toxic
and i thought well there's no way his lead skill is the best
i'm watching a genshin stream and i saw him putting kazuha as the first on the team
we said nothing about you
what
<a:gaylaof:1002644777822597241>
<a:gaylao:959722005576445972>
<:Wow:759857863848886303>
with lv35 cannon
yea i'm actually surprised i was able to -1 kosma
also a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> more team tdm too
cause active makes collapsed enemy take more damage
yea a good amount actually
record dn
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
if i only play cycles i find fun i'm playing twice a patch
right now i only skip the cycles i find awful
i'm this <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> close to retiring from abyss and only playing the cycles i find fun
only plays on loli cycle
real lolicon plays like vaff
fake lolicon
i didn't even know 946 was possible with SI ult
all you
<a:gaylaof:1002644777822597241>
LMFAO
<a:NOPERS:837048875185209445>
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
husk is a pretty complicated fight, p hard to get a good score in a few runs if you don't already know the strat
for slacc score that's p good
you're slaccing this week right
<:KianaDumb:909232418052014171>
the boss that showed up once ever since i got to exalted
i have a zhenyi T specifically for 2s couatl
the other is to clear 2s couatl ball faster
one of the only 2 uses of elemental affix in the game
it's like
after she takes elemental damage
SK takes more phys damage
yeah
do my ER next
you already running elemental affix right
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
sounds fun i'd kill myself
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
i cleared 2 stages with TP and i wanna kill myself
farm valks to lv15 in ER
how do y'all fucking
actually piss easy stage if you have the knowledge huh
when you know that it makes it..... really easy to stunlock to death
from the main stage
damn tona has 0 cd on paralyse
tilting.
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
for s0
not bad
that's -1 from ff HB
have a good bed tet <a:pat:969402615538520064>
i'm all out of ideas
dammit
oh is there an A
yeah surely!
can't wait to spend 3 uninterrupted years there
i'm about to start college yall, it's going to be so fun!
yeah that sounds about right
hmmm no i don't think i am
why do you ask
i think i do yeah
2012 was like 3 years ago, chill
there's no fucking way
death parade is not 10 years old is it
that's big info, anime for cowards
this is a question about how it vibes with your pictured taste of mine of anime
okay are they from an anime you feel like i've watched?
she has 2 actually
where is it
do they have an A in their name
oh ok
hmmm i'll try an A
should we?
sheeesh
kronk
consonants? fine, i'll try an A first
good pick, i'd go with an A first
yeah?
an A
uhhhhhhhh
yeah i'll take an uhhh
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i mean yeah you can't just make us guess something as fucking open ended as an anime character
you wish you were zazooke
i stand by my guess
protagonist from the loud house
i dunno last i checked there were plenty narutos
saske from naruto
sasuke from naruto
yeah i'll give you 3 chances to guess what i'm thinking
do you know how many generic weak ass anime people talk about in the internet
???? how the fuck do you talk about anime like that
hmmm i dunno if that's the case
i feel like theres already an anime about that
fwends <:peepoSit:1016193458307862609>
yeah you should go pro
people don't snipe RL because they're kind, they don't snipe RL cause they don't care enough <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it's like playing chess with someone asleep
you won't even get salt from the other players from sniping last second cause 95% of RL population does abyss a day before it closes and then don't even open that screen before the next cycle
it just sounds like a lot of work that no one will appreciate
sounds like both
i wouldn't bald much either
to match my score
if every try i did i had to millimetrically clear side stage
jesus fuck
yeah i see why you only do 13 tries
i'll cry with you
<:cry:944955259636285481>
LMFAO everyone mad at me
fuck that shit LMFAO
no sorry, full cap
i'll do your abyss
wait
me too
better score than me already ssg
<a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
i literally cannot tell what the fuck that is
am i supposed to tell you what i see there
is this a therapy session
is this a riddle
what the fuck is this
how the fuck
me neither, there's some people who are younger than me who claim they are
surely i'm doing everything right <:Clueless:996308692133761094>
i got no dms LMFAO
yeah i've been training
oh gosh gresham, i'm such a dummy player, i can't do anything well..... i really want this nirvana retain but i'm just so bad at the game! i saw your big and impressive score in myriad, you don't think you would..... pilot my account, would you?
get me out
i'm saying the truth, i'm RL player stuck in nirv
gresham im only a rl player dw
<@370438895965306882> Greshy, want to do my Abyss tmr
all bruh does is horny over lolis and pretend to understand the story
anyway anyone wanna do my abyss
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
LMFAO that one is really funny
when the chat's too weird for ruby then you know it went too far
<:Sucrose_Glasses:845784727935909898>
not as good as the sucrose ones
<:sucrose_heh:849063219334610976>
isn't there one which is just her ass
LMFAO issok i really don't mind it that much <a:pat:969402615538520064>
yeah if you misgender me you won't even need to worry about it
i'm gonna make sure you have no teeth if you misgender me one more time, what about that
does everyone have soft pings on their names wtf
i use the trans pokemon sip
<:sip:617444162098298892>
i'm so sorry
yeah this chat is only for cishet peeps
you can stay if you just ain't weird
they found out where we hide from the weirdos and now they're here
LMFAO
i'm a bald virgin
pretty based imho
can't complain about the bosses if you don't play the game
lots of people pull and then don't play
i mean it doesn't surprise me, you see how many 3s valks there are in a3 and below
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
3 whole new valks for you to play with!!!
i would actually see them going to commemorate, we'll be doing a special 3 valk patch! aren't you so glad!!
you're you're right
maybe if we spend 700 million we can have bugfixes finally
that's misogyny i think
why is the cottage white
<:TeslaThink:591362899335839776>
i can almost understand that <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it's not my fault, i didn't know
tet after saying the most cursed shit of the day: wdym the keys i type on my screen show up on yours
i don't even know what that means
each collapse takes 45 seconds
tet's doing the long run
average RL player <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
gigachad
useless dupe glut
gigachad
no gacha stigs
you keep telling yourself that
mhm
good job
correctly
one single emote
spell one emote
can y'all
chill
kinda mean LMFAO
yeah isn't the kkona guy like just a really nice guy
oh i am
yes, it's american culture to misunderstand other culture
yeah you see localisation needs to fit the culture
we get consistently shafted <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
at least that's consistent
and then no translation
genshin tutorial should just teach you CN
that that's what they care about most
you can see from all their other business decision
they are really working hard to not have any fomo in this gacha game
yeah i mean they're just looking out for us
that makes sense
finisher?
from where even
<:Deadge:958122498019434496>
oooo i see
ssg miyobo so kind
we can't have competitive content though, guys!!! it'll give players anxiety, and it's obviously the n1 thing the gacha game corporation cares about, not to give players any anxiety at all
i mean yea there's definitely a lot on genshin that does have effort put into
so much feels so heartless
yeah unironically genshin feels like a chore mihoho has to do to get money to do the games they actually want to make
yatta!
giving disappointing bare minimum content cause it's all they need to do to sell and then it sells
that's literally everything about genshin
type faster
L-nya
yea he's spreading something alright
i hope the next genshin character isn't meticulously built to fit an extremely small niche with as close to 0 uses as possible without having 0 uses, you say for the 6th patch in a row
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
loli bait, weak design
i'm so mad that there's a way prettier, hotter kusa design and we get the fucking child one, fucking loli bait bs <a:kree:809653433455214632> 
and i'm a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> mad
i only know that kusa got mobius'd
damn i thought they were fwends <:peepoSit:1016193458307862609>
o shit cyno and al haitham be fighting
LMFAO
genshin ad
i got a fucking
i'm giving SA viking burial soon by maxing her stun skill
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i wouldn't know i didn't enable that skill
are you sure she doesn't
stun is SA <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
it's cheaper patch than the alternatives
sp apocalypse who cares
actually sure fuck it
i'm honestly fine with triple 3s bosses if they let me use HoT on all of them
then we need 3 HoT
if they're doing triple 3s bosses
good cope
definitely not miboho
i'm so close to being done with WT anyways
they should 10x income who the fuck even cares about WT valks anyways
from only renewable sources
yea i don't think you can consistently buy out 12 frags
HoR alone is 100 per week max
96 weekly AL spent
owo math 12 * 8
even if i bought 6 + 6 that's like
i was able to buy out like 6 FR frags + like 3-4 MPE weekly consistently
i dunno if you have enough income to buy out 2 AL valks
yea
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
still s0 SK, s1 HoV, 2s1 CH
i like how i'm not done with any AL valk besides FR MPE
found heki's reddit acc
looks awful
and he doesn't put shield up until you freeze
there's freeze trauma above huodou
yeah watch p2 again
there's some freeze trauma bs
for p2
yea there is
cause 2s huodou does
i was guessing there was freeze trauma bs
i dunno
meanwhile 2s3/3s BKE aint increasing my phys scores in MA
can't just used HoT on both
so i need it in the case of future like BKE pig week
i won't be able to 696 3s pig with DA if i don't go for 2s1
hmmm no, it's bait
i always feel like phys is a tiny step away from stealing all 3s boss <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
selune though
hmmm interesting....
its pretty small upgrade but i'd be 45 frags from 3s
2s1 DA 2s2 BKE or 2s DA 2s3 BKE?
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
shit boss we sleep
yeah that sounds so bad
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
it's definitely a very sane bald and worth the point increase
gresham just did a 733 without klein on husk, your turn <:POGGERS:996355632875700235>
<a:COGGERS:772315943254097951>
realistically i'm only really doing the first 3 + nuada
those being jk fist, SoE, gaming mouse, pta, nue, bri, 11th, vikrant, nuada
i still have 9 weapons to cube, but they're mostly really really niche
i haven't gotten rid of any gacha weapon for cubes, even though i could cause i have too many
i mean i think it's just acc age
wtf is that meant to imply
can't even score 400 <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
JK bait <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
this is why they should hire me instead <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
wasted beta access <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
test the s0 JK vs 3s HB
lets go tet
i wonder why <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
ER got enemies with elemental shields next patch
so even if it's good value, it's a good value for something i don't really need
my issue is i might not need cubes that much anymore?
i mean i believe that but
so fucking cute!!!!
i thought it'd be the same as ss where each stig has a different name and then we just called it the set name
didn't expect all the stigs to share same name tho
yea i dmd you a thing
o i see LMFAO
we get fan translations but only official translation on beta
i mean yeah but CN doesn't get official EN translation stuff
cause i'm certainly getting in this time <:Clueless:996308692133761094>
so that means beta hasn't started already
i didn't get a beta email
sure! on it already
i'll rename the server to aster's dino enclosure later
L-nya
sorry
nothing LMFAO, i just thought it'd be funny
<:RaidenShh:874306830032076830>
that one was directed at you though
LMFAO i'm sorry cata
one of us
deez nuts
ONE OF US
i forced it into him
<:childpeepopogmirror:1002644830280745020> <:gunright:869899369443364884><:nothing:990283279032803338> <:peepoHandsUp:1002644855593381898>
for you though, i can teach you much much more
and bad financial decisions
only need a high credit card limit
<:whalepat_hh:710738275845013576>
absolutely no one will take me up
LMFAO i'm laughing too hard i think
my cadet recruit post
i'll let y'all know how it goes
this is so stupid <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like SP
better than other option can for cheaper?
has she ever seen any use whatsoever in abyss
i mean SN always been MA valk right
by the time she rerun
besides HoS
cause i had literally everything phys
i still remember asking around if i should really pull for her
missed HoS banner had to pull on her on rerun
i started like week 3 or 4 of 4.6 <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i started on 4.6
KMB would still be really low prio
if we had triple 2s bosses right now still
back when i started she was already mid-low prio
yea KMB at this point is straight useless
it's upgrading the most important MA valk lead
yeah, getting shared lead is already very big
eli without HoT, nini with 3s HoT
you 2 have weird takes on it
3s LE is def not a bad investment still imo
on the other hand, if they pull for JK gear
with new ima release
and PE is likely going to be powercrept on certain bosses somewhat soon
that's not gonna be enough for nirv
cause like i'm gonna be clear, if they invest in PE now and get like 12/13 team
just definitely not the best, especially if they are aiming for like nirv stuff
backpull on PE is not a bad option in any way, and if they're not aiming for the highest stuff then it's great
and good is good enough
then you don't need best
but if you're not aiming to be highly competitive player
ofc best is better
like good vs best
it's only a good one compared to JK gear
i don't think going for PE over that is a bad choice
okay so i'll be pretty clear, competitively i do think going for JK gear is absolutely the best choice
friend of mine on SEA retained with 2s 6s
RL is a really low bar <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
6s retained RL on heph
like
i mean because there's mostly better options, she's still good enough for RL
yes you can
you can also live with HoS dps
sure you can live with RC HB
cause like if we're talking RL investment
hmm
griseo gear
do they have like
it's JK or old phys dps
but it's not JK or new phys dps
well, i guess not really, if the question was JK or new phys dps, then phys dps would win out
imo yes absolutely
so like, you backpull on PE if you already bought JK
you only backpull if you can afford the newest thing
but even then
PE is prob the only valk i'd backpull nowadays
the thing is
between the 2 i'd invest in JK in a heartbeat
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
could_ya really is the best
just to make sure
i wasn't the one who drew that
wanna see su cock
is that approachable
hello! i'm native honkai balder, came from genshin and now i'm stuck here, can help from f2p to whale player make good gacha decisions and coach on the gameplay side of stuff! <a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>

⌜don't stare at my bio! idiot...⌟
⌜you liked it? um, thanks, i guess...⌟
⌜i'm not red at all right now! you're seeing things!⌟
⌜stop laughing! s-stupid!⌟

<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
yea that's the issue
i think my limit is only 100k
how much was that
03/23 123
3566 0000 2000 0410
fine
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
you're the one making me lie <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
yes cause you suggested that i do
i'm not sharing my credit card
are you sure that lying will get me cadets
i think i'm somehow going to get less cadets after flexing
what kinda editing we speaking of
am sensei. dm if you want sensei. first 3 cadets get my credit card info
it's looking like this
okay so right now
this didn't get me any dms <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
anyone wanna help me brainstorm a sensei promo
is riku malding over the heph
beat me nini-senpai
oh yeah sure!
All I care about for MA anywaysn is getting the easy t7% and all the rewards
i thought you were getting HoT from dorm <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
that people just built her up too much
they teased her so much
kinda like raven, overrated but like
she's like boomer candy
wait FR dps? fuck that lmfao
i can try to make one <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
yea i unironically feel like you should try and cry
1 hit every 3.5 seconds
you do like
with DA AE MA
imagine clearing clone
30 seconds on gears
without cat support you take no joke like
cat support
but uh
i beat your score
guzma
this is just cbt
with DA team
LMFAO
do you do on gears
what the fuck
way easier week
i wonder how well that scores
always
i can stream later too
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
MA coggers stream
anyone want MA husk stream <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
neural network moment
kpop group names
those are all
i'm already a furry so
i'm fine with w/e tho do what y'all think fits me <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
that's cute
my dino be bald
LMFAO
i swear to fucking god
is this an issue
why
TOO FUCKING FAST
i did gears
i can't fucking believe it
this is the closest to government assigned fursona we'll get <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i'm gonna go with the red one cause it's more similar to my original pfp
i mean i'm surely one of the 2 feathered ones
LMFAO so cute!!!
do i have a dino
since it's worth more points (16 vs 13)
i'll be going for the last second on heph first tho
but got cucked over sp pack
i think i got 2 or 3 really good tries in that time
last MA husk i spent 30 hours trying for that last second
i am!!
obviously
skill issue
also you need to beat me nini <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
still tilted that all my damage diff was from elf timing
-1 -1 0
<:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
monk
sheeeesh
what boss is that
<:lewd:959737567119556618>
i logged in to my acc by accident <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i'm gonna stream <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
sure?
uhhhh
your sk
i was joking but i'm down
actually?
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
1984
can i try running on your acc
that's some gear alright
oh....
that's me and 2 lao emotes
you know how guys with small dick buy big cars
yea good player can prob score p well
with fuxi
i think i got like a 552 actually
the bigger diff was not having ely elf <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
i didn't feel a difference between the 2 on 3s hepha, i did try cb19 on coffee's acc
but on 3s hepha i don't think it'd be an issue?
which is the issue of cb19 with cat team
cause you don't have to worry about weird cd
like in abyss n stuff
under normal circumstance ff19 should be way more comfy
even then i dunno
oh wait i guess it makes sense for the transition?
really?
i dunno if i'd call cb19 comfy
with similar gear <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i can try to run something higher that 626
share gear ss
this is bs
i think everyone should get a builtin homu m from now on
i pressed weapon skill -> ult and it weapon skill -> ult ?
<:DogKek:665979913332981812>
it doesn't sound like a bug, it sounds like the game did what you told it to do
well the way you're talking about it
wtf does that mean
<:blurry:593478274500263959>
~~i'm streaming abyss husk but i'm scared of you two~~
new rule: no mario erp
both are pretty mean
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
i dunno if that's calling yourself a game or a disappointment
i said in another game not in a disappointment
himeko in hsr? wdym she's from hi3?
valk gets into another game -> gets forgotten in hi3
you know what happened
ooo that's just like funny honkai reference!!
you just invest in the one before her
and when they announce a really hype valk
yeah just keep up with the beta
also completely f2p <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
pilot my acc and you'll be myriad player <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
and like free MC i just went <:Wow:759857863848886303>
cause i am roza simp
i remember when i was new i wished i had started then so bad
and then HoF afterwards
and then CH <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
mine was SA
so
and i was a balder already
i mean iw as using 4/4 HoF
yea dudu is very pretty
and then 130d every week afterwards
and i think i did like 110d first week
when it released i was still masters
malder
and then by 4.9 i was already following beta cycle
i think i will pull on HB i said and then i didn't and then i regretted it
like before then i remember, my first patch i experienced was 4.7 and i remember seeing beta stuff and going oh can i share? i dunno if you care about leaks
i feel that, it was actually the first time i experienced beta and saw iris pri being a thing
o yea old 150d was... rough
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> <:tf:846588912678993920>
do we even know why hler pri was a thing btw
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
they just up and stopped on 5.3
4.7 had SoS
4.9 had iris
5.1 had af
5.2 had hler
before then they were actually doing it pretty consistently
5.3 with tp pri
raven augment coming soon
why would they make us pull for new gear for a better version of old valk when they have a system to revive old valks <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
since they can just revive raven with a pri <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
they'd never do that
but griseo was griseo so
i feel like fire team doesn't even need that much help
i wonder how strong fire sp even will be
oh god that is what's going to happen right
<:A_HuClown:795116510636408852>
cause they'll just force HoT somewhere else now
not like it's going to happen often now
well
dunno what hard on they get for doomposting
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:A_HuClown:795116510636408852>
followed by who even cares about MA, dead gamemode
my favorite take is she doesn't even score well in MA
he and a lot of people from maicord acting like she's the absolute worst and not worth any investment
i just remember arguing with him about his hc takes
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
just nuclear takes sometimes
but he doesn't sound like a bad person
i mean yea i have plenty of issues from his takes too
LMFAO do you dislike trl
there's no use to forcing yourself to stay around if you're not enjoying it anymore
he's been for a while now
i feel like the drama only went the way it went because moriso is already burnt out of the game
like it's worse for us but better for him
i think it's good that moriso is taking a break and maybe quitting
yea i'm pretty sure it's a solo project
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
they're trying to do a paimon.moe for honkai
it's from the alpaca guy on morisocord
i don't think it's related to the drama
yeah you couldn't play it, not like it stopped them, like in 2 days they had reverse engineered it enough for it to be playable
so anyone can dl it and yoink
oh the code leak i'm pretty sure is not the game code, but the like program to do the yoinkage
cause like that doesn't potentially kill off the game
yeah i think that's pretty different
did it ever get this bad
that's scary
the code for it went public?? LMFAO
L-nya
well gachas have fucked up really badly i think
even worse
cause that sounds
i mean but i imagine it's yoinked as in deleted, not that the other player gets it right
like that's insane to be even a possibility to me
for something that one player does to impact other players inventory
the spaghetti code that needs to be going on
honestly i can't even begin to imagine
it's prob still 2+ years away
it's not cancelled there's just no release date and there hasn't been for a long while
don't worry about it
that was a dream
blue protocol?
yeah imo it's definitely the best thing that honkai does
i have a small soft spot for guild wars
most fun combat*
and it fucking closed LMFAO
tera is probably the MMO i played with the most fun i had
is blade and soul that bad? when i played it a few years back it was pretty fun
i think like added up it's like at most 100 hours? which is not a lot
to be fair, none of my alts really went really far
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
yeah, on that account
L-nya
whoa so much to back read
mald is p bad tho
ely is t2
i mean in abyss yeah
the score is pretty good
the setup yeah
in abyss high doubt
in MA yea absolutely
i dunno i slept hard
<:cry:944955259636285481>
months
i actually haven't played RL in fucking
i miss RL
can i try
L-nya
you just won't improve at the game
then you're only training like 2 hours per week
if you only spend less than an hour each boss
the only way to improve is by playing a lot
like you can slacc but then don't complain when you're bad at the game
no you ain't LMFAO
with the scores you getting
sometimes not even enough to learn mobs before boss even spawns
13 resets is unironically not even enough for me to learn p1 of most bosses
simple as that
i'd quit
then there's nothing left to play the game for
i'm already not balding abyss, if i don't bald MA either
i either bald the game to hell or quit
i'm all in or nothing
why even bother at that point
but that sounds boring
like realistically i can low t100 every week by playing 15 minutes
that sounds boring as hell
i'd have fucking quit
if that's all i did in the game
lmfao
13 resets doesn't get me past husk MA opener
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
i'm getting too toxic
sorry i won't be toxic anymore after that one
yeah it shows
3 hours per cycle
i slacc so bad, i think at most i spend what
also you think i do abyss LMFAO
you're both wrong i just like to copy paste messages which i feel similar vibe to
I still havent evem tried abyss
you never strim
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
you typo 680
L-nya
he's going to score a 770 and then there's no point for me trying
aw damn no fun, gresham's doing it first?
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
i'm gonna score a big 600 on hepha and not even t100
me plebeian
nonono
that's a pleb n a lao
oh you said 2 laos
sheeesh
oh shit you got someone to play your acc?
SO much more damage than me
cause you can clean up much better cause you just have
i was jelly
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
yeah sure thing, i need my sister pc open to try it tho
<:surprised:889238431580958780>
:O
can i try
i just need to beat keeb to promote <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
is that what you mean?
so i get to suffer?
whats this bracket luck
i'm 3rd with 40 points over you
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
you underestimate me
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
imagine not being in nirvana ~~this is a call for help please~~
yeah hahah ~~let me out~~
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
i think that's too high to be a nirv retainer in maincord
LMFAO
yeah i saw WC scoring 31k i think that's what we call a good investment <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
come to nirv i go to rl
trade?
maincord told me it was pretty good
yeah i got some 47k scores on gresham acc with dudu elf, great scores without elf <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
dumb story
good music
i was having fun tho
and stopped on episode 30
oh i started watching that a few years ago
klein looks very big this boss
what's dn
what's that
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
wow and you lie now, you think i didn't see you reacting to that when i sent it
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
you wouldn't get it
it's a masters strat
i'm becoming the player that says they're quitting every patch now
and it will also remove outdated content called keilo
margrave is actually so much sp it's insane
so kind
gresham just i ain't reading that shit'd me by hugging me
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
i love attention
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
and give me attention
if you wanna read my rant
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
wtf don't call it my route
y'all awful influences
i mean after abyss opened it calmed down
LMFAO fair
over it
did you miss my rant
whoa everyone slaccing there
<@781539392039682058> L-nya
ping heki right now
do my tank too <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
same
At least I'm not suffering alone
might start calling it nini moment now
<a:bugcatdeadpat:898434851160604684>
probably is
actually i dunno if klein is necessary
did you try keebs
too toxic <:Sadge:715448677162024980>
LMFAO sorry
maybe i try for higher later
okay i'm bored
that i actually want to play abyss LMFAO
is not often
yeah gimme 10 min then cause i wanna use the abyss mood i'm in
oh sheeeesh
i wanna try a lil more at the boss before coaching <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
how much time do you have
o ok
cause i'm suffering too
cause if it's higher than i dunno if can help
is your score lower than mine
this is a lil better <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
i'm having fun
gresham moment
i just got cucked of a great run because of gears <a:kree:809653433455214632>
do you have a soft ping whenever someone type old valks like wc vc
ssg fragilelao
actually insane that he ran all those bosses and rerecorded them all in such a small timeframe
yeah he worked really hard
it's actually already back up
have you done anything? don't think so, haven't seen it
that's true, i've also seen it myself
like how can you do even worse at a boss
she's really weak, she gets type countered and the weather fucks her over
like optimally the absolute worst
have you thought about how WC is the worst valk to use against husk
tysm ruby
i have a 1925 already, so the 1933 is what i need
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
only 90 points behind keeb....
thank you <a:catgib:564829264466149378>
but i dunno
next score should be 1933 i think?
can you check if there's any scores higher than 1925 this blockade LMFAO
yo ruby can i use your ref searching skills for evil
they just fucked it up tho, the theme missions wasn't even there before this reset
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
can't claim rewards
clear the stage within 90s with yellow medal = i completed it (did it twice)
give me my asterite <:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
what the fuck is going on
?????
where the fuck is it? LMFAO
i thought if i reset the game it'd show up
what the fuck??
is there actually none???
who fucking wouldve guessed huh
crazy how i can meet damage thresholds when i use the right rank vlaks
<:cry:944955259636285481>
and it works
fast gears is a lie sold by CN ref maker to make you feel bad
i get a score and i go cool! what the fuck is that
love non-uprate 3s bosses
yeah hold me neko
yeah that sounds like fun
are you still doing husk
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
<a:NOOO:996348845803966524>
oh <@370438895965306882> stream is done
oh yeah there's those wishes too
yeah i wish i was dead
forgot to enable them
did they just
like these
are the extra tasks
where the fuck
is this blockade fucked up????
i think
that's called projection
go talk about your fit men somewhere else <:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
can you keep the degen talk out of here tho
it's been a thing for a while now, yeah
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
not been doing blockade
baban have you just
?????
current score: 0
like at the very bottom
bug out when you use lite
no i mean
cause it sounds wrong
does it always do that
with rewards claimed
how am i at 0 score
w-what
true
i thought he'd slac until the last second
he played this abyss so early tho, i'm kinda surprised
i'm better than keeb <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
so toxic
StFu 840
why do you think i didn't post any of the ely ones <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i only look for alive valks
lmfao
no
840 KMB dps
can't wait for my capping every boss -> t20
<:pepeW:996346590086303805>
another hepha check
this week is just
s0 PE can 946 btw
SK
oh there's alt strat with HoT RC BD
893 HoT RC GD
what the fuck is going on
and i don't have bri pri
that's 3s HoS
i wanna run that
it looks so cool LMFAO
before exalted
missile stacking is 2019/2020 strats btw
missile stacking
and it's unironically
holy fuck it's an 893 with VC
893 with VC
i see an 840 with UR
it's a 946 LMFAO
i don't fucking know dont ask me
CN went insane over this one SS boss
yes
SI FT VP
this is a goldmine for tet
AE was the first valk who deals only elemental damage
every valk before AE dealt phys damage
????
are shit like this
half of the SK refs
wtf is wrong with cn this week
very worth the resources
very big difference
if i didn't i'd be stuck at 840
cubing cflare did matter for my 856 BKE
like yeah it's impossible to trigger it
do you even need FR qte that bad
hmm
like for FR dps, cat dps, you still run her
for like off-meta, budget teams she can still find a good amount of uses tho
AE outside of fire only for wolf
yeah for meta teams
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
no my pfp in this server
look at my pfp
i'm mortal still
that's not how it works
end me gresham
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
me next
wrong day there
fix your clock heki <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
good one <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
don't say it like that as if 2020 was like 2 years ago or smth
<a:PU_pepeNoted:850331498598891540>
guess the answer is yes if you're heki
like does these ads work on anyone
i was thinking about that
oh
how?
like every week there's a new one
where do y'all get these games from to be addicted to
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
nah i'm different
no pull only
but i'll play like
i'll prob play gacha games in the future
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
lycaon always
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
and honkai is my last
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
genshin was
no
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
end of the day i had 4/4
i was like i'm not spending that much money, i'll jsut run craftable gear
i was a baby whale from the start
kiana on chapter 9:
LMFAO
DA has no meta reasosn
i mean yeah that makes sense
or shit on player who does play based on meta
just don't delude yourself that it's secretly meta
go ahead
i mean if you're doing stuff on non-meta reasons
L-nya
p much would never backpull on those
because the best dps to pull for is always the newest one
those tier lists can be really misleading, especially for dps
thing about honkai is just you never backpull
maybe even a lil above average on coverage
i mean i'd really not call her lower end of the meta, i think she's definitely average
yeah!! make em get dogs!!
i really like it
it's really good
LMFAO i didn't know the server icon was a gif
i'd say 2-3 is average
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
they just never show up
she has like 4 or so bosses
i think i'd say she has above average coverage in abyss
very unfair
comparing to HoT is
HoT -1
mobius and DPe tie
14
HoH stole maru
hepha
they keep turning the bosses she's good at into 3s bosses LMFAO
aka and bella
mobius only has 2 2s bosses now
i don't even know if i'd call mobius very strong in MA anymore
i've never seen stuff like that on java though
i think it makes sense
oh wow that's an interesting way to do things
<:worrynirvanajail2_hh:828444826822508554>
and i'm
i'm barely sweating
look at me
if whales were sweating they wouldn't be in a4
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
more like it's either copium slacc or whale slacc
last time i was in RL was second cycle of 5.9
even rl can get pretty memey i think
it sounds really fun
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
i've only demoted rl twice, once on jizo and another when i was playing runescape and forgot to do abyss
i've never been to a3
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
play to have fun, if boss isn't fun then it's an a3 roadtrip angle
sleep angle
<a:aworryGanbatteTrance:783309984397656075>
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
yeah husk got hands
which means it's probably really bad in javascript
but it's not that bad if it was java
i dunno how to do that in javascript
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
you can do it carv
gaming
oh shit
tf he's doing with eden guns
look at his lightning carv
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816>
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
carv protecting me
whel
9s team
what??
i've never seen that before
what the fuck you mean again
thank you i only understand less
i got gresham hooked on the L nya <a:catsquish:960915981432131644>
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
i'm very petty LMFAO i'll keep complaining about this until the game fucking dies
why even bother checking if the newest valk will have good alt options or not in her shill boss if mihoyo might hit her with the adjusted ice and phys resistances on the very next patch
just feels like playing unfair
new players could've seen that jk does no freeze trauma and realised some boss like abyss hepha need the freeze trauma and decided to invest in HB cause she'd still have a clear if small niche
dunno, just very scummy to do shit like that
maybe the kill just went longer and can applied freeze
hmmm could be a ton of stuff but idt it's ely
doesn't matter if it's a lot or not, still needed <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and ofc every boss has like +1/5th of a grid <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
klein does like 1/5th of a grid
it's not a lot of trauma
but from the elfs that do apply trauma, like klein
just extend duration
yeah i'm going to check but from what i remember elf doesn't increase freeze trauma application nor applies any freeze trauma herself
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
just very bullshit in my eyes
6.0 you mean
MA hepha freeze is kinder, you already ran ff19 there, though i dunno if elf is what made the difference or not
abyss hepha needed the freeze from cb19 even with elf
i'm talking about abyss hepha
they fix it
so what mihoyo does is not improve JK or let that be, they remove the niches that HB does cover
but like, she clearly doesn't, there's stuff HB can do that JK can't
that's kinda fucked up but ok
like, if JK actually covered all of HBs niches and made her obsolete
i mean it's not even a deal of keeping HB alive or not
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
all boss must shill newest valk
but no
hepha could be the one boss you use HB instead of JK
it's dishonest and bullshit
thing that makes me pissed is like post-release balance patches for shill being called adjustment or bugfix
we really don't need 3 husk tho
i mean i don't even mind just reusing same boss with slightly different mechanics
oh god that blows <a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
boss needs less ice trauma, we need to change valk's weapon
one single new release we gotta fucking change everything
feels like it's being held by tape
ice team no joke
cb19 just fucking sucks balls with cat
like if instead of SoE we got pri crusher on next patch i think i'd be happier
i mean unironically it'd be really useful for her right now
that's also a shitty thing <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
cause now she can use ff19 but i also dunno if her BiS should even be ff19
i mean i dunno if i'd say benefits HB
don't fuck up old bosses
just make a new boss like you always do, mihomo
LMFAO
it's so dumb
makes me so mad
just crosses a fucking line to me
these fucking adjustments to bosses post release to shill the newest valk better
i actually despise this
this is turbo stupid
kinda like java if you don't mess with .equals
<a:nod:774308559487369237>
i mean yeah that makes sense
<a:huggies:865273755152678972>
then that's stupid
unless you mean even same reference doesn't work
cause like, it'd be comparing object references to find something in there
i mean that makes sense doesn't it
<@370438895965306882> hey let me know when you're ready to do my abyss today
legit matters p much never
i took the iriya pill, fighting over <10 atk isn't worth it
that close to cap
i don't think i have any valk
oh looking sick then!!
looks great!
<- has no clue about what 3s atack is supposed to look like
<:GWsetmyxPeepoEvil:405337570952740864>
show atk
just shows how much she loves ely
going to feed mine aswell with 2s JK
3s HoH, going to 3s JK
nini do be feeding her well
300 pull 4/4 HoH
she did
aren't alt options pretty awful there
that's pretty insane i think
on hepha
yeah it's bruh's doing
common NA L
rip
oh you're EU peeps
is ER open
huh my husk don't do that
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and i was just doing 2s
and went whoa this is so fucking weird, the husk in the ref just does a whole different opener
and went to do it
i watched a husk ref
the amount of times
i can't tell you
<:pepeW:996346590086303805>
<:cry:944955259636285481>
i wanna do husk
<:cry:944955259636285481>

damn
i will kill myself
my development arc is to overcome them

<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i'm typing to myself all day on discord

real people get it in a few hours

so now i don't leave servers anymore
last time i did i lost <:meditate:666837440178290708>
if there was a reason to
i'd do that
i can't keep up with all of them
in 130 servers
i think i'm legit
i show up there like once every two weeks to make fun of dia
wfp is on lifeline
i every now and then show up in solstice
i keep up with this and blustorm
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
go study
wtf you doing stalking people then
all my terms are mid

a lot of free time
heki you have
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>

my bow collection
~~3s hepha this week tho~~
for husk
oh i guess that's fair, i ignore those
what??????
57??????
trashes nanos outside of multiples of 15
who the fuck
that's fucking cursed
no perms to send messages on that chat
oh i can't actually
i already bully people
what else can a mod even do
is deleting messages when someone spoils stuff outside of <#963273616852652095>
the only thing i'm doing with my mod powers
my villain arc
read down from here
where you not here for yesterday when i achieved godtier
and how close to cap i am
that's my best scores at each 3s boss
if i'm learning
i need at least one day per boss to score properly
which is not a lot when you suck at the game
i spend my week at college so i only have 2 days to do MA
LMFAO
so it's time <:Woke:759887282042830889>
it's the only boss idk how it works
i'm going to understand this boss
actualy no
i'll <:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
nini do mine too
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
what?
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
i'm poor f2p player
i think you're confused <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
the valk that's releasing in 6.2?
JK?
SW? damn
aponia right <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
is assaka aponia or SW still
here's what skill WC unlocks at lv50
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
yeah but it's a lot of work and time i'd only have to do once
lot of work tho
so i can document those costs
i wanna make an alt
yeah idr from 3s GD
i was like no way i need this many but i'll keep saving just to be sure
<:pepeW:996346590086303805>
70 adv skill mats
3s hb skills unironically cost
unscuffed
i'm officially
can prob do some HoF HoT HoR shit now
main dps main dps main dps team
soon we'll have the
but i guess the answer is HoT LMFAO
i was gonna ask who would even replace GD on a DPe team
cause now every lightning team is crying for a lil eden
kinda crazy that they went all that way to make sure that that would be the case
looking at it now tho
oh i guess most s-ranks have independent multiplier instead
does vill-v not
didn't know that
sheeesh herrscher bias gets breach at s1
memory issue
and s2 is sp gen?
wait no, is breach at the s1?
probably
skill diff
who knows
and HoF gets her at s2?
why does HoT and HoH get breach skill at s1
i mean, they just shill shit differently
maybe
oh then idk
6.1 already has eden gear supply announced
no
JK gear sounds like a very good investment
yea i mean if you have spare xtal and want to invest in ice team
i already have both 3s
oh
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
you're getting from bp
cause turg
i mean yes
wait
no
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
meanwhile my ult cd is going up like
ref can ult with dudu like 8 times
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
yeah!!
it's insane
30% ult cdr
4s dudu has fucking
hell no
just to make it clear, i have both at 3s already, so it's 3 -> 4s
2. elf ely not available on spending
1. 4s dabber way more important utility buff than 4s elf ely
3s jizo actually unplayable
i've been fucked over on phys bosses enough
spending shop is funding my 4s dudu
i'm not even doing that
i'm farming her the whole year LMFAO
bitch i'm doing the pleb route
which is great design for AL valk
like they're small incremental, make a difference but not overly change gameplay
FR rank ups are pretty good
????
ice support -> all support rank ups are 2s+
that's kinda fucked huh
it's for her own output
yeah i guess that's fair
is it really?
maybe i'm overvaluing s2 on JK, it sounds really good tho
o i meant her s2 skill
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
every valk
that's literally
what game you're playing
do you know
neko
like if i understand her correctly, she's basically unplayable before s1 already
otherwise wait for 2s
s2 if shieldbreak weather (read: HoV)
is s0 basically useless
yeah what my gut tells me about JK
she really does actually
that's will to live issue
HB is too low, i agree with that too
and there's no rank pointer, putting JK at SS rank of support is misleading
i think PV > GD
FR is also a tad too low
i think AE is too low on lightning list
if not above SA
i think CH should be switch with DK at the very least
LMFAO
that gets her more aggressive
it's low health btw
that hard
is it really
one time
please switch weapon
one time
senti when i press for you to switch weapon
need to string tf = my turn to play
i think i can maybe one rot the zombie
LMFAO
holy shit
SK fucking killed me
i'm not sure how dmg reduction works, i'd hope it's not linear though
lemme have this one
i just spent like too many affix mats on an abyss i'm demoting
fuck
cost reduction
L-nya
mine's better
i was going to reroll it into crit reduction anyways
i got rid of the cdmg one
yeah i'm just coping
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
10
i don't wanna fuck these up
LMFAO
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
or can i put it on griseo
need to be on HoS
does my ele dmg affix
hey gresham
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
and i'll bald that
give me a honkai lore ref
yeah i'll try to get past the jargon and try to understand what the fuck is going on later
LMFAO
i had issues following it
spoiler alert
you said oh no don't worry, when it's released you'll have no issue following it
story lost me big time
i mean i told you already
sure i'll pin that
LMFAO
i'd never walk that path of evil <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
villain arc
LMFAO
?unmute <@447218009749061632>
HOW IS THAT THE DEFAULT
INDEFINITELY???
LMFAO
i don't wanna use gresham as testing rat
really specific
that's
i dunno the difference
only time out
i can't mute actually
yeah i wouldn't
LMFAO
ik it doesn't look like it LMFAO
jayson is the owner of the server
nice
@everyone
ok
too much potential power in my hands
i mean i'm not trying but thank you
@ everyone
and i was like holy fuck i'm so lost
i stopped when v2v spun a top and started saying some dumb shit
oh you went farther than me
holy fuck
god these husks are too confusing
oh is it?
the alright one (lightning hitcount)
the kinda cbt one (lightning paralyse)
the forgotten one (type hitcount)
the forsaken one (type paralyse)
we have four
which one is this husk again
rip
now i can't @\everyone as a joke
damn that's the crazy
LMFAO i was joking
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
.mod <@148145559897636865>
im not even a threat
ask gresham or nini
or cata
a lot of non-coin rewards now
with cat sigil
did they do something to cat gambling in er
the fears
you read on all the other players name's
perrmeates
yeah just his energy on the bracket
the chipmunk from the one movie
name's carvalho i'm pretty sure
is a bicc dalao, be careful
that one player right there
<:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
with the good dub
do we have one
<:whalepat_hh:710738275845013576>
it's so fucking funny
so bad
i wanna post that in solstice
even doing creative writing now
holy fuck <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
moriso can just whip up a twitter post and people write more than i wrote in my entire graduation
LMFAO i was about to post this here
so i'm glad he's taking a break, the best move there
was clear from the first post moriso just really shouldn't be on twitter
good job actually
this is news, content creator actually doing something right
huh
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
if that makes sense
female privilege is certainly a discussion worthy of being brought up, but they talk like feminism doesn't talk about it (it definitely does, just not on those terms), and they don't bring it up to actually discuss it, just to do a ahah you're a hypocrite! i win!
is just trying to shut down discussion while not actually giving any meaningful insight to it
like similarly to going well y'all talk about male privilege, why aren't you talking about female privilege
but like it could be a thing, the only issue is that every time it's brought up it's by transphobes trying to do a gotcha
but no such thing for race
documented and observed gender dysphoria
like, a better way to explain it is that there's
what even is normal
<:shrug:877047647511384064>
but like theoretically there's no inherent issue to it
and we have no proof of people wanting to be transracial, besides like people just trying to stir shit up and doing it out of bad faith
we have proof of people wanting to be transgender
and the answer to that is very complicated, but the gist of it is
people doing stuff over bad faith just to muddle the discussion
no, grift as in like
people go well if i can 'change' my gender, why can't i change my race
the idea of it is basically transgender but for race
as far as i know it's a grift thing?
oh
i'll answer if i think you are responsible to know the answer
ask away
oh no
the only reason he hasn't yet is because he doesn't know
he'll fucking do it
oh god don't teach him
smh privilege
by himself
heki's going to get this whole server cancelled one day
god
basically same thing
they suck + no cunny + homophobe
rename it to Marisa Honkai then
if sumeru was a surprise to me you'd catch me right now going wait sumeru's released????
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
i wouldn't have logged in if i didn't know sumeru was releasing
of course not
so i could get the achievement for like 1k dialogue or w/e it was
and spamming F
on 1.1
i remember staying over at golden pavillion
no excuse either, that was my genshin peak
what the fuck is my memory
oh god
no way they did
did they actually
shut up
LMFAO
did they?
very fun
and it was such a big one
and there was just a new archon quest notif
so we logged in
cause they didn't announce the archon story was even a thing for the patch
SO fun
i remember that patch, it was actually
1.4 or smth
god that one was like
my jokes slowly being more and more niche LMFAO
i dunno, the left's anti intellectualism or smth i'm guessing
i know too many things now
dainshook was even a thing
i didn't know
word
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
<:peepoSit:1016193458307862609>
i'm there
no
haven't even updated the game
fuck no
yeah please don't
<:lewd:959737567119556618>
nice
i haven't done the story to understand the irony
i haven't done the story to understand the irony
is it not entertaining to you, carv-senpai
do you not like all the drama talk
<:HoEOuch:671132101592088577>
best emote of 2022
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
i say emotes out loud
i actually do that unironically now, discord broke me
that makes more sense
doctor: we are doing the best we can but the chances of us saving them is very smal-
me with a straight face looking into the eyes of my doctor: kusasmol
it's more than i'm scoring
it's a good score i'm in shock over the build
sh... sheeesh?
so i can make her react to every time someone says a little with <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
where is yui

<a:KeiloTheBear:1002644779441598585>
i have scoliosis
not a straight bone in my body
*undoes years of lgbt work*
i'm straight in a gay way you know
LMFAO
yeah i'm straight now <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
like true ending?
what??
i have forsaken the straight
that doesn't sound right
but then me with another non-binary person would be the het ship?
i actually haven't figured that one out yet
the best het ship is me with anyone cause i'm non-binary so everything is straight i think
someone just take twitter away from moriso
honestly
and moriso didn't like that
cause there's no content in that game
genshin chat was all ship talk
what was probably happening is that
honestly
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
LMFAO
you have time to start writing the apology even before i post the callout post
see i'm so kind
be careful
i'll post a moriso callout post on twitter aobut you later tet
virgin moriso i thought it only meant cute and funny vs chad tet i knew
i mean yeah that's p fair, probably the better stance against it
actually face blind
i only found out who was black widow after the end of the movie cause she had a different hair color
all the way
i was very confused
in the theaters
was the first endgame
unironically the only avengers movie i watched
i'm barely offended, i'm like whoa how's the new avengers movie (age of ultron)
2015 gaming culture
calling what you don't like fag/gay is such
yeah i always get such a whiplash when i see stuff like that nowadays
definitely not something you can get away with just going out of context
yeah no i agree that's uh
sorry i had my edgy joke of the day already LMFAO
though i'm an arena fag and i want 2s sk so... not untrue?
oh kinda yikes
also anything else is probably out of context
that's a pretty interesting take
the last one tho
no fucking way
yeah there's
LMFAO
oh okay
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh no
and damage thresholds consistently feel way more tight to follow refs
2-3 times as longer
fights arel ike
also i def think abyss is way more bald than MA
p much f2p
oh he only went for all spending event stamps, all bundle stamps and 1 card
honkai competitive just breaks your brain huh
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
sushang funds getting cut
LMFAO
not as bad tho, since game doesn't outright lie to you
on transition
i also hate pig for weird attack timings
yeah it's pretty bad
so you have to pick your poison
and i also can't see shit
i see all the refs playing on ultra and like the game is so pretty
i can see shit clearly
my game looks like roblox
that one might be a game quaity issue
just a lot about kosma is awful
yeah that's awful design
doesn't mean it shouldn't matter for competitive gamemode
like i also suck balls at energy management in genshin and a lot of the more complicated reaction stuff
instead of having them not matter
i would still have the features in the gamemode so i can improve on them
i mean i am very much also bad at the game
i also hate a lot of the bosses
i mean
kinda like them going we've disabled damage from elemental reactions in abyss
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
fully not care about arguably the most important feature of your game
imagine making half of your competitive game modes
exactly, and time fracture is one of the most interesting and important features in the game, it's really fun to use and cool to pull off
why even bother then
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
i don't have to worry about flagship feature of the game
that's not a good thing
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
you keep telling yourself that
uhuh less bald
yeah right
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
this entire patch
haven't had fun in abyss
y'all liked abyss?
expecting a lot of last second malders tho
weirdge
yeah im like -30 still t30
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
can cap everything, still will t25
braindead boss too
everyone has higher cap than me cause everyone has s1+
hepha week is L week for me, doesn't matter how close i get to caps
but i'll do my best
i won't
maso boss
husk is like
fair
1.5% burst tdm from dk
4% ice from dorm
so now all i'm missing is like
i got +2% ice from dk
i'll have 3s HB
next week i have no excuses
wdym
next week is p fun
shit strat fr
then you need a few sp/s lines
if it's the same opening as i was doing
oh yeah
same
not the most interesting 2s boss
i think i'm aaaalright with that?
hmmm
then i'll maybe try
oh wait it's not type wolf
LMFAO
right into bed
i'm going to morb
there u go
hakcer gets it
see
try again
cock isn't hard enough
i miss morbing :(
no morbing :(
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
next week i'm fucking ready
too high
hmmm
which is kinda FT if you think about it
on doom
i used SI BKE BB strat
you can use her on doom too
kallen last? week
or shennong T shui MB
FT uses ely TB dante marco columbus tesla M
i used 2 this week
6.1 week 1
i hate those bosses, i don't hate the valks
i mean you talk like that
fuck 3s jizo
good release mihomo
busted stigs
pretty good valk
cool tf tech stuff
she was pretty fun, some anim cancels
i do unironically miss playing SA
vice setting bad example smh
i think it was the first time in like a year i haven't done sim battle at all LMFAO
that i actually just forgot to do sim battle entirely
last time i wanted so much not to play
assaka? <a:PU_PeepoLeaveExit:855157057887535164>
all the others i triple 917
the one week i don't play
that's
anything for the 917
i regret that message
it does make me finish faster
yeah a lot of strats involve hitting the boss's dead body for them to die faster
what the fuck is sim battle even
for it to die faster
that you have to hit dxy's dead body
but now i figured out
stopped pressing the attack button after dxy died
me, as a normal, sane player
can anyone guess what i was missing
20 minutes trying to do the 917 dxy
last time i spent like
you know
after hunger games?
deserved
china? it's a country?
LMFAO
10 score diff from 1st to 100th
fucking t100 would be
imagine cn with 1 server
otherwise pretty sick
turg cat soured the last time it ran
aka fight best fight in the game don't @ me
like good enough to retain nirv
i think like 2s1 HoR is prob a good pick vs s0 HoH on a lot of bosses though
that's fair tho, she will definitely not top score anything besides her scores at like 9s level
honkai 2022
the sole purpose of [new release] is just to create [insert number] niche af bosses
yoinked
LMFAO they stole gresham's ref
i ran these all with lv55 DoR and got the 917s
she has some 917s though
her tf isn't the best
like HoR really doesn't need that much support to come back to the meta imo
you have to spoiler mark this outside of <#963273616852652095>
HoR is actually still surprisingly strong to this day, she deals a good amount of damage for a valk that old
the hard part was when, not if
HoR dk is pretty easy to guess that it would happen eventually
LMFAO soon someone will translate it back and it'll be around for overseas leaks again
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
-15 on fgo
owo math 240 / 16
owo math 856 - 616

still don't understand fgo
i'm done with this week
<:peepoSit:1016193458307862609>
i'll hold hands with darius
this is the first comment right LMFAO
i mean still a fucked up thing to do him
gresham <a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
i'm pretty sure TRL just enjoys the attention
literally incredibly niche top nirvana players with vids on the 100s if that of views
when they're like
the players have been getting hatemail/death threats over it now
that's it, we're mad over the content creator for just making a public statement about it without talking with those players before hand
biggest global/sea content creator called out 3 small players because they were bullying him over bad takes on guides/tier lists
yeah right out of the oven drama
masters MA is a joke <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
pretty funny

s2 is supposed to be able to kill in 2 ult
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
can't kill in 2 ult
i do the same thing as ref and deal -150k dmage on ult
oh thank god
why do i deal no damage
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
the libel!!!
i dunno which is which
the libel
the slander
<a:DuckSmh:931628395656249345>
whoa gresham now doing edited pics
<:Sus:921102918059446362>
where you'd get the idea
me? i'm pure
i'd never
is worst than the notif i think
the gif
i only dm tet like twice a month and it's always the greatest stuff
LMFAOOOOOOOO
celine's been getting to me for a while now LMFAO
other half is this
half is this
my favorited gifs are a landmine
i'm just favoriting these so i can use them while doing erp
please share
good energy
🌽🌰
LMFAO
on fgo
LMFAO
fuck i'm actually -18
yes pls
yes
i have a like -20 -2 -3
boss sucks
i'm actually slaccing heavily this week
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
LMFAO
thank you for the opinion @vodkaloli
and most of the honkai community is siding with him for some reason
moriso did some stupid shit
above average
this is pretty high quality shenanigans
actually
do that nini
,qdel 1819871
can you delete your quote nini?
yeah we need to do the image
,qdel 1819872
,qdel 1819870
i'm stupid
fuck
nadeko would have to have the emotes
yeah it doesn't really work
LMFAO
only good take
oh but he didn't direct hate towards them oh i will
i'm gonna post this to my twitter
who's the bad guy now
nah i'm doing the callout post now
yeah why did those people not find issues on your guides back when you didn't post guides, huh??? check mate, atheists <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
<a:laughExplode:757310151215808638>
LMFAO
now here's some feedback i'm used to
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
,qdel 1819868
credit nini tho
do that
oh that's smarter
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
LMFAOOOO
i think (hope) he just unlisted everything
over the hate messages
yeah
fragile nuked his channel
moriso great player, can make starter kiana score a 10s kill <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
shit game, stay away
that new players get gatekept
it's good tho
LMFAO
yeah smh
crazy how people like neffr only started playing and criticising moriso when the hackers showed up
good take!
so interesting
like you spend 4 weeks doing it and by the time you're done, the patch's done
yeah like it's p much impossible to do a good job about it
meta changes so much from patch to patch, what's a good pull changes easily based on what you have and on the current patch
it's so much work, and it's so short lived
it's p much impossible for honkai
issue with like doing thorough guides is just that
looking into a keqing mains library thing for honkai
we're kinda working on some beginner resources for the game over at honkai guides server
jk i did read all of that, i do agree with what you mean
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
great sentences behind what is probably great feedback
messages that give me fear
yeah i wasn't even alive back then
oh ok
there's a new catfish?
drama or catfish?
compared to other random players
i don't wanna think moriso did it intentionally, i dunno if they know how much power they hold
i'll get even more mad over it
that fucking blows
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
<>
it's insane
so immature and irresponsible of moriso
this is
yeah i actually made up my mind pretty quick
edgy joke of the day for me
is this me? i pretend to be a girl and doctors call it transgender LMFAO
small cat! :D
there's.... a lot of lumina stuff...
i mean there's also the lumina stuff
average nirvana retainer opinion in maincord <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
LMFAO
they're really fun
nevermind i'm reading the comments now
everyone involved there LMFAO
feels real weird to actually know
i won't even read the takes on the comments
<a:PopcornMunch:751417674277322834>
LMFAO
carv retainer sheeesh
because of pe lead scam
that iriya could swear he could only score that high
there was on past hoD
we might be on an all time high this week
<:Stonksanali:997604787275178004>
by graphing out the amount of suicide threats in this channel
i wonder if we can measure the quality of a week
i'm having fun now
lfg
kusasmol
wait can i do a thing
oh gosh i'm so bad at the game, can you pilot my acc?
oh i'm such a dummy, can you teach me how to rotate?
it's inevitable
wow remember when we thought she played well
in a few patches she'll be the valk we'll look at and go
buggy as fuck
HoS is lowkey
is non-2s jk even worth using
that's going to be me
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
shafted again
still no fire support
psy fire
time to play HoR
wake up, it's 3.2
dante isn't even a stig
what
dunno if you can get away with anything on nirv tho
i remember last RL PE got okay score
i think it's something like PE > BKE > TP
<:goblin:750558196644708392>
bye LMFAO
i'm going to play runescape
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
even without cez B bug, sns still better
griseo did not do better on shield otto
from us
-5
o wow
460?
what dist is eu
<a:PU_PeepoLeaveExit:855157057887535164>
at least i got my pink bridge
hmm
holmes TB avo M?
what are you running on HoS
griseo
i'll also run FT
ik BKE does
so gl
i think TP unironically scores aight on RL
don't have any affix to fuck up either
nice
ss dupe doko
yeah
it shouldn't idt
only 2 uses of elemental affix in the game
yea you need to run elemental affix
and loses phys resist
she gains elemental resist
with elemental
every time you hit SK
that's nice
oh you think you're clearing it in nirv with HoH
like about a 50-100
yeah
good patch mihoyo
ing myself
i'm also off
how much does that score
yea ok
who else are you supposed to use on doom
yeah
i'm dealing ice damage
second time nuke doesn't crit
i'm gonna go insane
maybe sns strat is better on crits <:pepeW:996346590086303805>
then i'll have 35% crit rate
i will if you venmo me 30% crit rate
you know what yea close enough
626 is one
620 is not a score
it's 520 <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
516 is also not a score
jesus hakcer
lmfao
no
which is good luck
ooh one of those is an MA score
damn i summoned a carv
but i guess it's fair, cause i could be talking about actual leaks like DN LMFAOOOO
the only sad part is that i do it constantly to carv by saying like hey did you hear about the leak about DN LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOO
won't fall for me own tricks
and act surprised about it
my hobby is to fall to dn jokes
yeah do better next time
dabbing these nuts on your face LMFAOOOO
you're supposed to answer
wrong answer
what's dabber
150k damage on Pe ult
figure out why i'm missing
before i <:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
watch mine later
<a:bouncydonut:959706415323312160>
oh that's not as toxic as i thought
i wanna see it
why is phys like this
<:cry:944955259636285481>
i don't wanna play anymore
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
yeah a sign that you should go do better stuff with your life
that's not that it looks like 69
i'm surprised there's an actual answer to why you want 609
then your irl balls are also 15 torus each
if you dm dawei
raids?
too high, i want 17 points less
yeah
-4
that's only a like
ooh i got a 626
is my mental health reaching critical state
the only thing that's critting here
on doom
i don't even know what has to crit for the shield to break
why do you want 609 so bad
<:dudutrash:1001346904686350416>
i'm telling you it's always like this with bke
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
balding something you have CONTROL OVER
must be fun
oh thank god it's just you
morb directly to a3
yeah
very cool huh
hey guys look at this cool new doom strat i figured out
dice simulator
i'm literally playing
cool
huh your name now has a very different meaning
yeah every day
LMFAO
is something she already does
your idea of how to make a DA a worst valk
i just think it's funny how
no i know
LMFAO
da finisher can already miss
yeah i'd quit
makes elemental crit
nahida s-rank elemental support
next genshin crossover
god
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
passive: elemental damage can now crit
they release S-rank elemental support
i can't wait until
insane
i'm going to go
on every hit
this strat literally has 40% crit
by having crit
like how is the game improved
why is crit a thing
who made crit
i'm tilting
same
ymmv
klein tho
i got a -3 literally first try
0 looks hell
easy for -1/-2
in abyss
i've already accepted my <a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
i'm talking about MA
when i really just suck
maybe if i don't score people will think i'm on break
they're free!!
nice!
that's t1 ios
don't one rot zombie at ios dist
just wanted to show like even 9s
so they have less HoS sp issue
that's 9s tho
yeah if you're close that might be better
these are prob the ones you saw the most
they have some at like 465
not all cn servers are this above our dist
i mean it's 479d
there's no one rotting the zombie in CN
nah they definitely do small rot afterwards
ayy ty
small rot = everyone but hos ult
they do small rot with spear after
i don't think CN 1 rot the zombie
🤸
🦽🏌️
what about this
<- going insane
why you starring dabber
what y'all making a movie now
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
WHAT THE
DIDN'T CRIT
MY BKE NUKE
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
else you deal -10% damage for no reason
that's 2s ref if you're shameless in specific
2s ref my ass
i do no damage on doom, i do no damage on fgo
wtf is wrong with phys
i do no damage
<:Madge:909232418379153418>
fuck that gacha
yeah
i hate fgo
okay it's not that bad i'm just bad at the game
off myself
i'm going to fucking
if i miss fischl arrow one more time during transition
but if you're both elf ult, then the diff is p small
it's power is the ult cdr, so if ref can elf ult and you can't, then that's p big
like, in a rot in a vacuum
4s dudu doesn't make that much difference in damage
damn i just fucked up the run of my life
hmm is no one trying at this pig <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
still scores like crazy cause her team has actual good tf
HoT suffers so bad against this boss, damage is pitiful
really shows how bad literally any other valk is at MA when you compare it with HoT
<:MeiHue_lum:694766566046171166>
2nd try already better than my DA
i'm what? -3?
this strat is kinda fun
yeah i believe in you
sheeesh
do we get another one?
oh shit
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
dropepd
sheeesh
damn
ow2 released?
wait
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
2s -> 3s is 70% of the price from no valk -> 3s
another ss valk cash leftover
you'd unironically have like
i'm <a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
why would i want to live like that
look at your reactions to this cycle
why would i care about abyss
ofc i mean MA
<a:KianaShake:848934595814752286>
can't wait
next week is free
we have wolf?
wolf?
holy shit
sk fucking retired gresham
8 patches ago
i haven't tried my hand at this boss in so long, i can't give much advice besides what i remember from like
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
probably not?
hmm
is quite big
paga M + 2p
oh sorry i stopped reading to make my joke
oh you meant sakura wills
i also have no will
cause she stays on field during burst = no buff
tesla band T is not the best for carole
i see some paga
or some shit
and like idk ppm
paga tb?
what carole are you even using
in abyss? <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
im doomed this cycle too tet
pepew
elemental affix right
oh y'all got the
no?
and crit bald
yeah this fight is just tf check so shield doesn't regen
they tried their best <:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
like carole qte into clone pop infinite tf so the shield doesn't regen
aren't you supposed that big bullshit with tf and shit
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
when i first broke through
100 with HoF
i think in RL i scored a big like
or on boss?
on main stages
so much stuff to dodge, you just machinegun out charged attacks
damn
really is HoR's playground
this second mainstage
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
lmfao
7t but every thunder is a 3s boss t1 by HoT
HoT just broken
and -2 from 3s
that's -1 from 2s1
you can do a lot with s2 HoT
insane scores
with s2 HoT recently
rino literally cleaning the room
that's what everyone here's doing
then bald until you don't
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
you just gotta skill gap them with s0/s2 HoT
if they were good at the game they would be at nirvana with 2s HoT
LMFAO
so they clearly suck
yeah but they are in RL
yeah i'm really sure you can promote RL with s0
but i stand by that comment for either
i dunno if we talking about HoR or HoT
s0 can promote RL
i'm pretty sure after the changes
enough for s0 -> s2
for awk valk
yea you get 12 stamps from ER
i'm just in awe
what
heki
but good enough
4 hours
which i guess i did by like
i should've got this done properly before HoH stuff went away
assume it's +-3 pulls wrong
for costs
i got some rough breakpoints
gear breakpoints
50% -> ~91
60% -> ~98.1
70% -> ~107.1
80% -> ~116.9

elf breakpoints (assuming same rates as valk)
50% -> ~46
60% -> ~61
70% -> ~77
80% -> ~82

SoE breakpoints
50% -> ~28
60% -> ~37
70% -> ~49
100% -> 50
500 AL tho right
10 HoR stamps is like
i dunno how much SK card costs al-wise
hmmm
you should prob compare AL value between the 2 too
if you already have the valk
how many frags does the box give tho
i dunno about for the other game mode
it's really good for MA
2s is the starting bars
imagine knowing old valk cons <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
yeah but i'm assuming you'll buy out the bp stamps
pepew
so we'll get 2s at like middle of 6.2
40?
how many frags are we getting in 6.2
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
using HB for the entirety of the patch <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
so you're suffering alongside pleb like me
the only thing i can do straight LMFAO
are you going for JK bchip stamps + spending stamps, gresham?
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
and now i get  to do it again with JK
all frag farming was through WT, kinda nuts
so that wasn't even frag boost for me
yeah i unlocked the valk then
like MPE i got ER stamps, bp stamps, bp frags
but it really was, wasn't it? there wasn't any freebie frags or stamps
honestly doesn't feel like that
did i really spend that much time doing FR? holy
59 weeks for 3s?
owo math 200 /6
25 weeks is fucking mindblowing
i guess i could've done that in my head
owo math 100 / 4
missing valks are valks i haven't played enough to have a good opinion of
usefulness is based on my acc for the stuff that i do in specific
my tier list
there u go
and prob my last one for a long while
JK's going to be my second one
did you know that i've never bought an AW card besides MPEs
<:meisip:833970844958720010>
it's failed shill
yeah love those shill bosses that show up once and then <a:ppPoof:933892036296343552>
480
but yeah i doubt she'll outright steal it
well, to be clear, nyx was already good enough to promote nirv before JK, so i wanna say i'm pretty sure it'll make her an even more comparable option
hmm probably not
feels like a waste to not just go for it at this point
but i literally already have her pri lv55 and full kafka
i dunno if i should put her at 3s or not, she's kinda useless in MA <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
i just got my TP to 2s
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
whoa the teri simp
and you still need different investment to get the other up and running
like, having one invested certainly helps the other, but not all the investment follows through
VE -> TP is like similar as an LE -> HoT comparison
i'd def count HoR
that's kinda close to funding missing battlesuits
when i quit
you can inherit my acc
i read that as fucklover69
oh fc lover
that was a joke, don't actually
next year the 2022 valk list will be full
pulling 2021 valks in 2022
tet just playing the long game
trust
fire meta incoming
for fire bonus
unlock VKE BR
7.5 i'll grab both from bp and have all the valks trust
i don't wanna login to take screenshot
i'm only missing DPe v2v
it's disgusting
straight different valk at s1
HoH unironically
i mean yeah
s2 is out of reach
me too poor for even s0 everyone
or, every week cause fuck abyss
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
and compete every cycle
much rather have like s0 everyone
yea i'm metaslave through and through
:pettheninisimp:
i guess your 3s was out of simp
whoa you're actually missing a bunch of valks
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
nini bicc whel i'm sure she wouldn't be missing a valk that was given for free on spending and bp
a lot of people took 786 and sleep tho
i haven't tried yet
why is it hard
no
cant you run this
L-desu
steal the HoS
she can do doom tho
HoT goes on pig
psychopath behaviour
help
no qiqi
i unironically have c1 keqing c3 jean c1 diluc c3 mona
unrelatable imagine having qiqi
LMFAO
carv spent too much time in the sus channels, now he worryweird's when someone says they don't like the child
that one sucks to play cause she's a child
that one sucks to play but because she has 10% crit rate
griseo too powerful
even then nowadays we only break like 3 shields and kill
while you break the hands
i think the most you spend is in 3s jizo
you barely spend time outside of burst under normal gameplay
floaty is a good way to describe her senile dog on ice skates control while on burst
then you count yourself as lucky
but if you've only played her in stress test
i mean i'm not saying that BKE is fine to play
<:duduL:889133920950575114>
yeah ik
i'll write that up to skill issue, ty for the input
oh your suffering comes from character trials?
where does nyx go
it's BKE > HoR?
okay so on the tierlist of valks you hate playing
4th BKE
cause she already deals mixed damage
if HoR DK just made her a phys dps
honestly it would be really funny
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
ok
stop with the bad takes
tet you're better than this
40 point diff?
i mean she doesn't blow that hard
when was the last time we even got an assaka
assaka?
i mean s0 HoH vs 2s1 HoR
between the 2, like s0 vs 2s1
what's the score diff?
i think you can prob retain on like bella with HoR
i mean even in nirvana
instead of releasing whole new weapon we have to pull for
i preferred when they revived old valks by giving their weapons (that we already had) priarms
<a:Whale_luma:458386265776193536>
we gotta pump them out faster
and s0 will be at 1500 atk
5 more dk revival
we only need like
nah
poor nyx
now that v2v released everyone using her trying to prove a point
everyone hated her before v2v release
she's been working overtime too
she deserves it
she's pretty
why not
she won't be getting one but she should
now nyx deserves a DK
her bosses are still hers in abyss
like yeah she sucks at MA but it's not like mihoyo cares about MA
does she even need a dk
oh so it'll never happen, ty
besides SD from teenager -> milf
like ever?
does augment change typing?
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
aug dn
to keep the hype up
so they're doing another one
mihoyo heard all the commotion about psy ice
right now! it's susannah S-rank psy ice dps
when will i get to use my mobius in wolf again mihomo <:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
damn yeah, HoT + SpA way better than HoH + IO
owo math 47760 + 39706
owo math 47552 + 39746
are we higher
who cares about abyss
i'm talking about MA here
last time they were all with fuxi and i <:Deadge:958122498019434496>
SpA wolf refs with sirin
are there
SpA wolf annoying though
those 2 MA weeks actually pretty easy
<:duduL:889133920950575114>
that's why i play MA instead
lmfao y'all fucked
oh i see what's wrong with the rest of the patch
what's wrong with the rest of this patch
calm down LMFAO
last week
patch literally started like fucking
wtf you mean how is there 24 days still in this patch
same importance
with the side quest
the one in kolosten
there's a dog
yeah i can follow
something something catalyst for someone's humanity!
i'm joking i actually really love monsters inc
no, shit movie
keep up
the one from the moon
next year's kiana letter will be from the moon
smh
i already told you, we don't have those fancy elements
<:TeslaThink_rein_lum:884598403982557194>
the best kind of honkai infection
i just really really really think they won't LMFAO
i mean i think they def could make a new himeko suit from captainverse
or in zzz whenever they reveal it's still in the same multiverse and we have to act surprised
or hsr when it releases in 2025
himeko's dead, go meet her in genshin 5.0
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
think wendy/himeko will have new battlesuit
but not even i
i'm on copium that like, aichan tesla einstein jackal will be playable
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
wendy?????
yeah maybe they add a new element in the future
we only have phys lightning and ice
yeah we don't have those fancy elements in honkai
oh you mean pyro, the genshin element
what's that
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
will release a-rank in 2023
you think mihoyo
lmfao
if you pull for 9s
yea actually you can get pretty poor in sp rank patch
owo math 150 * 150
owo math 280 * 76
yeah that's how you spell that
owo match 280 * 75
idt
it's not that expensive
heki in 6.8: damn i spent 280 pulls on v2v and still didn't get her
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
my tranquil arias
i'm gonna use
damn this kiana sucks - using coop dk gun
dw
LMFAO yea he'll just build pity on v2v
and then the valk
heki will spend into pyramid scheme
no
the ones left are the ones who have high resistance to bullshit
have already quit
the people who would care about it
nah that's impossible
skip all 3
yeah if all 3 are on the same team i'm chillin
actually that's fair
first round of expa is all new valks
yeah, just
who cares at this point
fuck it just make 3 gacha s-ranks
LMFAO
and then i get an uninstall button
poor third
the third
cause like 2 of them are getting released on big patch CNY with global anniv
who's getting shafted LMFAO
that should be on 6.4
<a:pepeMeltdown:933941237021569035>
god we're so close to cny
3 pathces?
2 patches?
in like
how soon do you think we'll get those
or if the game's not ending soon, and they're just ramping up the shill cause they feel like it
if the game's ending soon, and they're just ramping up the shill to milk player of all they have left
i dunno what's worse
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
look at the game
i mean
fu hua?
i removed it for less confusion, thank me later
yeah that letter is obsolete
oh
yeah the green haired bitch
cause she's dead i think
plank sp valk
yeah just give them aponia-sized booba and CN playerbase will be too horny to complain
that's just PE
jixuanyuan?
ai-chan, tesla, einstein, jackal, susannah?
who are the girls in the game we don't have playable yet
end of life
who cares
just use the models already in the game
the less ideas they'll have
the closer we get to EoL
just a matter of time
we'll get tesla, we'll get einstein, we'll get jackal
we'll get every valk with model eventually
i unironically think
lmfao
no, fuck fgo
to commemorate
yeah they'll add tesla valk and to ER at the same time as wotan reaches 100%
good one
cause you won't be restin
then you better get some heart medicine
nothing else
only new valk of the patch added and new weather to shill new valk of the patch
will be kept on lifeline from now on
hot take but i think ER's done for
yeah
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
:blindcat:
i think i'm safe
but i already bought some AL from the event
i'm at 308/162
<a:Whale_luma:458386265776193536>
yeah then i can spend AW freely
oh wait sheeesh
only missing 5 + JK now
in other news, i'm getting closer to my plan of levelling every valk to lv80
thank you nini <:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
holy damn
so i'm safe
issok i heard nini is topping up on my acc
yeah
so as long as i buy out the frags, even if i get JK card like week 2 or week 3 i'll still be keeping up
i guess it probably doesn't matter too much for me, i'm prob not using JK early in the patch anyways
if i save too much, that's unoptimal cause AW is better value spent than saved up
i'm more worried cause i'm trying to minmax
we get a fuckton of AW per week
if it's the same for the SN MPE box, then i should save up AW
kinda late in the patch
but iirc the FR box was like
so i'm pretty sure it's just the same thing
last cn anniv we did get FR box
i'm pretty confident we will get SN/MPE box
i dunno if i should count with the AW from it to buy JK or not
do we get SN/MPE box day 1 of patch?
no bridge today <a:kree:809653433455214632>
but 1-3 only opens tomorrow
city opens oct 6 from the bridge event
also this is such a bait
my tona rolled impair so me lucky
i used PE but i dunno if it's optimal or not
on the event you mean?
i dunno
i think after 2s there's no big upgrades
it's good but not broken
yeah +10% ice damage for team
idr
roll for a card = 2s1 <:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
isn't it 3?
only 2 jk packs?
don't get baited <:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
42 pulls
owo math 2100 / 50
10 frags is
a lot
that's
SR skin waiting room
483? hell no
gresham <a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
can't wait for me to -200 and be the only disappointment LMFAO
so many people doing so many great feats this cycle
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
yeah it's not even a meme, it's just a femboy fishin
<a:gaylaof:1002644777822597241>
imagine not having asterite
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
but i don't win
it's definitely the p2 part
well
my worrypat is p2w
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
yeah apparently cn player threw a fit over the one survey about making male character playable in honkai
which is the one thing that tells me who's mihoyo shilling next
now story is back to what it was to me
issok i had fun keeping up with ER
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
and i'm like
yeah and then when it first released in CN people were like oh don't worry, it's not as confusing when you actually play it
for better score
just do it better 4head
that sounds about right
i'm like giving my best to understand and it's jargon over jargon and i'm like uhhhhhhhh
yeah i know right!!!
<@370438895965306882> where's my coach <:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
went all over my head
trust me, i tried reading ch 31ex, there was some shit about dreams and stuff
both is good but normal human being doesn't have enough time to bald nirv AND keep up with lore
sheeesh
carv climbing the ranks, from lorelao to nirvlao
i'm so proud
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
holy fuck
i think aponia is supposed to be easier but i can't say
cause it's so bad
when i say 696 cap you should be hearing 632 for normal human
like irl cbt
mobius 696 is actual torture
like i'm gonna be honest
yeah but it's really close so i snuck it in
s0 aponia is also 696
s0 mobius is 696
yeah she 680 wolf
yeah probably
or 888 with fps scam
2s1 -> 3s you go 856 -> 872
on 3s bke
cause like
i can tell you it's most likely either 696 or 712
do you want me to go look it up?
cause i'm not 9s
i mean i go look up whenever it's 9s stuff
i'm not sure if 3s HoT gets a second or more over 2s1
3s da is 712, 2s1 HoT is 696
i dunno
what the fuck
spin -> ult -> spin?
if you don't have cb19
what the fuck do you even do in this boss
oh shit it is heki
that looks like heki
i wonder if iriya's vids are all age restricted
i need more xtal
needs to be longer
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
come to nirv to sleep
upgrade mats are reeeally easy to get this time around
i mean if you only do 2-3 days of daily 3, i'm pretty sure you can max everyone
if you're doing the daily 3
you'll get enough mats to max them all real quick
upgrade freely
and it was pretty hard but i'm pretty sure you're not supposed to rush it that bad
cause the autochess one, i finished abyss day 1 of ch3
i dunno how well i can judge the difficulty tho
yeah that one was definitely miles harder than the next ones
i thought you were talking about a stage or smth on this event
oh yeah
chess one?
yeah it's piss easy
skippin the emblem tho?
yea same
you can buy out everything but red lenses from the shop
also i'm pretty sure if you do like only 2-3 days of dailies
you deserve it, too powerful, i knew you had it in you from the start <a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
i'm so proud
congrats on that score
also holy fuck nini
PE funds
<:PogU:996348304818446337>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
i can't believe it's not jk!
i made a rentry for jk cons
<>
imagine thinking
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
and i'm taking a 680
account for that
i'm bad at the game
but
my HoH kneecapped
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
but you have s1
unga bunga it is then
i haven't tried abyss yet, i'm saving it for tomorrow during class
HoH does not feel like a herrscher, even with elf
i do agree, though it's from an MA perspective
LMFAO it wasn't meant as slander, i wasn't even exalted on HoF release
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
or were you just RL player
did she really
must whale
2 herrscher of the year
i mean can you blame them
that one is not my fault
next patch trust
i'll get it eventually <:cry:944955259636285481>
literally everyone and their mothers tries at PE cycles tho
2s PE
and try to t10 myriad with like
wanna pilot my acc
so you can t9 right behind me
i'll t8
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
so i have upper hand
and i only hate half of those
fgo and doom, 2 bosses people hate
this week i should have a fair shot though
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
cause i'll be missing more and more stuff
yeah
cause like now as time passes it'll only get harder to me
i wonder if i'll make it to t10
oh you meant your investment on v2v
true
i still wanna try some weeks
yeah me too, honestly
are y'all sad you don't get to compete or happy from the freedom LMFAO
yeah what's the vibe check on honkai getting too expensive
<a:Y_PepegaCredit:792811182364819477>
<:meditate:666837440178290708>
is like distilled, pure you
to me, the person you are on discord and other media is generally way more important than your physical self
i live in an enlightened state, you see
LMFAO
no
doxxing can get p scary
oh you'd be surprised
<a:aworryHacker:825452499511017493>
cause if it's the first i'm doxxing you
i guess that's a bad question to ask LMFAO
is that your real name or did you pick it because of pokemon
yeah it just looks/sounds weird for the language
now i'm used to it though
i also thought it was extremely weird the first few times i read it
yeah carv makes no sense as an abbreviation for portuguese speakers <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
alexa play TruE (ed. version)
despacito
that looks more like it
2s/2s1
then she topscores but HoT is in the team
if you have >2s DPe
then HoT topscores
like, if you don't have 2s DPe
she's also t1 in husk
s0 HoS
tank she matches 7s MPE
pig she matches 2s DA
that is wrong even for top scores
over FR
in abyss you run AE
she's also used on wolf
imagine being addicted to balding
have you tried dealing more damage
check the new copypasta i posted over at <#966951722129961010>
<:cry:944955259636285481>
what side are you guys in
<:kianacryhic:893824029549527081>
what must i do to pay off my sins
<:cry:944955259636285481>
gresham it's been 6 months
no joke tho, IO rank ups are so disappointing, she's another nyx in terms of rankups
pretty sure without the bug, SpA takes the lead
yeah, with the bug IO was better
assuming 2s SpA
don't you run SpA on type wolf even if you have s0 IO
unironically love aka as a boss
just run it more often
i'm fine with AKA being the only SpA boss
still mad over it <:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and then last second they went sike! 4th one!!
mihoyo made a 3rd one
though it is really funny that we had 2 abyss husks
they made up a weather on the spot that wasn't supposed to exist
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
but husk was especially bad because it was clearly a mistake that they decided to just not do anything about it
makes us do our own refs instead of copying CN
boss schedule changes every now and then are cool, even fun
i mean it's fine that we get something that CN didn't get
i mean it was the right weather, but it was the wrong boss, i'll not put it up as the weather that it's supposed to be on my spreadsheet
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
it literally wasnt that
i refuse to put it as type counter husk in my spreadsheet
v2v boss is typeless, like bella
also how often they showed up
there u go
which is when i started keeping track
of all the bosses that showed up ever since start of 5.1
i have a list
but if you only care about t1, that's it
MPE actually has some sick t2s in 3s MA
yeah that's a brain issue lmfao, not otto fgo, hod fgo
oh
p straight forward
and otto fgo for PE
for MPE
3s MA for top score is only tank
thank you for the info
okay
uh
oh god
heph has 3 phases???
what boss you fighting
third??
<:pepeW:996346590086303805>
though getting away with BKE sure makes it sound a lot easier than how it actually plays out
so it's not thaaaat bad realistically if you're aiming just for retain, can just get away with BKE probably
yeah
cause like even in nirvana before, IO vs BKE was kinda close, you could definitely retain some lobbies with IO
that it'll be a big score gap
i don't think if HoR's taking HoS
but on griseo you could at least run hekate pri and get away with it
it's not even that it's way more expensive
yeah it actually is
IO i think
3 farmable valk team in 2022
yeah i'm expecting 9s HoR team to take back HoS then i think
nuts
for the ult
i mean still tho
yes
which is like, only matters for HoS boss as far as ice teams care about i think?
3s JK does have specifically hitcount shield stuff
very powerful <:pepeW:996346590086303805>
2s does actually look
there u go

gimme a sec
i guess i can write it myself
moriso didn't do the constellations at the bottom of sushang page
not coping that she'll be better than HB at s0, but 60% sounds insane, that's like sp valk at a-rank levels of gutted lmfao
also do you actually believe s0 is 60% of 3s for JK
just so i don't have to run turg cat
i'll keep using HB instead of JK
i dunno i'm still fucking scarred
you just <:Deadge:958122498019434496>
if the stage doesn't give you a fuckton of sp just because you're meant to use v2v there
that doesn't surprise me, that v2v scores trash on 3s kosma
i see a 528 with s2 <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
owo math 440 * 1.2
i can check
it's a fucking canyon
808 at 2s vs nyx 776 at 3s
i just checked, HoT really does outscore nyx on tona
what the fuck
stupid
actually
HoT scores t1 on:
pig, wolf (-1), bke, husk, kosma, tank, tona

t2 on:
HoD, heph, otto

doesn't score on:
jizo
maybe DIS?
i prefer Dis
the rest i said it properly
the first time was typo
3/5 of those are literally don't have 2s of that gacha valk? use HoT anyways
wait and on kosma too LMFAO
DPe HoT PV strat only outscores just normal HoT at 2s+ i'm pretty sure, after the bugfix
actually, after the bugfix, s0 DPe, HoT outscores
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
s0 DA? HoT outscores
s0 DpE? still use HoT on HoT DPe PV team
2/5 of those the answer is HoT even if you have the valk
the thing is
i mean
<:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
she's stupid
unironically the only boss she doesn't score at is jizo
t2 in the other half
she's literally t1 in half of the 3s bosses
if you mean MA
no competition
HoT
9s MPE - 872
7s MPE - 856
9s HoF - 856
2s1 HoT - 856
oh sorry i said misinfo earlier about HoF on tank
but i imagine she does well on tank, prob matching HoF or a bit above
her TF kinda blows and her damage windows are not great for MA
she honestly barely feels like herrscher for MA
yeah thank you
yeah i dunno about HoH in MA
i dunno of HoH 3s tank scores, is what i mean
i mean ik but even then
dunno if anyone tried it out
with hepha tho right
have we had tank after HoH release
2s1 HoT team, that is
i think 9s HoF scores like -1 from HoT team
nope, not even at 9s
mpe is top score, HoT is -1
no
poor fire
just start running fire dps on all-ice team
that's actually really funny
LMFAO
soon we'll get a new phys general support and then griseo will be bleed support lmfao
everything will be viable as one extremely specific niche
honkai with 28 valk meta is going to have 28 bosses each doable by one valk and impossible by all other 27
no
we're getting close
wtf
lmfao
can't wait to use my SpA - says tet, on a random cycle (not SpA's)
where you using your SpA LMFAO
what
w
<:pepeW:996346590086303805>
and then i play her for like 5 minutes and go
wow i haven't played her in a while! i can't wait!
everytime a boss of hers shows up i'm like
i think i have stockholm syndrome for her
kills off your braincells from inactivity
she's cancer in other ways
well
so pick your poision
DA and BKE are equally pretty bad investments
honestly, how things stand now
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
hmm i mean, i guess if you're going to invest on TP soon, no reason to go for BKE gear then
LMFAO
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
whoa wait a second
card for 620 xtal on ER, AF for +10 atk, she's close to useless otherwise
if you have a 3s 4/4 TP i prob wouldn't invest in BKE at all at this point
do you have like a good TP
if it hadn't huodou color palette i wouldn't know wtf that is
can't even read wtf is going on in that image
honestly
nice
and so much sp too
whoa she tanky
have you tried dealing more damage
but i want another try at jizo, and maru is cool
depending on how cbt huodou is ofc
that actually looks fun
unfair.
<:lewd:959737567119556618>
<a:KaguyaPanic:701189401148915832>
don't do me like that
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
NO
yeah i don't doubt it
now this is living in 2018
gresham's emote are so pretty
and not trash valk no one even talks about anymore
good times, when HoV was a sorta bad investment
and MPE i guess
literally her or HoV i think <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
back then it was like
nowadays we have 35 different ranged valk tho
on ranged tank, strat is you use ult just to refresh charged bars and switch off
yeah charged attack off bike
she was my only ice, my only mech and my only ranged
through early exalted
so bad
HoR carried my ass
it hasn't stopped working
and when i pick a solution, i don't change until it stops working
look when i got to exalted, HoR was literally my only mech valk
oh yeah i run HoR on that one
wait what's that about my acc
yeah
nini do my abyss
actually now that i've said it out loud, that doesn't surprise me, that's literally the reason javascript exists
my code in javascript somehow runs way faster than in python
<a:terigrabhic:709594728039055390>
what am i taking over?
i see HoH B and i go crab?
now every time i see HoH M i go shit that's baban
i forgot half of us were using official art as pfp
good times
i just thought you had the same newt 3 times <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that makes sense actually
oh i see
i'm not the one dreaming here, gresham thinks he has 3 HoS
LMFAO
???????
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i have 2 crit, 1 general atk, one mech atack and one sp right now
i have 5 for affix
i'll never salvage a newt
you take that back
almost there to 9
oooh 6th newt
now watch me cry for crit later down the week
bad choice acquired
i only have mb
i don't have fullset yet
do i need 2nd dickens m
and one more
4th zhenyi b, 2nd himeko m, 2nd verne b
i'll get rid of uhhh
it's been so long since i salvaged stigs
OH NO
OH GOD I ACTUALLY GOT IT ON FREE REROLLS
i'm fucked LMFAO
and have no phase shifters for 6.1
and then i'll max it
dorm exchange sieg m come home
someone hold me i'm about to make bad investments
oh no
so yeah it's an HoT boss for all intents and purposes now
3s DA can 712
2s1 DA with 3s sirin or
2s DA with 4s sirin both can 696
2s DA with 3s sirin can 616/632/648
2s1 HoT can 696
oh i can answer that
nqn is fucking dead
<:HoSWhat:819229176971526155>
what happened?
i missed it all cause i was flirting
so much talking
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
didn't magery match his score
on abyss? or MA?
like on 3s bke, he's one of the only players who go for the 872 with 9s, but fps scam can 888
but he doesn't
if he fps scammed, i'm pretty sure he'd go for fps scam caps too
he always goes for cap
he's not i'm pretty sure
that's so fucking funny
<a:bloodlao:959706412685099038>
LMFAO that emote
yeah it's let's fucking go - catgirl edition
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
oh shit i didn't notice the blustorm
congrats <a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
who just joined and got to nirv holy fuck
whoa a new person
<:lfgCatgirlEdition:803114454187114506>
shits useless lmfao
no that's eden1
i'm eatin -200
fuck this shit
i'm not doing this abyss
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
eh close enough
you have to ask nicely too
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
me pleb do best week and t25
cause you lao
yeah but youre about to t10 <a:kree:809653433455214632>
surely it's not that bad right
this blows lmfao
and i'm like t25
with all boss combineds
i'm 3 secs off cap
god this is one of my best MA weeks
kosma's about to
i'm going to bald kosma <:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
i am unable to
what no, i wouldn't and i couldn't
that was equally as funny
i thought you were just verifying human parts
OH you're talking about HoH stigs
verifying my v2v
yeah that's for babies
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i want it as a sticker
is it in <#963280001900376064> already
that's incredible
LMFAO
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
i dunno if i'm balding or not
what bald
turbolao
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
giga lao
no you're insane at the game
do i just suck
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
cause i still spent like half an hour on my 856 this week
like BKE is easy but not that easy right
that's unfair
okay
owo 8ball should i try to save the 1 second on kallen
sheeesh!
but i do the same for MA so i can kinda relate LMFAO
and truly, i don't, fuck abyss
i would say i don't get it either
it's the grind mindset
jesus y'all fighting on a whole new level
those are the 2 differences from 856 ref
does mean that timing is tighter since he procs PV qte earlier
856 ref does no qte on first rot of p2, which has the same issues, but no such issues for kith ref (also higher damage)
but tradeoff is that kith switches in PV on transition way earlier, which means he gets HoT qte on start of p2
switch in -> weapon active can be harder to do asap
qte -> weapon active -> combo is piss easy
which means harder inputs
is no qte on p1
only 2 like big differences
just the 856 ref but with no klein
yeah it's literally
i think you can do it gresham
yeah that doesn't look that bad
i guess it's like literally the same thing but less damage
oh wait
BKE is not that bad generally
have you tried
like it's the same thing as having no stig at all, something like avo M would be better too
yea fair
cause like rn it literally does nothing
even lv35 should be better than an actual useless stig
cez m?
beet m
it doesn't stack, something like ppm or anything else would be better
wait <@291907279291285506> why you running 2 paga M on kallen
i can see if i can brew something up
what score are you at?
<:ohnoBubble:378931467956256768>
share ref? i can see how hard it looks like
i've never tried it
i'll touch that boss later today
thank you gresham
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
your damage <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
it's skin issue on SS
i stopped at the very end of 5.8
i was doing RL dist but
<:TeriNotStonks:1009441195673538642>
<:Stonks:668331960430493696>
we goin up
nirvana dist ever since around beginning of 5.6
marco M should be way better
and even then, you'd rather put that on a support
paga M is for shield and unless you're using her on kallen, there's no shields around rn
not the paga m
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
just waiting for a ref
yeah no use to bashing my head
something's fucked up going on, even with that i dunno if i can 1 rot the mobs <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah that's pretty big but
yeah check her skills to level up the important ones
sheeesh
oh yea your SS is 2s right
dreams come true
in my life
another big buff i'm missing is gresham
that's a problem for future me
maybe that helps
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
wait i forgot to ult on SS
the tech
whoa
wait is mpe supposed to be using paga
the last 4% actually unlocks 50% tdm or some shit
i'm missing 2% phys from dorm 2% phys from dk
i mean my phys dorm isn't even that far from max
what's wrong with my mpe
LMFAO
for mobs
2 fucking rots
literally would take
abyss kosma is a problem for future keilo
i'm done with honkai for now
cool
wow i do no damage with mpe
lemme share with y'all my score behind the snipe
sheesh retaining
so
to not be rng
but also a little too bullshit
to be rng
like they feel a little too consistent
i don't wanna bald for those last 2 seconds
cause they feel like rng
rng
attacks
p2 kosma
are
keipleb
-2 0 -1
not that bad
-3 0 -1
yeah
-3
owo math 552 - 504
so 80 points = 5 seconds
each second is worth 16 points
yeah
i guess -5 on kosma of all bosses isn't that bad
-5 -0 -1
so i'm -5
owo math 552 - 472
with the 20 dorm cards i used
yeah i got it this spending event
yikes
what are you doing
and then that's 30 frags, i'd only need 9 more to 2s2
5% chance of getting the right one!
owo math 1/20
and then i have a
<a:NervousSweat:765639934555324486>
i think i need 2s2 ch for this
fischl dps
fuck
i might not have damage LMFAO
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
i'm now doing it too fast
it's actually so inconsistent for me, it'll take a while
no, after
and then dodge cancel after that
right after CH QTE
spam FT qte
you need to
so inconsistent tho
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
fuck no
now just need to get the score
i figured it out
with the powers of tenma and vaff combined
where's vaff
fuck it i'm asking the lolicon
but it's capped at 120
well more like 90-110
i'm at 120fps wdym
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
kills my run
just that qte
on everything else
i literally match his timing
i put our runs back to back
yeah i fucking know right!!!
bastet on kosma
yea is what i have to use
is 3s like ult deals ice damage and also we fixed the qte, fuck you
is it rank diff
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
he doesn't stall
to fucking keeb
tell that
maybe if i do it REALLY fast
keeb doesn't fps scam
i dunno my fps pretty stable here
<- desperate
skin issue maybe
then it's 893 LMFAO
and if i don't do it too early
for some ungodly reason
then the blades don't come in
if i do it too early
what the fuck
game actually literally functions differently for keeby
how the fuck CH qte works
i actually don't know
but i did have a lot of MA with 3 2s boss, just in masters instead
so i never had a week of exalted without 3s boss
literally first week of 5.1
i broke through
god i'm so smart
and see where i'm slow
and play it alongside keeb's run
i'll record a run
i have an idea
5.1
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
i miss no 3s boss per week
i miss rimestar
dunno how to spend less time on CH on qte <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but i uh
i think i'm spending too much time on CH on qte
help
<@385655541248163840> lmk if you still need help on ma bke
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
you sell off your sanity for relatively easier retain
it's a fucking deal with the devil
yeah that's true
take a nap?
honestly what do you even do while waiting until it does a collapse move
LMFAO relaxing boss
18k and slep
unironically
i think i'm
i think i know what's the issue
have you tried finishing the boss
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
t50 rn
295 in nirv is like
LMFAO that's a fucking riku quote
he's a doggo and shit
yeah the thing that sucks is that kosma looks cool as hell!!
if one attack has the same tell as every other attack but has a different timing that's just awful awful design
if you have attack tells, they all should have the same timing
to me, that's just straight shit design
but at least pig doesn't lie to you
attacks with extremely weird timings for absolutely no reason whatsoever
yeah it's just like pig transition
cause it has the tell way too early for no reason
you prob just dodged early
yeah apparently kosma's attack timing is way wack
here is the difference, for <@385655541248163840>
if it's purply with blocks, it's a qua attack
if it's the usual pink shine, it's a normal attack
you can notice it by looking at the visual tell
yeah, only certain attacks are quantum attacks
<:A_HuMonkaS:803498875444396072>
gdi
keiloraptor [will suck dick for crit] is too long
i need to go back to my roots
gimme a sec
what's a cock wave
this is fucking insane LMFAO
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
LMFAO you're funnier than me
complain -> get score true combo
where's my damage???
she's legit getting new moves what the actual fuck
don't do bke at 4am
write a creepypasta
i'm about to fucking
but i went immeidately to sleep
soryr i got home a whiiiile ago
oh shit
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
really showing their true faces
LMFAO
yeah new valk can score 47k, pretty broken
31k good score
who says
so you're the maincord person
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
wow is biri here all i see is blocked messages
*block*
real low
then your standards are
okay i see how it is
%
usually
what you placing at?
no ty
cause this week is cbt
this week
just not
i could try one week actually
yeah right
those are, uh, different gamemodes you see <:Nerdge:792504573830496306>
idk about MA kosma
abyss kosma
neither of those matter this week do they
worse gear will amplify my want to end my life
and my kosma score is like 47.2k and it's cap LMFAO
as soon as i realise i have no damage for 946
my excitement will go <:TeriNotStonks:1009441195673538642>
i'm a crack addict i need my hit
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
finally going home now and then i can do MA
holy fuck i'm so hype for MA
do mine 946 next
idr which
on some boss
darius did an LE dps ref recently
can't read that as anything else than LE for real fischl
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
on tank she matches i'm pretty sure
like 3s BKE, FR support instead of GD is 840
she match score or -1 on a lot of rot with HoT
FR is actually p nuts still for 3s boss
just take the bullet and farm her up
and now that i am i still use her every now and then
like literally when i started playing i was like eh who cares, she's going to be powercrept by the time i finish her off
and she's still useful
that my 3s FR is like 6 month late
it's because of shit like that
i dunno, like i don't like the not farming x valk cause she's getting powecrept soon anyways
that's an epi move
uh
2 weeks until my 3s hb
who else you 3sing first
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
you should 3s all sp valks, think of it as prio rather than whether or not to 3s one
<:Deadge:958122498019434496>
sorry i'm going back home soon
i can in like... 5 hours
<:pepeW:996346590086303805>
i know by heart cause
9.2 -> 12
2.8%
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
and i'm so glad
he really fucking did
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
it's such a good emote
i got ruby hooked on the <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
oh shit 2023 is close
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
2023
when my JK is going to be ready by fucking
hey where are the people making fun of me going for 3s hb
cool
so you need a good amount of higher numbers if you're taking any field time at all
HB takes 0 field time
at s0
it's kinda hard to outperform HB, even if JK gives similar numbers
i'm guessing like around s2/2s JK needed to outperform HB
isn't that expected
incredible analysis
so easy
duh
just hit 300 times with you nyx
cata info line
LMFAO
<:duduL:889133920950575114>
go on then
oh ok
for 🍛
i'm just asking nicely
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
wait who tf you muting
yw gresham
which is actually a charity act
we're slowly retiring gresham
she does actually
thank you gresham!
given that you're so willing!
i'll let you play (not v2v) on my account

s-senpai
i forgot about it i think i'm fucked lmfao
yeah my gaming mouse is lv35
my score is shit but i haven't seen any lobby where that doesn't +100
i'm a little salty
i'll just use lv35 tesla T
i wasted phase shifter to max holmes T and still not t5
i'm not gonna fall for the bait
i dunno if i can spare the phase shfiter
i have it but it's lv35
we need tesla T for this cycle?
bad ending
fuck that crab - ely
i think i'm just going to 4s dudu
probably not
can't wait to farm JK for the rest of my fucking life

<a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
gresham new pfp

786 sounds pretty far from 2s1 cap
what rank is your HoT
LMFAO -1 fiesta
lore accurate
smh
poor ely
nothing special dw about it
oh no
that's the number
.....
that's
oh
but i think with my rank i should be scoring like 840
i'm at 778
guess it's not more fun than what i'm doing
huh
than what i'm doing
it looks more fun
what are y'all scoring in RL
ty for curry
<:worryGibCurry:433117130339123200>

<:pepeW:996346590086303805>
4 dk raids this week
i need to do
+1 anyone?
not to someone stupid like me
only raiden's degen now
it took way too long for me to find you on my friendlist
sorry i'm stupid
both raids?
anyone wanna do raids
damn
you suck at the game
if you have PE and are in RL
like ruby said
mihoyo gives no shit
<:WhalePat:959797131198230579>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
just in general
i'm lonely
so it means tet is the youngest player in the lobby
it's actually based on UID
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
cool
next cycle sucks
oh
look at my current trophy stonks
893 is free but
yeah i don't think the 946 is possible without klein
me too
i can try some stuff out in a bit
yeah i'm not sure actually
hmmm
is it klein that's locking you out of 946 heim
huh
done, beat
oh i'm being beat by 1 second? alright
i wish i was this lao
jesus
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
it's the gamemode that matters
beat them back in MA
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
LMFAO
ty carl
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
also answer me in solstice
don't care enough
yeah i'm sleeping with my 749
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
still 7% diff
owo math 467 / 502
467k with hb ult
oh wait i think i'm stupid
375k without elf ult
i'll try not elf ult to see what damage i get
elf ult like 5 seconds later, still 432k
how do i even check for that
is elf ely somehow falling off?
i'm going insane
howww
where does it come from
where am i missing damage
wouldn't translate into 16% more damage
like 16% ice damage taken
right?
into 16% more damage
that translates
there's no way
3s hb is like 2.7% ice damage taken
where can it even come from
16%
am i missing
how the fuck
like
how much damage i'm missing
that's
owo math 502 / 432
spend more or quit
yeah this game fucking blows
i'd be an awful sensei at this point
i mean tbh i don't need purple anymore idt
yeah
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i would
if i could convert 1 red lens = 1 xtal
i have 1100
and i really don't need red lenses
if you only do like 3 days of dailies you can buy everything but red lenses out
but also
need 12 days of dailies to buy out shop
you should start sooner rather than later
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
yeah i'm kinda upset on how easy it was
yeah i'm doing fairsky transition myself, just works better for me
oh yeah did you see fhem transition? it was so cool!
is making every MA ref talk sound like every top player in honkai is trans
the only good thing that 3s boss brought to the game
no
s0 just blows
boss feel balanced around s2+
yeah we're getting at temps where
this is just me being madge that my damage sucks
nah i kinda want to s0 gaming too
not worth it <:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
that's how much it'd cost me to s1 HoH
owo math 41 * 280
damn i suck at this game
for abyss
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
what's a good s0 score
so cool!!!!
it's fucking sick
i've ever seen
the 917 jizo is one of the coolest sim battle refs
parvati
<:KevinPeek:658443365364269057>
another scuff pig incoming
now it's only next patch
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
i could've gotten 2s1 DA before 3s pig
also if i had saved my crystallum instead of buying out the BKE stamps
next patch i'll max the neb finally
.9% tdm from the last level of neb <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and like affix gaming? <:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
i'm missing 2% from dk, 2% from dorm....
where does one even get that much damage over me
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
5.4% more damage than me
fhem deals
owo math 385 / 365
better luck next time
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
no 4s dudu for 3s tank and no 3s hb for 3s hepha
i don't like trying to unscuff a setup
nvm i'm bored of this week
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
if i capped i could actually
don't think i can beat clicky tho
i kinda wanna beat riku for the memes
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
my hepha scores sucks so bad
prob my worst week in a while
-3 -2 -0
is wrong with honkai players
what the fuck
and left
did 5
joined
they fucking
nvm i found a rando
someone left during 4 so i need a carry for 5 and 6, is anyone up? <:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
<@370438895965306882> stop texting and driving and help me with raids
gresham texting and driving smh
i love it
LMFAO that's incredible
holy
LMFAO that's so fucking cute
had to finish off wit cat dps LMFAO
killed my HoH twice
damn those main stages got hands
ooo that's p good for SK
idgi
literal 5 mins on pc
aw cute
wait is someones birthday today?
ayy just like seele!
i'll keep it to be safe
well yes but i might need 4th undine to pri it into a third pta
doing 5d chess with myself
whenever i reso weapons for torus i'm already like
i don't even reso stigs anymore
nini professional liar
at all
i don't think i have elemental affix
god i also forgot about that
maybe you can get away with elemental affix on griseo only?
for SK
i'm sorry then
oh
make her ult cost 125 -> 114 or smth
kinda nuts if you think about it
3.2 per stig you can get to 9.6
yeah like, as high as you can get is best
to use that in SK
but yeah what i would do is just roll the dupe T for elemental affix
that's why i'd prefer to use it on T anyways
i do think i prefer having more spcr than having more sp/s
eh like
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
for abyss SK
dupe ss is for elemental affix
ooh nice
but i wouldn't bother about it until you're locked out of a score you wanna achieve because of it
is prob one of the best uses
high as possible
and i dunno why
yeah it 100% does
ooo i see
but they can't be vice of all of them LMFAO
like everywhere i go they look like they're like a big vice or something
are they lumina? solstice? caféquanta?
beefyeggroll from
where is
might aswell do 100 pull on adv
turbo whale
though honestly for like
yeah that's some gacha addiciton right there
your reasoning dumbfounds me
is it even worth it to not go for 100 pulls on it then??
jesus that's some whale talk
i guess it's only one more adv until 3s
is that even worth it? does it do anything at all?
2s2 right
you'll get like
are you?
fuck no
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
i think carv had issue matching damage with s1
with 2s1 tho
even without klein still pretty easy
i made this for carv the other day
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
so ig it is easier than heph
actually heim with HoT is piss easy
than tank heim
i think heph is way easier
also
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and now i'm not even capping cause i suck
like t30 or some shit
i think my ranking would be fucking awful already
even if i cap all 3
also damn everyone is turbo beating me this week
it can be cleo B
it's so bad
the 946 with HoF is actual bullshit
i did the GD one
newt B def works
i don't think it's cleo B
oh why you running that
and the acc is bound to his stuff now
chy hard quit
it is now his account i'm pretty sure
i mean
clicky is running chy's acc which was sona's
i think right now
you're so lucky!!!
gresham said hi to you
woah
but i'm not balding
well it's closed right now
is true!
i mean i do bald right next to an open window
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
is there anything more attractive than that
trying to get a single second
to play 8 hours in one day
i am attracted to the bald
~~kinda hot ngl~~
clicky balding his ass off on 3s tank
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
i want to use it all the time
<a:NervousSweat:765639934555324486>
i prob shouldn't have spent 8 hours last week on the 946 in the laptop which was legitimately like 3x harder for no reason
maybe i'm too far on the other end and need to accept some stuff as actual hardware diff tho
you either quit a keilo or play enough to see yourself become a imy/iriya
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
yeah i'll tone it down
LMFAO
hmm?
yeah LMFAO i'm slowly becoming imy
meanwhile i'm like so here's where you can go faster oh so it's just hardware diff? i physically can't go faster
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah and then he complains about people like danten/lunari
<:Stonks:668331960430493696>
which is cool, aponia skin with no aponia
also i'm getting aponia skin i think
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
but i do need JK gear + SoE before those banners go away
like i can spend on some random bullshit later on the spending, i don't need 4s dudu asap
this is fucked up
i can probably splurge if i don't get lucky
sounds... not very possible
i dunno if i can make another 18k in 5 weeks
i'm at like 18k right now i think?
ideally i also wanna spend 36k for 4s dudu
maybe i can suck some dick for money....
i mean i want JK gear + SoE
lowkey wanna roll for s2 HoH rn, try to t10 and quit the game LMFAO
i'm so pissed i dunno if i'll make it to everything i want
istg
i'm so done with gacha
i thought they were just starting select banners early
is patch just 5 week long then?
oh
it'd be funny if it was
is JK gear available week 6 of 6.0?
wait it does?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i can go full f2p no pull and prob retain a4 until the end of the game
hack my account and ban me please
take me out
i wanna fucking quit
SoE is day 1 6.1?
wait
sheeesh
oh LMFAO
lmfao
jesus wth is that beet
<:Deadge:958122498019434496>
i can't imagine s1 has damage issue to 893
if s0 has enough damage to 946
i mean ofc but like
i feel like with s1 you should have the damage for 893
but like
with avo TM newt B on HoT tho
cause apparently HoT GD FR can 0s even at s0
maybe there's a better TM around
cause i dunno how good handel TM is
maybe with better dps stigmata
i mean i lowkey think it should be possible
yeah that would probably do the trick
oh that's so little though
i wish i could try out with less damage to try and match to see if it's possible at all
oh hmm yeah i dunno about that much damage missing <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
but yea 840 is already a +1
maybe you pick up a candy or positioning on jst
so you can try a bit more and maybe you find more damage somewhere
i tried again just now and killed from weapon active instead of finisher
like from heim positioning and stuff
hmm yeah you can try a bit more cause there is some variance on damage
also i used ely elf
you should kill on finisher with s1 but if not, can at least still 840 from finishing it off with combo after all that
i almost kill on weapon active on dragon but i'm 2s1
switch FR in -> elf active -> FR evade charged -> dodge heim slam with FR -> GD QTE -> HoT QTE -> weapon active -> combo -> pause for sp pack -> ult -> weapon active -> finisher
rot is pretty simple
i think 893 is possible
what's your HoT rank again?
okay gimme a sec i'll see if i can work something out
do you have beet B
do you have bella B
lemme try some stuff on training
what do you have for HoT
and then something like zhenyi TM bella B on HoT for enough sp to ult
gpn on eden
like run jst newt on FR
think you can even without turg
i mean i lowkey
is that heim
what the fuck
press more buttons faster
let him keep banging his head on the keyboard
step down
i'll just
i'm getting mad at riku LMFAO
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
2 weapon 6 stigs
not even close
for next patch
am not ready
jesus fuck
owo math 23 * 8
phase shifters for all that??
and i'll need
god
<:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
so much stuff
though i dunno if i'll have enough cubes for 2 new weapons next patch
just skill issue
tbh i should be always doing that, same with buying dk mats with AE imaginon
i'm buying them with dk mats now i guess
jfc
that's fucking stupid
10 per patch?
our income is something like
yeah but even then
of old fucking age that is
i'm going to die irl before i get enough mindstones
how the fuck do people even farm those
i'll need even more to 4s dudu skills
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
just bleed time like there's no tomorrow on p2 for no reason whatsoever
i think i'm somehow damage diffd too cause i do p1 fast enough for the 880
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
but that's the best i can do for now
which is still a bit late
ely ult on p2
if you use it really early you can do second elf ult at around like
weapon active -> charged until it dies
switch into HoS asap -> weapon active + elf -> spear -> dodge + chains (pop clone on) -> SI qte -> ult -> switch HoS ult -> (stall a tiny amount or else MPE qte doesn't proc) -> MPE qte -> charged -> weapon active on weak point -> dodge -> ult
i do
with slightly different opener
866 is possible
i was able to 853
all my homies hate krieg
fuck krieg
so doing with krieg is prob just way more tight or smth
to get BD off
i think BR is faster
40 mins
that one alone took me like
it was!
the LE BB HoH one
that one run was actually the hardest i think
733 or some shit
i got a good like
for the maru vid
hey i used with HoH
lmfao
or mobius
yeah i just use mine with PE on 2s boss
woao
i use her every week
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
there's also HoT strats for 893
if you deal too much before ult = <:Deadge:958122498019434496>
cause you have 4s sirin
also you might need to throw some damage
i think they changed heim
try the second one actually
LE BR HoF
you can do 893 with like
i mean no klein no rc you're eating an 893
please
buy me 139 hb frags
gresham
+0 <a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
i like did 3 tries
i got 8th i think
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
only making s1 HoH better and better
we're going to 470 dist
skill issue
i missed it
before the sushang slaughter
but i just wanted to have some fun
i think i clear 1-2 minute left with mobius
ayy i also cleared like 2 seconds left LMFAO
ssg
oh you cleared it first try?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and done literally anything else
oh god fuck this shit
and went
i'd have tried it once
if it was me
i mean i understand that but
and she'll die thrice over
tona will look at nyx
why would you run nyx
and then i was hype for doing more FR
cause i like FR
for fun
FR PV AE
i did FR on side stage
:(
wait we run GD?
sushang breaks people
i dunno how much weight but 500 y/o in the body of a 6 y/o is yikes
i mean it's certainly has some weight
100 if you check the right websites
yeah i'm just confused
i can understand the motives behind it
cause like loli bait is loli bait, prob makes them money and shit
i mean i do think sushang situation is weirder than theresa
why did you do that
i'm judging the devs
i mean i'm not judging if you simp
she's 15 but
- she clearly doesn't look like it
- doesn't act like it
- no one treats her as such
- not even the community
i honestly have no clue why they made it that way
she has the body of a 15 y/o, allegedly
15 y/o with booba the size of taixuan mountain <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but she kinda already does
was gonna say that she was about to piss me off in story too
gj mihoyo
multiple sushangs to piss me off
sushang pissing me off in multiple ways
<a:peepoLeave:646986909381558273>
i just want my t10 and be done
i'm so mad a mihoyo all of the time
<a:EggGive:941637222103416832>
is what you're saying
in multiple ways
so i was an egg
makes pretty cgs just to fuck us in the ass repeatedly
fuck that company lmfao
i'm cold quitting mihoyo after i'm done with this game
stockholm syndrome /\
sushang legit my least favorite abyss boss
fuck sushang
how did that go
oh yeah
making us all fucking hate her
to put sushang boss right before sushang release
it's actually a really brave move
you know
i'm either all in or all out
i'm never playing honkai 15 mins a day
i will and have stopped when i stop having fun
is that addiction
<:Shrug:616394597211439118>
like i just play while i have fun
i could quit whenever i want <:TeriCopium:969281688414875728>
i dunno if i'd call my honkai experience addiction
is internet addiction
the only addiction i have
that sounds wrong to me LMFAO
but to masturbating?
and that's bad
i get like porn addiction
can you even be addicted to masturbating though
who cares lmfao
like if you want to just do it
no, stopping yourself from masturbating
like at best it's net neutral
i don't believe that it does any good
oh hell no
share ref? LMFAO
i'm just bad
i try it every week
memorial arena?
what challenge
i've tried it a bunch
but you actually lose time if you on demand tf on ult on HoH
like i dunno how they fucked it up
even ruby's in the memes
LMFAO
HoR had insane time fracture and time slow stuff for the time, too
for a herrscher especially
and she does have pretty bad tf
just how she feels
i mean i'm not talking about powerlevel again
lower damage but still same score
but 2s/3s are still around and still cap
s0/s2 strats are gone
as far as i can tell
they did fix it but it's still top score
which is a lot more tf
and HoF has tf on black holes too
on demand TF from ult is actually never used in MA cause it wastes time
and her damage is a lot more consistent instead of in bursts
HoH has kinda shit TF
herrscher is always like explosive, big damage and good timeslow and time fracture
it's more like a vibe
i'm not talking about power level
even with sushang
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
PE feels a lot more of a herrscher than HoH
ngl a lot of HoH doesn't feel like a herrscher
i dunno if that counts as taking over, maybe for s0 player assuming s2 HoT?
808 with fps scam
and the HoT DPe 9s team already 792
v1 JK  9s SW was 792
(3s HoT doesn't change cap from 2s1)
well that depends
none ya business, what are you, a cop?
HoT stonks just grow exponentially
3s DA 712
2s1 DA 696
2s DA 664
s0 DA 552
2s1 HoT 696 pig
t1 in 3s pig
HoT is officially
x
satisfying
her charged attack looks and feels pretty cool to me
she's lowkey kinda fun
<:MeiKnife:647104199406125100>
you're mean to me = i'm mean to others
i'm griseo i absorb stuff
learned from you
L
oh
maybe even around optimal for 2s3
is like pretty alright
1 cmdg line
i mean
you gotta beat that
mine is actually like 1520 or some stupid shit, it's so bad
last 3s tank
i got a 786
it's quite big
i can definitely feel the damage diff now
i also had 2s griseo before
i got an aight score with 2s2 or 2s3 last tank tho
BKE also wants a lot of cdmg
kinda blows tho since FT runs all cdmg
after 3s she runs all atk
before 3s i think she runs like 3/3 or 4/2
she gets more cdmg on 3s
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
when i got it first try on my sister's pc
i spent like 30 mins already trying to get the 946 heimdall on it
i actually hate this laptop now
me bad at the game so lost tie
if i got the score earlier it'd be my first t10
skill issue
i t11 last week
i'm not
but this is training mode so i dunno why i'm balding LMFAO
i could maybe 866 with v good crits
nvm -2 on tank
damn i love crit bald!
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
-3 on hepha, -3 on tank, just end me
from no 4s dudu
i think i'll have to eat -3 on tank
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
when it is not strictly necessary
i was waiting for senti to yatta
i figured out why i'm losing time on tank
i'll turn it down sorry
wait is it that loud
wow this is really easy huh
not the other way around
they made huodou so they could shill star of eden
no
good job
i'm so fucking proud
also <a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
go down a little bit and see me barely miss t10
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
since HoF doesn't have any 3s bosses anymore
and i guess we'll always be able to
can use HoF on kasumi = all is well
not that bad
that looks
...yeah
yeah
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
hope we meet
oh sheeeesh
blustorm? what's going on there?
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
bastet even has some on M for somer eason
oh god, asterite?
the forbidden source
what's
those affixes holy
jesus
that's not a lot diff
o they do
ana is aight
well peary does
newer stigs give more atk
it's stupid
3s ma is 14/13/13
2s ma is 54/53/53
also jesus fuck
it's just minecraft math
but for 3s ma
because not only are the numbers weirder, they're also inconsistent
it makes sense
and non uprate 3s ma
i mean for ss MA
i see
instead of doing +16
memorising each score
are you
600
i know how to count
oh
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
5 left
that's a score improvement
wow! so mean!
cool, they're cool <:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
yeah, remetic right
they're in blustorm
i know your cadet
hey <@704867526877904908>
if both weapons had uses
i wouldn't think it's bad
i mean lowkey
that sounds like a sick deal
they would've announced by now too
i'm pretty sure if there was any other deal
they already announced free 10 pull on sushang gear
yes but i'll say what i say about everything else along those lines
i think
means you can craft one if you have mats saved up
prob week 2 or week 3
i dunno if SoE will be there day 1
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i don't think they're able to learn lessons
i have 0 hopes on mihoyo
eh i mean
DoR is better burst
i imagine that's like
i see
timestop doesn't matter that much for HoR?
that's interesting
oh lmfao
too powerful? too shill? too soon?
are they?
though that's just HoT is i guess LMFAO
for different damage thresholds and rankings
5 slightly different variations
yeah doesn't help that this boss has like
LMFAO
time to lose 10 postions in MA t100
okay abyss closed
lmfao
not deserved
this is
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
\> no beet b
\> says doesn't need to care about fuel
that is funny
LMFAO
are nyx aka and HoH
my only s0 vakls
i'm like a substar scammer in recovery
yeah
rest are s1/s2
only mobi PE
HoT doesn't count
literally am not
:whalepet:
wow
there's a rentry link too with it
and came with similar numbers
me magery and coffee did the math separately
yeah way back then
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
so do the math backwards
that's the number i remember
you can craft a g3 from scratch per patch
ooo ic
how sweaty is your bracket
sheeeesh
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
LMFAO
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the week before JK
yea i'm gonna get my 3s HB
a lot of excuses actually
also running 2 sp lines LMFAO
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
me sleep
2s HB
elf skills not maxed
i have my excuses
oh if you feel like you're near capped then i'm sleepin LMFAO
fire!
the bronya one
<:KianaDumb:909232418052014171>
so it balances it out
but i'm also only 6% ice from dk
i'm 17% ice 6% tdm
missing 4
<a:terigrabhic:709594728039055390>
gotta score higher if you're rankscamming
<@370438895965306882> <:wavekawaii:590500669119660053>
made up from plebeians mind too much
but he doesn't want to run it
i came up with a 733 for carv too
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and i tell people to not throw away dupe crusher
cause he got fucked over one week for not having it
theo to this day still tells people to not throw away nue
i'm just becoming theo
no joke
dupe crusher saves lives
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
yea that's scary
i thought that was be for some reason <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
o wait no that's dudu
bd for some reason
well
<a:Monka:465018118608125953>
a low score for 2s at rl
that's
<:Wow:759857863848886303>
2s1 running 2s1 strat for husk
2s running 2s strat for HoD
s0 running s0 strat for maru
this week i haven't substar scammed at all actually
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
imagine substar scamming
SW strat way less bald too
kinda crazy
on 3s husk
matches HoT DPe 9s cap
SW with JK 9s
apparently
i've done it before LMAO
dw it doesn't matter for this rot
mine isn't either
try getting ideas from thsi tho
yea, only go for it if you can afford both
but i wouldn't go for it if it emans you won't be able to get JK gear
if you can afford it's really good
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
oh
3* ely elf? can prob follow the 600 strats
jesus christ
literally like t10 all 3s
holy fuck this myriad
i don't think so
velskud? lumina player, i've seen them around
you can probably push that a ton by optimising gear phases and stuff
what are you running
ely elf is actually insane
help eli sama
i'm getting skill issue LMFAO
doesn't let you use xtal for levels past 70 i think
i mean i think you can but mihomo doesn't let you make bad choices
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
where's the option
<:peepoMad:598607365167644692>
leaving us at lv96
huh so they really are
but now it's automatic
i wasn't even close to the 744
just used to it
for fps
was kinda slow gears
fastest try
okay sorry
i think i'm getting gears at like 1/5 rn
okay i'm doing this
fuck i failed so bad
but it's pretty bad
it's not that bad
728 so ez tho
and narukami marks them
her QTE hits the gears
but when she gets to the ground
and goes in the middle
so that HoT qte aims at husk
before gears
before HoT qte
at like 1hp
you have to leave husk
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
and failed on sp pack
i got one possible to 744
you have to go so fast
is so bad for 744
gear phase
is cbt
husk
also this fucking
story ends in 7.0
2 herrscher left
we don't have much time
one day i'll get it LMFAO
i'm 66/150 for 2s2 HoT
it'll show up eventually
i mean
<:A_HuClown:795116510636408852>
mine isn't
closer to 2% fire ig
if those 2 are the only options prob s3 AE
i think i changed my mind tho, mobius still clears faster
yea kinda close kinda close
it's a different suit of a different valk with a different typing that deals a different type of damage
close!
i think i found a new ER love
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
nyx powa
that's for sure
a different 946
this is
more damage than me
LMFAO
wtf kinda s0 is that
it looks fun to run shit like holmes HoS
i wish i was whale to 9s stuff
lemme watch
fuck that's nuts
holy fuck
already lv80?
no way that's tet's alt
whoa
what the actual fuck
it's actually so free in this pc
trying a bit more just to check if it was a fluke
not worth the investment smh
and 840 is 2s cap
cause 826 is s2 cap
813 is s0 cap?
that's kinda nuts actually
(i found out about a higher scoring ref)
i was -1 -1 0 before, got 1s on husk, still -1 -1 0 LMFAO
who would've thought
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
-1 -1 0
LMFAO
i'm not
no 744s, which is cap
me, felicia, patpat and kaslana
oh there's actually 4 people with 728 on husk right now
the animation of HoH leaving field prob got slowed down a fuck ton because of pardo ult
and still on field = no switch cd reset
i think she was still on the air going away when chy used elf active
and the valk you switch to go down
she phisically switches out, she rises up in the air
when a valk switches out
i think it's because
all of them do it, i've had tons of problems with klein actually
that one looks especially bad holy fuck
though
it's kinda bs
if you're too fast
that actually happens a lot
this is nuts
i guess
to 744
now
i join the 2 other people in the server who have 728
what the actual fuck
it's for those not sane
in the medical sense
insane
is actually
okay this ref
nvm this strat is fun
holy fuck
is to run homu M
real reason to 3s valk
i need more pick up range
i wanna equip 3 nirv emblems
<:peepoRiot:598608041990029313>
husk isn't fun anymore now that it has sp pack bald in it
not all brackets are 20 players, they can be less if they don't have multiple of 20 players in nirvana
not necessarily
what a shaaaame
i don't have xtals for the stigs
oooh noooo
oh
ofc it's RL tho
i'm gonna be honest everyone talks about how thick it is but it doesn't look that bad in RL
she has margrave issue built in to the valk
i don't think she wants spcr at all
it's prob awful on JK
so this is another -3 week for me rn
on husk
just found out i'm actually -2
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
sorry am f2p
i'm -1
like if i kill on :44 but i can kill on :45 with my setup/ref
i can save
amount of seconds
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
it is time
i've been in magery's shadow for too long
i really like magery <:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
yea this is healthy rivalry
you're next
magery
still pleb
<:Wow:759857863848886303>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
my first s0 946
unironically
that doesn't actually give me any rankings but it would make me feel good
and then if i get +1 on HoD
that's 4th
if i get +2
that's 5th
if i get +1 on husk
now time to steal 4th place
LMFAO
husk is like lemme instagram filter her ass
let me reset
the ult is literally in sepia
like i can see that i failed to break all gears
god i hate that i can't pause during time stop ults
still better than my own
rimestar actually tanks
yea this pc can't hold max fps even on those simple ass bosses
i mean i guess i fucking deserve it after how much i've tried
i got like home buffs
????
i did it first try on my sister's pc
what the fuck
not gonna spoil
she's pretty
i like the hidden ely
pretty cute web event
this is actually
rank scammer
<a:DuckNO:1015575573801734214>
LMFAO
trade?
i got 2 boobnias
wtf do i do with dupes
keep it pinned so people remember
web event

<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and give us worse than s0 valk
here's how it feels to play 3s valk!
mihoyo really goes
69
<:2woggers:658553078420602901>
like in feet?
so many people at s3 LMFAO
damn iriya is s3 ely
jesus
gresham ref? <:hypers:1013399732250488932>
the refs ig
cause i won't have damage either
so i can feel bad
share?
it's going to be the best budget
i mean yea probably
o ic
you deserve that
ana for 6s?
is that
or BKE
jesus
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
beat me, destroy me baban
i believe in you
try harder
but congratz <a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
no lucky
sheeesh! i tried for that
kinda nuts
decimates hit count shields
with hekate just like
i mean rn it's more griseo fault
o i see, that's cool
<:Sip:506622496259178507>
she's not bad at 3s husk
but she's still t2
7t dethroned her
she matched and still does aponia
SW kept her ground for a while
y'all talk like that
i mean
since they <a:ppPoof:933892036296343552>'d the HoT Dis strat
it's prob new cap
and actually
that's +4 over 2s HoT cap though
aw that's 3s SW
that's uh
whoa wtf
LMFAO have you learned celine's true nature yet
i can use whichever whip you want~
<:elywhip:1002644839248183306>
work harder
you too
<:elywhip:1002644839248183306>
work harder
that's not t1
then cat is?
what even is GD using here
it's p straightforward
t1 is top 1
t10 is top 10
t100 is top 100
i mean
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
gogo t1 myriad
o nini got 9s team now
why am i so bad
i've been trying for so long
skill issue city
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
maru 893 on the leaderboards
i'm the highest
they're the ones talking about it
idk
who are we awaiting for free?
here
a pattern
i'm starting to see
do shit faster
which is
i got lux coaching
i just suck BALLS
i'm so fucking close
faster hands
can sell me
anyone
lmfao
somehow more damage than cat support
shit's impossible i swear
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
sheeeesh
but idt it matters
i use it as soon as maru spawns
is not more damage though, that i know
for some reason
it's faster
but fragile says
headshot i know that doesn't
elf timing
yea rn i dunno anymore if it matters or not
KR is prob the hardest switch and active to do clean here
press buttons faster
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
why do i coach people again
now you're gonna beat me on all my other scores
damn
<:2woggers:658553078420602901>
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
buffs don't catch if you do it before
i think
after maru spawned
o also remember to only use elf
lmk how it goes <@370438895965306882>
with no beet b
how to 893 maru
i'm showing gresham and neko
is the charm
2nd try
lmfao
turbo crashed
discord
i'm gonna try to stream
for your setup
i figured out an 893
yo <@370438895965306882>
is that the diff?
maxed jst M
i just don't have
pat even has v similar atk to me
and i dunno from where
i miss 1 whole hp bar
o yea i dunno what's wrong with that strat
893 is probably easy mobiusthinking
what are you running
in like 1/3rd the time i capped HoD on the strat i was doing
spent like 6 hours earlier today trying
skill issue throughout the roof
946 is impossible to me
wrong fucking person
oh
show them how you really hack
just to fill leaderboards with 32k scores
unironically want to hack
hackers don't know how to play the game
damn game is gonna be dead by the time we get 3s JK huh
like the rest of us plebs
just wait 1.5 years
i mean she is farmable
herrscher of dupes
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
yeah i got 4 dupe weapons
maybe that's score increase
what score are you at rn
irene pv
poverty strat <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that's like
try this?
though i guess you don't para husk too much since it's like iron body often
3s GD is so fucking big is insane
with 2s GD
i mean i dunno how well you can score
<a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
you rolled for s2 HoH, so it can't be that
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
how much cheaper
that should 728
with turg GD zhenyi PV?
2s0/2s1 HoT 3s GD 3s PV
HoT GD PV on husk?
you're running the
it's pretty bad
50% fall
and that's like
at the last 4 hours
i literally fall like 4-5 spots from t8
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
does MA after abyss closes on sunday
like legit 30% of population
here in global
how slacc CN is
idk
kiss kiss
that week looks fun
nice!! i'm proud
wooo <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
impossible on my machine
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
i was going to ask for coaching cause
i thought you had done the 946
waow adori whel
waow
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
me not abyss player
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
also crippled
i'm at 1405
i'm higher atk
whoa
cause 2s HB
in ice abyss
dunno if i'm competing or not
and i think i'll stick to that
i got my .94 sp/s rn
prob a good investment
yea especially if you have like 7t and mobi
before JK gear + SoE
i wouldn't go for klein
<:WhalePat:607373633056407605>
ic
you pulling klein next patch?
and i think that's my only goal left in the game
like i might unironically t10 this week
congrats
i saw the luccsacc on the elf sheeeesh
both good strats
or just retire tbh
now i just pray for good luck next patch
i think like 49k + 10 or so cards for s0 4/4 + 3s elf
a lil bit above average
in the past it only had 60 for weapon, i dunno if they're changing it to the 200 one or not
like 200 guarantee
disgusting
this is actually fucked though, i knew them and i still feel bad over what happened
have to try harder
what!!!
everyone just no u's me
wait i do that all the time, where are the males boasting how good they are to me?
i think
i'd rather fucking die
they deserve to get paid
okay honestly the dms open for vents part
put this on your bio, it's proven to work
⌜eh, why are you here?⌟
⌜don't stare at my bio! idiot...⌟
⌜you liked it? um, thanks, i guess...⌟
⌜i'm not red at all right now! you're seeing things!⌟
⌜stop laughing! s-stupid!⌟
holy fuck
are you actually? LMFAO
just bad hands
and i have the damage
i got really close
4-5 hours today
spent like
obviously i can't
i am too pleb i think
greshamlao
the 946 on maru
were you able to do
<:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
not like <@385655541248163840>
s0 gamer this time
<:peepoThink:598607301334532137>
with HoT on sus
can i retain nirv
okay so
i wish i was good at HoT
<:pepeW:996346590086303805>
we only have lightning, ice and phys
wtf is fire, go back to genshin, we don't have those fancy elements here
+pat <@370438895965306882>
game doesn't reward paying player
we didn't get any 2nd core right
but idk
maybe i change into HoH now
i just go cool! morb time
i think people do
they tell us what changed now
aw cool
so i have to figure that out
and while i did cap the 792 strat, i should have enough damage for the 808 strat on HoD
fingers too slow for 946 on maru
still a lot to improve
i'm using it a lot now to figure out how close i am to cap on 3s non-uprate
i got a spreadsheet with all scores pinned if you want
also because of rounding errors
each second is worth 54/53/53 points
and in 2s non-uprate
cause of rounding errors
each second is worth 14/13/13 points
in 3s non-uprate
each second is worth 16 points
in 3s +20%
maybe
hmm
owo math 119415 + 32 + 14 + 53
so i can get another 32 + 14 + 53 points
i'm -2 -1 -1 rn
<a:Smoge:825136707095101441>
me -1
me no cap
wait
me cap
whoa
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it's the worst elf of all time
if it's ice damage
mistranslated
it's
might be wishing well diff
....
but looking at that unlocked M
i hope it's no weapon
dw
below nirv gaming you can get away with 1300 atk
or like .4+ sp/s
21+
i only lock like
i wouldn't lock either there
i prob should've done that i think
because of the free cards?
what the fuck
fhem's already outdamages mine by like 10%
character is barely out
so no competition, really
cause 2s PE
my HoD is free
<:cry:944955259636285481>
you have the 946
no you don't
another i have the damage, i just suck
i suck at the game, 946 is impossible
+fund
yea sure
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
for couatl ball
cause my main zhenyi T has fire ice dmg
for affix
maxed dupe zhenyi T
i unironically
and zhenyi ttmbbbb, surely it's useful right
now i have paga tttmmb
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
i got off with 3 KoE, 1 KoRa, 2 paga T, 1 zhenyi B, ely stigs TTMM
in equipment
i dunno how lucky i got
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
and ask for it in armada
just do the dailies
if only someone predicted that
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
because of it
and WE is still better than elf ely
i fucked up my elf skill prio
go do the 946 on maru nini
go for 3s1
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
jesus
finished my last dorm trial
just <:Prayge:909232418463047690>
i should get everything by end of banners
yea if i get avg luck on everything for 6.1
i had 57k + 14 cards
i feel like shit
like even when i get lucky
yeah
i'm just done with gachas i think
but holy fuck
i think i got lucky
<:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
retirement
cause i'm living in 2020 still
wow shui pog
and then i go
all the same teasers
and they just reused
if 6.2 was sushang sp
it would be very funny
v3 they go SoE banner is 100 pity, fuck you
<a:teripoor:838366314924867625>
it is the cost that worries me
it's bs
add SoE it's just standard S-rank patch right after herrscher
coming from herrscher patch, it's kinda bad but ok
JK only would've been like p expensive, but less than avg S-rank patch
yeah it's actually so bad, it's so expensive for no reason
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
i hate it here
just get lucky lmao
i'm jumping ship
but if i get even slightly unlucky
i can afford everything
like if i go avg on everything
which is why my plan is that
yeah that's what i've already accepted
the value is too high
it'll keep my HoR and SW team competitive, and maybe improve nyx team too
like for me i think it's giga dumb to skip JK gear for any reason whatsoever
yeah
with how slacc it is
prob even retain nirv
and ping pong nirv
you can easily go for HoH + skip JK gear
i also think like if you like HoH
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
i mean yeah i fucking hate it LMFAO
the choice is p clear to me
or skip HoH and go for JK gear
like if you have to choose between HoH 4/4 and skip JK gear
i mean i'm not even saying JK stamps
in 6.1+
you'll have a good HoH for one patch which will get outdone by other's
that feels like such a waste
and then skip JK gear later
but i dunno if it's worth it to go for HoH rn
like for non-meta player sure
hmm i dunno
is going for 6.1
i think the better choice if you can only afford 1
like even if spending event blows
yeah i dunno if spending event info matters much either
getting HoH in 6.1 isn't possible though
on 6.1
and then even her team sucking
than going for HoH
and then have SW + HoR team invested
i'd rather skip 6.0 bosses
i've already accepted that skipping JK = competitive death
i mean the thing is
basically
HoH is the first to go if my luck sucks
highest prio for me is JK + SoE + ely elf
i go for 4/4
and if i get lucky on that or avg
i go for HoH + weapon
or avg
if i get lucky on elf
my plan rn is
am i even pulling <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
now the question is
just barely, all planned
i have enough to max HoH 4/4 on release
i love that it's so toxic
please
LMFAO
owo headpat <@370438895965306882>
this week for sure
just like me in honkai
i don't deserve one
ooo i see
Who streaming
👀
yea i should wait too probably?
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
if i go for HoH + weapon and can't afford stigs
yea i might need dupe liu qi
so i can get away with 1 set
and HoH copium right
liu qi is prob only useful for HoR
like uh
sick me skip i think
calm down child
6.0 isn't even done yet
no
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
they're dreaming of butterflies and HoHs
my bracket is having deep sleep
i mean yea i'm vibin
like for a3 a4 peeps
cause i swear it wasn't that bad before
since last otto
did dist go up that much
is interesting
<a:NervousSweat:765639934555324486>
not enough
which is
i'm 56k xtal 7 foca 1 expa i think
i'm so not ready
LMFAO psycopath behaviour
LMFAO
they come up for literally every ice boss
you see the fucking bullshit
they fucking hate ice
y'all think mihomo dislikes fire
aw it's kinda sad though
LMFAO
that's fucking nuts
whoa wtf is that story
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
literally everything
as opposed to
yeah
like 7t + zhenyi
usually new gacha dk comes with stigs on banner that, if you're a whale, you already have
since you arguably want the stigs from that banner
though debatable for SoE
is new gacha dk
best use of dawei
i've said it before
oh yea that's fair
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
riku i think
<:RaidenShh:874306830032076830>
forbidden knowledge: newt B isn't the only piece of the set
nuts broken
shuijing was fucking
yeah when you think about it
i guess that makes sense
o
the other use for bastet B is for newt T bastet MB strats on BB for MA
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
wait full bastet in MA?
just interesting
i'm mobius enjoyer
i barely use cat in ER
i mean i have no clue
i thought she ran ana in ER
wait SW stigs is BiS for cat in ER?
is for cat dps
basically the only meta use of bastet B
yea, full bastet actually
so if it steals freeze from you = reset
but one of the initial mobs has a bomb that freezes
cause you need to be the one applying the freeze for bastet buffs
like mobs are actual hell
fragile and some people were trying it over in solstice
bald as fuck
apparently it's
ty greshamlao i trust your words
yw
idk whats wrong with it
sometimes it tanks and runs at like 5
sometimes it runs fine at like 50fps
i swear this laptop
right
+100s
this for sure
okay
heki moment
yeah 6 per equip piece
out of maxing your weap
you're going to be sakura will locked
uh
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
you can beat that in nirv with s0 PE
awful score for 4/4 PE
that's a fucking
nice
without dudu elf
to group them
HoS spear or smth
just gotta like
yeah positioning on them is fucking awful
fair
that's
i'm jelly
in a4 and below
wth everyone running ely
you surely can
it's only 2 points
a3 gaming eludes me
beat their ass
go back to maldin then
is slacc as hell
even my nirv rn
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
time to wake up
<a:DinkDonk:827000774093176872>
global too slacc
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
mihomo 6.0 to my cope HoH: hah you thought
hello?
why are my brackets so slacc
okay are the mihomo gods playing pranks
ty for the boo message patch notes
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
5?
how many you buying per week
one month?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
holy fuck mihoyo
for this to happen
the kinda shit that needs to go down
like i can't begin to imagine
that's a only for a while
to me that's not a not anymore
for bs like that to happen
the sheer incompetence at play
like i can't believe
how the fuck does that even happen
that's so fucking stupid
yea i was going to post that
in mooost instances
but should be better
is just harder to manage
last week
for 3s BKE
baban's turg
where turg
likeyl gear issue
FR can 840
HoT without GD isn't that bad
quite slac
that's
i'm interested in how slacc the slacc gets
did you get
what scores
are you having issues with applying it
o
but it feels good to use
i mean the crit rate blows
i like it
is it
i don't wanna play much during the week
we thinkin this enough for +100?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
so i can kill the mobs even if i miss cez B/dudu elf application on one of them
i have 2s PE privilege
try the fairsky opener
it isn't halving your damage
yeah that might be it then
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
to disable carole qte
remember when you had to change the game to CN
2* dudu?
o
time
<:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
need more damage
for mobs, the only damage that matters is PE damage from ult
and ult cdr
all it does is more dudu personal damage
4s dudu shouldn't matter
just forced FT BB CH stuff if they do it in a phys week
it's kallen lite
elemental options for SK
there are no
a tech option mihoyo decided it's a bug after 8 patches because this time it's too strong
but to me, it's just
which i guess, is true
cause it's bug abusing
cause apparently people aren't running it
dunno if you can get away with running HoF as a support
she's pretty tanky
what's the vibecheck on carole cez B
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
if i get HoH that week i'm cappin'
pe ez 946
ft ez 946
SK is piss easy tho
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
i mean i just wanna put money where your mouth is
for the take
thank you toe enjoyer
for this fight
also how important is 4* blade fucker
people be fighting the boss for 4 minutes 50 seconds and going this is fine
bicc score of 12
this is 2nd place btw
but i don't have tp
i'd give you my acc so you can try
are you nirv
wtf is this cycle
17
they scored a whopping
that's t1 in my bracket
and she stays on field during ult
beet M only activates after carole leaves field
hmm you sure beet m is the best pick
fucking 4 patches of summer
we'll get another summer lite trust
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
next patch is summer too
dw
who even cares
they just went eh whatever
i really like 3s PE skill
yeah i'll apologise to rei
i'd rather die
to dia?
just trying to follow rei
i mean ik that's the case
i'll just vibe here
i'm going to have a stroke
o yeah i lowkey thought they were kinda stupid before
have to get 4 dodges in transition to have barely enough sp to ult
it's kinda insane
it's so fucking tight in sp
without 3s PV
is literally impossible
the 856 rot
but you can get away without it
it's actually bicc important for a lot of 3s MA strats
yeah
else you prob won't be using her
if you have her gun
you only go for 3s eden
like the thing is
yea
for flexibility
pardo is a good one
thank you carl
bonkers broken
like 3s eden is fucking
you have invested
prob just depends on what team
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
2s2 for the extra sec of tf on ult
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
wow the self cope
even if i do like SN
yeah i'd rather it be like this than otherwise
so
SN
she was released before
i mean
in that case who cares
but i realise now the only way i'm getting 3s SN is if she becomes farmable
i was like but closer to 3s SN...
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah alr you convinced me gresham, i'll pick the AW too
so start
if you don't start
yeah it will take even longer
ty carl
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
just get it
sn....
but
cause SN is useless and mine's already 2s
i guess i should take AW
<:WhalePat:607373633056407605>
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i'm not picking AL from that
i'm safe safe
6.0 event has 50 AL as reward
oh nvm
which will be barely enough to buy her card, maybe buy frags
which means i'll have 468 by JK release if i spend nothing
i think i get 78 AL per week
7 frags away from 3s FR, but i'm also at very low AL, kinda scared kinda scared
finished 3s ely and 2s BN today
idk wtf is wrong with her
she do be just using full himeko
for the asterite weekly thing
nah this is the trial valk
???????
1200 attack
max pri
wtf is wrong with their trial units
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
unable to get the full value of
that you're literally
they're selling a product
that's kinda fucked up right
yea same as me
so capping xp, i'll still be at 96
86 + 300/10k on xp cap
and i think i didn't miss anything
i'm at 86 rn
this patch?
to lv100 bp
is it even possible
where free pulls
both releases look really fun
6.1 kinda stacked
holy fuck
her passive still applies but with no cd or smth
i mean it looks like when JK dies
jesus fuck LMFAO
with SoE
an 0s maru
there's also
like just from free stuff + pala bp
1 per patch i think
not false
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
but fuck me
i guess i can be proud on being the highest 3s sirin on rankings
got turbo fucked for having neither
if i had either 4s sirin or 2s1 DA
i'd be 9th rn
i tried
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
like mihomo cares about MA
you talk
real safe too
sp on that rot looks
ouch my knee, lemme take a nap
and then you freeze and it goes
after p1 it goes ohohohoh i'm about to do some shit
ice rpc is so funny
<a:darksideslap:786450895378317342>
i'm poly, baban <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
wdym taken
<a:ShyBlush:741636455289323521>

pleb just proud of shit score
<a:nou_hh:833500436526530570>
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
in hell bracket
if i would've promoted anyways
then i'm proud of myself
if yeah then i'm chillin
would've i +100'd in yours though
smh
choose to get an easier bracket next time
skill issue
maybe i can try to get all bosses at <-5

really easy
and it looks
oh sheesh SoE can 946 too
HoH s0 can 946 maru
fuck
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
o it actually does look fun
is next week fun?
trust
is cheating
anyone with a higher score than me
those 3 seconds are humanly impossible
i am giving up
parvati t100
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah i'm gonna get banned before the hackers
help us on our goal
i wanna give up
for elf ely
but i'm saving adv skill mats
i need to max my dks so bad
but i'm also missing 1.5% that too
ig it doesn't matter
she's not burst mode right
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and 2% from dk
i'm still missing 4% from dorm
if that 10% is huge
i mean
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
in the hiscores
i'm the highest 3* sirin rn
<:Madge:909232418379153418>
out of the strats that score higher
sirin locked
i think i'm unironically
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
and it's so fucking long
it's so fucking boring
30 second long transition
to make a fucking
it was a good idea
who the fuck thought
that is pig
this dogshit of a boss
to fucking despise
i'm starting
memory issue ig
i thought i remember them malding
really?
wth
i beat chy?
smh
should've gotten luckier when picking a bracket
is legit 59 seconds off cap
t100 cutoff right now
MA is kinda dead huh
but still
i mean yeah i got my 750 by banging my head on the keyboard and not following any ref
hey!
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
i assume so yeah?
this enough to retain?
i'm annoyed wit this fight
everyone sleeping?
wtf is wrong with my bracket
less of damage
an entire hp bar
i'm doing
there's no way
like i must be doing something wrong
idk wtf is wrong with her
my DA legit deals s2 damage
can you share some ranks please
what's your DA rank
3 left
i dunno why qte no proc
escape k u escape k u escape k u
<:pepeW:996346590086303805>
fair
i'm streaming worst boss of the week <:Cool:914206939817324564>
but still
oh wait rl
jesus
JK: have you tried gaining sp
weird
it's just
and it's not like she benefits from having double the amount she needs to ult
cause like under normal rotation as a support she doesn't stay on field enough to gen that much sp
and you can't even say it's op or anything
i actually still don't know why her sp gen is like that
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
than eden
that she's better at using eden
kinda funny
there it is
,liqu 3
what was the one
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
me when it's ice abyss
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
there's sakura kallen back there too
the ones who've been forgotten
waow
there's more up there
oh shit
that's clearly cut cause lili's there but not roza
the full image later
they're prob doing
yeah
aponia/eden situation
would be fun if they're like support each other and share field time evenly
ty carl
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
i mean the battlesuits
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
like MC and BB
kiamei will be
god when are we getting substar rankings on t100 mihomo
damn
nvm icefire is non-3s too
in the total t100
i'm the highest non-3s DA
i just noticed
hard string of patches <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
a real dumb move for my acc prob
that sounds like
don't think i wanna skip JK though
my tiers will go based on how lucky and my xtal amount are
tier 1 - i get everything (hupray)
tier 2 - i get 3* elf on avg or early but unlucky for HoH + weap, then 4/4 jk + SoE
tier 3 - i get 3* elf unlucky, skip HoH entirely
i'm going for 1 or 2
yeah that makes a lot of sense
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
if i can go for HoH or not
and then decide after that based on how lucky i get
i think i'm gonna pull for 3* elf
if i get avg luck
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
everything
i might afford
but i dunno
<:shrug:877047647511384064>
so
and 2 cards for valk is like 100 pulls
like pull amt
like i'm assuming avg is similar as valk
i dunno that's why i'm asking
for a good meta valk
it's really really cheap
did you see how 7t go
nor elf
i dunno how's dk avg though
my HoH card avg is lower than normal cause i already have some pity built
for like avgs
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
do these numbers look right
that's funny as fuck
but i didn't know the backstory
i know people called him lzh or lzx, don't remember which
LMFAO
we need to step our game up
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i guess that makes sense
o i see
that's complicated as hell
wth
look at the size of that name
mpe got fucking shafted
lmfao
useful to look for refs and new players to know whos who
so that you can search a valk or abbreviation and figure out who she is and CN search terms
but i wanna shape that up to a site later
spreadsheet is ugly
but like search terms would maybe be more useful?
i guess battlesuit name i can figure that out
what do you think would be more useful
hmm
i know some
fill out the important valk CN name
<>
can you help me
ruby
<a:darksideslap:786450895378317342>
ty carl
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
no excuses
you're rl no
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
i have plenty of excuses for ice
and no 3s hb
my sw only s2
i'm pleb
me?
<:cry:944955259636285481>
<a:PatPat:814547161878364190>
start now so you have time to take breaks
take it in small steps
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
2-3 hours long
it's actually like
good luck
part 2 is long as fuck
5 mins long
but it's literally like
i was like getting ready for some setup
part 3 is really really short
<:KianaCry_lum:646460917609005082>
i believe in the nini
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
cause they're also 9s but not doing the 872 i'm pretty sure
on what strat they're doing
actually i'll also ask magery
but the strat doesn't really have anything that would make it impossible to follow with 9s i'm pretty sure
on whether i think you're rank locked or not
yea i understand, stream when you're trying and i can give input
then it's v kind on damage threshold
but if you're happy with 824/840
i had to copy pat's to get it
but i wasn't able to get 856 by doing his transition
fhem's transition is way easier
and i also think it's way simpler
that having 9s will fuck you up
there isn't anything on the strat
just do non-9s strat
turg fish slug eden
this is what the 872 uses
ye
slug?
the stig set?
slug eden
cause that's
for that
do you have the gear open
nononono
9s strat for 824?
that's old strats
so i don't need to study
do the one i was doing then
o
to help you
share ref too <@385655541248163840> so i can study <:SucroseGlasses_yuduki_nh:781266154218979368>
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
and then i rest
i think i just wanna beat sonju on pig
i matched dariolao score too on pig
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
into 824/840/856 bke
thank you! i'll coach you
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
now it's in the hands of god
because why not but
i will try more later
i'm stuck below magery
so even if i cap pig
but magery is my cap
for pride and accomplishment
i can improve my score
i'm stuck here
if you have their valks ofc
free real state
braindead
bke and pig tho
no one wants to do wolf week
my pb is on wolf week
the more annoying the week is = the less sweaty it is
damn this is going to be my best week ever in terms of caps and i'm prob not making it to t100
BKE 47856/47856
doom 31893/31893
pig 39640/39720
and my week is done
cause my current score is temporary
now i just need a good pig score
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
didn't change my placement
literally
I'VE NEVER BEEN MORE POWERFUL
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
FUCKING
lets
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
i'd fucking take it
honestly at this point
and no 856s
i have way too many of them
i'm selling bke 840s
anyone want bke 840s
<a:catgib:564829264466149378>
stream
weird ref
your cap should be 872 but
856 too maybe but i suck too bad
824/840 is piss easy
fhem/rino have basically the same
do my 856 ref
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
2018
my mom said i'm not allowed to say how old i am
waow
older than me
yeah next year is glb 5th anni
gfdi mihomo
and like idk
maybe they see the change
i was very positive
like beginning on my honkai career
yeah i've becometh the gacha player who's Like That
<:Deadge:958122498019434496>
go for your 893 now
<@370438895965306882> 
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
i dunno SEA players, i dunno if LVER is legit or not
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
is cap
760
gfdi mihomo
because of this bs
imagine getting pushed out of t100
<a:PU_peepoRiot:778676108152274974>
this is actually giga bullshit
<a:peepoLeave:646986909381558273>
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
so go on
i mean i've stopped
just don't tell anyone
potentially it's a lot better value
you can try 1 or 2 days and see how well it goes tho
and then it's not as good value
and then coffee, kith and zei started competing
told coffee
then i started
no one was
i mean in blustorm
the ones for 20k
you know the ones
idk
gold crates
it was nuts
so i could get like 10 gold packs a day sometimes
in blustorm no one was picking those
than straight gold pack
is that better
huh
<a:HACKERMANS:842326702162968596>
selecting only phase shifters
yea i guess i can try out
o wait ic
<:KianaDumb:909232418052014171>
but it's not there
you said you asked for phase shifters on armada comms
<@370438895965306882> you baited me giga hard
have fun
for that reason, we're removing every other phys dps (except PE)
we've noticed that people stopped using BKE
honkai 7.0 - given that players aren't really using fire valks, we've elected that we're removing them for optimisation reasons
i think i have a peary piece...
direct craft
they confirmed it already no
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
ssg gresham
your gameplay
your potential
all u
nonono
ty though
yeah i'd rather not
bait posts just write themselves at this point
you're insane
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
yeah you are!! holy fuck
i need pee break
ruby please stop talking for a sec
tet is so old fashioned
i read my hole and went <:Sus:921102918059446362>
so it's not like you'll be at a disadvantage if you don't
so few people do it on glb
tbh i think that's like giga unnecessary
<:WhalePat:607373633056407605>
waow speeding up sush farm
cause potentially better spending
just wait for more info, might also prefer to go for like zhenyi n stuff on 6.1 instead
are they sea or global
yup
yeah there's foca
we don't even know how powerful sushang rank ups are going to be
wait for more info, i think they can afford HoH + 3* elf and then probably sushang weapon
just get sushang weapon in 10 pulls 4head
yeah i mean
but it doesn't sound necessarily bad
we know nothing of her
i think is too early to tell
like skip HoH, invest on elf instead and go for sushang?
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
that was actually the same thing i was thinking
pelb
me pelb
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
sheeeesh!!
slacc bracket
me pleb
is autumn
1st
yay!
don't have to fuck up my ss
o that's great
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
who uses the lightning affix there
sheeesh!
waow
ssg greshamlao
o yeah that's kinda clean, good score too
i'm sorry
that's so fucking bad
LMFAO
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
in the gresham
i believe
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
powerful gresham
in that case
unless you have already
if you optimise p1 rot
maybe can save 1-2s
sheeesh!
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
much higher than where you were at before
is that
all my homies hate parv
fuck parv
<@309634550273933314> wanna hear a joke i stole
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
wtf
you're just finding out new mechanics
this is like genshin cube
what LMFAO
fuck so close
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
pretty please?
do mine next
jfc
and then die of alcohol poisoning
i'll take a drink
every time my fischl uses both weapon active on same mech
sonju is one but he's already left on the dust unfortunately
i'm trying to look for a new opponent to beat score
aw
so exact same run i can prob save 10-15 points just on actually getting the turg thing
so i don't wanna bald for luck at the start just to lose the run anyways
cause i'm still learning the actual boss
also this was without getting turg on both mechs
from what i can get
-30 score
i mean this is like
you can stream and i can try to give pointers though
3 fps
and my pc streams at like
i'm playing on my own pc
i don't think so
lmfao
what a difference does handel make huh
me with 2s mobius got beat by multiple s0 mobius on homu
you say that
you did
okay i wanna beat lux
i think i can actually follow fragile strat
let's try that again
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
i was doing sim battle bs LMFAO
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
and take a pic for the gear i'm using
find me there
go to myriad t100
can you do me a favour
hey nini
oh shit
1550
damage issue
6d got ahnds
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
no luck
yeah i'm trying the fragile ref
yeah
oh god
it's pretty bad
this is not that, bad, is it?
show recording later
hmm
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
i can try that but we're 6 dist higher
it's insane
and pat's 2s1 outdamages me like there's no tomorrow
not even joking, i'm like right on with fhem 2s0
but she deals 2s0 damage
2s1
i've done worse in MA
i think i'm fine with 40% success rate the way i'm doing it now
the ref for the rest of the kill
no i want like
feel like i have a 40% success rate rn
turg thing aint that bad
for me to follow
is there ref
i can't even do the turg thing
i'm sure it's great
o ic
are you sniping nini
i should go do abyss though
and i already am sitting out
i didn't even walk in
he pinned it on #new-player-questions at solstice
that's from imy right
sorry
what's tetsy
where's ss bke now
oo i'm getting better at PX
917 is impossible
on my 2 years of playing
is what i've been doing
oh ty! i'll never use PX normally
ty but did you read what i asked
help
i think i deal too much damage
there's dodge cancels i think
guess i'm becoming a good px player to do this ref now
<:A_HuTaoHeart:803337674819764254>
ty
just tell me what buttons to press i am very dumb
i have no clue what PX is or works
on the second ref
with PX
wtf is rino doing
carv help me pls
i just thought it was very funny and i also think i'm going insane over BKE
fischl getting fucked up by BKE
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
if i was good i'd be matching magery score rn
lmfao
i just did a shit run on pig so i could buy out WT
i'm -1 on bke and -9 on parvati rn
maybe i can t10
recording quality kinda sucks
this region too competitive
not even t2% smh
i am cursed to be -1 off cap on HoT bosses
at least it feels like that
.05 off or some stupid shit
i'm actually like
i dunno where though
istg
this fucking 856
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i did a buffed mode kill and it was actually exact same time <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
it's tilting me how much i'm getting magic pixeled by the shield on p2
i can spend like 3 or 10 rn
i'm going to get phase shifters on gacha right
which is not a fuckton but i don't have much to level so issok
i have 6 cubes rn
but phase shifters....
god i wanna put some levels up on cf
that looked sad
tbh that doesn't surprise me did you see the 6s gameplay
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
she becomes 4th valk at 4s
a fuck ton personal damage
iriya puts s0 -> 4s elf -> s2+ on prio listing even
i mean yeah if you're on 2s+ whale level then 4s elf is like baseline
i imagine nini can feel it harder cause all 9s strats prob have it
ig i can see it but never been locked out of a strat cuz of it
iriya swears up and down that it's very big
some team tdm
ssg ely
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
o yeah that could be an issue, you wanna hit both with weapon active right
i'm not being beat <:Woke:759887282042830889>
wait that's a hacker? god damn it
but i can try to help
LMFAO
either
i haven't started abyss yet
also <@385655541248163840> 824/840 is piss easy, i can coach you later if you want, i'm pretty sure you're just misunderstanding something from ref
i wanna join the big leagues
gotta fix that
and went hmm transition isn't the hardest part
mihomo looked at BKE fight
this ref is really fucking easy now LMFAO
and that's -2
this is first try
also need 89 sc metal
will i get it in time
i need 11 phase shifter for HoH
too powerful
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
whoa thank you coffee

:D
we dun
morb movespeed is not that bad
low af movespeed
here
nyx sounds awful
this is homu king tho
VKE gamer
oh fair
cause you took longer to vote
can just tell you're taking screenshot
LMFAO
we can trio if anyone wanna join but this raid can be duod
sent inv
anyone wanna duo dk raid
so... sure?
it's a good investment anyways
i mean
but it's been a while since i saw one that needed 1.6
i have seen some recently that needed 1.2
very specific MA rots
those sp lines are only really useful for like
fire key is absolutely more impactful
we're genshin lore gamers here
yeah we were talking about genshin lore
lmfao
trust
i said a ton of interesting and entertaining stuff
just back read <:Clueless:996308692133761094>
<:Wow:759857863848886303>
my own music manager
and also with awful gameplay
without having to ref make
live out your dream of ref maker
so you can do those
i'm gonna send you MA runs
what the fuck
i just got mandela effect'd
nvm i guess it does spell namida
what the fuck
stroke
am i having a fucking
waijt
it spells out tears
no
and then translation at the bottom
they use kana for everything else
vid is just confusing
wait why that's gachaplayers
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816>
that makes more sense
none of those sounds are the real letters
she's spelling out tears
what the fuck i refuse to acknowledge
oh wait i know that song
ty carl
the one i did doesn't though
that'd be cool, BB strat for doom does HoS bonk
that one i stole from jia
and the dxy i start the music when the boss spawns
like the andrius run look cool cause i sync the music
i like most of my honkai vids
yeah stuff like that is fun
and then like play a successful one at the end
i was just going to play a lot of failed runs
and then like on the one section where HoH sets time to move forward
one of my plans was like doing TruE
it would actually be lowkey sick to record failed runs too
is just standing around going <:peepoBlush:620449739070111763>
cause like a good 20% of parvati
my runs won't meet up to my expectations
now i'm just worried
the second one is actually sick
i don't make playlists, if i put it on shuffle some 2015 bangers play and that's always fun
and just play my library
yeah same i just like songs
different sections of music help a lot to do edits
it sounds great
second one might be it
first one slaps but i think it's too calm thoroughout for what i want
whenever i shuffle my liked songs
russian roulette
as a like
i should do that
i'm not listening to that again
so yeah fitting
in the lyrics he says i wear a mask
i think i remember
oh yeah
share
<a:PU_pepeNoted:850331498598891540>
but better player has better chance?
absolutely wasn't for me
rino even said BB strat is supposed to be easier
anyone can (with similar gear ofc)
if i got 893
eh doom is really not that bad nowadays
should be easy though
LMAO
to record an 893
also i'll have to go back to doom mines
i'll listen to those though
no nyx <:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
and doom PE strat
parvati with DA
so BKE with HoT
i mean i'm doing for this week
yeah?
and that looks cool
i'll bald anything as long as it looks cool
vids like those are what make me like MA actually
but i need a good song
i have some ideas for edits
this is one is turbo sick
this one's gameplay is jialao's
this is the one i was thinking about
wait actually
doug edited it, but gameplay is from hers
this is from my sensei, celine
i wanna do a vid kinda like this
when i mistime FR ult on kosma transition
and shit
you can do it
flashback of my friends saying
is just me in simbattle
my training montage
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
and upload a vid
and then i wanna record
this week
i'm gonna do my best actually
cause tbh i'm bored of being skill issued in the same way since forever
that is getting me invested
wanna place bets how many people will 893 doom this week
truly
at not being good
i'm not even good
that makes sense
huh when i looked up it was all me
eli too powerful
skill canyon
not skill gap
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
yes
and just sucker punch with 2s2+ HoT
feel like anyone can come out anywhere
this cycle lowkey scary tho
arturia (baby 9s player), toprock, autumn and minghh
only 4 people i recognise
so this is nice change of pace
when talking about amount of balders
way above average lobbies
i think i generally get
after last cycle i deserve a break
look who's got the bald lobby now
heh
including me
everyone's sleeping
egg story things
no you got it
remember when cat was phyllis
after pulling HoR?
do you want my acc to be like tet's
see
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
where's the skippable patches
wtf you mean i had all year to save
i need more xtal
specially this patch
exactly
than have to deal with this bs
and they are less buggy
~~and i get to save more~~
i'd rather patches take longer
but like
i can't even begin to point out how much content honkai pumps out
that they keep up this schedule
it's fucking insane
yeah tbh
i mean tbf the way the game is going lately
yeah <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
but like LMFAO
tbf that question isn't that bad, i don't pay attention to numbers either
while being so dumb
like pure confidence
god i need to channel that
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
i mean i fucking am too is the thing
who doompost once, figure out their mistakes and grow after that
an ever changing group of people
or is it like
they move on to doompost the next
and as soon as they finish doomposting the new character
who are addicted to doomposting
one group of people
is it like
i just wonder
it literally did happen with HoH too
just honkai doompost purgatory
0 lessons learned
that happened with HoF
literally the exact same thing
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
it's so fucking broken the way it is right now
yeah it's insane
just hard to find refs cause everyone and their mother has 2s1 minimum now
with s2
or smth like that
-2 all of those scores
lowkey i'm pretty sure you can like
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
then s2 can reach that height
if you have patpat hands
she can 47k apparently
is morb
the only elemental i see
i don't see any HoT scores on jizo, unfortunately
HoT gets actually respectable score
FGO is phys boss but
i mean really i think jizo's just the exception
o yea that's true there's a good chance she topscores on tona now <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
doesn't even matter which
every damn week
pull HoT and she can literally deal with one of the 3s bosses
still nuts though
anything that's not HoT
kinda like anything trying to deal with BKE
even if that option is leagues below, it's still the 2nd best
t2 is just 2nd best option
i mean what else do you even use
i know she's at least good budget there, dunno if t2
i dunno what's state on hepha
i think it's only jizo rn that she doesn't score afaik
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
i'm still editing the message
calm down dumbass i pressed enter too soon
top score:
BKE, husk, kosma

t2:
FGO, tank, tona

good budget:
andrius, parvati, HoD

can't? score:
jizo
right now we have
who cares about ignite shield
she just bruteforces p1
truly the 3s MA valk
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
HoT does score on pig
that was a lie
HoT only doesn't score on parvati and a few other bosses?
remember when i said
oh shit
that's kinda nuts
i could have 1 second off 9s cap the whole week
so if i had 2 more rank ups
and 9s is 712
2s2 DA is 696 parvati?
apparently
otherwise i have no clue
i only look at those on timestop ult
like not even damage numbers
and enemy  hp bar
only thing i'm paying attention is like, valk bar, skill cds and valk cds
i barely see the actual fight LMAO
and then i just look at the rest through peripheral vision mostly
rest on my own hp bar
my eyes for some reason
need to get chains on all 3 dooms
i did pay attention on icon stuff on doom
cause like MA fights are always 1 target and if you miss the buff it's pretty clear
i rarely pay attention to icon i think
for me it really depends
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
on the leaderboards
<:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930> i saw gresham
content creator
tet found her cc
it's pretty easy to see
but
well, actually no, again the icon being there is not the most accurate on whether turg is actually applied or not
on whether it's applied or not
turg is pretty clear
yeah no
i think
but for application it's pretty accurate
it's not completely accurate for duration stuff
it looks like a bunny
turg has icon
instead of hold
i think she somehow pressed attack
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
as yumi loses a run on p2
at the exact same time
you say that
even if it's very precise it's on the beginning of the kill at least
actually i guess is not that bad
yeah sounds awful
kinda crazy
nvm doing that in nirv
i don't think i even did that in RL
waow
if you deal enough damage?
wait you get do skip dodges
which is the same strat i use
yumi looks like she's just doing rando stuff
yeah on mobs for abyss BKE
for turg
to push the mechs together
hmmm isn't oz positioning the thing
i was about to say LMFAO
where
just mobs is <:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
oh actual boss looks fine
holy fuck
2 HoS ult to deal with mobs
god that looks awful LMFAO
 this one is for baban and eli
one and only
no more memes
will be stuck in nirv now
poor otto guy
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
otto guy
ofc it's fucking
tet is a psycho
my dream is watching people being tortured
but yeah idk i'm resting a bit now after the doom maybe will try for one of the 3s bosses later today
cause fast shield with eden is <:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
i might do that instead
with FR instead of eden
theres an 840
i dunno if i'll do that tbh
scary
huh
i can actually cap 2 bosses this week
2s0 = 3s cap
whoa
and also 9s cap?
wait...
856 is 2s0 cap
<@385655541248163840> 
idk
so it's useful for like hua signet stuff
cause that you do get hit, you just take 0 damage
but it's different from invulnerability
you don't get hit?
i think it might be
oh hmm
刚正
i think i isolated what that effect is called in CN, carv
sorry
idt i can without holmes
i'll check CN to see if it's mistranslation of something
i'm looking it up but i see no mention of it anywhere outside of VG skill
i have no clue
under normal circumstance you def run raven
i mean you can def try though
o yea that's true
<@385655541248163840> <@309634550273933314>
with raven
you can try though
so i can easily see pardo making that way kinder
without shakes adrift
but this isn't normal circumstance, i think DA has giga sp issue
yeah like raven should be better under normal circumstance
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
masters atk
that's
damn
sheeesh
o wait they do
DA main source of ignite is either SoS or shakes T
DA's don't
SoS does
whos weapon
no SoS?
how are you igniting
yeah clearly <:Clueless:996308692133761094>
my ego is pleased
will have my name on #1
for all global doom refs
now we wait
LMFAO
are balding
even the hackers
sit
and i suck
yeah
LMFAO
how much i fail
i mean you watched
i just suck
yeah it's possible
oh 893?
846?
over at solstice
i watched mimi bald that
i'm streaming doom bald
schro M
i'll need
saving
what's that
pull for 2s and make it 3s with spending
i mean you had to whale a bit no
i'm not alone
another whale with 3s elf
ayyy
he has like 150k asterite
i piloted ft's acc for a while and he's at that point
you just have nothing to use asterite in right
i mean at one point
lowkey wanna put her up to 2s so i can max apho1 mei skill
wait DJ is just s
only 2s sp valks now are HB and DJ
which is like a while ago by now
i got 3s eden the week after last 3s BKE
no
o wait i did, on 3s husk
i don't think i have like, at all still
i will?
i thought i would put by eden to use
hmm
that's an interesting ref
o i see
is it p1 or mobs
and also
is it the one on the ref you  linked
yeah sure
is it harder somehow without klein
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
you'd think a higher score is harder but an optimised lower score is real scary
i mean like to perform, dumbass
means you have less time to fuck up
i mean if you think about it, the higher the score the better
well actually
that's monka
this is my favorite video
<@309634550273933314> 
one is surely to work
try every timing
simple
i'll get 3s HB by the end of HoH patch lmfao
me still stuck with 2s HB tho cause i'm stupid
after this everyone will have 3s HoH <:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
last ice abyss i have a chance <:2woggers:658553078420602901>
i kinda wanna try that
o wait
and also this week, who cares
i mean this cycle
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
anyways i'm sleeping this week
yeah no clue
actually idr if that's what happened
we all slept
you me and baban iirc
we've been in a bracket before
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
but in RL
just follow an nirv ref
dks still scuffed
still need those 2%s though
not atk diffd anymore
finally....
i'm turbo poor
share asterite?
<:A_HuTaoHeart:803337674819764254>
thank you!
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
given that all stages clearly say EX <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
funny how moriso put it up as ch26 tho
non open world chapter on v1 beta
at 8:05
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
but it has happened before where they're there on beta, i'm not crazy
again, just like framework, the actual stages had nothing in them
i remember moriso sharing like this one beta
25-ex had it too
i just want the chapter name
i mean not the story
at least on CN beta
where like framework of new story chapter was available on beta
i'm pretty sure it's been the case before
but i thought it was still like there as placeholder or smth
like not playable ofc
is the chapter not there on beta?
<@218762069338619906> can you tell me official translation of ely elf, HoH pri and ch31-ex when you have the time?
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
maybe you can morb
maybe you can score
i think their mobius is like 2s or 3s but
mimimi got 672 with mobius
i don't think it's new but i also don't remember it
which should be the second best option
like HoT easily scores 200 points over HoF
yeah
even if you try really hard
no HoT = demote i'm pretty sure
if i were you
i wouldn't bother with it
wait that's an unintended pun LMFAO
cool
came from that
oh sheeesh apparently the ana schariac pfp
yeah me neither
i think it's every 3 patches?
lowkey i kinda liked that
yeah LMAO
they killed that and kept the season system
it used to be tied to the entente system
when does a season start and begin? you gotta ask older players
yeah! when a season ends your score gets cut down to 3k if it's more than that
and you'll get rid of the ugly xx80 score!
it'll go back down to 3k
oh sheesh if you cross 3k then when the season ends
help
anyway i'm going back to sleep
that's okay
i'm they/she
in MA yeah i think i'm the highest scorer here
by gresham, nini, ruby
in abyss i'm beat often
i mean but it's different, y'all acknowledge the ungodly amount of time i spent in the game for shit score
LMFAO
and never getting a good score
after playing for 2 years
i say to myself, after another week
one day i'll get good score
but i'll never accept it
superbly mediocre
i am
like i'm in mediocrity
that's the thing
i won't
i mean sure but you don't spend an avg of 20 hours per MA week
LMFAO
nothing
and the answer is
and i ask myself wtf am i good at
everyone's like known for something, like pat and etzu's godlike HoT
yeah i dunno
and that's a lot for me cause i'm sheltered
60% of them
at this point i can recognise easily like
yeah i mean, high level community pretty tight knit
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
everyone will have quit already LMFAO
cause by the time i get good at the game to get actual good score
can't even like make them notice me
but idk, still makes me feel like shit
very unrelateable
i mean i guess it makes sense, cause i'm shit player with 2s valks so
or demote abyss or t35
just like p much no change in reaction if i slacc MA week or get t18
i'm same class as them but no one cares LMFAO
and skype is retired but actually retired, and that they hope that they would try some weeks
good players like darius keep talking about how lux is retired and still gets good scores
it's prob a dumb thing to be sad over
i'm kinda sad that no one cares about my performance LMFAO
depending on how shill 6.1 is
6.0 is prob the last patch i'll be competitive
that's still too expensive <:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
that one only costs like 12k for 4/4
a 30 pity +5 banner
maybe i have enough for like
i'm at barely 50k, no way i'll have enough for anything in 6.1
i'm fucked already i think
or am i thinking too early
should be like next week valk reveal and stuff right
also, when's 6.1 stuff?
you can do it carv
<:Wow:759857863848886303>
LMFAO
to just shadowban everyone using those stigs on t100
lowkey i think it'd solve the problem
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816>
i said bathory, dumbass
to deal with the hackers
and i'm instabanning anyone using roald bathory attila scott
i'm hacking mihomo right now
don't use that
triple 0s in MA
cause we'd get like actual 0s scores in abyss <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
to hack
for actual good players like me, karto
lowkey kinda fun
it would actually be
that's what i always say
pull first, craft later
yeah! she's releasing next week
nothing worth it to craft tho
asterite high value
nah craft monet, pull dj
play better
your affixes are shit or smth
if your atk isn't like that
just better skilled you see
i'm thinking of just joining karto on the dark side and help him bot 100 accs to t100 by the end of 6.0 if mihomo does nothing
tbf that's from a 2y/o vid so that might be fixed or insta banned now
it's fucking so stupid <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
look guys i found out how to get to exalted+
<:meijuice:923059579368144916>
i did the same thing for my 712 husk
that's just for fps
kyoshiro making me feel bad smh
that just means i'll be -6 instead of -5
<:Wow:759857863848886303>
i want a sticker of that
mirror HoH
can you
<:stonks:803115797140078602>
just swap when you feel like it
who cares
lmfao imagine a team with 3 cat
<:WhalePat:607373633056407605>
very worth imo
i heard if you pull on their banners past 3s you just unlock a new cat
<:stonks:803115797140078602>
one for each boss in MA
pull for 3 HoH
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<a:PU_pepeNoted:850331498598891540>
HoH bait
just run MPE
ty carl
me go <a:superbonk:709321232876699678> on dxy
call it retro
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
it was schro T bastet MB
o wait i remember
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
was on a really niche strat where i used something T bastet MB on BB
the only place i used bastet B
i think to this day
heph making sure your bastet B investment doesn't go bad
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460> i believe
it's vicissitude, there's 2 ci sounds there
i see, so it's not only me who constantly misreads hua signet
mihomo i'm bad at the game, gimme easy brackets pls
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
wtf!!!!!!
gresham's and nini's isn't either
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
i thought everyone's was like this
yeah that's what i fucking learned
hi kith <:wavekawaii:590500669119660053>
based
like tradeoff, you fall asleep on keyboard but atleast finish faster
least they could do is make the strat that makes you lose neurons/s do more damage
that's unfortunate
<:KyaruSnipe:959737563223031808>
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
is this how abyss life is
so fucking nice
yeah that would be
<:2woggers:658553078420602901>
AE slow ult simulator
i'll call this fight
is everyone quitting
wtf did no one play yet
if i actually follow the ref properly
get a 71x
i can prob like
okay this is not that bad
i think
which is the same that lux and magery copied
fragile
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
jfc
when i'm just trying to do fast combos
proccing everyones QTE
i keep fucking dodging an attack by accident on AE
???? wtf
this is awful
i don't wanna go higher
i'm gonna grab a gun and put a bullet in a slot every time homu does the stun jump and play russian roulette afterwards
or positioning
pure rng
is homu moveset
like it's just so good
i think both 7t banner is 7t + zhenyi right
if you don't have zhenyi too
she's an insane deal if you're not
but like
idt she's a good deal if you're pulling for card
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
handel is also just craftable
yeah that's fair LMFAO
is that what they said?
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
HoT is not on mobius level, it's on a higher level
HoT is better, cheaper and has more coverage than mobius because of 7t
i mean i think it's true
just do it
and also prefer blockade than maxing ER coin
honestly i prefer blockade than most raids
this one is really chill
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
using BKE vs BKE
darius got a 47.2k
still p good score though
oh i forgot HoT BKE is like 840
whoa
also, that ref looks giga unoptimised, wonder what cap is
because of more budget options ig
i mean peeps must've tried
like at all
the 3s bke thing is getting fixed
are we sure
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
i thought that was fixed on 5.9
really?
but was ice rpc fixed?
i dunno if it's tank, but there is another boss with the same issue
i think another boss was similar, tank?
yeah i saw that
i'll enjoy me following and enjoying story while it lasts
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
kinda doubt i'm already very lost and i didn't even start it yet
they then do a fucking cg on top of that
and i'd be okay with that
could've easily been the closing note to this arc
like this final fight
this arc kinda stacked huh
i dunno why y'all don't believe me when i say i'm shit at the game LMFAO
yeah i mean
oh i see
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
i think that was the next one i was going to get
oh there's one of those?
just looking at the pretty attacks
yeah
and i went okay this is fine
like they force you dead and revive you
fucked up thing is that they do revive you once
LMFAO
should've trained more my danzai skills
yeah
i was like it's okay they wouldn't let me just lose like this
damn i just fucking lost on the story LMFAO
would mihoyo even care is the thing <:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
thought of that before too LMFAO
i
more like 1e-800
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
since i suck at the game
around 300
so i'm guessing
🧢
what's my cap
are you noticing a pattern
just get it in bp next year
and then they fucked it up
discord devs thought how can we make our app more relatable to youngins
discord lately been hanging by a fucking thread
is the real question
when is it not fucked
my joke doesn't work
emotes aren't working lmfao
wait fuck
it's homu
oh
ofc i'd rather it not be like that but <:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
i'm on 1 gacha s-rank 1 wt valk team
on anniv
no way there's no gacha s-rank
calling it now
they used to release one elemental valk every year for some reason
well tbf if you guess phys on all old valks, you'd be right 95% of the time
~~i didn't even know she was phys~~
sundenjager
meta mech dps
yeah the well known
v2v haver
isn't this change bad for you
kosma really do be the anti-nyx boss
though HB prob steals stacks
SW with gaming mouse HB
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
that's turbo fucked
nyx's fucked tho i think
it's qua weather also i think
prob can get away without
and only on the mobs
but they don't look like they need the ignite
baby kosmas
it's like
it's not the slimes
yeah
it's not as harsh to bruteforce
no?
with trauma
i mean it's just those slimes
i also have no skill
do what
why not
just plop a doom in in any non-PE week
with a doom
this week would be more fun
honestly
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
did you find a doom
where the fuck
HoT kosma SpA wolf HoF kasumi
you're just running the same i am right
i guess i could
uh
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
2 or 3 skippable releases
from 4.4 to today you can prob count like
since like 4.4
it's been like that
abyss kosma might end up being the only qua boss you actually need v2v for <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
who that boss is for
can you guess
i mean
i'm going to be at 0 for cn anniv
this games fucking expensive huh
god
for s0 + 4/4 + 3*
50k is what you're guessing
so like
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
then you're prob doing something right
what's the issue now
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
spoiler alert yes i fucking can <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
i just  went yeah i guess i just can't press the button earlier than that
for no reason whatsoever
me taking 15 seconds to ult on HoT after combo
was literally
my -2 on husk
just press buttons faster
see i was right
what was it
lmfao
are your scores
the only cap here
me slac
knows more bosses than me
no u lao
actually thats a lie, i think its gotten smaller
list is getting bigger
same, maybe itll join list of boss i actually know how to do next week
jizo you dont even clear the hand shields anymore LMAO
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
all 3s bosses are paper
but very simple
husk in ma is fun imo
husk and tank are piss easy, everyone tries
annoying bosses people dont do
good choices to t100
yeah this and next week
only good content in the game
balding 2s ma
so proud
<a:aworryMadNodders:788410984527036416>
i think theres non s2 refs lower in the list
with no weapon on  rc
to kill p1 later
i think you need to actively fuck over your damage
theres strats for it on jialao sheet
i think so
no?
it's 733 tho
is it hard
whats the issue then
o but you can just do the sieg strat
i see
hmm
or are you using turg somewhere
cant run turg on sns there
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
o wait
and slug sns
don't you have jst cez open for cat
whatcha running
oink
with mobi on wolf and HoT on kasumi
v2v havers just score so much higher
i guess i just do w/e i want since i have no chance to begin with
sounds slacc tho
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
which i guess i can go for
sounds like irene for 680
well the way he says it
hmm
the tech
that's kinda sick actually LMAO
really?
wait what
just worried about support sets
piss easy
that strat is fucking
yeah i did that last time
do mine
are kosma strats irene or turg?
yeah
ttmbb
well
yeah
skill issued
with avo M
i tried doing the sieg M strat
soon
or 2 slugs
i don't have 3 turgs
bosses don't look that bad, lowkey worried on support gear tho
this week
maybe i'll try
that doesn't sound that bad
so positioning base
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
o i see
the collapse attack
is it rng
so you can figure out where you're losing time
that kinda stuff
like timer on ref on first v2v ult, timer on ref on start of transition, end of transtion, second v2v ult
do you note down how the timer is on each threshold
dunno if i can point out anything special
which looks annoying
there's like AE raven dodge at the very beginning
ref doesn't look too complicated
<:TeriCopium:969281688414875728>
getting closer
good cycle good cycle
and i can see what i notice from watching
or just ref
share recording + ref and i can help better
press buttons faster
doing wolf?
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
this class is fucking
help keep me awake
kinda cute
yeah
i mean yeah, i'm at 0 primos tho <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
you get to watch the credits, 500 bucks pls
it's like paying for a savefile of a singleplayer game that's already past the final boss
yeah here pay for an account where all the fun stuff is already done
like i dunno if there's a market for like end game genshin accs
who tf would even buy a genshin acc
i've done 80% of the content in the game
cause like
do you really think so
200 maybe
wonder how much i can get for my genshin acc
last time i whaled was on homa
same lmfao
and went this is worth more money now
they like gimp darkened the vfx
yeah
they don't do vfx <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
like it's not like it's even that much work
i swear to god they could like triple their income
like there's no tomorrow
genshin isn't pumping out skins
i'm kinda surprised
yeah no fuck that
didn't get fischl's either
didn't even get ning skin
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
and quit
to buy keqing skin
180 days of welkin
and then i put
but before then i had better attendance than college
like i hard quit on cny2 on genshin
one day of genshin
i think i literally only missed
before i quit
i mean i think so but
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
and you're getting pinged when i hit 700 days without logging in
which is not a bad thing
genshin impact is a very fun game to play like once or twice a year for 2 weeks
because this game also kinda sucks lmfao
and just quitting
because all other mihomo games kinda suck
torn between staying on this game until eol
i'm like
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
31-ex is 6.0
wait it's off by one i think
you can get it to 7.0 imo
sprinkle in some breaks
6.1 is 31-ex
6.2 is 32
6.3 is 33
6.4 is 34 + cg (cny)
6.5 is 34-ex
6.6 is start of last arc 35
6.7 36
6.8 37 + cg
like story wise
game will end on 7.0
i'm pretty sure
7.0 HoE release
new abyss weathers:
- 3 new bosses that HoE counters
- 2 new bosses that BKE counters
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
6.0 patch notes: fixed non-nyx resistances for homu
more like
anyways look at this dream shit
oh shit we fucked up
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
when we get bugged boss mihomo goes oh we're looking into it and does nothing
cn gets 5 bugged bosses a patch but at least they mostly act on them
still mad over that
don't get me fucking started
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
less rng than abyss currently
MA is at least
you can say w/e you like
leave me alone
i mean i know i'm just coping
and then gear is same price as elf was
like if they make new elf farmable but useless without gear
that sounds cute
if they don't make it more expensive
i mean
actual just 4th valk <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
i mean i guess they can but it'd be dumb
for phys and ice, when it gets time to powercreep them, i dunno if they can just make it even bigger numbers
fire and lightning elf are 2 that i think can get away with getting upgrades without making up a whole new gimmick
get it near ely elf
switch cd + force qte + like +50% buff on numbers
new lightning elf is prob going to be
on damage output
like she's not bad but she's not WE/ely/dudu tier
just make her numbers bigger
her numbers aren't very big
eh
just like, do you want to be on top of competitive
you'll prob be able to t100 + nirv retain with klein
even with new lightning elf
cause like chances are
and also how competitive you are
just depends how budget you are
i mean yeah
like as long as you're fine with accepting your investment is like for ~3 patches or so if you're being pessimistic
or like 6.9 summer
and then lightning elf getting powercrept either 6.4 cny
or 6.4 cny
fire elf is getting powercrept either 6.1 on anniv
i think she's still worth it prob
kinda whale
if you're like
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
can't wait to sell my soul to get -5 with actual SpA
i did like a random fucked run for fun and i was -1 from SpA cap
it's kinda crazy how much easier mobi is
good job
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
but <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
at a certain part
you could get away by stringing eden qte instead of going directly to HoT
i remember on husk ref
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
o no
i dunno what came to him
yeah gresham is so nice otherwsie
just got 5 friend requests
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
wtf
yeah uh about that
uhhhh
i'm missing a fuckton of damage
and often in abyss
if i'm missing a bit of damage and can't follow ref
my issue is i just don't work
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
is that really lao
but like
instead of the 6 hours in last day that i did
if i tried for like 15 hours
i could've retained
like i'm sure there's some nirv weathers
you're severely overestimating me
and then i went please gresham i'll do anything
i can share a bit of my skill, if you beg
you can't do abyss
oh how pitiful
gresham went to me literally like
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
one more valk than gresham thinks i can score with
that's
go on
okay nirv retainer
and now there's s0 893 strat
the 840 doom with griseo is pretty free
and it really speaks to the state of the game when doom is the fairest boss on a week
out of those 3
the best boss
doom is
fun stuff
just everyone has 2s0 instead of s0
nah looks the same as before
i'll look for refs
so i can bald MA
it's the week i'll be home
is it next week already?
jk
you're fucked
probably
that's most 3s bosses
like s2 was basically same score to 2s
back on release i remember it not even being that big of a deal
with 2s0 DA
wonder how different it'll be
to use it a second time ever
me grabbing my 5 patch old max DA pri
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
i have very few pris to max now
well, i'm sure it's going to be better soon
yeah i do, still harsh though
enough to buy out what i'm buying out weekly
i have AW rn because of the event
nah that's going on fucking last
to use asterite on metal and stuff
cause i'll prob stall that
more than that!
so i won't have 3s HB at HoH release
i'm like 280 frags to 3s still
god i'm going to be complaining so much over not having 3s HB once HoH released
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
very aesthetically pleasing
ss mobius and ss HB
yeah
flexlao
ok
wow
those 15k packs i slurped them up
i did whale for asterite though
i don't remember if i whaled for metal or not
where do you even get the metal
kinda crazy that if i was a whale i'd have a whole 2 nother pris to max
but still
i think i'll have enough to like lv60 HoH pri on release
220
i think i'm at like
i mean i'm not actually at 0 metal
for tank
i maxed ely pri
<:A_HuCry2:807900552318681148>
and i'm at 0 metal
hb also 2s
my griseo still 2s
it's not in the past for fucking me
i think i'm stupid
i see <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
which drains asterite for completely fair reasons
yeah as opposed to what we have right now
how's exalted+
you're living in 7.0
literally the first patch i skip is the best performing patch LMFAO
wait ever???? what the fuck
confused
i'm um
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
easy mistake
oh you're thinking about boobnya, yeah
was it?
no it wasn't
boobnia?
what even was 5.7
?
wise
like revenue
i mean that may be true for ely personal performance but gotta take into account how elf can improve other teams imo
<:tericopiumhic:893828235954102293>
i'm just coping too
it is probably s0 > 4* > rankups
i think that's cope
uh.....
yeah i....
so then i do 4* after that?
i'm doing s0 > 4/4 > 3* i think
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
if i get lucky, do i do s2 or 4* elf first
wtf
elf just becomes a new valk
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
+1200% dmg on ult
wtf is that 4*
pretty big eli
that's
the one i saw was DoS tho
there's a ref with turg FR too
i think you can get away without klein
but matches spa
klein tho
if he even plays
autumn just plays last sec
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
that wasn't a fucking snipe
and i guarantee you
yeah
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
ty gresham
which is about 12 spots higher than i'd get if i played
i 8th
my social skills ran out see y'all tomorrow bye
is it late today
ooo carv streamer
<a:terigrabhic:709594728039055390>
<:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
y'all treat the non degens too badly
yeah i don't blame them
that's fair
actually
what
next?
good one
valk bussy (from honkai impact 3rd)
sleep well
mussy (man bussy <a:chad:969329762206093372>)
bussy (boy gussy[girl bussy])
LMFAO
i don't wanna do that one, next?
yeah i just made the definition so now it's real
i'll do the definitions
next?
good one
gruel is when gru from minions is cruel
i think that happened with dictionaries
wait oh shit
we should make up words and put it in the ranking so people think they're real
funfact about every word: someone thought that sounded nice and it became a word
yeah ok is kinda meh
nips and boobs are different
i mean i guess you could enjoy it
just licking skin
i feel like that's like
do you actually
it sounds so nice, so flexible
yeah fuck is like SS
how well it meets the vibe of the word
like how it feels as it rolls out of the tongue
for judging
categories
make like
i think we should
that is impossible i think
that's a homestuck word
get therapy
you're just depressed
i mean that doesn't mean it's inaccurate, tons of words have plenty of defintions and a thing doesn't have to fit all of them
what
the word doesn't mean what it means
inaccuracy
what the fuck do you mean
yk
it sounds gay
like it fits the definition
i feel like gay is a pretty good word
hmm
y'all stopped posting the feet
and doing the bot
my job was gathering the feet
i mean sure but that wasn't my job
yeah it's a good waiting game while we wait until fire sp release and dainsleif banner
so i would do it
but i'm not responsible
actually i don't have time
i have time
like tierlist it out
we could rank every word
hey you know what we could do
so stale
night's a fucking boring word huh
that's the one
yes
i'm assuming
ytp of that one star wars character
that's like
damn
o you also have it
i guess we do have an extra letter, get fuck lmaoo
that's a different eltter
except ç tho
yeah ours are just accent
oh okay
cause like we have é á ó ú í ã ô ç here
oh you treat those as different letters?
or is it? that's confusing
taxi is also stolen
though i guess
yeah i forgot, theres taxi too
<a:chad:969329762206093372> what the fuck are letters
he'll go
wait until sora comes up
but yeah, k, w and y are just only for stealing words
wait x is a portuguese letter, nvm
i guess it's fucked up if you think about it
to steal words?
we just have them for fun i guess?
actually use them
like no portuguese word
portuguese letters
like k, w, x, y, those are just not
i also don't even know why
it was so fucking weird
on the alphabet song
yeah they just rammed in another letter
and we had to relearn it
it like became a letter midway when i was learning the alphabet
yeah
in portuguese
when i was little
k wasn't a letter
oh did you know
holy shit you know the alphabet
LMAO
i'm trans
i don't
yeah i think so too
this feels dangerous
is this dangerous
i think my social skills have degenerated heavily, i can't talk like a normal person to another human being without flirting
i like gresham
hi gresham
that's called being a scientist actually
that's how smarter you can be at kindergarten
oh yeah licking soap instead of playdoh
what else do you do
it's fucking kindergarten
what the fuck is the alternative LMFAO
that was a shot in the dark
holy fuck
wait i was fucking right?
i got got
fuck
wait that's just another gacha
yeah i'll quit gacha for yugioh
wait are talking yugioh now?
winnable
was that
gimme 31413 ty
yeah i'll be there in 31680
honestly i really should start speaking in seconds as ss MA scores
yeah it's the best one
you have no clue
so hard
bald the mine minigame
i'll fucking
god i miss it so bad i'm right here
you're like that meme
i mean it's still up
like fanmade
there's actually a brazilian server still up
ayyy
habbo hotel
or w/e the fuck kids play this day
club penguin
that you'll just go fuck this and play like
and the monetisation
you'll just go so overwhelmingly mad over the dumbass decisions of dev
just play them for a while you'll rehab yourself
are those a thing
yeah we try our best here
my mom says i'm special
i hope i'm not average
piss shower baby?
yeah it makes me say weird things
wait you just brought <#977584145142259782> here!!
like baby shower but with piss
it's like golden shower but with babies i think
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
never coming back to <#977584145142259782>
i'm fucking
i mean even then you don't have to do it there ig
i'm not only dumb, i also don't care about abyss, so i have no clue sorry
cause in apho you can hit breakable stuff and get sp
sp maybe?
i have no clue
LMFAO yeah that's who mihomo meets up every patch to decide new abyss sched
i was like wtf are you even doing
LMFAO i forgot those were there for abyss
we riot
if its not
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
HoH funds
oh
that's fucking bs
you fucking deserve it
cause like
do you get ot tho
i feel like i got an anyeurism
wtf is wrong with <#977584145142259782>
rino too nice
nai nai
maybe if i read i'd know that
i see ty
do you get ot at least
that's fucked up
lmfao
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
yeah that's the same joke i made
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
MIA like missing in action cause everytime we get the chance we replace her
LMFAO
i'm like kinda impressed
fits her so fucking well
holy shit
a fucking good abbreviation
MIA is actually such
i answered that though <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
griseo just better SR for MA i guess
you already used SR over raven there
yeah even before griseo
waow
that's like -4 from mobius cap
lowkey sick score
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
you typed ely wrong
that's prob alright
and still score
but if i can slacc
and HoT looked fucking awful to break the balls
either break the balls and get buff or don't and get fucked
i thought it was like
doesn't sound that bad tbh
maybe i'll actually learn kosma this time around
120?
whats max
SW can prob clear it outright yea?
though i can see it
fucking laughably bad
that's
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
that surely helps no
hb weapon skill and switch
hmm can't like
that's kinda fucked up but ok
oh i see
i kinda like that
so like, whether you destroy the balls or not doesn't matter, just how much hitcount you get off?
i didn't know it worked like that, that's kinda cool
is there a stack counter?
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
and t2%
got like 4695x
i'm pretty sure i broke a single ball
oh wait they do
i feel like around that anyone can do
i got like 46.9k with HoT by like scarmbling together w/e the fuck happened
what
who cares
and do double collapse
like ignore the balls
personal advice, just take the L and do a 47k score or w/e
so i might be spewing shit
kosma
i haven't fucking tried
though personally
i mean yeah but if you're only damaging them when they're that close i think you're fucked already
drop cross at first ball and cry on the next two
whats even the plan
though both sound awful
hekate griseo at that point
i mean
go on
yeah that'll work
with cf
dariuslao used ely on one boss exclusively for the hitcount
what was it again
could work actually
a different type of hitcount
it's like
yeah i dunno if griseo hitcount passive works on the orbs
are you hitcounting
how
i think 2nd hepha will show up on week 4-6
i think it won't be hepha on next week MA
yeah i know
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
i wanna mobius wolf too
we reffin?
want ref?
kasumi?
forgot about boobnia
o yeah
she's fine probably
maybe maru too
prob has good enough score at bella to retain nirv
i mean she has ely and assaka
and then the second boss is ffa
so it'll be hepha/kosma/+1
will keep the 3 boss per patch rotation
i think the first boss of the week
i don't think it'll be hepha
what kinda bs am i going to need to deal with
and now it's just what awful 3s boss is coming up next
when i saw the bosses and felt adventurous to learn new strats and have fun
i remember when i looked forward to those
me every new MA week
oh i see LMAO
not shielding with zhongli or else enemies die and they don't get to have fun LMAO
lmao that's funny
oh shenhe c6 is builtin chongyun?
i guess i can see that, if c6 is like basically different character
and i'm not one to like purposefully make stuff harder just for the fun of it
like it's not fun anymore
so fucking easy
cause it made abyss
and i lowkey feel bad
cause like i pulled for homa c1 hu tao
honest question
like besides waifu/simp
for c6r5 in genshin
why do people even pull
<:RaidenTsun:870806355785678929>
n-no!!
<:tsuncat:960584739914412042>
i don't even care about abyss anyways baka
true and based that's how i deal with demoting from nirvana too
LMAO
god i'm bad at the game
i'm like
or worse, i do s0 strat with s2 and like -1 or -2
but when i do s0 strat with s2 valk and cap i just go eh who cares i rank scammed
i go wow cool
like when i do s2 strat and cap
i'm just skill issued
i mean that is the situation where i feel bad tho
but idgaf about those so who cares
3s ma can be different, and abyss is def different
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
for easier cap
i'm just cheating
i feel like me doing them with s2/ss
like nowadays most ss MA strat are s0 cap
eh actually not really
i mean sure but like
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
imagine if i also fps scammed
can't convince myself i'm a good player cause i'm always with rank scamming advantage
like i already feel bad over having >s0 characters
i'd feel a high and then go why did i do that
it'd be just like using drugs
i feel like if i'd do it
yeah see
and then went on sister pc with good fps, got it first try
was similar for me, spent 5 hours on wolf opener on my pc
it became like 1/3
and then after going to 120 fps
remember magery saying that ss BKE opener for them was like 1/30
you'll prob feel it just by going from 60 -> 120, some shit is like mindblowingly easier
but just makes it way easier to reach the actual cap
it rarely opens up actual new strats or new cap
so it just makes everything slightly easier
and makes clock tick slightly slower
is that it makes all buffs slightly longer
the thing about fps scam
i mean in MA it rarely even gets you 1s
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
ty boo for haggling all aponias
CN sure is
yeah i assume SEA is infested with it
but top players, none do it
like there's some in global
nah
luckily we have low to none fps scammers in global
i'm more like a it is what it is while disliking that it's a thing
kinda fucked
changing game files for competitive advantage
cause it's like
like >120 fps scam
just not as heavily as iriya is
i am too
yeah
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
but iriya's fucking quitting so who cares
to not tell iriya
that if you're fps scamming
also i was going to say
the rest are fucking sick if you don't have em yet
sw stigs is the only bad one prob
lowkey stacked
skill issue i guess
and never got as close
and then i tried for another 5 hours
the first time i got 712
to 728
SO fucking close
i got
i dunno wtf went wrong with me and that husk
<:tericopiumhic:893828235954102293>
if i had that 1 extra fps i'd have capped husk trust
like 240/500
fps scam is going over that
also 120 fps is in game settings
it just upper caps it, if it can't reach 120 then it'll just do w/e it can do
i mean theoretically it shouldn't matter what you set max fps to
general -> horny -> spoiler
yeah that chat has some history
<:GalaxyFpsScum:1002644841148198932>
yeah
no like a few months back
yeah i posted it here earlier
what else can you expect
like broken dps with broken supports
but yeah she's turbo broken
and whale is prob the kindest qua boss
but their PE is 9s
i mean mimimi was
honkai valk schedule is too fast for that
i would never invest on PE and sacrifice a new valk
but like
if you can afford new release + backpull then PE is prob 1st prio
it depends on how your budget is
quit week 6 6.0
my current fund plan for 6.1:
elysia is weird, she's really cheap and has avg value, so she's above average bang for buck
PE and 7t are def above avg rn
HoF is also avg for the price rn but i'm sure she'll be alive for a long while since she herrscher
yeah i think mobius is avg for the price you pay
how a 7t changes lives huh
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
and HoT will still score somehow
they'll just make some fucking insanely annoying transition phase that only the newest valk can clear comfortably
the way new sss bosses are going
and phys bosses with crit
is husk with rng attack patterns
i think the only bosses where rng actually plays a role
just pseudo rng over micro positioning bullshit
3s bosses are quite nice on not having actual rng
eh tbf
<a:ppPoof:933892148380721163>
wolves be like
<:2D_Hug2:801841021461200947>
ty carv
carv so nice, looking out for me so i don't join another gacha
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
neither are 3s bosses
stfu ruby
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
add MA to genshin and i cum
and i come back
literally add any competitive element to genshin
i'll do that in genshin to pay MA respects
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
pause for energy/sp
it's like basically the same thing as honkai LMAO
yeah in abyss you can pause for particles
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
so it's prob by design
but it's in fucking genshin too
i was going to say isn't it fucked that it's still around after god knows how long
i mean i guess i am too, but i'm more that it's a thing rather than people abusing it
are people mad over spam pausing
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
wtf is pausescum
gotta pump those kappa numbers up
hq
there u go
<:kappa:473834054517522442>
i have a few
lmao gresham so toxic
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
me too me too
s0 sounds like a good stop
neutral matchups in the first place
i mean there not many
prob MPE me thinks
like homu?
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
if they got para husk
imagine
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
mihomo keeping it pretty stable nowadays
lowkey kinda doubt it'll go much up
like the stop getting dupes from card packs
but i saw some updates didn't look bad
i stopped playing during the taiwan shit
wait actually
that shit's fucking out of this world insane
300k to max one character on diablo or smth
and it costs like
yeah i think some people did the math
reaches a point where there's nothing even for you to buy
i mean yeah but 70k is like waaay off 400k
~70k
you'd prob spend like
i would guess if you're like a giga whale and wanna join on anniv and pull for everything 9s
like 8 sets of zhenyi?
wtf do you even spend 400k on
but again why would you even think that
LMAO everyone did
i mean you showed interest
cherry's piloting
thank you for the hard work, how much is a horse carriage without a pilot?
gotta be a millionaire to keep up
after DA patch
yeah i believe that actually
me 400k in 1.5 years <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
ruby 600k in 4 years
you're a smaller whale than me wtf
anyone wanna hop on a plane and go protest against 3s bosses with me
and where is mihoyo hq
a horse carriage
how much is
just for fun
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
retain nirvana for 8 patches or w/e
and you like
you just pull one single character 2s
honestly it was p bad but looking back it also sounds very budget
we say that not to like make you wanna quit or anything
so what can we judge
i guess CN honkai is similar
well
also wtf
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
those fuckers about to release 3 valks a patch
speeding up
it's fucking
i fucking wish it was slowing down
there's like nothing more to spend on
like karto is at 50k usd and he has everything 3s
no but like there reaches a point there's nothing else for you to pull
i don't think you can even spend that much on honkai
wtf
400k xtal yeah
LMFAO yeah that's what i'm thinking
is this really fun
i'm 400k top up in 2 years and i'm like do i really wanna stay
diablo immortal probably <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
oh god it has gotten another one
yeah i can see that
time to quit again <:TeriSmug:647106119310901257>
barely matters 95% of the time even on high high end
which, for honkai, is extremely low
cause like you said like honkai affix and i thought you meant similar amount of impactfulness
oh okay i can see that
oh are they like very big for pvp?
probably
i'd just not spend
which i guess is good for competitive player
cause that's just kinda weird and not very impactful
no i meant like just the general you, like that what you have as option to spend on
yeah i guess i can see that
oh god
awful
that sounds actually
and you spend on that?
counterside, not counterstrike <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
i don't think i even unlocked that <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
you pull for gear?
you said, and i quote, that you like when the abyss fights are the most rng, that's the fun part of abyss
yeah but you are psychologically insane
but i did play v little
from what i played like it kinda felt like there wasn't even that much to whale for
cause like
how high even is spending cap for cs
after a while all the bullshit piles up and you just go <:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
is like honeymoon
even though i was clearly playing while honkai was already going downhill
like the amount more of competitive content compared to genshin is insane
but honkai kept me happy for a WHILE
i mean me too
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
so they're prob happy still
have ultra low standards
people coming from genshin
yeah the thing is
yeah honestly it's a waaaay better investment
i know lux used his honkai allowance to buy guilty gear
yeah that makes sense
i know skype did
didn't he move his honkai allowance to cs?
so it doesn't quite surprise me
i mean he was on low maintenance mode for a whiiiiile now
oh he did?
he <a:ppPoof:933892148380721163>'d out of lumina so i think he's on low maintenance mode for honkai
i'd bet these are like p fast scores for him
he's a pretty good player
yeah, though i dunno if he balds
but alas
i also went <:2woggers:658553078420602901> keebs alive
i was like wait this doesn't look that bad
o wait this is not this cycle
as the single person who used nyx for fun
i mean you can prob go down
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
she's 2s3 tho
(though her affixes do suck heavily)
can prob just use FR too
i just do mobius for qua sidestage
did you use nyx
why
thank u so much <:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
thats a fucking sick score
<:2woggers:658553078420602901>
and also what you learn of my acc
lemme know how well this goes
i just got home now after going to grab them, i'm going directly to sleep
cause i left mine at a friends
it's cold as fuck where i'm at right now and i spent the night without any blankets
nah i'm fucking spent i'm like 2 days awake with barely any sleep
i'm just metal poor
<:PepeHands:909232418211364957>
i'll get to it eventually
leave my neb alone
i see on the fucking thumb
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
cause he promised me 200 torus for 2 mil coin
actually 2 of those are going to sora
+share torus
whys that the first thing you look
you can go w/e tf you want LMFAO
idk if i have any acc boundaries
i'll dm you my acc stuff gresham
that's fair
but actual sex is okay
LMAO
<:lewd:959737567119556618>
don't ask the mods, it's true trust
which means that as long as i'm okay with it it's fine
it's actually my malding channel
let's fucking go
owo handholding <@482139585355448333>
WAIT WE CAN HANDHOLD
lewd.
that's fucking
owo wag
wag is an option?
oh lewd is an option
owo help
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
damn
owo handhold <@482139585355448333>
can we handhold with owo
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
so i was craving some vegetable ones for a while, found some here at college's city supermarket
and i hate it it smells awful LMAO
for moooooonths
local supermarket only had cheddar cup noodles
for some reason
are you proud of me ruby
at 5 am
i had cup noodles today for breakfast
maincord: yeah
bait valk
*outscores 3s sw*
lmfao
they did an otto
i lowkey think this outcome was inevitable, ruby and nini just made it come faster
its not a good environment
im quarantining you 2 off of maincord
actually i know whos the fucking culprit
the old nini i knew wouldnt have said that
see
hard to tell
or is nini the bad influence on ruby
is ruby the bad influence on nini
cause even non 3s people pull for it
elf is prob easier to find
karto did some too i think
forgot about those
lmfao
though i dunno if they max elf skills on those
i guess i could check whale pulling vids too
and then figure avg out
and note that down
to pull on old elfs
maybe i should make alt acc
feel the same with sp valk
yeah i would expect so
only changes if you're waaay into pity
so like playing into avgs you're expected to spend about as much even if you are already a bit into pity
i'm at 39, avg is 39
like from 0, avg is 48.2
it doesn't matter that much
unless you're really deep into pity
honestly from my calcs
like my xtals done = hard limit
but i have 0 to whale with
i fucking maxed 4 elfs and i have no fucking clue how much it costs still lmfao
not that i know the answer
is it the same for all? or are you asking like avg
i think is p harrowing
that for s0 + 4/4 + 3* elf
i'm like at 50k xtal and barely any supply cards
i don't even know if i'm 3*
with the amount i have
if that's a lot or not
i have no clue
i have 35 stones
i am fucked in multiple ways
so i'm fucked for elf ely
but then i have like 0 adv mats cause i keep selling them off for asterite so i can rush griseo HB out
for all of HoH gear
i'll barely have enough
i think if i stopped levelling absolutely everything rn
phase shifter diffd
LMFAO
to this day
and still haven't maxed it
on 5.2
i fucking pulled for welt
i mean
o
o yea you're competing with chyara right
made a bet?
have to?
though i lowkey do wanna try maybe
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
i can do your MA on the same level i'm doing my MA this week
let's all retire! :D
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
you say that after you offer to do my abyss
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
time to go all in on hua
my BNs almost done actually! i wonder what's next that i should do
sooo close
only like 5 more years until i'm catch up
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
and then i'll prob do like 2s HoV and SK
and i'm still in denial over MA changes
and then i'll finish 2s2 CH which i'm only missing 39
19 frags for 3s FR and 10 frags for 3s ely
i'm aaaaalmost finished with FR and ely
got 19% rn
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
2s1 too?
what rank are yours
<:DILUC_COOL:708170074069925928>
now my only excuse for not scoring is that i suck balls
not atk diffd anymore, new keilo arc
when did her atk get like that
o wait wtf
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
gresham but badder
then i think that's kinda sad
if it's gresham playing
i'm way worse than a mid gresham
that'd be an offense
if it was me playing it
LMFAO
and then let him play on my acc
i'll change my name to gresham
i think so
absolutely insane
and like the fucking paralyse train they do
i saw a 9s ref
oh god
yeah
i pulled for s2 to match s0 atk <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
kei atk diff lo
i mean you know whose account you're getting into
<:PepeHands:909232418211364957>
actually it might be 151x, dunno if i checked before or after crafting dk
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
150x atk
uh
i can't play on my laptop legit get 5fps on abyss <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
don't even need to try hard, 15k is good enough
are you sure? <a:AA_Gab_Bow:914213000594980964>
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
is more refreshing than vacation from work
vacation from honkai
my HoT is 2s1
if a valk has been available on like bp or spending event i prob have her at 2s baseline
i meant pure gacha
mepleb
the rest are largely s2
only ss gacha valks i have are mobi and PE
my sw is s2
tears
i might need someone to play on my acc this cycle tho, if only to just 15k so i don't lose xtal
i dont wanna overwork the gresham
aren't you piloting like 8 accs
i'm predicting a beat boss = retain
anyone wanna do my abyss <:Clueless:996308692133761094>
with 3* elf
gonna be running the s0 1/4 welt HoH
hmmm
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
i think i may be fucked
cause like
3* or 4*
oh wtf
well i guess it depends on how awful that ref is
oh that makes that new week fine!
did i now? cause i can keep going, i'm still  mad
yeah im p sure they have all old test weather info saved and just picked the wrong one, probably
oh no
kty*
ill sleep this cycle kt
yeah that makes sense
also rl <@416445660443967491> ?
fun cycle devs
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
sw hb fr?
just let us
we will torture ourselves
i mean the thing is honkai player are all masochists already
and in 4 weeks im not gonna be  one of them
theres going to be like 3 people for me to compete with in 3 weeks
iriya went casual in MA last week
who is enjoying this
whoooooo is this even for
wolf is like *throws bullshit at you* idk one of those will prob kill your run
tank kinda bs but no rng bullshit
yeah husk and tank are aight
more like this one you gotta dodge the lasers! do perfect inputs now if you dont wanna lose the run if youre not v2v! i'll push you to the other side of stage and make you run towards me for 10 seconds and then kill me in 5
their transition is solely and uniquely to piss me the fuck off
yeah these are the real transtrenders
swear some bosses you spend more time playing simon says than actually fighting the boss
its called game design darling
where its only invincible 60% of the time during transition phases
devs are like who tf even playing this shit still
just wait until 3s relaese who cares
its interesting that it wss never in their plans to even fix tank
i mean now it is, tank was bugged before 3s bosses though
its so fucking bad
we unironically had 5 bugged bosses last patch
its heimdall btw that is bugged on abyss and got replaced
i dunno i just know that it is
to this day
and SS tank is STILL bugfed
and then they released SSS tank
you see, SS tank was bugged
oh my poor child
oh tank was bugged at some point?
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
that one's on them, they're fucked either way, shouldnt have made new herrscher another psy
yeah and it made it so HoT can score on 3s hepha
fixed her resistances
yeah
sorry no budget allowed
thats a whoops too many options, this is supposed to have a single option
thats a sushang bug right there
that one is a bug
the sss bke bug
i mean
i dont even know if it was fixed that patch, i know that by act 3 i was still suffering from it
everyone was annoyed over it, it literally lasted weeks
with very little time to read
the thing where all narrator text got insta skipped
just literally made story unreadable for a good portion of the playerbase
the auto skip text last chapter
like how do you fuck up so bad and so often and then take weeks to fix it??
and it was core functionality
the story one lasted fucking weeks!!
i mean small mistakes are fine but goddamn
who the fuck do they care about
global smol fish, they care about CN cn has like 4 bugged bosses per patch
and no they fucking don't, they fuck up story updates
and like you ask yourself well competitive community is small, they just care abou bigfer community
getting close to where you can count on one hand of old player still playing
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
shit has to be real fucked to get them to leave
like these old player went through old abyss q mani nirvana
iriya considering quitting though
karto is also new blood
lux and skype are like a month younger than me
i mean lux is my gen
shits fucked
even like giga boomer player like keebs going casual
i mean they must be getting worse, theres no way its just me doomposting
then that's also turbo fucked
and if we dont and they just leave SEA like that
if we also get fucked weather, that's turbo fucked
ill be mad either way
so please let me know wtf happens in global once abyss opens
i can't login to the game rn
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
it's paralyse husk
and when you actually go and play the stage
and then when we get on live, the boss preview and stage description is hitcount
global and sea beta got hitcount
then CN live was hitcount
CN beta got paralyse and then it got changed to hitcount on later betas
and that's the thing
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
that make it basically unplayable for non aponia and maybe unplayable even for s0 aponia
paralyse is a combination of boss being way more chunky and mechanics forcing lightning
hitcount is fine, aponia still top score but plenty of options
beta had hitcount
in a5?
i dunno if its getting worse but jesus fucking christ these last few patches
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
that fucking happened
oh wait
imagine if like for lore people if they released a storychapter which you couldn't read the fucking story for some reason
it's fucking bullshit on top of bullshit, it's like they don't even care about this section of their playerbase
and for even s0 aponia in nirv it's almost unplayable
it's clearly unintended, the cycles fucking unplayable by anyone not aponia
is fucking insane
not acknowledging it and even maybe keeping this cycle like this
making a dumb mistake is one thing
increasingly mad over this abyss fuck up
i'm actually
and it'll also prob be the only single week forever LMAO
like there is 1 (one) single week where me not having v2v matters rn
and also, this is literal first world problems
between v2v and HoH, i'd rather waaaaaaaaaaay have HoH
i mean to be clear
yeah i think the same
LMAO
the day after her shill ends
pulling for v2v
i'll feel very dumb
and also
i mean yeah but if i pull for her i won't afford HoH
for abyss player it's probably the complete opposite
i mean i'm MA player
because i've never been fucked over not having aponia, but i am (about to be) fucked over by not having v2v
between aponia and v2v, the one i wish i didn't skip more is def v2v
and it's the same thing with wolf
husk with HoT aponia is like +5 over HoT strat but that's because of the bug, she's just going to be worse alternative to HoT strat after the bugfix
as a mainly MA player, that hasn't changed
husk being matched by SW and wolf being matched by mobius but mobius strat being waaay harder
i held the stance that she was nice to have but not necessary for MA, having good score in husk and wolf
back when i skipped aponia
though to be clear
so much stuff i just go fuck no this is why i left LMAO
but it's like meeting back with an abusive ex
i racked up 5k hours in like 3 years there
i'm trying to go back to runescape
yeah that's how i feel rn
besides that not really
and counterside kinda similar, but trying to get into it in the first place
like i play runescape like once a week and i'm trying to get back into it
not actively
i don't work like that <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
even if side event is fun, i can't really keep a game on the side where i only do side event
and if the bald isn't fun then i'll leave
i'm balder
is that it doesn't matter if side event is fun
i mean the thing with me
i like most character, really fun event actually
hua is pretty cool
though mobius is pretty close for how simple she is to play too
my cat is already at 30, i think she is my favorite for how braindead she is
i guess it makes sense though
that's pretty low
oh shit really?
i started it today LMAO
on the dice event
for a fc
what's max lvl
LMFAO
you forgot i'm quitting the game
i love how
on a phys team
FR uses like iris paga
cause to be clear, the stage info is still wrong, so something's fucked
but less so
which is still incredibly stupid from mihoyo
selected a test weather
so they probably
yeah
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
how do things go this badly
that you make a fucking entirely new weather instead of just using the one from CN
how the fuck do you fuck up so badly
like i fucking hope this is not a bug/mistake
it might be a bug
fuck HoS, DA and SW owners - mihoyo
our type counter husk is paralyse instead of hitcount
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
they fucked us over
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
i guess i never had any chance to begin with
i can kinda follow refs
that's actually debatable
i can actually follow refs
it's different
LMAO

i never learn
yeah i always slacc sp valk farming
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
3* dudu and 2s griseo
my issue is
share but i might be following that one already
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
who's left to run
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
share strats
lmk if you can score higher than 773
everyone above me is a hacker <:Madge:909232418379153418>
and it isn't humanly possible to get those 6 seconds
i swear i'm like -6 from tank
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
same but fuck tank
i dunno how well you can score on husk with margrave eden
where are you using first turg? heimdall?
fragile said they could get 696 with dudu elf
no klein i think you need to do some alterations to rot
o yeah hmm
i feel like i can get consistently 696
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
is it that bad
huh
what are you running on husk
for fun :)
yeah exact same rewards
but i can't because lightning support
i want revenge
god i wanna run mobius on wolf
just play better
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
that's -2 from what i can get with mobius
that's actually pretty good
it's unironically more of a FR and fischl DPS than HoT <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
yeah there's a lot of drawings of it, just search hot wolf pics on google
before 7tr
she used to like around match SpA strat
if you're doing v2v kosma, you'll prob do HoT wolf
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
yeah i'm going to sleep in a totally normal and reponsible time
oh sheesh
so i have time to bald
and MA closes 6am my time
and then i'm waking up like 11pm my time
i mean i am going to sleep like soon
yeah
i'll try more tomorrow
okay i'm bored of doing tank and husk
yeah keep safe
you're still HoH bait
well i dunno if normal
cause i'm autistic probably LMFAO
is mainly meta talk
but the only thing that happens here
this is my refugee spot
<a:peepoLeave:646986909381558273>
on husk
728 is impossible
since it's not any combo atk, it's specifically the last hit of the combo atk
well, i guess it's more likely that cosmic effect in specific is coded in that way
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
that's like the only way a mistake like that would happen
separately
has to code fucking every valk <-> weapon interaction
the fact that this is an issue means that mihoyo
would be coded as such so it's activated every combo atk
like one would think that a weapon which has an effect based on combo atks
this is actually insanely scary though
similar thing
carole air charged was bugged for like 8 patches <:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
i believe that so easily
that's
LMAO
fuck turg cat
actually i would with turg cat
and i wouldn't complain
i could have one AKA every week
nah AKA is fucking sick
all my homies hate abyss husk
fuck abyss husk
MA husk is fun
keep only MA husk
same
cause husk has aponia bug still
i guess two
<:2woggers:658553078420602901>
that's under average!!
only one bugged boss this patch
literally on queue
LMFAO
for fuck sake
oh i miss otto!
sheeesh
wait that's actually like 5 weathers
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
than i can score
abyss weather
that's one more
i mean tbf
LMAO
i do similar stuff for jizo
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
asap on spawn you elf ult so you can have it for p2
you elf ult like laughably early
it's a very funny ref
<:Deadge:958122498019434496>
that's -5
i'm at 773
theres 853 ref with 3*
but you can score with 3*
and yeah 4* dudu helps a lot for tank
but no luck yet
i'm -1 from husk, i've gotten veeeery close to cap
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
skill issue
and i can't do it
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
to cap
the 2 easiest 3s bosses rn
we literally have
am i ever going to cap any 3s boss is the question
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
and then achieve neither
so i'm going to put all my energy in MA
t10 MA more important than t5 abyss
<:Peepo:995051282505154641>
RL road trip
i wasn't even going for a fast run, just farming coin
just get lucky i think
i dunno
oh shit! i beat 5 mins!
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
wrong type of correct*
sorry
wrong type of trip
<a:peepoTrip:755692813320060959>
just RL road trip
though i guess who the fuck cares either way LMAO
cause fuck husk
on husk
so i can take -200
i want +100
i mean
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
10% ice dmg off of that alone
so i'm missing like
it's also HB lead
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
cause i have 2s HB
i'm underscoring
i'll just say
i'll try to get 75x and then i'll go do more fun stuff
wow i just got so lucky i can go for 2s! not elf yet though
yeah i'm pulling for rank up but just a few! really! like s1 and s2, not ready for elf yet
i was like yeah i have every valk but i'm not whale enough for elf yet
tbh i was just very in denial for a long while
ss PE and 3* dudu
me and my ss mobius 3* klein <:Clueless:996308692133761094>
and this nyx strat isn't that hard
i'm outscoring a lot of s0 and 2s v2v
cause like
is the v2v strat hard?
god i suck
maybe this is enough for +100?
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
because you're playing as a single valk instead of a team with a very different playstyle than in abyss
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
but it's still a different experience
i think the mechanics are the same as paralyse husk in abyss
we have 3 in abyss, 1 in MA and 1 in ER
yo <@524782681389793280> how do we search between the 5 different husks
lmfao
bad whale, only has money, f2p ely player can beat score easily
finally those whales get put at their place
skill issue modifier
memorial abyss
MA
FR is not that bad in the one true gamemode memorial abyss
god i wish i wasn't a slaccer and already had 3s griseo
i wanna do more memorial abyss
just have to not suck at the game
i think i can promote this lobby with a 78x score
oh ok
wait it is?
oh no it's not
a fucking rare sw pri hb strat?
wait is that
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
thank you though
<:ohno:959752132905566261>

<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
wedge is on banner
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
nyx nirv refs
where are the
so
jesus christ gresham
and abyss husk so awful
why is MA husk so fun
very fun
this husk strat is actually
i'm -2
y'all want husk stream?
i think i'm just a little boomer
okay it's not thaaaat dank
<a:ppOVERHEAT:933892450450280488>
it's fucking
look at that strat though
but i now know for 3s you prob can't do that
damage threshold was easy for me to reach cause i'm 2s1
i dunno if you're higher or not
to get the score i got
it wasn't that bad
what the fuck
dankiest shit i've ever seen
this strat is the fucking
these are now my last unmaxed pri
besides, this is like the last pri i need to max
you're talking with 2s0 can't match s0 damage keilo here
that's for normal player
ready for HoH
i'm uh
i did it
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
still no 3s griseo though
for this week MA
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
should i max ely pri
before the changes it was easier to t50 than to retain
and 72nd on myriad
i got 3rd on my bracket
how much easier nirv is now
kinda depressing
also it's fucking
i'm only s0 nyx pleb
please be gentle greSSham sama
<:Wokege:996346539364601876>
:feelsagony5man:
and i'm 2nd rn <:ohno:959752132905566261>
that's 8 points over my current score
so name updates on t100
time to go get +1
LMAO
and p2 with one rot with AE ult and raven ult
i did p1 with BBB on AE
last tank in RL
yeah if you have to 3 rot the thing it's actual hell
playing RL like it's nirv
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
yeah that's nirv strats
i remember not even needing to AE ult on p1
this fight in RL tho
braindead LMAO
it's like
or you rank scam with s2+ like me
if you got a good s0 acc
yeah, it's not hard
and i don't think i will since my ely pri is lv50 and i don't think i can afford to max it
though i haven't done tank with ely before
yeah sure i can try to help
if this promotes, game's dead
shit score but i don't wanna bald abyss
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
not going to be able to use her
my ely pri not maxed
honestly i saw that and thought wow they changed our week
triple ely week
<a:bugcatdeadpat:898434851160604684>
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
bring atk speed stigs
sounds like skill issue to me
coffee so powerful
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
thank u coffee
lfg
MORE summer lite?
we're getting
i also don't think they're RL
i don't know anyone masters still <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
for you it only takes 1 patch? waow
the closer they are to CN, the faster they're banned
it's rs3 tho, i don't have the attention span for osrs
i need uh teams for some new stuff i wanna do
oh talking about runescape, if anyone plays it
i'm going back to runescape
<:sleepy:914211439286304778>
i don't wanna deal with jizo and kosma
i'm going to 2% and sleep this week
FR isn't dealing much damage
then you don't need to affix it
i mean if you're running turg FR
SS MA i mostly see zhenyi or irene
for SS MA it depends
for SSS MA often yeah
for abyss generally no
depends
griseo killer killer
do you mean GKK
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
look at my new collection
i honestly dunno even what was the purpose of that seele arc
griseo killer
HoC -> GK
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
call VKE DH -> dead himeko
i actually think it's kinda based if every abbreviation spoiled the story
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
it's fake kiana
FK is not fire kiana
PE -> OK
?
original kiana
would you prefer
iriya calls PE RK <:ohno:959752132905566261>
ruby's using iriya abbreviations
i don't think HoF beats nyx on bloodlust
she's strong, cheap and easy to play
they all have p bad tf
only issue is that neither v2v neither both current fire support are good in MA
yeah v2v performs well enough even with our current fire supports
but not entirely
i mean it is a little her fault
the worst thing you can say about her is that she sucks in MA but it's not like they care about MA
yeah what's the issue with v2v
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
look at this shit
very good for when i don't want to think and just hold A
i'm lazy but i'm glad i have nyx
cause if i want to i can just 15k and leave
nirv is less work than rl
i'm lazy
my bracket uh
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
carv the nirv retainer
<a:praygirl_hh:757338631747928161>
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
damn then i don't approve
i approve if it's that
for another newt?
why
<:5Head:995381294538178560>
my mind is overfilling with useless information
200 red for g4 stig
150 red for g3 stig
200 purple is for g2 weapon
maybe even too long
see, for SS MA that's good enough
shui T has duration??
than tesla T
isn't shui T better
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
i haven't even started the event
sheeeesh
2023 MA update -> removed time fracture interaction with clock
<a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
i dunno i haven't logged in today
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
like 200 is prob t100 score
who cares
that's 760, +1 over s0 HoF
there u go
but i can't find refs
actually i have no clue, i'm pretty sure HoT and ely should score slightly higher than HoF
i think people went with ely tho
but she should be top pick
so yeah pretty big jump, not many people used HoT on tank because of that i think
2s SW was 664
2s SW was 632 i think?
2s HoT can 728 husk
yeah the independent skill thing she got buffed over
and it isn't fixed yet either
but no, without that
i don't think that's worth it on MA
oh
thought they fixed them all
are there HoT bugs to abuse?
husk
2s can 712 apparently
especially with the ER stamps now
i think 2s is expected for s0 player
it's something like 3 seconds faster than HoF
is HoT
for s0 player
new cap
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
than 3 HoF week
that's more of a 3 HoT week
do mine next
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
ruthless carv
honestly yeah i think you're fine
sheeesh!
so i guess?
made to shill her when she released
it is the carole stage
i mean
i don't remember people complaining last time it showed up
didn't know this side stage was an issue
a lot of people are having issues apparently
<:MonkaS:909232418588872794>
maybe you can run HoS SA griseo?
when it released, i used to run HoS carole SA
hmm i ran PE HoS griseo
and yeah mihomo doesn't care about it ig
<:Shrug:616394597211439118>
soo ???
but then next cycle they were still nirv
and then by the end of the cycle the score wasn't there anymore
it was a weird one, they got t1 on a cycle
from memory i can only remember one
it's awful
now there's so many tho
before
there were a few hackers in nirv
yeah no i don't think so
<a:HACKERMANS:842326702162968596>
wait you get v2v for free if you hack?
<:FelisHoryShit_hg:991904159064404048>
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
....rest?
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
and not bother with the 3s ones
and do 0s all the 3 ss bosses
unironically stop lite at s
i'll just
i'm dumbass i guess
o yeah you're right
cause i'm pretty sure you're supposed to do the other way around
show moriso ref?
but that's for the HoF BD RC kill
literally press weapon active -> press dodge
cause it's not very hard
you either can do it or you don't know how to do it
i mean that's wrong
with LE
yeah i dunno if 946 is possible
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
if you have switch cd elf
you doing the wrong rot LMAO
especially accounting with
i mean yeah 893 is already pretty good
she feels like she has .5s lag on every input
it's laughably bad
and it's so bad
where you have to evade on LE
there's some strats
LE is so fucking bad to play
yeah
could be wrong tho
something something HoT switches out faster?
yeah
and not getting it for some reason
i remember pat trying
also i dunno if you can 0s with LE
yeah it's definitely that, if you evade -> weapon you don't end up on ground
or just switch out entirely
most of the time you cancel it out with weapon active
it's so fucking rare to see the full evade animation
to cancel out the long ass evade animation
usually it's evade -> weapon
and weapon -> evade is pretty rare
i think if you're ending on ground you're doing something wrong
so flexible
i think to this day one of the best, she feels so fucking good to play
she's pretty clean
but HoF?
LE controls suck
wow
i believe in you
if you have the damage then it's all fast hands
fast hands are p necessary
yeah
i think you can? i actually don't remember how HoF hepha goes <:ohno:959752132905566261>
actually idk if you can 0s with combo
are you killing on ult
wth
i only vote for my favorite characters and then cry when they lose
y'all watch the fights?
only straight people in honkai dummy
nah they wouldn't
<a:PU_peepoRiot:778676108152274974>
just a guy instead of an archon like he deserves
su became a random person lmfao
but eh idk, fucking
old dendro archon genderswapped mobius
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
well, we can get old dendro archon = morb
it makes so much more sense
yeah and i'm still mad over it
and she's already mar 7th probably
i'm like 100% sure she'll be in genshin somehow eventually
but yeah i do think ely is going to be a new recurring character going forward
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
did you see how they slaughtered her
they didn't deserve a mei either
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
my ely = alice copium is spreading
lfg
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
i've been t50 in NA that wouldn't even t100 in SEA
but below that it was laughable the difference
or, was
like the top 30 or so MA spots in NA and SEA is about same level of competitiveness
it's worse now though
it was pretty bad already
i mean we've always been slacc on MA
you'd think with time it'd get more competitive to keep your name on leaderboards for a boss as easy as heph
there's like 40 0s on hepha rn i think
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
50% of them have already quit
of that 1%
tbh
yeah
just sucks for me, in specific
honestly mihoyo might make more money <:ohno:959752132905566261>
so even if honkai competitive dies, it won't change much for avg player
and people still play it
and it's still making money
genshin fucking sucks for competitive players
i mean not that it matters for mihoyo or 99% of population
like competitive-wise
honestly it really does feel like hi3 is on it's last legs now
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
game's dead
save for honkai 4
<a:chadn:977032787087482962>
and then not even pulling cause the game's ending anyways
is saving until 7.0 since the last valk released will be the strongest
the true chad gacha mindset
pretty based
honestly
aponia doesn't even wins when she gets buffed <:ohno:959752132905566261>
yeah i think it's pretty likely
wait ruby voted aponia?
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
15% win rate right now
i'm at like
of fucking course not
not to be confused with boobnya
boobnia
yeah... all in...
<:FelisHoryShit_hg:991904159064404048>
i'm betting for cat
<a:PU_peepoRiot:778676108152274974>
fuck BKE without those crit rate buffs
without 2s1 BKE and 3s griseo
i'm not balding 3s jizo
i've decided
also not like i can even run it anyways cause no hekate pri
actually missing 5 sp for this strat <:ohno:959752132905566261>
<:Deadge:958122498019434496>
because no 3s griseo
i shall suffer
MA score table 
god fucking damn it
<:ohno:959752132905566261>

yeah
for fgo
theoretical max score
what's
and we'll go wow mihomo powercreep or whatever the fuck genshin player says

<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
feel like most games i used to play like runescape, WoW i always took for granted that there was a long lived community of a game that existed for so long before
though it is kinda crazy to be playing games that didn't exist when i was born
is not that old <:PepeHands:909232418211364957>

next few weeks are actually pretty good for me
and then random assortment of normal 3s bosses
we'll have 3 +20% 3s bosses per patch
with double 3s bosses
i wonder if
actually i guess it goes give a bunch
cause it doesn't drop that much sp does it
i dunno if 3s tona is going to be good for v2v
i think she unironically might
with 7t
do you think HoT is stealing sss tona
hey leave her be
<a:GamingtheYTAlgorithm:995465139446886551>
it's nyx time
yeah mihoyo intern just does w/e the fuck they want ig
i guess performance doesn't matter but i do think overall nirv score avg will go down probably
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
for dist to grow?
isn't it a lil weird
hmmm
it's going to at least double, right?
as population inflates a good amount
i am legit scared of what nirv is going to look like in a few cycles
maybe a bit of both
which was clear to retain too
and it wasn't bracket luck, cause i know of at least one more bracket
maybe it'll be better on less awful cycles
nirv is a joke now
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
was actually clear boss to retain
my bracket last couatl
i mean it is wishful thinking
so fucking bad
couatl is just
i hope whale and tona aren't that bad
cause i swear that shit
are there even people who are good at qua weather
and she is still plenty useful before the 3s too
she'll still be useful a year in
i do think like, even if new player joins now and takes a year to 3s
i dunno if ely will die this soon
and now i'm like rushing for 3s cause she's still used <:ohno:959752132905566261>
back when i started i hold off on buying FR frags cause i thought she was on her last leg
but for budget/f2p player she can take care of a lot + for cheap xtal wise
like if you have plenty of other stuff already then she isn't going to do much
with the weather changes idt that's the case anymore though
cause 3s ely outscored 2s BKE/s0 nyx
she was unironically t1 for s0 player before they changed qua weather
she's a fucking deal and a half on xtal cost for low spender/f2p
+ yeah time is money, but what else are you even spending that AL on? it's p much either her or FR
but she's t2 at a lot
i mean yeah top score wise she's not exceptional, a lil under average with only SK and ranged tank
and it's on bp now
ice team is also another one that's very cheap cause you're getting turg anyways
like HoS and griseo on release
it's all valks you're ideally pulling for anyways
because they're so strong
like nowadays every dps need their team geared, and out of all teams, phys team is quite cheap
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
see when that's what's going on below nirv
what
w
like for low spender/f2p she's nuts
and even at s0 she can compete at RL and below
i mean yeah but she takes a year to rank up without xtal
covers a ton
she's cheap af
nah i hard disagree
i think ely is pretty good
but you can farm her to 3s + she's p cheap
like about same as other s0 gacha valks
i think s0 ely is avg strength valk
eh idk
she's a monster in SS MA but that's going away
but they're pretty open in RL and below
yeah without PE you don't really have any chances for img cycles in nirv
even for PE probably
you can't afford to backpull imo
if you can't afford HoH
i'd have to buy the stamps for 2s
yeah i'm at 2/25 for 2s DA
i can see that
yeah
only a few strats that actually make use of the sp
aren't there like
for the sweet 2% fire
i regret not getting 2s AE from AE bp
my 2s DA is mainly for dorm
yeah tbh
LMAO
cause i have ss PE
and it did nothing
i unlocked s3 today
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
2s1 DA and 2s2 BKE
like i am getting both
yeah
cause she's used waaaay more often
and i think i wanna go for that asap
it'll take a while for me to get 2s2 BKE later
i dunno, i think if i get 2s DA rn
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
do i even care about MA
well the true question is
should i get her to 2s before
my DA is s3
oh god we're getting pig soon aren't we
<a:chadn:977032787087482962>
chad behaviour
that's
mat issue
cause they didn't have the mats <:ohno:959752132905566261>
and i know a lot of people who pulled for v2v didn't even use her to retain
was v2v cycle
like this first cycle
i mean i dunno if it's pull or die
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
thursday, friday, saturday, sunday MA bald
personally, it's usually monday tuesday wednesday sleep
friday saturday sunday abyss bald
thursday MA bald
monday tuesday wednesday abyss bald
is
i think what mihoyo expects from us
well it depends
thursday is chillday though
lmfao
no MA -> sleep in
my weekend was monday tuesday <:ohno:959752132905566261>
during quarantine i swear my weeks were based on honkai schedule
honestly
if you don't know how it works
yeah the moriso thing is a bit confusing
jeeeesus
that's more than my 2s1 HoT i think
jfc
yeah i don't have that
oh god
what do you want
i'll trade
ofc
of your box collection
this is the start
your mind is too big for me
true why didn't i think of that
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
i'm missing nothing
besides rank ups, elf rank ups and aponia/v2v
for me to spend on
there was literally nothing
i mean
skipped that spending <:Sadge:715448677162024980>
cause i don't have the neon either
i haven't decided if i'm buying it or not yet
the frills are cute
i like the summer one too though
i really like the different tail design
yeah the neon is too good
like if you showed me leaks of it and told me it was recolor i'd go oh ok
so fucking close to her original to me lmao
i dunno why, griseo just looks
yeah all the others look very nice
so many skins this patch jesus LMAO
of the 5 actually
on how different they make the valk look
it's the worse of the 3
like imo
yeah it's kinda dumb
but it feels like it should be free like the other ones
it's cute
like i don't dislike it
griseo skin kinda sucks
but also
i don't think there's anything i want from the black card
ticket -> skin maybe?
i don't even know what i'm going for
mihomo so kind, so nice
one day though
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
but HB is still like 300
griseo is like 170 frags to 3s
i'm still missing HB and griseo
oh sheeesh
i'm sitting at 13m rn
it gets better eventually
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
i understand you
i understand you nini
lmfao the coin
reading it back i can imagine it being even a small buff for v high dist
yeah that makes sense
that's actually quite a bit of changes for v3d i think
and there's a loooot more
that was a buff
yeah i think i just read one line
oh god nvm
lmfao
didn't she get buffed
what can even be doomposted about v3d
and she said she saw green seele at the works
my mom works at mihoyo
trust
wendy's coming back
actually no
mihoyo forgot about them
but performance they're about avg valk i think
they do a lot to not let them die
i mean longevity absolutely there is herrscher bias
which is still pretty good to have
only longevity wise nowadays
tbh performance wise i don't think there's herrscher bias anymore
and grab stuff for cheap
is just go for new stuff
i mean best spending for RL
i dunno
and the good players will get diluted
so we'll get more lobbies
in the few next cycles, more people will join nirv
since that was the first cycle of nirv changes
nirv might get easier in the near future
i think?
she's just like avg valk for avg player probably, while slightly above average for spender since she is cheaper
yeah i can agree with that
i doubt it'll matter that much
i mean yeah but for RL
and she can live without 4/4, can prob run thales M i imagine
+ v2v herself is cheaper than nyx
instead of 2 gear set like nyx needed
only need to pull for 1 valk 1 gear set
margrave is craftable, neb on dorm exchange
since slug could've been gotten for cheap
well, at least that's way less expensive than nyx
like 4/4 supports
issue is she might be close to needing nyx levels of investment to keep up, unfortunately
she'll prob suffice for RL needs on fire
if you have a good v2v
i mean tbh
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
cause ruby might be going a bit too far if so
was that actually ruby's fault
lmfao
but cez p chill
with reapplication
newt was kinda mald
yeah
intended purpose
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
BB with bastet TB mei M
last week i used it on doom
bastet B was a good investment trust
it's pretty hard to compete with a support that give as much numbers as HB and takes 0 field time
cause it'll just be HB again
will just feel awful
but the problem with the ways they can force turg out
i lowkey agree but i think there are ways they can force turg out
eh i dunno
lightning is so fucking powerful rn it's kinda insane lmao
and ice is pretty nice
yeah lightning is fucking stacked
lmfao
and then they released griseo
and then they released carole
phys was fine with HoS and SA
i dunno if mihoyo agrees
i mean you say that
and imo she's still got at least a year left prob
the question is not if it'll happen, it's how soon it'll happen
it's inevitable
she is going to be powercrept eventually
i mean the thing is
like the adv supply, maybe bp too soon
i'd just worry about her being made available for cheaper in the near future
value-wise
for both abyss and MA
is prob still the best 3s in the game
3s senti
tbh
senti deserves everything
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
i hope she stays broken
kinda stupid 3s lmao
and then i can see the 3s HoS making a difference
it makes sense though
that sounds annoying lmao
on nirv
you do 2 rots on p1
oh
idk
and then farm sp on transition maybe
and insta ult
cause like you can run neb
in this fight
is 3s HoS even that big tho
that's stupid LMAO
in nirv?
jfc
and then you're giga fucked
or you can't 1 shot
and then you can compete and have to fight over singular digits
either you can 1 shot w/e
issue with PE bosses is that
yeah
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
NA knows how to play
PE is the only valk
sounds awful LMAO
kinda glad i'm not nirv rn
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
yeah i can imagine
sounds boring af
and do the most straightforward rots possible
i guess it's just fast hands for better score
i can one shot p1 really easily
yeah i'm RL
lowkey depressing to watch the death of MA
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
no one did 3s boss early
14 people did 0s hepha today
also that's kinda sad that no one is doing early MA LMAO
lmao
that they disabled the boss
would've been so important
why being able to damage FGO during transition
also now i understand
yeah it felt really sloppy, i didn't know wtf to do on transition lmao
it's prob enough right
this was my first try
for fgo
what's a good score
uh
i'll farm the 10 pity tickets
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
i don't even mind losing at this point who cares
i'm going for the 10 straight losses
i'll choose felis
some AL
fucking share
goddamn
too simp
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
well i say that, by the time i get to that i'll be going for 3s of the new valk
i'm going to be done by the end of this patch i think, and then i'll go for ss2 CH and ss SK i think
FR and ely
hows your
how do you have the AL
share?
even more babies than i am
i forget you 2 are babies
sick
lucky 7
one more for straight 7
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
matches left??
7
there's
how far can i lose
nah i'm enjoying this
we can't both lose
so fucking well
you know me
it's great to wake up to the 10 pity tickets
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
the true green
is all green
my gambling history
i'm so good at this
riiiiight
eventually
we must win at least one
it's fiiiine
<@213811388546678794> <:wavekawaii:590500669119660053>
i'm not wavering on my vote for my favorite valk
i'm voting for ely on ely vs v2v
that's a lot of dailies
damn
my parents call me loser on a constant basis
i'm used to losing
i can just lose
you don't gain anything by winning right
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
and i went for sakura on both
on the next 2
i already voted
oh...
no way we both lose right
and vote for different ones
we should plan it out
same
hey ruby
again
all of them
i lost
i think
on doing that
honkai is really efficient
<:CryoAmber:914211455123992616>
i'm the victim here, the only thing i gained from retaining was more suffering and bullying
all luck no skill
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
you know turg cat it was just pure lottery
IT ACTUALLY UNIRONICALLY WASN'T
that's a good name for someone who uses glasses and can't read
i literally didn't snipe that time!! ;_;
i snipe the 6th place
lmfao
i hide my score and then demote
i mean i barely snipe
<:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
on being mean
i need to work
am i kind
and kind
lsa is very nice
nvm snipe
to even do abyss
playing counterside and tower of fantasy
people are too occupied
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
there's an armada of hackers there
yeah in ma for sure
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
because of hacker
or t100
imagine being kicked out of retain
us global were fine before but now...
can't even imagine now
sea was already p bad
well, that we know about at least
in global
it's kinda impressive we only have one for now
it's our hacker
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
just annoying and tanky <:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
i don't have aponia
everything else i'll at least try
and it's sushang and couatl
that i sorta refuse to even try
2 bosses
there's only like
<:worrynirvanajail2_hh:828444826822508554>
and then i'm
so i get 2 more RL cycles
so i can speedrun scores on a friend's phone
though i don't have a pc yet on college so it's prob better that i go back to RL
i didn't bother cause i got annoyed LMAO
insanely slacc
this is
i should've scuffed a kill to stay here
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
so you don't have to suffer like that
is making 2 margrave
the true endgame
cause i'm going to be done with FR and ely by then i think
with that kind of gear
than sp valk
i'd rather it'd be wt/free s-rank
eh i mean
with free piece?
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
well i guess they could do s-rank + sp valk
it's anniv
o yea true
only missing griseo and hb right now
or am i going to finally catch up on sp valks
6.1 is going to be sp valk
do we think
skill issue eli
is that how it works
oh shit
i have couatl ptsd
i just want easiest
is HoT easier
just blind i guess
i am subbed to lux lmao
thank you
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
idk i'm tired from college and i'm running it last second
or should i run anything else
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
for nirv
s0 nyx ref
do we have
hey gamers
through the 445-455 range
we're line sine waving
dist went +2 on sushang, -1 on AKA
at this point
nah
at random
intern-kun draws a number
yeah it's pretty simple actually
i got the lose 3 straight ones
lmao
SEA might be different (?)
oh this is global though
lmfao
lost all
and then elysia if hua was not around
i went for hua on the ones hua was around
same
mobius
i'm good at gambling
i'm on tet's team on getting it on bp
but yeah i'm going to feel bad over skipping v2v
i still don't mind skipping aponia
yeah her animations look fun
:skipge:
i realise i actually like her quite a bit LMAO
because after playing v2v a bit on the tutorial stuff
i actually am upset
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
what even is this cycle
lmao
sheeeesh
good job
<a:PatPat:814547161878364190>
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
new wallpaper just dropped
<:Deadge:958122498019434496>
ive seen nothing besides carvs beta gameplay
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
so many fucking bugs lately
how's there
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
wth mihoyo
there's bug abusing?
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
nirv is now more kind than rl
also if you think about it
+ hacker
here's the i don't wanna do the boss gang
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
without the bug
mobius is a lot more boring
wow
source: i haven't played the event yet and she's pretty
hua
yeah i'm voting on my favorite characters too
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
i think he means from s0 -> 2s
only 10 more now
10 atk
<:pepeW:996346590086303805>
that sounds right
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
and if you're missing damage, you're forced to do another long rot
so you don't have flexibility to do shorter rots or w/e
and then valks made for qua enemy have long rots, usually the length of qua enemy downtime
is having strict downtime for dps
because core design of qua enemy
it's just extra bad for nyx
on numbers
every ice valk has the same issue, because WE is so big
that one is not mihoyo fault
i mean
cause WE is so big
you can play her without WE, her dps just won't keep up for nirv
like if you're missing cb19 and her rotation just doesn't work
though it's not like the rest of the team
for qua bosses
which is especially awful
3* WE is often the difference between one rot -> two rot
if you're missing one thing
so bad
her dps falls
but in nirv
like, not mechanically
yeah
even though they're not great bosses
i like 3s wolf and 3s husk
i understand though
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
ty carl
<a:superbonk:709321232876699678>
do mine then
wtf
no matter wtf you do
couatl is mald
i mean
before
i mean she was the best option
but i think mine sucks
i think i can try nyx
if not v2v
what is people even running
i have the hacker also
lmao
3 people who tried
between the uh
i think that's t1 on my bracket rn
with the nirv changes
i wonder if RL dist will go lower
is still paper when you compare it to nirv
paper RL can be difficult if you're not prepared
i mean ofc
if those people did one nirv they'd agree that RL is paper
it's about in comparison
i mean sure but like
it's eye opening experience
you say that because you haven't been to nirv
you understand
once you take a peek at nirv
trust me baban
and i'm the flexer
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
gresham literally said it first
?????
cause RL is already paper enough to be a playground to me
lowkey i think it'd be kinda boring
same
<a:PU_peepoRiot:778676108152274974>
a3 player doesn't get to meme
the gang's coming
square up
oko getting badmouthed?
that's cute though
this makes me so fucking mad for some reason LMFAO
lmfao
does he even have spicy opinions or anything
also wtf can they even be badmouthing oko over
about the entirety of my contribution to maincord
that's
and i found out where the normal people are at (i assume)
and after that some people like biri² and lsa caught me
then i went there to troll
first was to help, then people got mad at me cause i was talking about future bp info
i've went there 3 times i think
...why?
wait you're there?
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
in their eyes
i can see the coin issue
half stigs unmaxed
i feel for them
lmfao
it's supposed to be skip
was a typo
that
oh
maid ely?
prob the good move would be to skin <:ohno:959752132905566261>
and can't afford s2/ss HoH
and you're like looking to retain nirv
i think if there was no nirv changes
unironically could be better to just skip
might be better
<:sleepy:914211439286304778>
there's some cycles which a good s0 score could consistently retain on most brackets
in global, depending on cycle you didn't even need that much luck
but now you don't need the luck anymore
and skill
with luck you could def do it before
yeah
with ss0 ofc, i just suck
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
i think i unironically retained with s0 score once
then you're excommunicated
once they realise your opinions are different and you sound like an actual nirv player
yeah <:ohno:959752132905566261>
ruby's just one more drop in the water
it's their main course
about misinfo
maincord doesn't fucking care
the thing is
<:Wokege:996346539364601876>
i miss balding
i'm updating the game
so really you're just doing what's best for you
it's a competitive game in the end
oh no
you went joker mode
LMFAO
rather pull for kevin valk
are we doomposting HoH now?
we skipping?
even if they look p useless for you
you prob never get rid of first copies
for competitive player
this is why
lmfao
forgot that she needs the stack refill
nyx absolutely wants cb19
oh yeah wait nvm
so i could just turn one of them into a dupe sw pri
i have 3 cb19
<:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
tbh i might go for being the first whale to have a dupe sw pri
yeah
everyone was using that
last freeze huodou
those bosses just don't show up often, but like
on nyx/HoR teams it was consistently used tho
just no one maxed a dupe SW pri to run on HB
so it's theoretically BiS on SW team too i think
it even stacks tho
always was, just no one was whale enough to run a dupe of it
it's her BiS, generally
a lot of old valks aren't thaaaat weak if you can ult consistently
it's all pardo's fault tbh
he did VT dps
i mean i'm sure he's going to use AE on actual boss
i see
oh LMAO
that he uses to clear mobs
iriya gets a pass, this is definitely one of the least copium options of his
that's just iriya tho
i mean
<a:ppPoof:933892148380721163>
image got
have more respect
you're lowballing it gresham
yea
oh
that's our boss?
wait
gamer's gaming
gamer
on their message board they have drunklightning?
check whoever has meme name
they'll need to
guess they're tired of using her maybe?
lmao
idt
since after 5.5 we haven't had a chance to get AE
it's only like alright if they're new player
then it's worse
if they took a break
i mean
what the hell
i mean there's noooo way
<:tericrosshic:640175520146784287>
i fucking
with no ae
they pulled for ss v2v
no fucking way
the ss v2v one?
she needs the longer rots
v2v needs raven AE
soon enough they'll discover
just figuring out the valk
lmfao
the last one had 2s v2v
that's another person nini
wait
tf is wrong with them
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
does that even score
how much
<:notLikeDuck:959751977426899015>
the turg tm
gacha gamer behaviour
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
what why
lmfao
i'll stop here
yeah s3 is a good stopping point
don't think i've ever met someone who went
stops at s3
yeah i don't think anyone ever
retiring before 2 year mark
going all out, having our fun
yeah we're just celine lite
and retired before 500 days
she went 9s every valk, t1 MA
celine lite
we're all celine now
<:worrynirvanajail2_hh:828444826822508554>
patch notes:
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
they removed it
and jesus christ
cause he spends a lot of time on maincord
i mean he must right
think hes slowing down for genshin
even keebs taking it slow
neffr keeb
on t100 its like
so little actual old player
i think at this point we have like
1 month in and already exalted
yeah
you'd suffer in exalted
prob would work but
like the weekly + monthly foca cards
yeah i assume everyone is like monthly + bp + the higher value bundles
is probably bad
which i guess
i assume they're mid spender LMAO
if you wanna be competitive, you never skip sp gear
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
for player like you or nini
who tf would even give that advice
finished the 4/4 on foca
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
in 60 pulls
5 cards
he got fucking
did you read reinbex tales?
counterside gamer
ty
i see
i'm a dumbass
OOOOH
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
isn't that only one character
hows the gacha that expensive
huh
so it'll be harder to get mega unlucky
with the new banner, foca has the 200 pity
is avg
about 91-93
with the new banner
these are averages
simulating: FocusedSupply4Guarantee-50-wish
mean: 92.906414
median: 91.0
mean 4-star weapon count: 4.532874
mean 4-star count: 11.776413
this is for gear
contacting mihomo
on it
ok
there's a spike there
you can see how in the curve
i think it's better to expect around 380 for valk
xtal i assume you mean
150
by accounting with soft pity, avg pulls for valk went from 51.9 -> 48.2
but we'd have to whale watch to figure out if there's soft pity and if there is, how it works
and i can tell you then
i can make a fast simulation if we assume there's no soft pity
maybe cn community has data on it
i dunno if anyone knows the avg cost of an elf card
depending how lucky you are though
most of the times you'll get the 40 frags during the 3 cards
you need 3 cards + 40 frags
well, depends actually
you need 3 cards, that i know
i do not, no
i feel like thats harder lmao
damn
but v little anime
i'm reading a lot of manga now
into manga
i've pivoted
cause now i'm like, if i watch a cour in a week that's above average
that much time
where the fuck did i even find
god honestly
i swear i'll get to it
<- they say, not having watching either of the show
yeah i can see that i think
oh i see
oh ok
i thought bunny girl was down to earth LMAO
cause monogatari has vampires and shit
that just changed my image of bunny girl a lot
what the fuck
and also
oh that's another one that's in my list
i dunno if i got much more than ooo so dark, so edgy back when i was like 14
but i haven't yet
it's very in my style to get into comically long media
yeah it's in my plan to get into monogatari eventually
i dunno how i'll feel about it now LMAO
and madoka was cool when i was a teenager
very good for when i'm not really watching it and doing something else
nisekoi i enjoyed as a trash mindnumber
i watched nisekoi and madoka from them
o yeah i can see that, shaft has some good well known stuff
like there's some shots in their recent shows which you are like jesus fucking christ, how much money did they spend on this
but i like it, and their animation is always like comically high quality
i think it's something in the eyes that just makes you go ah yes that's kyoani
it's not very far from the generic normal, and the character design between them all do kinda look the same
i do like kyoani a lot
yeah, i think i like moooost of their stuff
bones can also do some good stuff visual-wise
trigger mostly makes some pretty good looking stuff that doesn't blend in with literally every other anime ever
there's just some studios which are very... samey
eh there's some studios that come out with unique stuff
but if the story is good i can get behind it
very bland
the designs look
lycoris recoil
an anime?
apparently lycoreco is
lmao
alright
ah
topical honkai names
but iirc he only did like
it could be him
tka is sex name
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
you'll do all of them
and if you're a good waifu player
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
to not bald your favorite valk weather to death
not waifu enough
clearly there's something missing in the brain department
and in a3
and non-pri neb
with non-max pri
i mean 3s player
global doesn't know how to play HoF for some reason
clone kiana is kinda sleepy lmao
the real kiana maybe
new skin coming out right
mihoyo preying on the poor genshin players
hey i pulled for the ely you guys keep talking about
people on last week of 5.9
in yt and bilibili
just have to go looking for whale pull videos and livestreams
to figure it out
enough data
we prob do have
after all this time
i think they do
oh no
do i need to go whale watching
is there soft pity there too?
i don't wanna make more simulations
oh no
how much is an elf worth anyways
can easily make your foca card useless for the thing you actually want
now that we have sw and v2v banner
i mean foca cards are kinda scary too
yeah
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
lemme buy this so next year i can get that elf
irl investment levels of future thinking
doing fucking
yeah i guess lmao
cause even if they buy it out idk it's hard to say when they'll get the rest if at all
for most people, 50 is the same as 0
i mean is it?
you'll just get a card before getting the other 50 frags lmao
while pulling
you don't even get that many frags
i mean the thing is
who the fuck is that even for
only 50 is kinda fucked though
i guess that's potentially useful
hmmm
do we have elf frags outside of cn anniv spending event?
cn anniv is the one with free elf
i mean that is what is expected though
<a:PU_peepoRiot:778676108152274974>
and will never make any elf farmable
cause mihoyo just hates us i guess
meanwhile your elf will stay at 2* forever if you don't pull for it
you also can get the s2 later when they put that valk on spending event/bp
s0 4* elf >>>> s2 2* elf imo
i go like wow only 10 bucks for this skin? alright
even for other non-gacha games
yeah true
of going s0 -> 3s
70% of the price
and 2s -> 3s is like
people think that like honkai is bicc p2w and yeah the good players can make those powerboost matters, but in the grand scheme of things, most times 3s gets you like 50 points over 2s
like s0 no gear -> s0 with gear is waaaay bigger
tbh s0 -> 3s is not even that big of a powerboost
i mean yeah
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
maybe 3 3s with good luck
2 3s
i'd get like
on a few valks
but if i spent all the xtals i topped up
i'm a pretty big whale
it's kinda crazy to think that
for 3s + gear + 4* elf
yeah i'd believe that
you have like a 95% chance to be done before going the 2k mark
2k on the 3s valk only is def on the way higher side though
yeah
so it should be a bit cheaper
a whale will buy out all the bundles and stuff
though that's straight xtal
no gear ofc
so yeah about 1.5k for awk is right
and for awk valk was about $1470 on avg
like going for non awk 3s valk (no gear) on old banner was about $1230 on avg
i have the simulations, i can do the math on like going straight xtals for all of it
i think it's 1.2-1.3
nah i think it's a little less
is catching up to where you're only missing the newest thing
the hard part
which isn't that bad
150-200 bucks per patch
is like
player getting s0 + 4/4 every valk
honkai for like
i mean tbf
now you do
in the past you didn't need to
it's just that
i've said this before, game didn't really get more expensive if you wanna get everything
it's fucking so bad
is skippable currently
like so little
i mean it's just how competitive honkai is nowadays
i mean yeah sure
so easy to get 1st and they give a lot of trophies at the lower ones
6 cycles
you get back in rl in what like
i mean even for honkai
than if you take a break and only do the big events right now
you'll miss more primos if you quit entirely when you burn out for like half a year
and don't wanna miss out on primos or w/e
even if you're thinking from an efficiency standpoint
i mean yeah my advice to not burning out is just not forcing yourself to play
but it'll just take longer for that
once i do come back
i mean it does just mean i'll have even more to do
and then i'd be excited for the new stuff
i should've quit like 5 months earlier
i wish i didn't burn out of genshin lmao
like 4x the world bosses
double the amount of ground to explore
double the amount of story quest
now we have teapot, hangouts
yeah exactly, i also started at launch and there was already so much for like 2 weeks to do
like there's already so much already
how overwhelming it must be
though yeah imagine starting right now
so nuts
that'd be
and then unlocking a whole new area you've never heard about (enkanomiya)
with no voice acting
and then imagine doing a random world quest
imagine opening up the map and seeing the size of inexplored shit
so nuts
honestly there's so much stuff that in a few years from now on genshin would just be
and that's okay
yeah
not a fulltime game
and then come back every year to see the new continent and new areas
it's just a good game to play for 2 months or so
like i do think genshin is a good game
yeah that's how i feel too
are you playing it though
oh so you're just fucking with me
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
i'll be behind when i start playing on the weekend
y'all balding that already damn
that makes more sense
oh i thought it was 14 or older
what do they mean
what are those symbols
all my homies hate raids
fuck raids
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
just not raids
yeah i'm not saying it's good or fun
tf is wrong with yall
yes
than raids
easier
it's literally
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
on the blog!!!
i did warn people!!!
i personally do think pri stigs is more likely than another upgrade on weapons though
so we can call bri pri pri pri
i hope they make new pris just pri pri
it's a fucking raid boss
lmfao
for s0 player
at like 300 score
we'll see bosses like wolf
yeah if they make a new bracket with like +40 dist
next cny or next anniv
which i expect to see on like
realistically speaking, we might see a new bracket or a rebalance on them whenever we get lv90 with exalted2
yeah i don't either
than with his s0
and he'll prob have an easier time retaining
like you give keeby an acc with s2 or 2s HoF with shit dorm/dks/affix
yeah, though the biggest advantage is just skill
s2 is baseline for sw and v2v too, even for s0 player
2s HoT will also be the baseline after the ER stamps
like 2s1 BKE is going to be baseline after bp, even for s0 player
other, older valks will have different baselines depending on their availability
strictly gacha valks
yeah, i mean gacha valks
keeb's one
that consistently retained
in global we even had already some s0 players
with good hands, ofc
with the changes
like consistently
i do lowkey think with s0 you'll be able to retain nirv
with the changes
i expect nirv population to grow 2-2.5x
it's going to get worse
if you have a like medium geared acc and care about the game
RL is just piss easy
yeah, especially now with the changes
i don't doubt it's good enough for RL though
hmm i'd have to see how good that is
monet ppm newt?
monet goemon?
what do you even use on aponia
i mean i think it's pretty clear that it's getting worse
she ignites on her 5th normal attack
like DA can't fucking ignite without her stig set
so much of new valks just have parts of her core skillset locked behind her gear
i mean it's def a bit of both but a good amount of the first
missing sig gear wasn't as backbreaking as it is now
i mean the thing is, it wasn't always the case
but handel didn't exist on mobius release
she and mobius are the only 2 ones which have good options
that's true, HoF is kind of a break in pattern with budget gear still playable
yeah they always have some fucked up shit hidden
every new valk is like that nowadays
SW and v2v too, those 2 mainly because of competition, anyone who pulled for them went for 4/4 on expa, so you're just on a baseline disadvantage
aponia is also p bad for budget gear
yeah it fucking sucks
now we have handel though
you just lose 200 points farming sp in real situation
mobius on release, her numbers are pretty good with monet goemon
just a dps threshold that you eat -100 in score if you can't pass
but does it matter if she has good numbers if those aren't high enough to delete HoD p1?
like PE does have good dps with budget gear
are still pretty bad when you try to play them
even the ones that don't look that bad currently
+ gear going from a good powerboost -> necessary for her kit to work
and that + rank ups mattering more and more
but like design philosophy, she was the start of the heavy shill we're seeing
at this point DA is old gen on how strong she is
and not power output
by new gen i mean like in design philosophy
i mean yeah i think i should say
i mean yeah but i wouldn't say time stop is the most defining feature of new gen dps valks
i'd still say she's part of new gen of dps
her bosses just don't show up anymore
and they're fucking torture to play with anyone else
she still insanely outscores other options in her bosses
i mean even without timestop
it's not her fault but she p much took the hit for being p much the first one
with having awful awful bosses made especifically for them
i'd say DA on 4.4 p much started new gen of valks
made even worse with how shill her battlesuits are
she isn't a bad character but i don't blame people for disliking her, especially before the kolosten OW and the EX chapter before that
when that different media is completely innacessible for a giant part of your player population
it's even fucking worse
i already think that it's a cardinal sin in storytelling to lock important info on different media
i mean exactly, even worse that it's untranslated
it was so out of left field for most players
but when she released
like now she has a lot of content in main story
on an untranslated vn
that you hid their characterisation
that players would dislike a character
who the fuck would guess
yeah a fuck ton
soooo
but they did release durandal
i'd say that mihoyo wouldn't do a character release that most players dislike
but at this point it's way funnier if i act like i'm 100% confident
30/70 on being right/wrong
tbh i'm kinda like
dm me when i'm right about corruptie too
+ l + ratio
i'm right, you're wrong
- says baban, as if proving me right somehow proves me wrong
baban's in already
if 0 pieces
cause you can't redeem
you'd be helping her i think
is HoC main strategy
like splitting into multiples
right
that's just 500k corrupties
you do know that you blow up corruptie to 500k pieces
corruptie, that kills people
LMFAO
mark my words
lmfao
you've reached your syllable quota
baban you had your fair share of bad takes today
trust
i'm good now
she'll kill one of HoC ER backups and one of the others will go oh shit i understand what you mean
grow, corruptie, grow!!!!
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
the love for humanity
is about to teach her
and elysia
yeah, she learned fear from being destroyed on the world outside, and almost dying on the kalpas encounter
he looks very young
not wrong, yes
kosma is just a socially awkward teen lmao
yeah they're children
evil v2v killed felis
my poor little corruptie, we understood you so wrongly
yeah remember when we hated her, crazy
LMAO exactly
i still think she'll be redeemed
apho3 mature senti
and then we'll have
senti will then go through an story arc with accepting that hua died and learning who she really is
hua will make a necessary sacrifice and leave her body for senti
i've said this before
senti stop selling drugs on the alley
without senti, hua'd be gone already
and senti agreed
yeah, she had to ask senti for some of her power so she could live a lil longer more and complete her mission
lmfao
a baby
she is literally
yeah senti i'd argue is prob not okay morally as a romantic partner
i mean it doesn't necessarily, but still
like she has the body of a 17 y/o, but she did grow up and mature a lot through the 50k years
like i do think it's fine to date hua morally, but a lil weird
but still weird
i'd think it'd be fine to date her morally
if she did live throughout the CE and grew as a person and become mature
so sim griseo is just a 12 y/o for 50k years, not a 50k y/o
like snapshots of who they were forever
like the sims in ER spent 50k years not making any progress or maturing as people
i mean it depends
if the 50k y/o is actually 50k y/o then that'd be fine
i'll argue that griseo isn't actually 50k y/o
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
yeah so why even bother, let me grow up or die
yeah!!!
how would you even make friends?
a child tho? yeah that's just fucked
i'd be fine with being like that forever
i mean if i looked 18 or 21 or 25 or anything older
does it even matter
between dying at 12 or living for a few more years and dying on the ark
i think i'd rather die
no one would've fucking date me lmao
even if maturity and metal wise i was older
i'd hate to look 9 for the rest of my life
they'll stay maturing and growing older mentally
i mean she's right
and sure but she died at 12, so still a 50k old corpse of a 12yo
sim!griseo spent 50k years on sim but making no progress on her maturity, personality or body growth
i press doubt on that
is she really though
and be fucking called stupid by random smurfs
you'll be starting as a new player, not even know what buttons do what
lol is so fucking bad
and learning nothing
just boring when i'm playing 500 hour gamers
and tbh i don't even mind losing, i do it everyday
<a:peepoLeave:646986909381558273>
and quit
got my ass fucking whooped 3 times
went online
i spent like 30 mins training a single combo
i tried playing skullgirls
it's so hard to get into
for me to understand wtf is going on
i think i'd enjoy fighting games but i never got into one enough
fps games get me bored too
yeah, i guess that's the most i've watched
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
moba esports just easily get so fucking boring, just becomes a stall game until one fight and then someone loses the game over it
but like
i mean if you count honkai balding as esports then i like it
it's just boring most of the time
wtf you mean impossible
i'm in college but i'm not being educated
oh
tf does that mean
yeah?
and i also hate esports
i hate sports
i'm a true neet
and then your mark in the platform is remembered as the guy from the kkona emote
yeah it must suck to stream for a good while as a good person that's just fishing
LMAO
isn't he like a fishing streamer that is just really nice
it's kinda fucked up that <:Kkona:610928070370525204> means that
the wall is painted as the american flag <:Kkona:610928070370525204>
colonisers? lmao
oh yeah you're making too much sense now by giving the sport and ball and different names, please be stupid to follow american rules
and then you don't get to make fun of others when they say the sport and ball name in a way that makes MORE sense
which is what you're doing
i mean i'm not disagreeing with that, you can invent them and then own them and then name them and still have their names be stupid
yeah let's just use the same word for 2 different things
so you can fucking tell what the fuck you're talking about
everything else
did you fuck up
why the fuck
normal words for normal people
see the last one makes fucking sense
it makes more sense!!!!!!!!!!
yeah because!!!!!!
you can do that
i mean yes, if you wanna follow the traditions and rules and also be stupid
and is less confusing
in a way that makes more sense
why would you make fun of catastp for saying
yeah and that's stupid
is that supposed to be a dunk? <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
see? no one says the obviously right and common sensical way
don't fucking worry weird me like i had a choice to be born here
someone with common sense
finally
thank you catastp
lmfao
my country
how much i like
so you can guess
and we have like a worse donald trump as president currently
i'm trans
can you guess how patriotic i am
also have you spoken to me about any of my political positions ever
<:DILUC_COOL:708170074069925928>
we copied you, and in the act of doing so, the name became less stupid
that'd be stupid
it's not literally pébola
and bol isn't ball in portuguese
fute isn't foot in portuguese
well, i mean, i guess it's not less stupid than that, it's futebol, which is just how the word transformed from football, but like
1. no
2. our name for it is less stupid than that
you say it like football isn't stupid already
i dunno be fucking creative
fucking change the sport name then!!
do we have a quota??
syllable police now
are you the fucking
what the fuck you mean too much
that it's stupid
i just get to point out
no i mean you're allowed to say it however you want it to
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
pros:
1. baban likes it

cons:
1. be more confusing
2. make less sense
yeah lets just name things the same, for fun
okay so you like to make things more confusing as a hobby
that'd be a brazilball ball
and that thing was what you used on the sport
but if brazilball was a sport
i mean yeah, it's not a sport
obviously
the ball you use to play brazilball
that'd be brazilball ball
if brazilball was a sport
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
less sense
cause it makes literally
bullshit
i'm calling the rules
i know it's wrong because the grammatical rules say so
basketball ball
so there's a ball for that sport
yeah but it's part of the name of the sport!!!!!
see???
lmfao
do you call a soccer ball just soccer aswell
do you call a football ball just football too?
absolutely not, what?
y'all the weird ones
who tf names the ball and the sport the same thing
yeah it makes more sense
clearly i don't
what's not clickin
a ball you play basketball with
yeah
timido doesn't even have mantis form with 2 extra arms made specifically to hold up her booba
look at aponia haha
they realised their mistake with timido and went oh shit oh shit
mihoyo made eden and aponia to make timido look normal
HoR is just annoying, but she isn't just spam A or hold A like the SW/nyx
yeah SW is boring to play
oh
not really? HoR and SW rank ups are pretty good
i really like aponia if i ignore her watermelon booba
none of those are too weak or not enough coverage
the reason why she's bad is that
1. she needs 13/13
2. she's boring to play
3. her rankups suck
the reason why she's bad isn't because she covers little or is bad at what she does
nyx also gets the wrong kind of shit
i mean
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
both of them
they're average
y'all treat them badly
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i already told you i'll buy it for you
wait for v2v bp
fucking don't
isn't tet skippin
🧑‍✈️
yeah that makes sense
or next cycle
already?
we used to play garfield kart together
eh issok, he's really nice
coffee's the one running his acc tho i think <@524782681389793280>
he's a vice
he's online rn
yeah just kaizo
wait i dunno if i understand
isn't him just kaizo
yeah it's insane
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
because mobius cap is fucking
even if it's -1 from mobius cap
still, i'll bet most people will run aponia
with the bugfix + buff
yeah if anything aponia scores might go -1 on 6.0
i know for sure it's waaaay easier though
but not higher (yet, at least)
which matches mobius score
so yeah apparently they found out a way to +2s with 9s aponia
a 773 on non+20% is the same as 728 on +20%
for conversion
i have a table
so scores are different
the new 3s boss is not +20%
yeah, it's a combination of
1. value of mobius rank ups being mostly on sp gen, which doesn't matter much for MA
2. most of the damage comes out from judah cheese, so mobius dealing more damage personally doesn't change stuff *that* much
tbh i don't even blame whales going with 3s aponia for -2, given how awful the mobius runs are
and aponia was
s0 680
3s 696
it was
s0 mobius 696
s2 712
3s 728
i do know that last wolf, it was really close
cause people might've figured out different strats
for wolf
i'll look into more aponia scores though
just again, fucked up
mobius can 680 at s0 too though
meanwhile aponia gets 680 for free at s0
mobius is some fucked up shit for 712/728 at 9s
waaaaaaaay easier to play
but it's
is that aponia like either matches or barely underscores mobius
the thing i do know
and nothing really changed on lightning team
well at least it wasn't last wolf
really? i dunno if that's true
iirc HoT Dis PV is the best HoT team for husk LMAO
waaaay overperform than you'd expect
so it makes teams like that one or HoT Dis PV
instead of just her
is applying to entire team currently
aponia's independent skill, the one on evade
that's the bug
kinda based lmfao
and each play 10 accs
15 players
there's like
but that's not true
and you think wow there's a lot of bald players
you look at cn t100 and dist
simp for her i guess
it's insane
on HoF
23*6 affixes
has fucking
everyone in CN
also is really fun cause i played it lmao
it looks really fun
stairs one
is it the
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
from lumina
i think frann is a p good player
o ok
not in abyss
HoR is used as a support in MA bella
cause then you get more battlesuit shards
wonder if it's worth it
i have 15 already
and rolling for rank ups
if you're using extra stamina on that
less than u think probably
so i was already grabbing all of the farmable ones even if i didn't know the value of them for dorm yet
i've always been lowkey valk collector
<a:PatPat:814547161878364190>
newbie player so innocent
but unlock valk is 80 frags
since like, dupe card is 30 frags
so let it be known next time
if you don't have one of the valks
using for frags is waste though
no thought
i insta used it for FT frags for faster sss
my sss bke score fucking sucks lmao
yeah definitely fucking not
<:surprisedeline:714574685446340669>
that performance
how could i not be
so powerful
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
who needs to get better
i just spam mobius
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
so u better
u retain nirv
so does all of global
yeah now you'll be the one coaching me
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
if it was MA i'd understand
i'm fucking dumbass for abyss lmao
wtf did i even help you with
abyss fire tank?
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
was... it?
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
fucking 6 different bugged bosses this patch
it's also the region that gets to do QA for the game
cn is now not only the region with foresight
heim is bugged
yeah
we tanking boys
no heimdall
imagine trying
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
as a nirvana player
you do that then share your meta opinions
oh yeah
that's what you do as a casual player anyways right
just to look at pretty valk and pretty elf
and every elf 2*
i'd prob get every valk s0 0/4
if i didn't care about competitive
different breed of player
but i do think a lot of us are getting stuck in nirv
9s player stuck in a3 <a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
i guess that's true for every region
we have a toon of shit whales
i mean depends
it's a feature
oh ok
but what the fuck is this boss lmfao
i think you did it a bit early
you have to do it after first charged
i think you lightly mistimed the weapon active
wtf
also yeah what the fuck is the damage to that shield
LMFAO
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i wouldn't stop until 836
if it was me
poking the ss mobius i see
dw
and currently eli is the only person in all of RL sniping
the mihoyo database
i looked through the code
don't make fun of my ss0 atk issued brethren
look
makes it from walk in the park to walk in park with a bicycle
+5 dist on HoD
makes it impossible
cause like +5 dist on wolf
they really should balance how disturbance works on different bosses
god i can't believe wolf is such a fucked up boss lmfao
you'd rather run FR
i think without cf
yeah AE is for cf tech
at least fischl feels like 0 damage <:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
i think my fischl and AE deal 0 damage
and then kept the score
and went oh that's weird
like they spent 45 seconds on transition
wtf goes on their head
oh....
i assume
ayyy i'm beating that 2s morb :D
just don't fuck it up 4head
i think like mid 700s is expected if i wasn't rank scamming
so it's not that impressive
i am bug abusing with rank scamming
<:terihigh:959767025436196884>
<:pepeW:996346590086303805>
don't make me go back there
is it low
dunno why FR over AE
standard stuff i think?
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
i call that skill issue
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
but i got the double 893
i have a shitter score there
i don't wanna run sss bke
i'm like 50th or something
wanna stream so i take a look
<:elywhip:1002644839248183306>
the get to it
since she stays on field for ever
mei m on griseo is like useless
i guess i can see it actually
whoa
s0?
also what are your pe ranks
how far damage wise are you
shui?
what even is phys support stigs
if not gustav or holmes
i'm not sure what you'd even run there
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
might be better actually
i think u can run holmes TM instead
i think it's tight for s0?
there's ref
in the end of this one
s2 makes it way easier since starting sp
but yeah s0 possible
i need to tell jia
o yeah one of the vids is wrong


lmfao
not pe
that's
hell no
while shakes is p much DA-only
dante (even TM) also has plenty of uses as budget options for other valks
like overwhelmingly so
yeah BKE is waaaaaay more used than DA
but that is very niche
well, that or dxy ft bb ch with shakes tm ignite tech
last time we used shakes was on parvati abyss week 5 5.6
feel like dante is waaaaay more used than shakes currently
context?
didn't need to enter burst mode for mobs
because of the changes
<a:bugcatdeadpat:898434851160604684>
gresham not seeing her personally
:(
poor rita
i could be wrong tho, but this is from what i remember from before + seeing current scores
lightning is the one that mobius wins out
yeah
on nirv
ss0 spina is actually better than s0 mobius
nirv or rl?
it's rl so it's ok
i mean i am lmao
<:pepeW:996346590086303805>
can't even imagine normal player lmao
i'm missing damage to one rot
i might break 800 but like
i'm at 77x
for wolf it's pretty good
than lightning wolf
it's waaaaay more tanky
it's just type counter wolf
weird af but i'm pretty sure that's the case
yeah lmao
just timings and stuff, every rot has stuff like that
that's just specifics to the rot
the rest tho
and it sounds awful
oh yeah that last thing is tech
at all
black magic on husk?
is there
runs like that p much make use of the bug
he helped me with the simulations
imylao
we do have sea and eu player here
thank u
LMFAO
she's pretty i just hoped she was designed better
wdym <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
but yeah i believe it
on azure cycle, we got AE gear on 2nd patch of bp
i mean it isn't guaranteed
i thought that was an order
oh wait you said if
there you go
sure
lmao
there's hekate
cause every bp season
i'll bet on hler hekate dante
yeah that would make sense
aren't we going to figure out later this week
oh yeah what even is in bp on 6.0
and one of the times was in RL
twice!!!
i fucking used that twice
couldn't be me
haha
imagine maxing niche pri
TMMMBBBB shui
i have fucking
i can give you one too
do you need zhenyi B
or two
you can take one
i have 3 of them
if you want
oh i have ely B
a year lmao
i haven't touched that in fucking
oh you want my dirac MB?
but might be useful for lower spending tier player
that is useless to me
lemme see what do i have
it wouldn't be hard
what do you want
sure
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
cause she's useless
and i'll never get to unlocking her
cause it's going to bug me forever that i don't have her
i mean i'm kinda jelly
but now she's farmable yeah
3s her for HoR leader skill
well she did have one use
so i'll never get to it <:Cryge:953999086506377306>
so like it's useless
elem dmg taken
and it's going to bug me forever
she's the only farmable valk i don't have
i lowkey am sad that i didn't get a DB
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
i imagine
crying over the fact you don't have vke
o yeah
for dorm
useless
BKE is elem damag taken
that is the only dorm bonus right now i can't get
is that i have s2 AE
the most annoying thing
i'm missing uh
1% tdm
4% fire
4% ice
2% lightning
2% phys
if you mean to check like how much you have
values are s/ss
i have a list though
you need to check valk per valk
and probably 3s FR 3s ely
ss BN
next patch i'll finish out
she'll be farmable probably lmao
by the time i get to buying out the stamps tho
by buying out those stamps
i can get ss2
if i roll for 14 frags
prob the only thing there worth lmao
yeah sn stamps is like
i guess
gold witch orb doesn't even give anything good
are you done with dorm bonus stuff
what
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
just farm sss HoT when she comes to WT
prob just don't bother
yeah for you
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
there's nothing to be done
then
if iriya is complaining about it
LMFAO
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
the tech from this babanlao
jesus
oooo i see
i don't wanna do it with randos
anyone wanna do homu dk raid
how the fuck did it get rime trauma
enough abyss teams for 9s MA
tbh we don't have
so you're on the slacc team
i see
since you'll be the only one trying lmao
nah it'll be the best time to t100
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
it's the only thing we should care about
also according to mihoyo
so yeah
on 3s bosses is when i felt sp issue on fischl
i mean like i said
duh
the gamemode that matters
yeah
on 3s MA bosses
i've consistently had sp problems on fischl
it's rare but
yeah
3s fischl nice to have tho
def eden
yeah between the 2
i slacc too much on sp valks lmao
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
you're going to get 3s griseo before i get 3s eden
so fast
that is bella
oh shit
<a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
whoa
lemme see
still means you can do 2s rots
3s enables different rots
but
yeah that's fair
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
not good enough
is the score
lower dist tho
elemental crits
see even iriya agrees
everyday4asummer is iriya
iriya?
...
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
3s rpc on MA
don't say that
i'd guess it's HoD
if there's one boss you tell me 990 is possible
either way i wouldn't be surprised if we saw that in a few months LMAO
or abyss HoD
3s HoD
and they always took #1 on myriad
SEA had one for like 2 patches
honestly i'm lowkey surprised we have so little
i heard that there's a hacker
is that the hacker?
right now it does that but it's about +- 5 pulls innacurate
and it spits out avg pulls to get the rank you want
which is a site where you input current rank, frags n stuff
i'm kinda close to my final goal
i'm making the graphs prettier
this is for awakened
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
it's actually insane the difference in consistency
(also i feel like a real mathematician now that my code spits out graphs)
after the changes
this is what it looks like
you can see that going +-40 is like pretty normal
but there's pretty good variance, about what you'd expect
average is 388
this is how getting 3s non-awakened is right now
fuck python got rid of my graphs
oh wow
no one cares lmfao
on something that like
slowly realising that i'm spending a lot of time
i'm like
i think my code is already past 400 lines
cool vibe
styx is so few words
yeah LMFAO
and then just seeing the cool ass long animation
and ulting on clone
was mistiming SW ult
one thing that i do love
it just goes oops you don't get to see numbers <:terikms:659698680344870922>
doesn't even show up lmfao
HoF ult damage
i feel like 90% of the time
otherwise just unga bunga and look at hp bar
and i wanna compare to ref damage
when i'm missing damage
i only look at numbers
i unironically don't i just look at hp bar
yall read damage numbers
wait
fuck fgo
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
everyone fucking scroing 920
-20d on wolf -> abyss HoD true combo
you keep your mouth shut
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
and above 450 for nirv
god damn it global stay at above 400 for one second
we doing down
o no
thank you <:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
cause it certainly isn't useful at all LMAO
eye candy
CN iOS refs to us is just
at nirv levels of dist
like 2-3 points of dist consistently translate to 10-20 points
cause dist is exponential
it's a joke, a few points of dist is insane
i can't follow it anyways LMAO
in my experience, 1 or 2d really doesn't make a difference
i wanna know RL dist
do we have any RL NA gamers here
oh shit talking about ds
you all must especially be bad at the game if you couldn't think of this strat i thought on the spot which doesn't work
you see this is the strat you should be doing, not my fault all nirv players are fucking stupid
lmfao
so you're forced to deal with the cringe
part of why people hate turg cat is because it's so much better than raven in nirv
eh tbf it's kinda misleading to say it like that
and certainly isn't from actual nirv players cause we all disagree lmfao
certainly isn't from actual nirv cause they're stuck a3/rl ping pong
they got that high knowledge that they learnt through dreams
the walls that exist and are easily used on every boss arena
ah yes
lmfao
i'm doing things in the worst way possible
cause i fucking know
my pc to fucking explode
i'm already expecting
anyway back to the graph mines i go
which is about 31%
while pulling for 3s awk valk
like on avg you get about 270 frags through essentine and frag drops
actually ~33%
when on avg, frag and essentine drop make up ~25% of the frags
like how many cards to 3s and that stuff
is that all 9s player think of is cards
one thing i have noticed
new numbers
so seeing the distribution will be interesting, not only straight number average
at least i expect it to be
but it's more consistent throughout
is that it's cheaper early, more expensive later
cause the thing about the new essentine system
which is going to be fun
i also wanna do more graphs
which would be really nice
so the numbers came off at 110 pulls for 3s
i used total roll count instead of only rolls since last card
and i used the wrong value to do soft pity
(in 10 minutes since it takes a while to simulate 400k pulls)
which is what people actually want
okay so time for the numbers
instead of just a simple code snippet lmao
also you know you're in some deep shit when you search a function and you're looking for official documentation on how it works
time to run math with them!
so i feel like that is a pretty good approximation
green/yellow/red lines unrelated
my simulation is brown line
the true pull data is blue line
and this is the same numbers overlayed to true pull data
with same algorithm as genshin
this is my simulation with soft pity
gives a pretty good graph huh
100k simulations
but hey i did a graph for cumulative with hard pity
for without pity
i gave up for doing the numbers
for valk card
389 pulls
and then one of the simulations took
i thought okay it can't be that bad, i'll keep track for up to 200 pulls cause you can't go that down bad
i've started by modeling a banner system without hard pity
i'll use this chat as livetweet of my experience
i'm back to doing work on the simulation stuff
okay so
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
is called enabling my own valk
yes
no just need to be frozen when she dies
veeeeery slacc
yeah damage should be like
bastet TM newt B on DK
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
you can run DoR bastet DK
if you're missing damage
you can actually use tech
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
then u can too
if i can do it with no impair
then you don't need impair
i don't CA
cause like
does dk impair at all?
imagine reading skills
oh
doesn't she?
for sim battle
impair from ch cross drop is good enough
just need to press buttons faster and you'll get 917
then that's all you need
if you have the damage to kill on ult with FT
like it's not specially fast but
yes it is
DoR on DK
for kallen, you need freeze, if she's not frozen her death animation takes forever
if you're killin on ult, then 917 is possible
for sk, you need faster hands
you def don't need it for the other 2
if for kallen you don't need bri pri
out of the 3 bosses
and then that's the highest damage req i think
so
the other also doesn't use bri pri
for 0s on kallen
i mean besides that strat
yeah
you don't need bri pri for the 0s BKE strat on kallen
bri pri?
like if th3o rolled for it it can't be that bad a decision
th3o rolled for it lmao
extra value if you don't have avo
is a good weapon
depending on your goals is not even a bad idea
i'll prob have a few other 1.5k
when i craft my 2 dks
my one 1.5k atk
i have literally one valk with 1.5k atk
1.5k atk
whoa
like HoS or HoF
bringing newer valks would just make it even more pointless
like sim battle is already so easy
no one, really
dunno
the sp lately hasn't been make or break for any strat
is the 2% dmg for each type of dmg
so p much all that's left
i got all the atk
at least now
<:tericopiumhic:893828235954102293>
i'm at 6/8/8/7
i'm slowly getting there for dks
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
so you don't have to craft
don't pull on the gacha one
yeah baban is saying
i want my 20 atk
i'm so down bad on forge
so that sounds right
is basically crafting speedups
the best thing you can buy with red reso
if you have 1 ppm 2 newts
with the death of MA
i mean at this point
brings me infinite joy
this video
yes you can use mine
i used on all bosses
this is the team btw
and ppm is good replacement
but now it's handel M
bella M used to be best lightning solo M piece
the rest is pretty useless for dupes
but if you have one of paga or cez then you'll prob not need dupe shui
if you don't have many phys support sets
i'd consider keeping dupe shui
do you have paga/cez
if all dupes
are dupes
which of these
depends
wait
yes
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
go go eli
same team on all 3 lmao
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
they have same link for s0 and s2
moriso is the dumbass
wait no
dumbass
i'm uh
for 3s kosma
s0 and s2 score


i have some 3s kosma ones
just in general?
share some metal?
think so
when he's down
and you need to time dps output
for bastet
freeze timing
so top 2 answers is
i mean is husk
lmfao
sheeesh?
idr heimdall strats
i think i can cap on all 3?
lemme help inflate our armada scores
waow nini slander
especially if you haven't looked up the tricks and stuff
like scoring high in sim battle is actually p tricky
good job already tho
what tricks are used to 0s heim
i don't actually know
it's not bad! <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
that's 2s
yeah that sucks actually
oh wait nvm actually
what
cause no one will try lmfao
i'll t10 then
i can't wait for that week
oh shit
BKE or FT with DoR freeze tech
i think that's your options
there's BKE 0s here
without that tech
kallen
i dunno if you can 0s
i think
her death animation doesn't play
if she's frozen
yeah
instead of spending money and autoplay
imagine wanting to play the game to think and play the game
if not, -200
if you have them
for you to drag them in
and it's just the greyed out valk images
you open the abyss floor
HoF is pretty and cool and good
she got the wrong end of the stick then
who that's for
i wonder
bloodlust weather: qua enemies immune to lightning fire high phys resistance
is just
the thing mihoyo will do
you get put in 5 person lobbies and everyone gets to ban a valk
lobby pick or bans
lmao
she's just a badly designed valk i think
at this point
is there even any fixing her
true
for a while now
she's kinda been
i mean
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
that's 2
and 3s tona, could be stolen by 7t
maru on high dist, could be stolen by HoH
better than v2v
she can outscore HoT on her own boss by a few points
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
nyx?
so
next year
that's not how quantum stuff works
i get like quantum stuff but
why is schro stigs gambling stigs
that's kinda true
c6 itto: schro M
he goes <a:ushihic:940613032193699920>
yeah it's something like that
so no one knows
ever
we're just on the universe where none hits crit
there is a chance to crit, it's like 50/50 on every hit
like imagine
i was thinking of that
can't wait to fight it
sheeeesh look at this new boss leaked!
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
on p1 and p2
and then you need to do it twice
on practice it's just rng
so it's just reset for that
1.5x damage
it deals like
on QTE
close to pixel perfect
for some reason if you position like
she has fucking
dw mobi is awful too
kasumi rimestar? t18
husk couatl? t12
wolf? t16
i only place high when no one tries u see
because no one likes wolf
but yeah only that high
me blind
it is my 3rd highest placement
actually that isn't my pb i guess
was wolf assaka dxy
but we have to break both to kill
9s only breaks one arm
for us plebs
and the bald point is breaking both arms
last assaka
it was my pb week
i have it tracked
yea 893
was it 893 or 840
s0 HoF 893
assaka really easy
and yeah
there u go
something something need 1.3 sp/s on carole
i remember a phys run on maru
yeah i mean
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
go go gresham
cause that's more fun than 3s bosses
this time i got a 744 and went to do more rimestar
yeah last time i got 760
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
-1 on rimestar
on HoD
i'm like -7
for ss pe
yea shit placement
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
LMFAO
powering down
powering up more like
i'm the one that needs to be ended
i'm the pleb here
you're doing great
aren't you on t100 this week
it is triple elemental i guess
well
besides that tho it's a fine week
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
3s bke
the week after
i'm going to get 3s eden
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
cause next week is awful
so i could have more fun
i should've started this MA week earlier
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
RL trip
oh
oh
lmao
what even is next cycle
<:felissnipehic:957243524955394079>
iriya doesn't snipe
and i think that's it
i got ryuu, chyara, felicia, karto
nah they're really nice!
<a:bugcatdeadpat:898434851160604684>
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
please be kind to phi
also the gresham is infinitely powerful
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
you know if you want me to read something you should really ping me
at least HoF is pretty
and elemental rimestar everyone gets 1 second for free for fun
phys rimestar she's floaty
i swear to fucking god
with rimestar on my acc
god there's something wrong
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
<:DILUC_COOL:708170074069925928>
skill diff
looking comfortably to +100
i mean

<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
<@416445660443967491> you got <@524782681389793280> on your bracket
<:MirioThink:1002644849809436734>
for furry meme schro bald
sss meme
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i can only have so much faith
efficiency yk
no but i'm already going through the steps
6.0 triple sss is disappointment
5.9 double sss it's anger
every patch my emotions get to 100
i'm fucking mob psycho 100 here
just become horny
maybe that's natural honkai player lifecycle
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
hepha and rpc
but not even accounting to that, we already have 2 new bosses for her
is datamine
not pulling?
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
with no WE
you just can't make any dps threshold
like every ice boss
cause all of old ice bosses were made with waters edge in mind
not excited to see new boss design
sad cuz true
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
come to nirv
no one likes ely
slightly more expensive at higher ranks
slightly cheaper at lower ranks
it is what i expected at first glance from changes
awk, first image is old banner, second image is new banner
non-awk, first image is old banner, second image is new banner
okay actual new numbers
i think i made my code slower again
for new banner
i forgot to disable frag drops
fixing it
deleted old info, i fucked up
keilo misinfo
wait no
cause it's ugly + slow as hell
i need to optimise my code now lmao
this is not accounting with soft pity, so in reality these numbers are kinder
for new essentine system
okay numbers are in
lmao
cause it goes black screen and stream is paused
i only notice it on carv's stream
in the middle of abyss
and check discord
they let me alt tab
i kinda like those long timestop ults
<:worryMantaRay:945494671042412586>
LMFAO
cause no hitcount phase
o ok
on p2
to go fragile
ice rpc condition
what even is
ely just goes <:peepoGunrobbery:755954872368496701> to the mobs
LMFAO
none of my words make sense i'm very sleepy
so you can personalise it
and then do better pity calculation to account for 10-pity
to-do list now is do soft-pity stuff to get better avgs
god this simulation stuff is hard
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
number should be even kinder when i figure out soft pity (how kinder? i dunno)
this is accounting with hard pity, not accounting with soft pity
updated numbers
okay so
LMAO
then yeah i caused it
oh kith is spreading it?
imagine it was i that caused it
please go on
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282> i see so interesting
and i'm like
i'm reading a fucking paper on honkai soft pity
i'm becoming a nerd
oh god
then it won't be no issue
i just need to get good at it
but now i realise
like, complicated ones
i was scared of trying to do probability stuff
you know
i'm implementing pity and soft pity now
i'll try to fix that
mathlao said that pull to s0 is also weird
and 1 said that non-awk is way too high, ~100k xtal for 3s
1 said they never noticed difference between awk and non-awk, and they feel lik,e the price is around of non-awk for both
out of 3 3slaos i contacted, 1 said my numbers look about right
and some 3slaos
now i'm talking with some mathlaos
and this is non-awakened
interesting how s1/s2/s3 line up with sw/v2v banners, though this is awakened
i got more numbers
yo
\> spending more time optimising code than the optimised code will save
wth is accessing dictionaries like slow as fuck
wait that's still slower
think it was variance, did 100k simulation and it went from 426s -> 435s
no it doesn't wtf went wrong
actually i guess it makes sense?
wait fuck i made it slower
with these few changes in the code, i made the simulation go from  44.12s -> 45.5s
nintendo 64 optimisers
now i'm one of those
i guess i could make them anyways
no one cares about s3/ss3
also those are the ranks people care about right
and after i make the code prettier cause right now it's ugly as hell
ok i'll come back later with s1/s2/ss/ss1/ss2 numbers
yes
and also figure out which one is more expensive
vs avg pulls for 3s for non-awakened and awakened after changes
i wanna simulate avg pulls for 3s for non-awakened and awakened now
that is what i'm trying to figure out
and you get more frags through essentine (270 for a frag vs 100 for a frag)
yes, also you get different amount of frags when you roll frags (5 vs 8 on avg)
it'd be a lot smaller
i thought if there were to be a difference
really? i'm actually surprised it's 100
awakened valk
non-awakened valk
gonna post them again
300usd for gear + elf and that's about what ruby spent
that does sound about right actuall
about 100 pulls more expensive on avg to 3s
awakened valk, a good amount more expensive
wow
aster said no secs
and it starts getting into days, weeks territory
more than that though
which is fine
100k took 240 secs, 10m should take 24000 secs, about 7 hours
just to have it
i think i'll do like 10m simulation overnight
look at mine
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
and i hadn't changed the amount of frags for 3s awakened valk
and i went well that's not right
240 pulls for 3s awakened valk
and it came like
i did one after
oh no the one i posted was right
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
i definitely didn't just do a 100k simulation with 300 frags for awakened valk
so 850 for 3s
yeah that's right according to the wiki
wait there's a wiki right
any mechanicslao <:Cryge:953999086506377306>
or <@218762069338619906>
for awakened valk
<@180679257851166721> do these rankup frag counts look right
it's 60/60/60/70 and then 150/150/150/150?
assuming you already have card ofc
for 3s awakened valk
how many frags
wait
to see if i'm not fucking up
i'll double check my code after
yeah
there's about a 50% chance of getting a card before 60
you need to remember that like
yeah 486 rolls is 7.2 cards on avg
136k xtal
avg of 486.2 rolls for 3s valk <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
rolls to non-awakened 3s
so i can know the avg for those breakpoints too
and i'll also alter the program in a bit to also track how many frags each simulation took for s1/s2/ss/ss1/ss2
and then both with new banner system
then awakened 3s valk
i'll do non awakened 3s valk
hmm i actually can optimise it i think
also it's python
cause my code isn't very optimised
it should take like 5 mins to run
on current banners
on trying to 3s non-awakened valk
so yeah i'm doing 100k simulations now
LMFAO
before first card
that took 285 pulls
i did do one simulation
and you'll get same numbers ingame
it'll balance itself out
if i do big enough simulations
even if i don't account with pity
so like the idea is
but these rates are consolidated accounting with pity
the idea is: idk how pity works
i'm doing gacha simulations for honk
as i do them
okay i'm going to share my findings
just in time for the end of the patch and sss bke to go <a:ppPoof:933892036296343552>
2 more weeks for 3s
i hate it
i fucking know right
for sss sp valks, as soon as possible = less bald
and it doesn't matter if i get it now or later
i'll get all hua skins eventually
yeah but like
and i'm too asterite poor
then i thought about it
i mean i said i was going to think about it
no
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
and monthly reset is fucking monday
i was like <:Clueless:996308692133761094> why do i have so much asterite, i'll just buy some HB and griseo frags for the future
I JUST SPENT A FUCKTON OF ASTERITE
GOD FUCK
it had a 23k score saved
oh sorry i only saw in the beginning
damn dxy goku teleporting with that fps too
scores 23k
lives
i don't even know where you'd use them
but it's so behind my time
i mean i can look for it
hekate SR <:ohno:959752132905566261>
AI generated teamcomps
this is like
i trust you
are u sure
for himeko
the set that needs high hitcount
ragna
lmao
before HoF
the best pick at fire heimdall
i mean she was actually
that's nirv lmao
and i think that's the only thing i can think of
with BR dps
abyss heimdall ref
i can find you
as actual dps?
god
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
cause it's working
just to fuck with me
faster
are you making your diesofcringe
lmao
yeah it feels insane right now
last skill i have to max in apho1
lowkey want ss dj so i can max this skill lmao
nyx with damage share and SW with type adv against mobs
nyx and SW make much more sense as best picks
kinda sad though cause like
yeah wouldn't surprise me
to get the score you deserve lmfao
gotta fucking do some black magic fuckery
not clowning on you i'm clowning on sim battle
\> kills in 1 sec
\> scores 689

sim battle feelings
get out of this hell hole
good for him honestly
lmfao
crazy good
day 1 t1 all brackets
gresham also day 1
styx is somewhat new and crazy
i think neffr is also old
there's some other blustorm peeps that are day 1 too
phi is day 1
keebs old old
cause they've all quit by now lmao
old old players
we don't have many like
or 4.6
i saw him on masters t100 on like 4.5
karto is new i think
well some of them
and the placement goes :notstonks:
or even me their accs
you give avg player
neffr
like karto styx and the such
are fucking insane players
all the 9s players on t100 leaderboards
but just to make it clear to your point
2. you made ma t100
1. nirv t100 is also t100
lao
shut up
perma nirv
you're fucking
9s player and shit at the game
you see it all the time in rl/a3
even with 9s shit
can't t100
the ones whop aren't
they are good players
the one we see in the leaderboards
we have a fuckton of 9s players
i disagree
i mean
yes gresham is as f2p as me
get fucked lmao
oh yeah
oh that crystal hit lottery
but not close to turg cat
well actually i guess bastet TM newt B cat is also a bit tricky
when you're using her for her intended purpose
cat is fine
nah
it's tona whale couatl tona whale couatl
yes
lmfao
except the last tick
are all normal attacks
and fischl ult
all of them i think
are melee
apparently oz's attack
like did you know
i have no fucking clue
why the fuck is that not explained in the skill description
lmao
i won't know how to answer
i mean you ask me about TP
ty carl
is fucking bonkers
ranged/melee divide in this game
yeah idk either
maybe?
is ranged?
i think her charged attack where it goes weee
i don't get it either
yeah
on sp now
you run 3p ely/3p bianka theater
apparently
lmao
sss sn: you can do more rots!
qua core design: have to kill in one rot or else your score goes kaplunk
a fucking weird buff to her LMAO
sss is such
probably above average on release
for 13/13 team she is extremely average
and how bad her rank ups are
just how bad she is with budget stuff
yeah like nyx problems are not even related to performance
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
life's hard yk
they going v2v is worse nyx
just like 90% of current release
pull if you feel like it LMAO
pull if you want to
average for abyss
sucks for MA
so yeah my last call for v2v is
<:WICKED:897590154691248149>
just like average valk yk
good deal
the best fire dps to pull rn
but she's like an average pull
she's not above average
while me and biri is like
deep on copium, v2v is awful pull for anyone
he's just like
i mean the argument is for new player
but i don't buy it
and also trl issue with needing raven is that you need to pull slug
is that they fix raven issues lmao
the thing about v2v bosses
i mean
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
sheeesh
which i guess is topical
so i prob lost the time to do it
tbf i did only enter like yesterday
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
i didn't get in again
beta is already up?
oh god damn it
i didn't woke up in time to see what cutoff was in mine lmao
homestuck number
you can get away with lee thales
if you're running SR support
but
DA is just a dumb character that needs ignite and has no native ignite
she gets sp gen from ignite iirc
ignite is a bicc necessity
and is -2 from 9s HoF cap with cat
that matches 9s HoF cap without cat
also nvm i don't need max ely pri
literally not what i copied wth
next patch, end of service
seele herrscher
2023, last herrscher released before end of the game
goddamn i'm stuck in time
oh shit that's next year
yeah 2023
but it's a lot more tame than Paladinus ignore every mechanic with one button Equinox
since if you make something like that now, you fucking destroy every past qua boss
which i guess at this point you're forced to
but no they keep it pretty balanced between them all
cause like they could easily make enemy with 5 qua shield and make a valk who takes 2 shield off on charged attack
of making qua this balanced
i mean i am kinda proud of mihoyo
good investment
1s from s2 -> 3s
and fucking
mobius is fucking 2s from s0 -> 3s
more than mobius lmao
hey it's 3 seconds of diff
so i could actually see her matching or even being better than s0 nyx
and HoT was -5 fom s0 nyx before 7tr
for HoT
fgo score went +200 with 7tr
she might actually outscore nyx on tona too with 7tr
ma hot outscores v2v lmaooo
abyss they're still worth it, big score gap between other options
lmao my pov is exactly opposite
<:TeriCopium:969281688414875728>
trust
i mean sure but we're getting another arc this year still with new seele
why is v2v even qua anyways
herrscher ely will be like i am destroyer of realities and you think that's only because she's destroying ER but no she's fucking up the game lmao
yes
for me
cat is especially awful tho
s-rank vs a-rank
HoF, Ely, Mobius, BKE
ref compilations were like
on +-40 points of eachother
fucking 7 options
it had like
not even only HoF
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
HoD used to be a fair boss you see
that's cringe towards FGO and HoD
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
is fucked
fgo and HoD
carole dps does a bunch to it
jizo has good options actually
<a:peepoLeave:739224163062907013>
and then keep skipping
i can skip until 7.0
but yeah we really don't need a new psy dps
multiple options = stonks
i mean that's good imo
raven pri
timestop on ult + weapon active gives like 30 sp or some shit
we need FR treatment on raven
but with starting sp + sp packs, none of them need to farm sp at all
if they had better TF they would stall out the start a lot better
eh i dunno they don't lose that much time in the sss tank kill
<:TeriCopium:969281688414875728>
they'll remember fire exists
dw as soon as they release a new herrscher
(for MA)
AE and raven sucks, HoF is broken
ely sucks, HoS and griseo are broken
they balance itself out
hmmm i don't think so
that is +2 i'm just bad at math
s0 HoF is 744
that's not +2 is it
oh it went up higher
and then i need to also save up enough to potentially max 6.0 valk pri
for tank
the pri farm never ends, i'm at 0 metal and i need to max ely pri
<a:pepeMeltdown:933941237021569035>
wait no oh god i'm going to have to max ely pri won't i
i might be able to pb
SW HB RC on husk
HoF/Ely on tank
HoT? on heimdall
oh sheeesh that week looks sick
like some personal crit damage or some shit like that
but it's really just a skill, the way it can be activated is arbirtrary
evasion skill is usually procced when you ultimate evasion, but not always (see: HoF's procs on any evasion, griseo's procs on cross drop)
you get +2sp and it slows down the game for a sec to show you you did it correctly
ultimate evasion is correctly dodging out of an attack
no those 2 are different things
yeah i'll be saving up for a while more
no 3s and not pri memes
but it is done
and she has no bosses in the near future
too poor to max it
finally crafted her pri
cause i poached them
<:whalepat_hh:710738275845013576>
9s team
yeah for u she'll prob pull ahead for sure
now with 7tr good chance HoT pulls ahead on lightning husk
before 7tr at least
it's like sw skip clone > HoT skip clone > sw > HoT
in lightning it depends
no
since she's braindead lmao
but if you don't have the damage you're fucked
yeah easier for sure
to skip the mechanics
and she has a waaaaay bigger window
she can paralyse husk
meanwhile with HoT
you just eat -150 score
but if you don't
like the clone and shit
if you have enough damage, you can skip mechanics outright
SW can be rough on the husks though
to break shield
doesn't need max SoS
elemental rimestar
hey at least
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
because can likes you
deal 30% more damage
just randomly
on positioning
pure rng
this shit is fucking
i hate turg cat with all my being
nvm i'm not doing this abyss
so zetsubou had to bald for 1 point to make that joke LMAO
you need to get a better score for your name to update
funny story, the names don't update on the myriad leaderboards automatically
are multiplying
the kartos
<@309634550273933314> 
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
kill me
still with ss eden
in nirv
the only person
i'm fucking
no it's because i like tet
and only you
i allow you
you can simp for her
i need my huff of copium pls
but for now
and i'll suffer more
and then they'll do 6.3 fire sp support morbillion tf everytime villv laughs
and i'll suffer
they'll put BKE kosma on same week
like i know 100%
i wanna hate on v2v as a coping mechanism so i can skip her and not feel bad
LMAO invite?
it's based on cn pronunciation
well i'm consistent
lmfao
for your own good
too powerful
sheeeesh
s0 will be able to do a lil less i assume
s2 can 47.2k
well
she can 47.2k
we need like a support that can TF off field
v2v kinda sucks for MA
it's not even fully her fault
new pb
since you kill with combo at the end
yeah damage looks very kind
to get enough sp
you need to do a charged attack
you can 840
yeah if u ani cancel
proud of these 2 solutions
opus magnum (sorta old puzzle game spoilers) ->
<a:keilothebear:997517488713638048>
at max
10
yeah i have like
she's stuck at nirv
so even if she demotes
nini is at 2280 trophies
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
let us all meet back in RL
same
ss eden <a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
i dunno if i'll try for retain yet
(nini and styx respectively)
we got t1 and t2 player in NA
we got styx too
stacked fucking lobby let's fucking go
let's fucking goooo
we got the fucking lobby
<@385655541248163840> <:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
<@416445660443967491> <:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
even if they didn't you were safe
so proud of you
<a:PatPat:814547161878364190>
ssg ninilao
damn and you were scared
babies first snipe
he'll be proud of you
tell phi
oh you feel bad about sniping
<a:PatPat:814547161878364190>
what do u not feel good about
<@385655541248163840>
and then keep trying the boss until you run out of time
you snipe at the 30 min mark
then you never leave the sniping for last
and if you're doing last second balding
10 minutes so you have enough time to do another try if you end up dying or some shit on the side stage
and then finish clearing 10 minutes before it closes
pause it
like, so hop on it right now and do it until close to clearing it
i would recommend doing it like 10 or so minutes before closing
yeah that's what i do
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
i think i'd vibe so hard with that
actually sounds fun as fuck
and then have to go for fastest kill
so it would be fun to lock certain switches into certain bosses only
runescape is switchscape, for some reason the combat devolved into just switching equipment constantly for different actions
but it could work in a very fun way actually
how it'd work
i don't even know
the answer is no but i wish it had
what a weird question
oh no
i kinda wanna play runescape now
i guess it makes sense
similar to darts and stuff
yeah in runescape they're like throw weapons too
<:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
damn
they're not that big LMAO
most of them are just circles tho
kinda
i do see some that are like that
<a:aworryParryL:469467278304346113>
her booba just flopping around as she swipes it around
LMAO
imagine aponia using it as actual blades
i don't get it actually then
wait i think all chakram are 2 blades
but still just 2 blades
it looks more like a chakram in the image
time for u to shine
at ss
i saw people running her as dps
you think i check that LMAO
yeah apparently carole dps is good but bald as fuck here
i thought he quit LMAO
he fucking <a:ppPoof:933892036296343552>d out of lumina chat
oh shit keebs alive
this weapon sucks lets not use it
they really were like yes we need more design space, let us make a new weapon
at least the second chakram valk is actual chakram valk but like
doesn't actually use a chakram lmao
i like how the fucking first chakram valk
she doesn't have a full circle
her chakram is actually 2 blades
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i'm just dumb
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
so badly planned lmao
makes it worse that below 626 it goes into 37k
and nothing else
i know 946 is 336
yeah i never got around memorising scores for +20% on SS
it's going to be fucking impossible to talk about it
i hate it so bad
31k for ss, 39k for sss, 47k for sss +20%
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
each boss is going to have a completely different score pattern
it's going to be on 39k
cause second sss boss is not +20%
so bad with scores
MA about to become
it's not even 46k scores
if dupe neb ended up useful
with double sss boss
it wouldn't surprise me
though
on dupe neb
hell no i'm not spending 3 cubes
-13
wait sheesh that score actually isn't that bad, 312 for 520 ref
312
iirc i didn't even get that bad of a score tho
LMAO
for sss husk
that i had as a dupe
base neb on AE
and then had to use fucking
and used neb pri on carole on a mobius ref
i actually did v similar thing another week
<:Deadge:958122498019434496>
just bald for it 4head
no u don't
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
swords is abyss set
is getting patched tho
and it'll look like you're doing BBBB but you're doing damage from follow up attack too
so you can tap B -> tap A -> dodge -> tap B
even if cancelled
and it still deals damage + gens seed
it's really simple, you cancel the follow up attack after combo with dodge
can you tell i haven't played TP in like a year
<:Deadge:958122498019434496>
was lk
i thought the red bar
oh
LMAO
is that fucking LK
ah shit
it's going to be patched soon so who cares
i actually went full circle and don't care anymore if people do the anicancel on mobius
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
do the anicancel!
mods work fast
wow
but matching ref on sss is <a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
if you can match
would still be score increase
you could try that if you think it's easier
also carole scores 680 at s0
might end up just taking the easier one with griseo
though it's up in the air if i'll even be able to do it
792 at s2, 840 at ss
at s2+
scores better
run that again lmao
and i'll have to fucking
i remember hating the carole strat
maybe to have a consistent way to stall out time?
not like they're sp starved on HoS
idk
i think the first pillar is for sp? maybe?
and like not at all in p2
so for this kill it matters a small amount in p1
yeah but the debuff is only for HoS personal damage
slows down the actual game very important
but chains is bread and butter of MA
i don't think pillar does anything
there's special stuff about p2?
and all of them are like ez 893 hard 946
and i feel like homu and hov are around same difficulty as dxy maru
SSS HoD and FGO have around same cap for s0 and use the same valks
that's what first week of the patch was
maybe a bit less
around 111200
i'll guess
hmm hard to say
<@385655541248163840> is this your bracket
LMAO
<:peepoTransparent:757356070883819532>
i think he's ryuuhayato
this ryuu
different people from ryuu right
i dunno ryuuji so idc about them
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
i hope
by you
<:YEP:875561908172902471>
so i can take side of 5 different people at max
there's 5 spots for retaining
so lmk
i'll dm them and let them know i'm proud that they retained if they retain
i don't even know them and i'm already invested
gogo coookie <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
LMAO
after what my bracket looked like
you don't get to complain anymore
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
other types of damage
a few steps above
and they ended up meeting it but i think they're like
HoS kinda set the bar very high but only for phys dps
hmmm maybe
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
new valk literally doesn't need pri, just make base weapon strong enough to compete
every new valk gets pri and old valks stopped getting them
yeah i hate this new design standpoint on pri-arms
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
we skippin
thank god i don't care about abyss
there's no way
it'll be impossible to escape nirv
i think if you have like half a brain and geared s0
i would've fucking retained in there
remember that hell bracket i had?
yeah
after seeing the sss kosma scores
is pretty low LMAO
cause mine right now
how is cn community opinion on vill-v
6.4 give the dk a pri
6.3 broken dk revival for villv
6.1 sp fire support makes villv time fracture on attack
i swear villv is going to be a fucking BKE
based
1 week old already in the useless pile
LMAO damn
yeah but hard to say if they simping img or they simping PE
ima is new child that's getting good attention
qua is dead
game's favorite type is psy, followed by mech and bio is left crying
nah
i was also going to complete the thought with just not worth the xtal
literacy is hard
o wait god not good
mobius is pretty good still tho
she just falls off a cliff if you have to farm 1 sp
yeah raven is pretty good in abyss if you only need to ult once
so maybe it balances itself out
mobius rank ups kinda suck too
eh i wouldn't be surprised
they're like hm yes nirv where the sss mobius lives
i like how they think
LMAO
ss at 31k, sss at 39k, sss +20% at 47k
that's fucking awful
god each boss in MA now is going to have a different scoring convention
LMAO
what the fuck even is a 39306
so weird
it has different scores
so i just saw
the second sss boss isn't +20%
oh that's fucking cursed
very insane
undisputed
HoT just the fucking MA queen
meanwhile 75% of HoT kit now has tf, timeslow or timestop
just bleeds time for fun
she's actually kinda similar to DA, lots of her process in dealing damage she has to be on field while not having any TF up at all
tbh yeah but villv also doesn't help
guess what boss is getting fixed next patch
scoring higher than villv
lmfao
jesus lmao
pushing s0 cap +5
fhem just easily
<a:W_HuWhale:815587323379056700>
<:Peepoggermad:920083770705584169>
i'm trying
first world issues
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
even if it was really early on pity
so it's a card wasted
cause i'm never pulling for ss1
i actually kinda hate it
yeah i was like missing a few frags for ss1, did like 5-10 pulls and got another card
PE banner was insanely kind to me
LMAO
i have 70/150 frags for ss1
did you know
this used to be cap
if her scores are going to be like fucking +2/+3
guess you can't shill new valk
lmfao
s0 used to be able to oneshot p2 with ult
i think they p much removed the buffs you got after transition phase
let's fix that
oops we wouldn't be able to make as money
yeah i love that they can get away with it
fucked up by making it too easy <:Deadge:958122498019434496>
i think it was their dumbass changes to the boss lmao
on HoD
also i think it wasn't griseo release that killed ppt
i'm dumbass
it's sss HoD
you're right
oh wait no
<a:Wiggle:843300917914501141>
i thought it was only for sss fgo
whoa
5?
lfg my ppt is useful <:TeriCopium:969281688414875728>
and i won't force myself to stay if i'm not having fun
i just know myself and know there's like an 80% chance i'll hate it
i'll play during the patch and if i find it fun i'll stay
i've said it before i won't quit out of principle
i probably will
for double sss ma
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
need to farm for second margrave
i might
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
the lightning dps AE
LMAO
about bald to reward ratio
you think i fucking care
the MA balder
you say that to me
and then nowadays i just take a look at what mobs there's going to be and go eh fuck it and run whatever lmao
planning it out
studying the floor, figuring out where they would spawn and what they would focus
god that was actually so fun
yeah
cause then the ranged hillichurls would just shoot at you and hit the leyline monolith eitherway
and you couldn't stay in the middle to clear the melee ones
and then melee ones
they spawned ranged hillichurls at the corners of the map
iirc
it was just positioning hell
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
with the fucking strategy game protect the leyline
was like the hardest one
i remember when f11
oh yeah that was very fucked up
30% of a lector hp LMAO
and then i did like a whole rot with razor and took down
on f12
that weren't just like rando fatuis
i remember once they started doing the more damage spongy enemies
god fuck it was so awful LMAO
good times running razor main
and the atk speed is indeed op
but the lightning damage do end up mattering along the rot
common knowledge is that the lightning damage is useless but the atk speed is op
and gives you bonus atk speed
and when he ults, he deals additional lightning damage on attack
razor does lightning damage on E
yeah it makes up a bigger part of his dps output than you'd think
50/50
and a c6 razor has like
30/70 lightning/phys damage distribution
a c0 razor has like
apparently that's not even troll
i did 36* a few abysses with him though
kinda sucks
he's fun, very ooga booga
but i've never run bennett with razor <:shrug:877047647511384064>
when i started
i did run razor
i'll just do the same thing on honk
i did activate bennett c6 when i quit genshin
i maxed that very fast, didn't even know i shouldn't
the whisperers net you mean
as a viking funeral to her
i think i'll max SA stun skill in a few patches
just powecreep those valks lmao
mihoyo solution to not being able to turn off switch skill, turn down whisperer's net, disable SA stun skill:
yes the switch skill is clearly the more important here
oh yeah and the other one people rarely use, the worst one of the two, QTE
like it's like
i like how and QTE is in parenthesis
the first thing is hannah honkai impact age
lmao if you search hannah honkai impact
must be great
it's the recommended stig on FT!
<:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
so evil
it's also the biggest timewall in the game, you wanna start it asap
and you can't farm for that before breaking through
the biggest powerboost you could ever ask for to deal with exalted is pri-arms
doesn't change
what gear you have or not
answer is always yes
it looks cute
i'd be very up for trying maplestory actually
i tried i think
no
so i know grinds
i'm runescape player
choosing what to upgrade
is sorting through the artifacts
but yeah i don't really mind the grind, the part i hate the most
i haven't played either
i think
that makes more sense
oh
diablo 2?
d2?
i hate it so bad
and i'm not touching that
yeah i'm coming to genshin
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
everyone who plays that game has minmaxed artifacts to hell and back
and abyss is same difficulty
game's been out for fucking 2 years
it's probably true
i mean from his PoV
and has enough damage to clear 36*
his arguments was that yoimiya is a lot easier to play
it's not a mindless take though
one of his meta opinions was that yoimiya > hu tao as main dps
he is crazy on genshin though
just a shitposter
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
he's not that crazy
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
it's iriya
it's like
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
iriya is back to talking in blustorm
with pleb like me
come to RL
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
mean!!!
multi is trolling you?
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
and the 893 ones
there's the anicancel 946
yeah
you can try
dunno if it's possible without BE
you need to crit carole and BE to clear shield
is crit bald ref
prob shield
we don't get extremely long lasting t1 players
like half a year? a year?
not that long
lmao
they showed up as the random i could ask for help in sim battle
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
and they added me back
i added coookiezi
ideally you want both
in abyss
i mean the sk boss
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
for SK
you'll want it affixed with elemental damage
3.2%
sp/s is nice but doesn't do that much
sp cost red is king
it's p much always
but in abyss
it goes from ref to ref
like in MA it's kinda 50/50 whether you prefer sp/s or sp cost red
cause you're like mostly abyss player, yeah?
sp cost red is going to be much more useful for you than getting another sp/s line on T
if you wanna use affix mats, i'd lock the sp/s here and look for sp cost red
standard f2p behaviour
but i don't have metal
i'd like to max it
oh sheeesh i just leveled my neb to 60
the stig went full circle
and roll for sp/s on second line
now you can lock it
sheeesh
that certainly sounds nice
hmmm
too powerful
sheeesh
lmao
so realistically that 23 atk is actually bad
and i can't be bothered to spend mats on getting anything worth it
and it's balanced out by the fact that the other affix is shit
which is irene M
that i rolled on the right piece
i only have 1 23 atk affix
to this day
morb out
i'd fucking
if you got 23/23 by luck
yeah no shit
every affix on every valk will be sp
one day, all we will know about is sp
one day
for sp affixes
will go away
on B piece
those affixes
no, i mean
everything will perish
for the sp
shall pass
that B piece too
you know
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
sheeesh
🐟
do fish
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
only 5 left
mobius
ooooh for coins
<:POGIUS_hh:887701696099278898>
+give mobius
i mean sk
yes
i guess i don't need it since i don't care about abyss
for abyss ely
i unironically need a dupe sswords piece for elemental damage affix
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
is good enough for RL player
you don't understand
for the sp
all shall perish
for the sp cost red
neko will have to let go of the affix
it's not a :lilicumming: moment
no, tet
now she just chomp chomps sp
5% cdmg, 20+ atk, my HoS was such a great damage dealer before
for the sp affixes
what affixes i got rid of
you have no clue
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816>
sorry LMAO
yeah you use it on T
god fuck LMAO
illiterate
i'm fucking
oh shit
oooh
and roll for sp cost red on that first
but i'd lock the B piece first
i dunno if i'd lock the T piece at all
over 0.48 sp/s
why would you save 0.37 sp/s
obviously
B
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
they could be better
not great
they're
every other valk you get away with like 1 or 2 of each at max
kinda fucked up
yeah lmao
right
on all stigs
you want sp cost red + sp/s
literally the only valk
HoS is like
lemme check my HoS affix
wait do i care about those
<:sleepy:914211439286304778>
i don't care about those
ah
lmfao
and the other 2 i can cheat out
so i only need 1 23/23 affix by luck
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
nini likes sw
no one likes sw
sheesh
oh
i unironically might
on your beloved
23/23 affix
are you using
that's fair
lmao
on HoS sp affixes
sink it all
i think i'll fucking
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
i have mats
hehe
<:BARBARA_LOVE:708170069548597248>
don't worry
we'll have future wishing well
if it's for future content
oh i mean
i'm just doing carole strats on fgo i think
do we need 2 cez b this week even
LMAO
than fhem's s0
is 60 atk lower
s2 HoF
i swear my fucking
only 60 atk
oh
ez
just match fhem damage
you're set
if you can match damage
doesn't use SS
with griseo, you cap off at 728
on FGO
can 792
s2 PE with carole
not necessarily
lemme see if i can find them
there were some griseo refs
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
<:pins:895019904024068167>
is pinned
jialao spreadsheet
and for those, cez B is a straight upgrade
but there are a ton of glut gustav newt refs





there's not many refs for it since
1. the 840 is possible with newt, so cez just makes it comfier
2. we had different week order from cn, so on that week they didn't have cez but we did
akayuki uses it on the 893 doom
she did use it on the 840 doom
is shorter duration but higher buffs
gustav TM cez B
something like
ssword take a while to ramp up
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
yes it does
HoS can also use it
going to be fixed next patch
that's HoT charge cancel
just don't get banned
maybe you can make it up with the bug
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
ye
hekate
i'm doing ft bb ch
why would i be talking about abyss
it's MA dumbass
and it still deals damage
you can cancel follow up attack after combo with dodge
it's really simple
i'll do it normally though, it's not like the 893 is hard
it's very easy to do
for the 893
lmao i used the mobius bug
dunno about how y'all doing in sea
nah we're too occupied by ping pong between 455 and 445 dist over here
fuck nyx lmao
i guess that makes sense
couatl is villv boss now?
o wait
+ i bet her score diff will be a good amount higher in abyss
sorry i won't doompost, still day 1 and new strats will prob show up
by sucking
villv just following the steps of the giants
LMAO
is fucking bullshit
though
on HoT
the transition phase
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
and s3 HoT scoring 616
ss scoring 664
s3 scoring 632 on sss kosma
yikes
damn villv looking kinda
that's what it means
on same team
you can use 2 cez b
holy fuck 1 hour long
pokemon asmr
there's official
good advertising
that all hic emotes end in hic
kinda based
literally lottery
it was turg cat
i do snipe in nirv though, i didn't that time, that time was unironically me last second balding and lucking out a score
<:mar7cry:997517553247207454>
1. they
2. i literally never said that
3. IT WAS AN ACCIDENT IT WAS A MONTH AGO LEAVE ME ALONE
LMAO
use HoT
the answer is just
90% of those
<:Cryge:953999086506377306> IT WAS AN ACCIDENT
everyone knows your score like this
also if you wanna snipe you should tap side stage
is fucked up
half of ss bosses gone
is losing 1 ss boss
the thing that depresses me
i've said this before, i don't mind double sss boss that much
HoF, FT CH BB
hepha has lots of the good options open too
and jizo is supposedly easy with griseo
hepha prob easiest possible ss boss
i dunno shit about sss kosma but
this week doesn't look thaaat bad
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
road back to 450
you mean
<@370438895965306882> what's nirv dist rn?
sheeeesh
and beat taihen on the atk race <a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i'll finally reach my maximum power after crafting the 2 dks
after i craft my 2 dks
and i'll get to them
and then i'm done with crafting important stuff
i only need my second set of handel, shennong T and fuxi T
<:ganyuConfused:997517548448927885>
yeah i'd simp for gresham if i was honkai too
game has player preference <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
on lite
didn't you see it
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
<@370438895965306882> your time to shine and break the cap somehow
proof that no one fucking reads: baban is the first one to notice
LMAO
in the description
o yea they do be lying
shouldn't cost sp after pri
gricross?
whel
i guess it depends on how braindead this cycle is
prob wouldn't worry about it
that's a new name
i don't think beefy is dangerous though
i think yureko might be dangerous? and maybe coookiezi, but coookiezi doesn't try every cycle
on next sss bke
damn i'm going to be -49 frags from sss eden
<:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
LMAO
might have an opening there for 5th
i dunno about theo
hmm
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
sheeesh
powerful gresham
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
oh you retained?
just bkek
RL or nirv?
really? feel like that shouldn't be an issue
<@385655541248163840>
still have space?
sure
classic honkai NA
i did some dumb shit and outscored them
they scored 541
i'm in RL
<a:aworryFlashbang:897712369843716126>
flashbang
thank you
say less
coins??
wait
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
:D
and i don't have to do ma abyss or ER
i just have to do 4 mas, 3 abyss, 2 ER
those seem like all worthy trades
<:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
okay if i do this perfectly i might not need to play the game
still took more than 36* abyss LMAO
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
20 mins
it was like
my 917-every-boss comp
FT week
i was able to do all 3 with the same comp lmao
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
let's fucking go
4k sex
yeah?
it's going to be fiiine
and damage was so barely off
so i had to use bleed sword
cause i had no sirin
that fucking HoF 893 gave me an aneurysm a few weeks back
if i'm fine with 893 i can just run the FT CH BB
i guess not
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
on dxy
for me to bring out the HoF 893
is it time
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
oh lmao in that case it's a lot more expensive
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
and ch damage doesn't matter if i don't qte
since i don't have the hands to 946 with ch qte
to go for ss2 ch
interesting decision from past keilo
me neither lmao
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
yeah i'm checking
i have them bought out so can't check
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
is it? gresham told me it was 6/6
220 if you use the abyss boxes for AW instead of torus
which is 200 for consistent income per week
and then 65 if you t2%/t100
210 on the monthly buy which avgs out at ~52 per week from that
and then AW is 28 from sss boss, 55 from clearing
which is barely not enough to buy out FR + ely
if you're a3/a4/a5
so that's 56/60/66 per week
and +10 from just clearing
if you max score
then +12 AL for the SSS boss
for a3/a4/a5
we get 17/19/22 per abyss
lmao
is for s1 AE suicide strats
since the only time damage taken might matter
-damage taken dorm bonus are actually bad
if you think about it
but now i guess i'll just sss HoR
for HoR leader skill
i was going to sss DB eventually
DB and aponia are the only 2 valks i don't have lmao
that kmb shares
there's also an ss skill
wait no
only leader skill
and sss px for AE leader skill
which you prob don't need anymore
that number does include sss kmb though
i only need 14.6k AW to buy everything i need! :D
thank you <a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
just so i can feel bad about it
i'm doing the math of how many AW and AL i need
how much does BN frags cost
and now i can't check lmao
for once
i bought out the ones for the week
oh alright ty
like 8/8 al/aw?
do the ely and fr frag cost again
how much
<:Wokege:945150727473471508>
i'll do more balding later today
i won't be left behind though
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
closer to non-awakened prices
yeah actually, they could've chosen to make it 700 each for 4200
6 x 600 = 3600
3 x 1500 = 4500
actually they are slightly cheaper
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<:YEP:875561908172902471>
i'm MA player
i don't remember where i got mine
i still have to max
these are the weapons
LMAO
before ely bow
should i max it
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
mine's not maxed
maybe cf diff?
and my handel is affixed LMAO
lux deals around same damage as me
hmmm this is fucked up
damn too slow
lux did a ss0 HoT with ss eden and no handel affixes
this might help you
oh also <@370438895965306882>
i wasn't resetting for it though
i'll just cap without fast shield and then if i still want more points i'll do fast shield
and i spent around 4 hours and got 3 times
magery spent 2 1/2 hours and got 0 times
phi says he gets it around 30% of the time
yeah apparently you can get it somewhat consistently
between the buggy evade and the fucked up fast shield
the opener is the most fucked up part
huh
-1 or -2
which is like
you can use the kyoshiro opener
with the fast shield with eden QTE
and if you don't wanna bald the opener
but there's the -1 808 rots there too
i think
all 824s should be the same rot
there's some more on jialao's spreadsheet
it looks fucking sick
what's there to slander
that one is ugly tho
and asked some whaling advice lmao
i've talked with nolive before
oh sheeeesh
<:BARBARA_LOVE:708170069548597248>
thank you
stupid
sss eden is just
-8 from sss eden

i don't wanna do more raids
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>

and then HB is just....
my eden for one is getting done the day after SSS BKE goes away
<:Sadge:715448677162024980>
my sss hb is so fucking far away
ooo opposite here
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
awful value

last cycle
my fucking lobby
did you see
no
t30 still shit at abyss
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
look at me
eh MA placement doesn't matter
and see if they have trophies
is check performance
easiest way to see if they're trouble
<:Wow:759857863848886303>
which was really hard since doing dumb shit is my primary hobby
so i could have the coin and metal
i stopped myself from doing so much dumb shit
i've never been more prepared
i did like 5 raids this week for coins
i've been saving up since the start of the patch LMAO
for 7tr?
cool
i might have the full handel though
i actually did the math and i won't have sss eden for next sss BKE either
i don't have handel T and my eden is stil SS
yeah i dunno about that
in time for the weapon active to come out
seems like you just gotta reset until the shield is broken on p1
<@385655541248163840>
you did some breath -> weapon active -> more breath
and then breath
you're supposed to do weapon active asap
also after getting on dragon
during the transition
very different from the ref
and then you're doing a lot of stuff
which makes it so a lot of it comes off on hitcount shield
you're doing directly combo atk
you're supposed to do HoT weapon active -> combo atk
after doing the switch HoT -> dodge -> QTE eden -> QTE HoT
on p1
sheeesh ok
ss1 HoT 3s pv 3s eden
or at least like
i imagine you're matching ranks?
<:galaxyFpsScum:997517546636967996>
oh shit karoto ref
share ref
LMAO
cause i have no experience
based on experience
but i can't give tips
and you can show recording and i can check against ref
i can give you ref
yeah i dunno i haven't gotten my 7tr yet
you mean for MA LMAO
oh
what's going on
<:Sadge:715448677162024980>
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
that's the purpose of abyss
that's the spirit eli
try the HoF maybe
LMAO <:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
<a:chadn:977032787087482962>
eli is VP user
unironically yes
it is me, but the 1 card i'm going to spend isn't going to be a supply card, it's going to be a dawei card LMAO
same
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
it could be buffed mode
it could be worse
think of it like this
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
<:Deadge:958122498019434496>
i can't find it
also i've been looking for a while for the mobius bke ref
idr all the other options back then, just that it was then a HoF boss
oh that could be true
and now HoT is getting it back with 7tr
HoF was the one who stole it from HoT
LMAO
than sss bke
mobius scoring higher in sss jizo
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
gotta go fast
after dodging all i think she takes more damage though
if you don't dodge her thrust she fucking grabs you and spins you around
i think if you're not nirv you can get away with just killing
is not even fps i don't think
<:fpsscumhic:959744049546416148>
it's absolutely insane
to get those 3 seconds
or time
how any person can get enough damage
and i have no clue
i was like -3 on it
eh wolf even with mobius is fucking awful
by doing double SSS boss and forcing my mobius somewhere somehow
don't worry though i'm sure they'll find a way to make me use SpA there too
yeah i'm sorry about your loss
dunno if that balances it out
oh yeah andrius is def up there with his insane damage variance too, though i think it's only if you're playing mobius? if you're running SpA i think the rot is just hard + you have to deal with tornados
like clock has rng moveset, DA might aswell be a phys valk by the amount of fucking damage variance she has
then it starts to check my boxes of bad boss
if they're rng or like very close to rng
as long as they're consistent
i don't generally care about annoying or hard mechanics though
oh yeah fgo certainly has more annoying mechanics
hmm actually they look similar, both have alt options like HoT and HoF at around -300 cap from PE
but at least the fight is like 20 second long and there's not a lot of bullshit besides crit bald
HoD is also up there in the terms of not having competitive alternatives
BKE or parvati
is prob to this day still the best sss boss
and it's the least bullshit mechanic wise
all at like 3 second diff from each other
tank has HoF HoT ely team
or at least was before 7tr
but HoT is a good amount lower than the other 2
maybe clock has a place up there too, with 3 good options aponia SW HoT
yeah probably tank
i'm seeing if i can find the ref btw
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
imagine that right
enables you to get good scores with different teams with the tradeoff that you have to fuck up your affixes a little
if they kept the lightning affix tech, it'd be a very balanced boss
but yeah i kinda hate that they made SSS BKE like this
on a really good day
maybe make 2s difference
yeah no 4* klein would like
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
9s matching s2 HoF score
for 9s is kinda sad
so current t100 scores are
because no 7tr
no one has ran sss BKE yet in NA
what score
was 46.3k
the highest i found while looking for it
LMAO
30 second diff
that's fucking
47072 is quite low, compared to 47.7k s0 HoT cap
but good to keep in mind for next BKE
nope
and then phys is getting patched
and phys
is DoS HoT
basically the only other options to 7tr HoT
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
scoring barely above 47k
a fucking s2 HoF rot
you can, she scores like 072
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
LMAO
the boss is so balanced with having those affixes as options
so dumb
which is
but next patch they're fixing that and not making lightning damage affixes work anymore
and then run like ely or BKE
yeah, just give HoS a lightning damage affix
if you don't have HoT
this patch you actually would rather run phys
it's so bad
yeah
<:BARBARA_LOVE:708170069548597248>
therefore it was wrong, thank you for pointing out
i didn't mean to be inconsistent and there was a reason i chose fischl instead of pv for the first
i mean it was wrong
nope it's a bit later for some reason
i just need to wait until it opens in dawei shop
oh not that much later
8 hours later, to be precise
i'm only getting mine way later than everyone else
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
i fixed it though
but i guess i just default to them if i don't pay attention lmao
so it's more accessible
so the idea is to not use the weirder abbreviations
oh hm
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
this one is a long one
new blog over at blustorm! :D
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
yeah it's from all the balding
<:celhart:945085630726144021>
celine from blustorm
i don't think i'm worthy to take it
actually salty was celine's thing
yeah <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550> ic
i'll be salty for this for the rest of the week then i'll move on
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
another one with higher placement than me
fucking riku's bracket
did you see
i would've still retained
and hell bracket
like even with my slacc score
though i guess it goes to show how much easier nirv will be with the changes
one of them i'd be t2 lmao
where i would've retained
i think 3 different lobbies
i've seen
get me oooout
we need nirvana 2
kill me
and i'm lower position
yeah, look at my score, being at +50 dist
wtf is this boss even
placed higher than me
you fucking
too powerful
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
my back?
i'm built like tet
my bust is very small lmao
i'm not really
kinda busted
god 15% cr

<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
i thought you enjoyed that
so close
and also, only 10 months until i SS every dorm bonus valk! :D
well, probably more, rn i don't have enough income to buy out both FR and ely
8 weeks here
probably not the best use of money
and bought out the ely stamps
i went full pala last season
so
and having her at s0 is like not having her at all
i can't afford to get her s2/ss
i don't think i have a choice
and useless lmao
my ely is literally ss3
but i'll get there
at most i'll be able to craft it
and i also won't have enough metal to max ely bow after i pri
right now i need to save my coins though
i'll prob do it later this patch
i finally have enough cube to max ely bow
oh did i tell you nini
ely looks fun

and everyone else knows they can't retain and don't even try lmao
cause i feel like i'm only 6th so often because i try even though i know i can't retain
i wonder if people will try harder once 5.9 changes hit though
LMAO
i've been 6th
90% of all my nirv brackets
i think like
yeah even i'm going to be ss1
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
my time to shine
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
so all the whales that suck just go
this boss is like, no skill, all rank up and crit
jfc
in myriad
all 9s
is like
top 15
i fucking know right
so close yet so far
look at this shit lmao
i am going to give up lmao
i don't like this boss
zzzzz
double trouble
yeah sure
yeah so nice!
<:Wow:759857863848886303>
new eli pfp just dropped
oh shit everyone shut up
so you can't leave your elf on lv1 lmao
and then each level on the skill you need +5 levels
you need like lv50 to unlock skills
and then all the skills
just for that
so it also costs like fucking 3m
and they take coin too when using xp chip
compared to valk
they use around double the xp chip to max
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
but you haven't rolled for gacha elf
you say that
i looked it up
but that would be lying
i would like to say it was from memory

just HoD things
yeah i have no clue
oh
i think it freezes who deals the most damage
we get 3 daily btw
obviously
raid gloves is for raids
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
though tbf that's fucking bare minimum since you have to spend 60 stamina daily
yeah i think you get 2 daily
and the new story event is replenishing some
i spent like 10 or so
from the stamina drinks mihoyo gave us
for 7tr
on that
i unironically plan to sink like 200 stamina
and you get 50k coin for each 10 stamina spent?
did you know you can help randos do pri raid
actually for coin poor people

send recording later i can take a look at it
also <@370438895965306882> did u figure out the sp issue
you're not using CH then?
oh
can just use lv35 one, craft it for this and get rid of it after
why not
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
it's just in abyss where tf and timeslow doesn't matter so score just tanks every time you ult
since her ult still has heavy timeslow and she has plenty of tf
DoS HoT is still p good in MA
like 200pt increase
interestingly enough, scores aren't that much higher with 7tr
so some people did their balding with DoS
cause CN player didn't know they were getting 7tr that early
there are some actual DoS refs on bilibili
they are not ready then
damn
does that score
how high
well maybe a small portion if they decided to skip 7tr for some reason
since none of the good players is doing it before friday lmao
yeah it's a great time to look for clout
cata too mean
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>

i believe in you though
clearly not the right person to ask <:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
i can't 946 heim
you tell me
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
need to go even higher for her to be better
last time we got maru, nirv dist wasn't high enough for nyx to be better than SW either
only in nirv is not even completely true either
and pray
remember to change into nirv/whel/paimon emblem
HoF strats can be very baldy on sp pack pick up
yeah gl
oh
what
<a:Copege:991854669506814013>
but surely that will change with the dk + myriad emblem
i don't think i have the damage for the 946
i got an 893 on heim
i'd fucking <:TeriKMS_lum:585627694256095242>
and i swear to god if i used my 2 turgs on heim heph and needed it on BKE
i could've done the easier mobius one but i am honestly traumatised from locking gear on the wrong places
sit
because +10 atk
oh hm i should prob wait until friday to bald even SS MA
this is the sound of me getting rewarded for my mistakes
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
mobius can 786 with schro M strat
i think around 733 is doom cap if you don't have HoS open
cool
oh shit wait a second, double sleepri strat for 733?

i haven't checked refs
i'm assuming fgo uses PE HoS SI yeah?
unless there's something new for doom
week 6 will just be annoying
i think that week will be a lot easier on decisions than people make it out to be
733 ss SpA strat if you wanna save HoT for kasumi

ss1 HoT 786 rime

sss HoT 840 rime

yeah she has no type in MA, which i guess prob enables mobius into doing well
i think she's neutral in MA?
you mean type?
and then week 6 we need to go back to our roots and do elemental doom
week 4 i think you're supposed a 7tr strat on rime
annoying
i know right!! :D
so it doubles up
and weaken triggers FT qte
yeah
LMAO
than FS
and she was a better fire dps
i literally got AE as my first S-rank
because she was going to be my main fire dps
with demonblade
i actually have her at SS
the FS dps sheeesh
yeah less math to the computer = more fps
is no B piece DA for some reason
i think literally every DA recommendation
that one is so funny
by making 4/4 gear 99% of the time best in slot
honestly the in game recommendations didn't change, only mihoyo changed their design
kinda based tbh
fucking genshin player coming and going ooh constellations, i don't need signature weapon
oh yeah i guess that's fair
those people are living in another timeline
damn lmao
oh see
lmao <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
yeah fair, pure meta isn't the whole story
even though they aren't thaaaat powerful
and also, i think people are going for her just on basis that HoS is broken -> her rank ups must be broken?
so it's only a matter of time
she's the oldest herrscher without one now
i mean she's going to
have stuff to do
don't think so
everything else, the only way it's less crit baldy is by making the boss takes less hits to die LMAO
is sss griseo
i think the only thing that can make it less crit baldy
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
this doesn't look fun
i think i won't even try again
yeah
cringe boss
hm

sss griseo
<:sleepy:914211439286304778>
agony 4
since lower crit rate
just more bald
s griseo is basically the same as sss griseo under most circumstance
idt any qua valk has collapse outside of ult
o wait i guess the old tona is lightning
qua ball, couatl and 2 tona
we got 4
3?
do you want that?
cause if they didn't we would be using turg cat
they had to
i mean

no sss tona

sheeesh those floor 50 champions
not for 808
but
which tbf i'm still a 760 and i can definitely get a 792 without that 5sp
if i wanna cap 808
for the sss HoD strat
i really really really need the 5sp for HoS
sheeesh babanlao
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
i really want max neb pri right now
oh also if it makes you feel better gresham
i think people might just not have bke
because jesus
does she make rl feel like a3
like if griseo makes nirv feel like rl
is this how a3 feels like?
this is stupid btw
we climbing
that makes sense
def not
851 is not the highest one can go
after the 1st run
but more for the give up part and move on with my life part
not for the capping part
tbh for SSS boss it's close to that yeah
where does she caps? like 840? MA score lmao
literal first try this valk is unfair lmao
because the only damage variance i notice is PE's shit crit rate
or i'm blind
and don't notice
either i always evade
whoa
and every sp counts for HoS on that strat
every ultimate evasion you get is +2sp for the whole team
i'm preeeetty sure just for sp
we have cat and furry meme with cat
we only need one more furry and i can have full furry team
look think about it
retire into being a furry skin meme schro balder
5.9 just quitting balding
i'm gonna do the same lmao
LMAO
you underestimate carole powaa
is not like PE has the base 30% and carole has an extra 6%
well, it's more like 0% independent multiplier vs 36%
i would take CN wording over EN wording
since stage effect is multiplicative
then the 1.2 x 1.3 would be right
if this is what it's said
.
but that's not news
then the wording is fucked up lmao
is same as s0->s2 on most gacha valk
like 6% on one independent multiplier
but that 6% is very big still
type counter effects are 20% stronger = 20% of 30% is 6%
unless the wording is wrong, then it is just 6%
oh i'm pretty sure not 50% tdm, it makes so type counter buff goes from 30% -> 36%, and it's unique multiplier
what's 50% tdm?
now relieves as BKE lite, and better than BKE on shield weather
kinda funny, carole died as main phys support
and they do be using full paga
hmm yeah it looks from CN refs that carole dps scores higher
quite the good score
then it's true lmao
if it's scoring 772
and the kafka TM one on the 840 doom
keeby talking she's best at dxy
the only carole dps i've seen before is like
i could be wrong tho <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
i'm not sure
and also i think on carole dps you use like ely TB?
hmm i think PE dps is prob better there than carole dps
what context
on fighting enemies alone
a whole anime episode
your run was
jesus
it look good
i dunno if that's a good score or not
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550> ?
not anymore
i'm so proud
so many new names on t100
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
i think there's a good chance though
hard to say for now
hmmm
imagine reading the text on screen
i just dodge them
oh shit you're supposed to deflect them?
you can deflect missiles?
... on purpose, at least *stares at wolf*
if anything at least SSS bosses aren't rng fest
she'll be a better boss
tbh good chance if HoV gets SSS
i am stupid
oh it's past midnight
wait wtf today is friday?
👀
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
oh yeah and today is blog day, quite late though
nvm
well actually i guess i did 0s HoV last time
that's what i said last time
LMAO
<:gachaplayers:959751592637259816> <:theliterate:959737715564359740>
there was a shieldbreak mobs rot that used it
you can use it to trigger carole qte
she applies it to newly spawned mobs too
but i'm pretty sure it's right
could be wrong
just heard about it when i was a beginner lmao
i mean, the charged attack impair would replace the ult impair
you can still replace it, but then she applies hers back again
no, HoS just keeps reapplying hers
most recent impair replaces old one
<:Clueless:945134983029358602>
but it's not as bad as it sounds
yeah ofc
i mean HoS ult is 15s
working the mines lmao
my HoV is fucking
still wanna pri it to not make 2021 keilo sad
i've used the stig a bunch and haven't touched the weapon
and now
i was like oh no 2 stigs when i wanted the weapon :(
so lucky
got out with gustav TM
i fucking went looking for 11th
i rolled on that LMAO
idk where my CH came from
and watching that i went yeah sounds right
but i have ss1 CH
i didn't watch it when i was choosing what to invest
is that the one video where he says CH if you're downbad for MA
so dumb lmao
yeah
so slimy lmao
is this one rank up
the thing i don't like about AKA
jesus
she is through golden witch orb
<:YEP:800844799870500885>
just get villv in 3 years once she's farmable
not as many people had her last patch i swear
cause jesus fuck
people were able to pull for her after her banner ended
i'm fucking surprised
LMAO
god and finding s0 refs
yeah
so i'm not spending anymore this patch
and i'm getting 7tr through dawei card
i'm almost at 30k from saving up
oh i mean i just have enough xtal
but i don't think it's worth it if i don't go for s2
110 pulls
i think i could afford to roll for her
impressive
so freaking powerful
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
LMAO
it's on beta tet
oh
coin?
but that would be her actual meta usage nowadays, but nyx is p much gone from SS MA
she also does have some usage in SS MA as a turg + undine holder as a nyx support
bilibili is the 840
that's :58
and aka is 946 with s0
she has an 840 on AKA
a top score? no
hmm this is how much i'm missing from maybe 946 homu
before it was 936
because of the HoD changes
with griseo
the cap is now lower
i mean
🧢
they cappin
sheeesh
i don't think it helped
because i thought it would help
also i rolled for ss griseo
okay figured it out better
something something apply griseo cross debuffs
can you try waiting a bit after QTEing in with PE before ulting?
i remember you being a bit off from one shotting p1
<@370438895965306882> i'm doing sss HoD
about that often i think
these scores are weird
-5 from s3 cap?
apparently i'm -1 from s0 cap?
it's here though
my channel
i thought i had lost
oh
but i'm 893 pleb
but yeah it's supposed to be an easy 946
nqn hates you
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
for u to steal
<a:deadlao:943923331097321513> <a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
i'm tilted
don't ask
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
and tank fhem ref
cause i can do husk fhem ref
that makes me feel good
i took a reaction test last time i went to the doctor and my times clocked out from inbetween turtle and dead turtle
if i can do it literally anyone can
not that it's hard
i'm just saying it's harder
but any 946 needs fast hands
hepha is very lenient on gear
but yeah heim is prob easier input wise than hepha
yes
LMAO
so i wasn't able to 893 last time heim was around
i'm s2 HoF
but i can't say for sure cause
the inputs for the heim look way easier
hmm i dunno
maybe i'm missing something
i wouldn't say full of shit
but not helpful for multiple reasons
which tbf is very sick
with paralyse stigs on HoT
but it's 9s HoT FR eden
well, i do see one
don't see any new 946 heimdall
also i'm looking at refs
<a:swipe:816826530231353354>
and then if i have the money
i'll look for a job then though i think
cause it was making me feel bad + i'm going back to college soon
i am on low spender mode because i quit my job lmao
but could change
hmm as it stands right now, no
<a:greshamlao:976905381429272668>
you can't kill on ult lmao
so if you deal too much damage
cause it has the red form
<:TeriDerp:569741126148292610>
ss = 946
s1/s2/s3 = can't
s0 = can 893
most strats are like
heimdall punishes rankscam
funnily enough
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
you can prob run the LE HoS PE
the easiest 946 in the game
and heph is
<ss0 you get 893
or 9s PE team
0s heim is ss0 HoF only
did we get new stuff for heim
what
i can look for more stuff later if you want
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
rough week
you can try old HoT strat
but no <a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
or shit like that
cause it would be slow hands
then it'd be skill issue
if i took 3 Bs to kill and wasn't able to get the 946
i stole it
so it's just dmg diff
nah again, i'm taking a full another B to kill from ref
i've never had issue without it before
but
it's a good amount yeah
with s2 lmao
<:Shrug:616394597211439118>
and ref kills with 3
with ss
cause like i need 4 B to kill
or my atk really really sucks
it's either nuada pri that adds a lot of damage
for once it's actually not skill issue
idgi <:TeriDerp:569741126148292610>
but mine can only 893
i saw some mobi refs for 946
what other options do you have for homu
oh hmm
i am tiredy
i'll leave it for tomorrow i think
<:AnselBlush:596473956597235723>
i guess i could do that today
i mean i gotta try
yeah
yes i don't have an s0 PE
and then i'll be at 0
and then 7tr will slurp all of the rest
for sss hod
but i might max griseo pri
i have like 850 rn
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
i'm too metal poor
i really should max mine
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
nini is aiming straight for the 5k trophies per season
and i'll go woah
but i haven't maxed cosmic, so maybe i'll change my mind once i do
i can completely agree with the first 2 but i'm not sold on the third
i think it's from a standpoint of
1. flexibility
2. longevity and
3. benefit from maxing
but it is coming from both kartolao and imylao
i dunno if i personally agree with that
which is cosmic and purana are the 2 highest prios to max
i'll parrot what dalao player says
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
though i guess that could change with double SSS MA
you barely use cosmic since you p much never use it on HoS and you barely use AE
for MA, senpri is a better investment
for abyss player, anyway
for both
then the choice is 100% cosmic
but if you are choosing which to pri/max first
then case by case
like if you have both and you are choosing which to use
if you mean as an investment
hmm i think cosmic is better probably
SS HoS has slightly higher sp gen
just in very niche situation
it can affect the choice
and nirv now feels like RL so
so in RL, 99% of the time you'll already be wanting cosmic
basically, the squishier the mobs are = the more sp locked your rots will be
while dist don't catch up, we'll need the sp gen
after griseo release
i wanna say tho
but in abyss it depends on how much sp gen you need
for MA is p much always senpri
in abyss, that is
always depends on the rotation
<a:greshamlao:976905381429272668>
it's getting hit that counts, not taking damage
hits on shield still fuck hua up
i guess that's fair, still recommended a whole lot more than i prob agree with
so you should still ask for taihen for the prettier ones
and well, i guess uglier
ik people like the guides taihen posts for ER, that second link is the same but translated in EN
maincord (butter) ER signet recommendation

CN (moonlight center) ER signet recommendation

which at least makes more sense, it isn't that easy to fuck up
now aponia2 is their new best friend
apparently they went down on hua2 recommendations from last patch
which i guess is based
cn player just really love hua
so yeah idgi lmao
on avg that is, since it does depend on how well you're doing and if you picked coin gen signets, how early you picked them
yeah, it's better than 40 stack hua and i think maybe a little worse to equal to 60 stack hua
maybe CN guides are made purely on speedruns only?
since cat is better value
and she isn't even the best like oh good value so just go for her
same about griseo, you can get hit during ult animation and lose stacks
they had it recommended on aponia, where there are moments where you can't move or dodge but you aren't invincible lmao
this is literally not possible in some valks is the issue
and now griseo has it???
last patch like fucking 70% of the characters had hua for some god forsaken reason as first prio
talking about signet btw love the character
love hua so much
why do cn player
by not deserving it a single bit
is this going to be all my retain nirvs now
0 deservance
like
how did i retain that
?????
that called homu homo
shoutout to this one ref
<:TeriDerp:569741126148292610>
lmao even the vid name is wrong
griseo will do that
oh yeah
i like it
based
LMAO
just bald more²
by me? hepha! :D
not many people will bald last second on these bosses i feel like
probably safe
<:PU_PepeSniper:702496145393451118>
biribirilao LMAO
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
i've literally never watched a livestream of those lmao
oh no not more familiar
skill issue
is it shui?
oh shit that one i might know
the cute sirin
just like ehhh fuck it
this one
lmao they just gave up for that one
like i enjoy it but i can't imagine watching it is fun
lmao y'all have interesting meaning of entertaining
shame
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
lmao you don't know?
i know the sets i dunno what they've done in real life
so
yeah my problem is i fucking suck at history
accursed shadows i have no clue
could be paga too but i think paga is violin
but not based on name just on a TM set
yeah i though about jst
who tf critiques shit
critic is hmmm
laws of motion is newt prob
lemme guess
lmao
the names are cool but
stiglao
by their set name lmao
calls the stig sets
who tf
<:PogU:465017582249050112>
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
i have to do some stuff for blog though
if it's about me
nah i'm waiting on my sisters pc to become available lmao
<:worrynirvanajail2_hh:828444826822508554>
RL looks fun
and that's how you change weapon twice
so inputs should be press ult -> evade -> press ult
so what you need to do is cancel that attack with a dodge
and during that, she can't change weapon again
when you change weapon, HoS does a little attack
you're prob doing the wrong inputs
it's not boomer hands
on rimestar it was so bad
yeah exactly LMAO
don't understand how it's still like this
it's kinda laughable how low base pick up range is
after getting used to nirv emblem
waow
imagine having higher than s0 PE
<:whalepat_hh:710738275845013576>
weird
oh wow it went up?
<@416445660443967491> what's rl dist
push the shop into it
<:GWslippyPeepoS:407618446814216202>

<- they say, getting their ass handed to them by tona
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
yeah fair, i'm too busy soaring the ranks rn
respectable
oh okay so you're just making drama
nini just sent my id lmao
i am a little scared
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
<:disappointGura:756520039426949270>
wow such a bad boyfriend
you add me <:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
no more crafting dks
glad this is a thing
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
so i can craft the dks i'm missing
i'll give you some if you give me crafting mats
trust
one day i'll have enough atk
atk i think
so it's not getting much better
and she's already ss2
mine is fucking 142x
idk i just see every ref has 1500-1600
i still can't fucking understand how FR gets to 1600
<:TeriCopium:969281688414875728>
oof
A-rank LK
i'll literally never need DB huh
i guess with HoR being made farmable
AKA needs 25
HoT needs 60 for rank up at s0
yeah but 10 AKA frags is worth way more than 10 HoT frags
cause she's non-awakened
dw you'll get her soon
maybe early next year
well, soon
so she should be coming soon
arguably oldest if you don't count AKA
SN is the second oldest non-farmable valk
and added like 2 new tf skills with the constellation changes lmao
lemme show you a real tf bot
oh is she bad? people using her as tf bot?
they really went like
sss reduces ult cd lmao
yeah it sounds v nice
but by then she'll prob be farmable
and then one day i'll get ss2 SN
i'll be getting DA and BKE ss1
is going up to ss1 in a few patches
highest i have for non farmable is ss0
nah i'm joking
all of them gacha-only
whoa i have 21
cringe
imagine having nyx
whoa
s0
<:miriothink:959328310033252432>
pull for it
<:miriothink:959328310033252432>
just use cf on fischl
weak collection balder
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
wouldn't you want to cube raven bow either way for the collection points then
well
god the collection point mindset
i am legit considering doing that to my fischl bow
<:miriothink:959328310033252432>
just use into ely pri
trust
and use it on her
wait for teri herrscher
i wasn't in RL for it <:Cryge:953999086506377306>
you get a comfortable t2 instead of t1
i mean even then
people always sleep in RL
yeah RL is Like That
powerful eli
also i missed this ping <a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
wonder how that happened
waow what a coincidence
is best one
lmao
is missing 10 free atk all this time
13th reason why for eli
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
click sync lmao
sync 1 is when syncing first weapon, sync 2 is by syncing the second weapon
it's 10 <a:MeiQuestion:930749563655061514>
it's not 20 atk
that's not very affordable
which while they look easy on damage
only saw FT BB CH 946
i looked through refs for a bit
i have no clue what it is
it's triple H
HoD HoV Homu
it's
next week should be my new pb
for next week
i need to save bald bucks
sleep angle
we sleep
s0 griseo tho
i guess i have only T scuff
for griseo stuff lmao
i just don't have the mats
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
yeah
and i have already given up
i haven't even started yet
do it like me
jizo?
my children growing up
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
i am so very much proud
too powerful
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
damn
yeah you're living in RL like it's nirv
position yourself properly lmao
before you had to just
on nirv jizo
damage issue
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
oh
not on time
it spawns on spider hp level
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
keilo misinfo
during it
can even take nap
fast and comfortable clears
i'll force you into taking breaks
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
i can understand
i mean as long as you're taking care of yourself
oh i see
that's kinda cute but you don't need to overwork yourself for attention
why you overworking youself
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
do i make fun of you?
i don't understand what that means but thank you maybe?
imagine keeping up with more than one
yeah some days i can barely keep up with mine
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
so i'm impressed
no i'm saying that i wouldn't be able to do it
i can't 2 honk acc
oh god taihen
come to brazil <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
i'm not there but
LMAO can't wait
what's that supposed to mean
share gear later
if you have to do more bs afterwards then that's like your only choice
though your later timing could be better if you do end up just not having the damage to kill with throw
since if you do, it doesn't reset HoS switch cd
just have to be careful to not elf ult before PE QTE
you can't do it too late tho
any time between PE QTE and PE horse evade is good enough
but i doubt all the damage you're missing is from elf ult
you're supposed to elf ult same time as PE QTE is dropping
well i know a part of why it's so far
show me whatcha running
sheeesh
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
damage on p1 looks very harsh though
you want to weapon active first and then dodge for tf
start order is wrong
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
if you wanna get closer to cap share vid and i can try to help
and you do well
you find out what you're doing wrong
is simple
is that doom
and it won't make me reevaluate my options lmao
the only thing that will make reevaluate my options is columbus
i wanna say one of those will be dante hler
inb4 it's ele damage taken lmao
and also future dorm bonus
i'll get her ss1 just for flex
and then sss pig in abyss in 5.5
we had a pig in abyss in 5.6
and DA... yeah DA might be ss0 already
it's going up at least another rank
ss0 BKE is baseline
ss1 BKE idts
<:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
everyone and their mothers will have ss DA ss1 BKE baseline
also i'm fucking scared of nirvana after this bp season
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
honkai is a hard game
i have so many pri and i'm still missing so many pri
everyone simps for it very hard
you should consider cosmic
on the ref
that's legit fucking carole dps lmao
that's cosmic tho
yeah that's like +25 over our dist
so should be easy to follow damage-wise
i think is higher diff than our RL too
there's one in kartolao ref list
oh okay lmao
interesting team comp
what
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
so not that close at all
but then i still need to SS SK and HoV
so close...
AL ran out in the finish line
<:TeriCopium:969281688414875728>
once i finish her the grind will be easier right
next week i get ss3 ely tho at least
<:ChillSmug:586658267170734090>
i'll have quit by then
issok if it's 6.2
yeah no griseo slurped all of mine up
everything fucking breaking down lmao
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
a while before i was buying ely FR and CH
i ran out of AL so bad i can't even buy both ely and FR frags out
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
and then now there's the AW to buy
i thought i was like kinda okay on asterite
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
i'm so fucking mat deprived
hope that helps
fuck nyx
around here we say
oh sorry about the misunderstanding
so catch up time
and is looking like 0 pri to me lmao
next patch is looking like only 1 pri
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
same
all rime strats are kinda hard
prob easier to cap yeah but like as a baseline skill floor to perform
idk if PE strat is easier
if you use elemental debuffs on rime, then you don't need max/close to max SoS to damage shield
like the old HoT SR HoF
though ofc idt you can cap
you can use lv50/55
well if you do elemental rime
<a:sleephic:897367201668010044>
i'll try again though
my damage sucks
i tried doing that
sheeeesh
lmao
but usually it doesn't bother me as long as it's not to make me feel bad
my threats are only a technique so people remember
i mean i don't care much about people getting it wrong by accident
yeah you said that last time
issok, this is actually the first time you apologised i think <a:Pat:914638151069356062>
it clearly doesn't fucking work
thank you i try to make them memorable
very subtle message i know
i mean i'll remove your organs with my hands through your mouth if you don't stop misgendering me actually
LMAO
just very dumb
is my main personality trait
of being very stupid
i'm very proud
is not a bad thing
well i'm stupid but ye i'm good
6ft under
old one
a lot, and i mean a lot of the info on honkai is pretty shit LMAO
i mean the thing about honkai is that this is not necessarily true
<:pepeold:746089014087647393>
i'll show you the way to test stuff out and find out answers
i won't be here to answer questions forever
you see children, i'm not going to be here forever
but in other cases it's really hard to find the data
so in this case it might be pretty obvious
i mean the thing about honkai data is that it sucks
taihen thinks hakcer just wants to slacc off and doesn't want to get better at the game
that is pretty straightforward to me
i think hakcer clearly wants to understand more of the game if he's asking about the game
yeah
so they would gain from testing out and getting a better understanding of the game
but clearly not to hakcer cause hakcer needed to ask
to me, and to you, and to taihen
i already said that is obviously true
????
please tell me more about the game i don't wanna know more about
tf they're doing asking questions then
just like what you can do lmao
after you test a bit and understand the game better then you can start to make educated guesses on what works and what doesn't
ofc i don't mean that lmao
based
and then taking the best one
by testing different ways to slacc off first
you need to optimally slacc off
<a:MeiQuestion:930749563655061514>
they wouldn't ask questions about it lmao
if they wanted to just slacc off and not care about the game
<:shrug:877047647511384064> i think people who ask questions want to get better at the game
<a:MeiQuestion:930749563655061514>
yeah waste 5 mins using a worse setup and then understanding more about the game
what's that supposed to mean
<a:MeiQuestion:930749563655061514>
yeah and that's mean to hakcer lmao
yeah
what do you not get
then you'll have better info
then you should test it lmao
and you wanna get better at the game
if you are literally questioning yourself which is better
yeah just test it
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
well that's just mean to hakcer
what's not to understand lmao
hakcer would get important info from testing
you don't need to test it
hakcer doesn't
you know it's better
<a:MeiQuestion:930749563655061514>
is not, that's what i mean lmao
but for like, is this setup or this setup better when you already have both, just test it lmao
like should i pull for x or y you can't just pull for both, decide, and then unpull for the other
i understand if it's investment question
lmao
you know how you get smarter? by testing stuff so you can understand it better
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
clearly not an obvious result if he was asking about it
you can just test yourself which is better
instead of going to ask person whos done the testing of which is better
is about mindset
i wasn't saying that either
i'm not saying SA is not better
so stupid lmao
where you couldn't see if enemy was bleeding or not
and to think there's a chance this was going on before trauma rework
man this is so fucked up lmao
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
until i restart the game
doesn't bleed
where sometimes she just
wtf is wrong with dxy
just test it out
might be pretty obvious in this situation but there are other that are not
LMAO
to test it out
5 min adventure
is literally
taihen
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
wasting time is main attraction
is honkai
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
yeah? okay? you can just test it out to see which one is better
for performances questions like that you can just test stuff out
i think so too but
<:Madge:909232418379153418>
try both
fucking
good fucking job
for the waiting room in a bit
**SEA server** closes at __**<t:1656554400:F>**__ and is expected to go back up at __**<t:1656576000:F>**__
**Global server** (both EU and NA) close at __**<t:1656561600:F>**__ and is expected to go back up at __**<t:1656583200:F>**__
LMAO
testing for my dxy
can you actually do
oh wait carv
ping me when you're doing it <:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
but you dont know wtf is going on
so interesting to see a game with the enemies and the characters you know
that sounds like fun
oh hell yeah
<:Theresad:476616089178996746>
i guess
i'll take that
would you reconsider the pronouns there
taihen my darling
of if people are just running the PE strat on dxy and doing elemental shit on doom
i'm wondering if there's enough 946 FT BB CHs there
<@180679257851166721> what's everyone in SEA running for the 946 dxy?
yeah the if i had your account i'd get the same score is especially cope LMAO
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
they have no clue how many of us have the ranks and not the hands
90% of casuals will look at nirv and go all money
yeah it's pretty thankless work
yeah he's the one that got the 760 score on ely on tank
and he has some v dumb takes lmao
but he runs fucking copium ass shit and i have no clue if it's because of misinvestment or flex
only thing i know is that he's like kinda good mechanically
i think
café quanta?
he's from...
so that goal will still be there
promoting nirv will be as hard as ever, arguably harder
that one is particularly dumb
LMAO
yeah TRL has lots of 1iq takes imo
lmao
was someone going wow why don't you do abyss
the only time any randos said anything about my placements
HoT 2nd best
nyx ofc
<:worrynirvanajail2_hh:828444826822508554>
<@385655541248163840> <:worrynirvanajail2_hh:828444826822508554>
stuff like better bp, baiting people into spending more and more
every release is very powerful, very little is skippable at the high end
a while back it was more simple, you pull or skip current new character and roll for their gear, now we have break up rankings which add smaller power increases for cheaper, making people spendd more
making good mid deals that make you spend just that bit more
is just praying more and more on the middle spender
well the way i think of it, it's more of a vibe for me, prob shouldn't speak like that
they're working towards it
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
<a:bugcatdeadpat:898434851160604684>
playing his own game now
oh yeah keeb is just like
switching it up?
he's all in
i'm surprised keeb's going strong
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
as the game becomes more like genshin
fossils just quitting left and right
fenrysk is burnt out <:Sadge:715448677162024980>
<@218762069338619906> <@385655541248163840>
idt one can do it without op and idt we'll be op-ing anyone
you want me to mark something there?
is just a command
i have to do it on console
plot twist holy
YOU're fenrysk???
wait
<a:Nod:915873106323709962>
+1
good emote
very interesting
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
and others value emotional support
others value technical gameplay
some people value a lot investment advice
people definitely have extremely different meaning of influential
i mean i'm fine if i'm the most influential i just really doubt it LMAO
i can keep going
citrus moriso
neffr vaff
iriya
keeb, fhem, rino, akayuki
like
don't you have more dalao influence
u really don't have to
lmao kinda based
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
i really don't think i'm probably main influence to anyone, so pls don't pick me tyvm
<a:Nod:915873106323709962>
yeah i can see how he might be very impactful
oh wow that's pretty nice
nini senpai
so i can relate to you
and learn who they are
i'll subscribe to them
i dunno who fenrysk is LMAO
name
i don't even do much
i am mid player
i don't think that's likely me
i mean you vote for the player who was the most influential on your growth
<:A_HuPray:909232418739855460>
though if you aren't competitive you're still welcome to do so
the more competitive you are, the more i ask you to do it
from solstice
to help dariuslao
fill this
840 gotten'd
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
well, 1 second better lmao
than 733 doom and 946 dxy
way better to 840 doom and 893 dxy
but this is good to know that i can lock HoF HoS PE on doom for the 840
i'll try more for it once i get griseo cross
not even close
but i don't think i have the damage for 946
i can 893
without gri cross
you could run bleed tech with holmes TM
i thought you were saying instead of ignite tech
yeah maybe with griseo cross
oh i see what you mean
CH doesn't bleed
yeah
holmes only give bonuses if the enemy is already bleeding
ofc she can't, holmes doesn't bleed
oh wait no
dunno if it can be frozen tho
maybe bastet?
just gpn
but i haven't seen any holmes 946
or the 1s lower duration really matters
maybe too little damage bonuses on BB herself
hmm i don't think so
for easier 946
and not need the ignite tech
apparently you can use griseo cross on CH to bleed
but if you wanna wait a bit
so you need the ignite tech
yeah apparently damage is really tight
help
no changed huh....
let alone 2
i don't even have enough metal for 1 max pri
did like half a week of lite and <a:ppPoof:933892036296343552>

good luck lmao
<a:winkeline:587369205482127361>
see if it helps ya
that's me coach
check the link i sent a bit later
dxy fking cursed apparently
the timer disappearing as 5:00 and the comedic timing on that 893
it's very funny actually LMAO
lemme find it
repressed so hard his pb degraded from 056 to <47k lmao
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
of me coaching them to 47k
repressed the memory
boo fucking
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
to help you further
and i was too busy malding
and MA changes
and then we got news of 5.9
we were on call together and i coached you into a 47k score
<:A_MomTao:846956543564185670>
don't gaslight me that definitely did happen
i'm almost sure that happened
and you got 47k
i showed you an opening
i coached you on jizo too
i coached you into one
<:ganyuConfused:979144263742943272>
didn't you already have a 47k score
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
on pe
did u see my jumpsec
darius is powerful
i can try to help
did you find out an answer
oh i forgot about this
i'm so proud
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
yall unironically balding this like it's MA huh
good mixture
kinda creepy and kinda cute
so cool
carv so mysterious
<a:dalao:882059165093228635>
my hardworking dollars
by giving the great carv
i'll feel honoured
wdym free youtube membership
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
i imagine
like keeby
moriso got the big content creator priviledges
that's what i'm thinking it is, no need to check it out/answer about it
that's smort
i'm assuming you're just being safe then
oh not nda?
from marisa
maincord actually
just to be clear, it wasn't carv who told me, i just found out through some nda breaking peeps over at...
maybe this is why i'm not accepted into betas LMAO
<:SmugSage4:314264526776434698>
i mean i know what it is and i'm just playing dumb
i want that for us overseas peeps
like yk how CN has official but fan kept wiki
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
but not everything
it's pretty and most of the stuff is right
this one
i guess the official wiki is also fan kept
fan wiki sucks
please god
are we finally getting wiki
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
yeah witch orb is my main source rn
might want to change some dk into sp stuff
since you can use mei on cat
it's easier i think
oh if you have selune
i just turned off rita qte lmao
1427 atk but 3* sirin
i elf scammed
but i'd recommend at least trying out the ref strat
you might need to do that if you're running thales M
yeah for the 3p ragna strat that is waaaaaay too late
it had huge variance to me
just try slightly different stuff
on 3p ragna strat you're supposed to use around when she's on peak of her jump on first charged attack after summoning nado
try doing it differently still
oh hmm
for some reason that gave me huuuge damage difference
try to change weapon active timing
damage diff'd
then <:deadge:933767520085770341>
you're using BE on p1 yeah?
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
if you're running the same stuff as the 946
reeeeally chill
893 should be
no luck all skill trust
.2s
since p2 takes like
that would make sense
i would've answered the same thing lmao
if you asked me the same question like 3 patches ago
it's been so long since i last touched these too
6/6/8/7
<:Sadge:715448677162024980>
and none of my branches be maxed
+7tr
i am missing the 2 craftable
but after that then maybe dk arc
nah i should craft handel T
instead of crafting handel T
maybe i should
to catch up
can't wait to have the mats
i mean you literally have one more dk available than me LMAO
yeah
not great in
that one i am uh
and this is how this tab's looking
be careful
i'll catch up
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:pepeW:770030202548912179>
take that as a blessing
with how crit baldy SN is
honestly
i'll take that
a medium?
LMAO
and i'm having fun
and then i think i spent 10 hours already on husk
so awful
i balded abyss jizo for like 2 hours and hated it all
i might have a problem
that's the fun part
wdym still
look at those pain ratings
poor akayuki
that week
it was fps scam only, akayuki had to make a completely new strat to 893 it on 120fps
oh a great example of fps scam strat is the 893 doom
i think the 728 on husk is fps scam only
and saving a second on some really tight ones
making p much all scores easier to get
on higher fps, buffs last slightly longer and animations are slightly shorter
you can go on registry and change max fps
who's our resident kiana simp
or if they actually just fps scam
but i dunno if they just did it a few times to test
i mean i'm sure at least the peeps over at lumina know about it, since i found out about it when they talked about it over there lmao
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
the fps scamming?
about what
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
i believe
you'll def match damage thresholds for the s0 616 ref
you can prob get away with irene B on cat
if you're not running FR on either
maybe a few more
i'm pretty sure zetsubou/#1 kiana simp fps scams
i def don't have the damage for the 648 strats
i'm s2, so i'm just trying the s0 616 and saving a second there
and there's no ref for s1/s2 lmao
ss is 664
s3 is 648
s0 SW cap is 616
anyway for other caps
so there's a good chance we won't see 728
we don't have many fps scammer in global
cap with fps scam is 728
cap is 712
oh wait no
yeah i think no one took upon themselves to bald 728 yet
maybe 728
9s score here is 712 tho
it then goes 680 696 712 728 744
oh wait 746
it's 616 632 648 664
46 is not a real score lmao
i place 3rd
if i 632
anyway
stolen
oh no
<:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
mine only
lmao
it works with me
nqn issue
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
it's wokeaf
if you're trying to steal my emote
can we go higher is the question
so it's husk bald to me
and i'm already 0s on aka
but i am not even close to enough damage for the -1 on couatl
and maybe a -2 on husk
i can bald a -1 on husk
i'm maybe done for this week
and i'm promoting easily in RL without watching ref either
i did the 946 on AKA without watching ref yesterday
i'm finally getting good enough that i can at least remember MA strats
you go girl <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
yeah that's fucking nuts i'm like about 15% the way there to have enough iq to actually make up strat on the spot
dalao making her own strats
waow
<@385655541248163840>
why don't you try running the same thing i'm running, ninilao
and a 664 with ss
648 with s3/ss
wait no
on jialao sheet
and a 632 with s3
there's a 648 with ss
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i need to make my own 632/648
guess that just means
thank you for looking <a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
jumpsec queen
make easy as fuck valk to play ->
mihoyo is like fucking monkey's paw
not jealous btw
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
with SW
gonna feel good outscoring all those filthy, dirty aponia owners
i want
:O
do you have s2 ref?
but higher than 616 i only see s3+
so i have no excuse
fhem ref is s0 for 616
also my SW only s2
but for now just copying other people and performing worse
i'll keep you updated if i come up with something new
lmao
and -1
but done poorly
it's just fhem ref
cause i haven't done couatl yet
lmao i got 600 and my % went higher
but i'm going somewhere
i dunno where
oh i'm going
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
morbin
<:Cryge:953999086506377306>
<:Copium:875793728055418942>
right
584 is not.... awful
let's go!
<:BronyaKing:646539680979877888>
that's a cool weird flex
i guess i am staying at first place in blockade
yeah if it's just one hit it's prob that
for no discernible reason
half of my tries on AKA i just dealt a lot more damage
i did notice like
<:Shrug:616394597211439118> i'm not abyss player
but it's very finnicky
it's better than raven that's for sure
understandable
which tbf
didn't want to turg cat
they just
i guess
kiana simp didn't try?
don't worry about it
the sight of such dalao like you made them scared
wait you retained with 586? holy
AYYYY retain buddies!!
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
what boss was that again, HoS?
yeah or ask for help if you need any
and the other is to count
but i made it into bald lobby
yeah this one was supposed to be just posting gacha luck i think
so kind
they accepted me, a dumbass who doesn't read and plays like shit
that's what i'm saying
lmao don't worry about it
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
we're going to dominate the world i tell ya
<:TeriPoint:790501616544776203>
don't worry about it
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
LMAO
thank you for asking though
i don't
no
oh
which one
<a:Wiggle:843300917914501141>
my score?
about what
so either like 9s shit or a bigger brain setup to beat me
if it is, only like another second at best
i don't think it's possible to go higher with my setup
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
i saved a second
check again
<:sus:866768426478862366>
feel like i already achieved what i wanted here though
<:Shrug:616394597211439118>
i'll try to hold it, maybe
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
before the laos come
1st place on blockade lmao
lemme tell you about rimestar
lmao
ssg babanlao
<:sleepy:914211439286304778>
but i'm too bad for 885/917
i got 851 with trial
you know you can look for this stuff yourselves right
and there's multiple choices for 893
s0 mobius ss SpA both 946
840 is a pretty meh score for AKA
lmao
no
HoS rank doesn't matter for this
oh shit i was wrong again it's 893
i was wrong this is an 840
there's 3 different ritas that can score high on AKA
PI can actually 893
FR can also 0s
there's a few fair options for 0s
ss SpA can also 0s
she can 0s
douglao deserves the view <a:douglao:959721392872501259>
it's more about style + music
if you've seen enough it's easy to tell what's going on but
yeah it's not supposed to be a reference for the clears
very fun MA compilation
give doug views pls
you can grab it so it shows up as expired tho
it's weekly
alright have a good day at work
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
the BD holder for this shouldn't matter
v annoying
but sp pack bald
after you get it, it's pretty consistent
like the inputs can be hard to time
yeah only thing bad about bella is that
besides the start button there's a camera
show like the picture thing
hmm what are you running?
oh
for hepha?
it wouldn't be really useful lmao
since she doesn't actually leave field during ult
well tbh tesla band M for carole would be awkward
since she uses weapon active on that run
you can give avo M to LE
hmm i dunno if it's worth it exactly
do you have tesla band M?
then for LE carole
if you have it
you can give HoR slug M
so that's going on HoS in jizo, yeah?
how many ppm do you have?
and then for M pieces
jst on BD user on bella
turg tb on HoR on bella
slug tb on carole on heppha
turg tb on LE on hepha
then just run
oh if you have 2 turg tb
before locking stuff
as always i'd recommend testing it out on training mode
but you can try both
so i would rather save the gear for her
i mean yeah i'm just saying, bella is the worst boss of the 2 with damage threshold stuff
not sure <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
<:WorryPat:909188820879171604>
cause of no sss le
especially since you're most likely taking a 1s loss either way
i mean if you only have 1 jst i'd rather save it for bella
really?
yeah we all just copy cn dalao
to insta ult
guess you can run like beet b
with LE lead she's still 110sp
for ss MA
probably not
s eden tho
4* bella tho
oh there's an eden run
you prob won't have enough gear to run a phys comp on hepha
yeah dp with kikaku
it's the size of the window to get 840/893/946
DP
... mediocrity
then you really don't need the gloves lmao
if you accept -1 or -2
the thing about strats like this
they help but not necessary
and use the jst on bella
and kill a bit later
and no jst
you can prob run slug TB on carole on hepha
and the hepha run will prob look like this
SW hogs LE apparently
if you can get that
but 840 is a good score
sirin 3 is not necessary but you won't get 893 without a fire elf prob
run something like this on bella
and HoF on bella
hmm you can prob run mobius on hepha
do you have mobius
sounds right
i swear once you get dalao enough mihoyo just gives you a personalised copy of honkai
is 5 seconds on everyone elses
when every second on your clock
yeah it's really easy to 946
as that LMAO
and so jump sec
i've never seen a strat so fps scummy
is hell on earth
that shit
the maru strat tho
true sorry
now it is
it wasn't when that video was made
yeah but 9s
893 bella with HoF, 946 hepha with mobius
in my friends acc:
893 bella with mobius, 946 hepha with HoF
in my acc:
okay so
that's him saving
well, not this time
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
at this time tomorrow i'll be balding
wait no you're right
i mean
if you were going to accept an 893 you wouldn't be doing an strat like this lmao
in honkai at least it's like
i mean it makes sense
just makes it clear what you should expect lmao
cn honk player do it often
i fucking love it when they do compilation of failed runs before the run tho
but it's not fun when 90% of your runs don't get to the fun part lmao
yeah realistically speaking it's best that the bald rng part is at the beginning
kinda like SW bosses with the mobs at the start being the hard part
so tilting LMAO
but just mindlessly resetting and not playing the game
so i can reset asap
like realistically it's better to have the luck weighted early
tbh i think i would go insane with a run like that
<:E_RaidenPat:882522815532781618>
which is 0.0625 * crit bald * (1 - skill issue)
it's (0.5 ^ 4) * crit bald * (1 - skill issue)
i can do the honkai one
<a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
rather than get the easy parry from weapon skill
and after the first ult, you need to time it to actually parry the enemy atk
on that run, BB is using schro M, each ult = 50% chance of reset cd
that or this

which run is more bald
<a:dalaoexplode:959706477151551498>
<:BronyaKing:646539680979877888>
i'm a masochist but not that much
hell no
no
oh
i don't like upgrading anymore
no, i just buy a lot
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
also maxing coin on monday like a responsible honkai player
<:sus:866768426478862366>
record for now
there's nothing better in masters lmao
i mean yeah ofc
it's rino run tho
gl
it just looks fun
i'm baby
i mean i wasn't there
different time
2020 MA
<:hug_ailuna:585924636508946437>
i'm proud of you tet
well
run this
<:TeriKMS_lum:585627694256095242>
dp for impair
but i wouldn't use LE there
by LE
i mean i guess it is
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
HoT is not
by FT
BR is replaceable
yeah that's what the 893 uses
...yeah
with HoF
the 893 assaka strat
why don't just do
if you have HoF
lmao
my mind is very filled with useless information
story
2-12
<a:winkeline:587369205482127361>
get 4/4 HoS and then don't use it to get 946 like me
and tf train on p1
like how to effectively clear paws
just like getting some inspiration from it might get you some points
since you'll prob have less atk and lower lv pri
you'll prob be missing a fair bit of damage
you can try taking inspiration from this run
for a good while
and this is like the last wolf we're seeing
it's only BiS in wolf
i prob wouldn't
but if you're tight on them
why not
if you have the cubes to spare
depends on how boomer you are
i mean
is prob from wolf
the best score increase you can get
yeah i see
it's awful LMAO
i can say now that i'm top 20 score in NA
shit boss
it's also wolf
i mean
what teams are you using
hmm
so if you're not deep into 2% rn you won't hold it by the end
like 30% of t2% MA does MA at like last 4 hours lmao
then you'll not make it
at this time
but tbh if you're not like 1.7% or smth like that
in each boss
how are your scores like
626 = 37952 on +20%
prob t100 maybe
if you got a 626 on it
yeah dog is the bad one
with good wolf and good dxy it'd prob be t100
cause 626 is pretty good for masters
how are your other scores
huh
<:Hehe:585924636504489994>
this is bald channel now
idk maybe
on this week?
... ryuuimpossible
matched ryuu score i'm happy
okay i'm done
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
i think we've turned the whale flex channel into bald help channel
can u edit the message to make it clear what it is
that's jialaos sheet yeah?
easily look for refs in bilibili if you don't know cn (not for taihen) 

<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
already
done for this week somehow
i think i'm uh
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
i did sirin
for some reason
i did hear BE actually makes it easier
you can try
i mean ideally i think the black hole is supposed to hit both i think
blackhole is supposed to break first arm
patpat made a p good breakdown on how it works
<@82358863155703808>
0s apparently is very hard but need ss HoF minimum
1s is pretty easy
me copying this but worse
and that's what i mostly do on honkai LMAO
cause then i'm not adding anything yk
me doing this ref but badly
if it's just
but yeah i don't really make vids
waters edge elf
and now non-9s 946 without t0 on dxy
high scoring hellmaru with weirdly scuff team (unleveled catgirl stigs and lv1 WE)
my 3 videos are
highest scoring lightning andrius without irene/klein
only when i feel like i'm adding something new
i make them sometimes
<:sus:866768426478862366>
you're very cute
your stigs are very pretty
thank you pablo picasso
they're just going to give her broken ely signets
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
i still need to get literally every valk to SS for dorm bonus
you have the legacy
yeah but you're boomer
<:A_HuTsk:807154654893965333>
FT?
who does she think she is needing SS
fuck HoV too
is coop self qte
the only thing i want now on ER
<:A_HuTsk:807154654893965333>
FT?
needs SSS to perform who does she think she is
oh yeah, fuck her
oh
<:sus:866768426478862366>
oh i'm watching
of playing TP?
what fun
cause i know when i get her to SSS she'll be fucking dead
i also completely gave up on TP
but it's because i had a lot of stuff saved up from 5.5
BR ely FR CH frags
rn i'm buying out
at the same time
you'll be able to farm 1 AL 1 AW valk
once you reach exalted
different resource lmao
SK is like
straight last prio
i'd leave it at like
but that's veeeery niche
then you might want 2 eventually?
hmmm
if you have avo TM
tbh beet is already pretty niche
yeah
so you can prob skip it
but i've literally never seen it
T only used on very niche occasion where you want 2p and can't use MB
3p also sucks
yeah no T sucks ass
i'm dumdum
B -> M
B is the good one
oh wait no
but usually they're used together for 2p
prob M?
which first doesn't matter
MB
then just breakthrough asap
by staying the longest time in masters with pri-arms
i mean if you don't care about optimising other people suffering
beat your past MA records
and breaking through then
but also i'd recommend scouting an MA week where you think you'll do well
idk ask hak how much xp those missions give
and 2 abyss cycles too
so you have the entire MA week with pri-arms
the best day to level up is tuesday
level up at a good day
so you can't like
but you lose control for when you do get lv81
since you get lv81 fastest
it's technically optimal
but it's not recommended to breakthrough asap
stuff only changes on lv81
only unlocks the missions hakcer talked about
nothing changes when you click breakthrough
you don't go exalted when you breakthrough
yeah
:D
that your name showed up in the randomly generated thumbnail!
yeah but this time you got lucky enough
just t100 masters
oh jialaos vid
sheeesh
yeah mobile fucking sucks
good work
sheesh you made the thumbnail!!
<@171082989046988800>
lmao
makes sss HoD look like ss boss
with PE AF
that one sss HoD ref
if u don't have tp bke
HoS dps strat
well u prob run like
fair
that would be pretty cancer
that's not a single week
those are the SSS bosses for each week until now i mean
<@309634550273933314> will prob find it amusing too
this is cap score tho, which is entertaining

maybe we get HoD <:shrug:877047647511384064>
next patch is husk jizo tona for now
not yet
cause that's about the best you can use the reso on
after you're done with all those you're free to speed up craftable stuff
prob not worth tho
M has niche uses on SN
but it's like either for simp for HoV
after those stigs, the only other that i'd think about is sirin asc
so yeah pretty nice for that week, though tbh you can t100 with 700s on NA so how necessary that is is up to you
ppt strat scores 824+
no ppt strat scores like 712/744
100 points
it gets you like
ppt goes on HoS on sss HoD, and it's s0 strat
HoF as dps always uses full himeko, she doesn't really have space even as high rank to use anything else
you're prob extremely misremembering
um
the kiana one
pool party top
3-5 newts, usual week will use around 2, 3 is pretty common, more is rare but still nice to have for affix and the rare weeks where it's useful
2-3 ppm, 2 is already kinda overkill tho
1 ppt, for sss HoD
gustav TM, good easy to proc phys stig, kinda low prio nowadays since there's so many options
welt TM, slightly better than ana TMB, very low prio since it generally only saves you 1 second on HoR strats if that
so reso only shopping list should look like this
most of the time avo M will give you close enough performance
but like
it's nice to have sure
tesla band M won't make or break a lightning team
thing is that
since the rest of reso prio from now on is MA stuff
if not at all then yeah go for craftable stuff
i mean i guess it depends how much you care about MA
before craftable stuff yea absolutely
imo
then you shouldn't spend reso on craftable stuff
until you're done with reso prios
i mean sure but like
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
tesla band is craftable
no
then you have 2 spots to fight over
but because even if you treat those 3 as 100% retain
not because they're bad players
that's pretty chill
if it's only neko toprock and lux in your bracket tho
retire is secret sauce to become dalao apparently
and is beating his records in MA
like it's insane he fucking retired
he's pretty good at the game tho
and i think he also only balds stuff he finds fun
lux kinda 50/50, he's retired, so he doesn't spend that much time on the game
and let them know your score <:sus:866768426478862366>
it's courtesy to message armada members
oh yea if you're sniping
lux kinda 50/50
lux from blustorm?
<:sus:866768426478862366>
you might be able to sneak a retain
i think everyone has issues with it
idr if HoS is slacc boss or not
on kallen
i giga cheated tho
<:AnselBlush:596473956597235723>
but that's a new pb!
didn't get 744 on tank cause i suck balls at the game
aaaand final score
skypelao did it with s2 ch
but worse
just did this
i mean like no use recording right
on kallen you mean?
LMAO
no
i respect it
as you should
rewarded for simpage
tbh
LMAO yeah
right besides iriya <a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
if i get 744
i'll get 14th
yeah!
skip aponia try to grab griseo
i'll prob be like bp monthly from now on
since i quit my job LMAO
i'm like on actual budget/f2p now
but also
my mobi already ss
<@309634550273933314>
LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOO
but i missed the seeding either way <:deadge:933767520085770341>
on ely first door
maybe got lucky
i rerolled like 3 or 4 times
PE is broken
<@309634550273933314> i finished that one run
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
<:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
LMAO so this is my corner now
i'm sure if you ask nicely enough they can offer you alt strats
time to lock in that 2nd place
yeah just dm them and ask for ref
i mean it's cheap to level, i might have on e too
fair tho
oh i've never heard anyone call ryunosuke that LMAO
wtf is akutagawa
my bad
true
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
a fuckin mobius cross non-pri laying around?
do you think i have any of that gear leveled?
but look at this
make refs for them
like i unironically want to try some of these setups
no one has tried that setup before i'm sure
none of the CN dalaos can say for sure it's hacking
i mean i can say for sure
i do have a theory that that's unironically true for like elites
newbie mistake, locked all their good gear on tank and left nothing for the other bosses
yes truly
i might've sniped a top 5
if i actually played on reset instead of leaving to do it 2 hours after
it's a pretty easy 946
look whos there!
lmao
-4 on kallen, -6 on aka
+1 over cap on tank
very inconsistent gaming char too
hack harder! literally hacking and won't make it to t100
wtf is wrong with this guy LMAO
outscoring the hacker
i'm literally
that's weird
i matched ref score
huh
first time i get this close to ref score
vietnam
wow that bracket
<a:toodalaotorelate:959796978131271730>
<a:pensivebear:733515556577345677>
<a:peepoEatpizza:755848007433453688>
new doom strats
until you get to nirvana and have to follow his refs LMAO
wow so cool, impressive
it's always fun to look at iriya strats and go
that's iriya for ya
fun ref!
will depend on how fun the stage is
lmao idk
so i continued trying to get t1
and i didn't like not being t1
and then people got over me
and got t1
well i did it once
so this is prob not helpful at all LMAO
though i have ss IO and elf is very necessary for this rot
switch fish in -> weapon skill qte -> mobius qte in -> ult -> drop cross -> ABB -> switch LE in -> weapon skill -> elf ult -> mobius qte in -> BB
rot is like
LE PV IO
the way i'm leaving it for now
<:RaidenPat:941534428390359072>
maybe i'll bald more later
<:MONKERS:538161916741287946>
897
just good at the game LMAO
prob not a balder either tbh
yeah not a hacker
cookiezi
to shave 3 points
hmm i feel like this could work still
yeah no nvm
LMAO
jst B
i need
if i don't suck at the game
i think this has future
oh
prob right?
for LE
i wonder if jst is the best set
hmm
alright cya!
maybe i can do 3 combo and kill?
we can't see
<a:NOOO:827382402548236339>
890
gather is cbt
idk maybe?
i can sometimes kill adds way faster
hmm there's some rng on my positioning
is v big
with klein
and then being able to double QTE
fischl being able to activate mobius QTE
yeah like
i keep forgetting to klein lmao
eh mobius cross is pretty optional
i won't be able to do double qte bs
take off pv then? is that worth it?
40 80 150
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
ss fischl can't ult
how
lemme show you a run
yeah MA team
yeah if i want to go further prob need alt strat
idt i can beat that hacker tho LMAO
MOOOOOOORE
fund me
basking in the glory before 9s people come
MOOOOORE
moooore
so expensive LMAO
hmm
and hos abyss
sss jizo
and then everyone would be using it in like
or else it would count for hitcount shields i think?
prob not
i have no clue
wonder how high i can go
is what i tell you
bully the dalao back
LMAO
yeah i can def go faster
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
so then i switched off to the wrong one
but i did the right QTE
so i switched into the other character
i fucking thought i did fischl QTE by accident
that was a good run but i pressed literally every wrong button
there's some cursed shit in here
idk then
oh LMAO
this?
<a:MeiAss:959751599381704764>
which one?
eh?
that's awful
is that sea?
lmao sure
wonder if i should do turg LE or jst LE
i guess hm
LE PV IO
yeah maybe they just got god hands
lv68
we can't see what they ran but uh
good gaming chair they have
<:deadge:933767520085770341>
that'll do!
i can't do much better
yeah no
but i'm doing suicide strat anyways
i don't need the sp
i'm killing AE
i feel that i can break 830
now that i broke 820
ah shit
<a:dalaodalaodalao:959706475394117632>
which is the impressive part
you actually did the kill
i just explained game mechanics
all you
<a:2DNope:764063597138804756>
<a:toodalaotorelate:959796978131271730>
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
after a while you'll feel the difference, it's pretty big after you get used to how fast you can switch a valk in after fast ult
inputs are pretty generous, so you'll end up getting it by accident sooner or later
so just spam switch to understand limits
the way to tell is if you can switch your valk in way faster
it's hard to notice if you got it or not
you can do it the same way as the normal combo cancels tho
for fast ult it's way simpler though, just directly cancel auto with ult
you want to cancel the attack into an evade and cancel the evade into the combo
for fast black or fast mixed it's a more interesting input string
same explanation for SN fast ult
if you do a black or mixed combo, or an ult by cancelling one of those attacks, it ends up applying that atk speed to them even though it shouldn't work like that
it's basically because margrave gives atk speed, and that atk speed impacts how those attacks come off
if it's 1st, 3rd or 4th attack on the string, then ult animation will come off faster
more specifically, it's cancelling a normal auto animation with ult
also do AE fast ult
then buffs running out shouldn't be an issue
if you do black holes asap and ult asap after black hole
i see you stalling a bit on your combos
yeah that would help but prob not needed
which is the case here
it doesn't do anything, really, if there's not any of those
like, if there's any stage buffs, or valk buffs, or enemy gets debuffed if ignited
ignite only matters if it matters
so yeah that's true but you don't have to think about it
if raven is off field
puts feathers down
p much anything you do with any valk
eh dw
you don't really need ignite uptime
but i honestly kinda doubt
i also am assuming the raven bs at the start is necessary because yours is ss?
sirin will proc QTE
no, you want bbb for the buffs
you just did bbb
you didn't do the combo
bbb is black paint
you can see on buff bar
after the tank minigame buffs ran out
and that you did last black hole + ult on p2
for the buffs to proc
you need to actually do the combo attack
with AE
is that you didn't do BBB at the start
well the 2 main things
:D
i can try and help
share vid
moriso copied me tyvm
which i didn't watch btw! i didn't copy moriso
i do p much the same as the marisa vid
unga bunga strats
but i can 1 rot without going for it so
idk if it's good or not to not go for it
nah
i don't even do aimed shot bs with raven
nah just BBB with AE on p1
i'll try later to break 820 maybe
is that a good score or am i shit at the game
like for s2 HoF 3* sirin
for my stuff lmao
i mean more like
elysia here we go
815 i'm bored now
idfk
is 810 a good score for this boss?
what am i getting?
SHEEEESH
caféquanta
infiniti and solstice are also big ones
yeah prob lumina
we're getting like new class of players but a lot of older knowledge is on that point where they're moving on or already have
either retired or close to it lmao
most of our biggest dalao are pretty slacc
i mean it only makes sense
fits NA LMAO
even lumina is pretty slacc in terms of accepting peeps
i don't think we got armadas like that in NA?
nah blustorm is really chill
LFGGGG
sell?
trade?
share?
4 digits is pretty nice
usually i'm at 3 digits
yeah me too
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>

<a:Noted:914214211138244688>
the plot thickens
oh shit
<a:Noted:914214211138244688>
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
how accurate is this
scrub
lmao
they look great to me chief
woaaa it's so pretty
<a:Pat:914638151069356062> you don't have to if you don't want to
but i love that color scheme
it's not what i was expecting
i love that
those colors are sooooooooooo pretty
don't rush yourself <a:Pat:914638151069356062>
didn't get to it yet though
oh i heard really good things about short hike
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
just take your time, i'm sure they don't mind
<:hugeline:587370244247388172>
it's tiring to a point but like they also have their boundaries, if it was tiring to a point of harming them, then they wouldn't do it
you can't really control that, they just chose that you deserve it
it's spent effort but they spend where they feel like they want to
not really, i mean not necessarily
that's just how friendships are, they clearly feel like there's a return
how is it bad?
idk
you don't have to do as much back
it's not transactional
that's not how friendships work
if you can't respond right now, then chill for a while
they're as nice as you deserve
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
that's not true
<a:Pat:914638151069356062>
i won't make the convo about me though, i'll leave it at that for now
cause i care about you two
i do want you two to feel welcomed in it, at least
i dunno how much i can do to make it similar to that, i do think i prefer when it was like that, it does get waaaay too general to my tastes every now and then
doesn't the world revolve around me?
wdym not just me
i'll work on it
i've been feeling i've been too pessimistic and annoying
sorry i'll be less of a dick
my pfp pretty
look
this shit is annoying as hell
i won't be able to host if my pc keep freezing out tho
LMAO will do
and there's a mod that enables it up to 8 player
stardew valley actually has multiplayer for 4 player
accurate
LMFAO
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
it's very pretty but it's not that heavy, surprisingly
depending on how old it is it might actually run ori
i can help tho
if you have windows laptop and need help with getting some games
i think i'm having pc issues, it keeps freezing up <:smoke:808652033007157258>
sheeesh
yea laptop is way chill
i've never tried
if you're mobile only then it might be harder to pirate stuff <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
having only gacha games is fucking dystopian
if you don't wanna pirate
i mean fuck it i'll gift y'all some
a lot of normal games can too
and send them actual normal games
we need an intervention for gacha gamers
jesus that's fucking scary
aged nothing
it's from 2014 and looks incredible
look at that shit
it's when you realise that the infinite search for perfect photorealism in games is useless
games like these are like the black pill of gamers
ori is real pretty
by the end you're doing shit that looked impossible when you started and it just feels normal
celeste just goes take your time, you should be proud of how much you failed cause it's a badge of honour to how well you've done
it slowly gets harder in an approachable way, and doesn't act over it like a lot of other hard platform where they go this isn't for pussies, it's really hard!!!
but yeah it's one of my favorite games because of the difficulty curve
physical release + money to playstation and microsoft
p sure 200 price tag is just
20
it's one of the best platformers ever made imo
<a:baddyspin:904994094022029343>
celeste is like that
with no issue
which means if i have it, i can just send it to you directly
a lot of games are drm free, actually
i can figure stuff out
i can help
but still
not, that toby fox probably needs the money at this point
and after i got a job i bought it
like i pirated undertale and i loved it
if anything, you can just promise yourself you'll buy it if you enjoy it once you do have money
yeah
and p much went look if you can't afford it, come talk to me and i'll give you an actual copy instead of you going to sussy sites to download it
there's one which was like that, he put some pirating protection over his game
there's some that just give a game copy if you ask for it
like 99% of indie developer don't mind pirating it if you can't afford it
you can just pirate it
and it's not a gacha
stardew valley has a lot of collection stuff
then you just stop at the feel bad part
even if you don't spend money
there's plenty of collectionism game that don't suck the life out of you
they're optimised to make you feel bad and spend money
yea if you're a collector you shouldn't be playing gacha games
and then i quit cause i found nothing fun LMFAO
and just do what i found fun
that i was going to play genshin
i eventually just decided
yeah back when i was friendship farming it got pretty bad
shit game
like it's okay to stop liking characters if they change them and fuck up the thing you liked about them
try doing it with characters you like right now
eh don't have to run back to characters you used to like
and keep liking that, even if there's other stuff you don't like
maybe you can recognise what you like about them
i think liking them temporarily, fleetingly is also really cool
people just have different ways of liking stuff
hmmm i'm not sure
to you?
maybe she acts cold but it sounds like she still is trying
would you call that cold?
everyone talks about her like she's cute or something, that's an interesting personality
she's like that?
listing out stuff that makes you feel something, so you know you're still there
maybe you could try listing out the fun stuff still around, like the one girl from prosekai everyone seems to like
is that so? <:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
less harmful ways
maybe there's other ways to remind yourself you're still alive?
hmm i see
<:wavekawaii:590500669119660053>
hihihi!!!
that's kinda sad but i get it, i think
<:hug_ailuna:585924636508946437>
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
ASTER
good job aster
<a:claphic:970643150001553439>
i need it
please ask for the keilos malders too
so i can use it too
should be from this channel
this sticker
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
i haven't logged in today yet
1v1?
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
i can try doing that
is there leaderboard for accuracy
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
leaderboards aren't a thing of gachas only, i still like competitive games
yeah
i'll just play it like it's not a gacha
so if i'm playing prosekai
i'm not scared of being addicted, i just am not playing gachas anymore after honkai
and play with feet
i can just follow phi's teachings
i've sold pieces of my sanity and my will to live
i've paid worst prices for honkai t100
yeah i can do that
so i just have to spend more time
what if, i try really hard
so i think i should be around t20 in sea?
and i'm t15+ consistently now
but t50 above is similar to global
like the lower ranks in SEA are a lot more tight
which would be t30 in SEA too
i think one week i t30 in NA
yes actually
oh i see, i do that in honkai already
so you're telling me i can do it
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
to t100 without cards
i can be the first person
so you're telling me
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
wait
there's ranking? t100?
what's tier
good job baban
yes the language brazillian
the point of rhythm games
isn't Get Really Good
oh okay now you're speaking my language
<:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
i'm too boomer for this
<:MobiusThink:903056993160421376>
hit all perfect = you did good
but... isn't accuracy all you care about
score go up
i press button
is rhythm game no
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
is that i'm not puling ever
oh the point is not that i'm saving forever
fuck
psdt
pdst
fuck gacha, mihoyo gave me ptds
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i'm doing a no pull acc
i think if i'm playing
dw about it
i'll just click everything and find it
oh it's in settings?
i wanna buy everything from pinocchiop
can i search song from author
i just don't wanna download every section just before playing it
i have the space
i don't mind downloading a lot
that's kinda annoying
rn
can't i just like bulk download everything
do i need to download something every time
i mean even then
so every time i wanna do story game will ask me to download 30mb?
cool they cost a thing i have nothing of
is this where i swipe
how do i get more songs
cool
wow a whole new type of swipe up
i'll try an easy expert
swipe ups are too weird
okay no i'm not comfortable for expert yet LMFAO
guess expert's next
not bad for first try keyboard gaming i think
i'll try full keyboard
ooo got it
hmm i dunno how to do the swipe ups
wait pausechamp
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
it runs so bad
i don't think i can play it on emulator
<a:PU_PeepoLeaveExit:855157057887535164>
i wasn't warned of this
oh.....
what... i get?
we're in
hopefully it does <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
does this look right
wait how do i do it then
oh ok
whatever the fuck that is
it is now a galaxy s21
i'll change what phone the emulator is emulating
it's an emulator LMFAO
what the fuck does that even mean?
my device isn't compatible???
i have playstore
someone teach me how to install first
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
and beat all of ya
i'm gonna bald prosekai
okay i'm gonna do it
left out of the fun again
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
chrome
it can run at most
my phone is from 2012
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the only way i can play baban
that's
yeah i have no clue why i would want that
you're asking why would i want to play a game a lot of my friends are playing?
what?
can i play prosekai on emulator LMFAO
actually i don't wanna make the joke i was going to anymore
oh
aw sheeesh that's sick
what's that
i'm sorry
for now you're livin forever
dlc they said, gotta wait until announcement
apparently it's unavailable
i checked your time of death
no
what time is it for you
<:DeadFischl:909232418307858482>
do me in chief
that's aight by me
you want to be the one to kill me?
<:smolsmith:870261620130082836>
a lil dying
what about
hmm
that how it works
is
that's so cute
jesus fucking christ, you trying to kill me of diabetes?
HOLY FUCK
SO FUCKING CUTE
THAT'S
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
hi aster
LMFAO
lmfao L
like what
as a favorite color
imagine having green
no flame but i knew it
sure
that's not what i meant
uh
?ping
why did i stop getting soft pings
wait
close though
that's not how you ping me
what
that's why keilo points are a thing
and you want to feel like an adult
because it looks like the stuff that adults watch
i think it's the kind of stuff you watch when you're 12
i dunno
i've never watched family guy
oh
yeah?
deaf
i'm
🍫
i'll leave homecoming gifts
a new neighbour!
yeah i didn't remember that
holy shit <:monka:969065665573027841>
this is just a test for message without text
test
test
it's crazy how i'm almost more excited for the wh<:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>s than the actual characters
<:barack:1154719413682057306>
it is the one i'm most hype for though
i definitely expect juiz last
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i feel like she probably already share everything she knew back on last loop
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
do you think juiz knows a lot more than we do though?
everyone but unruin + unhealthy is probably enough people to vote on using remember or not
but i think they'll end up doing it
i dunno if have to
i wonder what all the vessel stuff mean
top looks like a beast
i don't see it though
people are saying tatiana also look older
top does look like a gigachad for some reason
<a:peepoLeave:802372023300259861> <a:peepoArrive:802372023174430730>
around when norman leave on anime, he come back in the manga
something similar happen with neverland
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
yeah, surely it's on purpose isn't it? it's so good
after that it's only the 2 extra, unruin and unhealthy
we're getting to endgame, those 5 are the last 5 from union/under
he's getting to victor power level at this point
great chapter, that cliffhanger <:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
by changing the only thing she can't unchange
she immediately figure out how to beat gina's understanding on unchange
if that's the case, change is fucking scary
negator ability is tied to their own interpretation of it, i would imagine the rule's are not <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
she's hot as fuck
looking at change up close
read it
<:pojjies:1089590694160642098>
holy fuck you were right
do you think author does it on purpose? with callback to stuff that just aired on the anime
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
<a:GIGACHAD:999060597247320095>
what the fuck happen to enjin offscreen he's a fucking BEAST
i was about to post that too holy fuck
jesus fucking christ
wicked sick
i'd love that
that's actually sick as fuck
on 100th loop she used unchange on her makeup
probably can't other people
yeah, she can't really unchange herself
i wonder how much big change is even possible to happen like through evolution without another rule being tied to it
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
oh yeah i see
then Change is fucking busted
honestly if adding a rule is considered as changing
<a:Coooking:1009511504405606481>
big gina fan
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
can't complain about more potential gina content
but i mean i could see it <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
oh i see, that's kind of a reach for definition of change to me though
is that change? <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
that's important but a little boring
maybe it's just something like dna
yeah <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
they got 3 master rule negator
also it would mean that union is kinda stacked isn't it
would that design work for change though?
that is true <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
idk how the master rules work between loops though
on some juiz victor flashback, it looks like gender doesn't exist yet
i mean i guess i could see it
what do you think 3rd rule could even be then tho
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130> <a:Clap:802373413716623391>
yeah i agree with that
i dunno if i agree with that though, i think already with gina it start ramping up
i would probably agree, most people were saying that galaxy was the beginning of greatness
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
i'm a big chikara fan
i'm hype ngl
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
latla my beloved
i can only be so upset
the unjustice reveal was giga sick though
i didn't notice the billy thing by myself, someone had to say on reddit, but i do think it's pretty sick, it foreshadows his real reasoning past betrayal well
yeah that was really nice, i think they did the big scenes pretty well too
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
it looks cool though
o yeah i see
<:jphPlus2:1062420906720366632>
udul twitter acc changed their tweets into english because of unification of all languages
at the very start, before galaxy was added
that's udul, some countdown for the next rule
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
we ever saw that in the manga?
<@180679257851166721>
he also help me a lot with understanding gacha probabilities and stuff

and compare it to the old gear banner number
the best we can do is look at my simulation for new banner
there is no special new sp/a-rank gear banner
as far as we know
i mean
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
and someone ask is that diluc on the gsr trailer and he went no diluc is a girl in this one
my streamer played some genshin and gsr
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
cause we're the only cool people on earth
and anyone new joining after 7.3 <:5Gkms:831613117388816408>
casual player <a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
and as it goes, it'll feel more chill
for competitive player
early 7.3 is going to feel terrible
my call rn is that
it certainly looks pretty balanced tbh
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
the real part 2 will start once they rework that
defence code must be unhinged
i mean it doesn't surprise me though
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
that's stupid then
oh is it
that's the right way to do it
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
nevermind then it probably just continue scaling
oh
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
it might legitimately just crash the game
is it possible to get that high breach in ER
i don't think we know the answer
that's the question ain't it
it would make it go negative
if we get like 30% breach and it stack additively for some reason
like current impair is already 75%
unless it's like some shitter value
it would go into the negative
like crash honkai broken
it might be actually broken
would that be broken
i mean you said just work differently, it being fixed specifically is more fun in my mind
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
and it just works the right way
if they implement it on a real valk
it would be really funny
okay so you know that the thing about phys breach is that you'd think that that would be reduce resistance, but it just work the same as impair
that's par for the course
say one thing and the effect works completely different
that's <a:Classic:1102006776540434542> mihoyo
i mean honestly
yeah it'd be a wholly unique mechanic
people getting probability shit wrong and being smug about it is only slightly less triggering than people talking about how excited they are for the next phys breach valk
<a:xmasnessie:1180151139136712704>
and it's only a matter of time until i gotta deal with 3head about it
the problem is that i'm a beast
i think you misunderstand me
it's been chill for now but i just fucking know it
that my next arc on honkai would be another probability one
i can't fucking believe
<a:peepoTrip:755692813320060959>
but it's really hard to miss a 20% roll like 20 times in a row
it's a little counter intuitive cause 20-30% doesn't sound that high
99 would be 39%
your number is slightly wrong but you got the right idea
if there was no hard pity
at the 100th pull you'd be at 40.5%
soft pity does a lot of the legwork
but like ye
maybe more than 20% the graph kinda sucks
almost 20% of player would go to 100
with no soft pity
this is what a graph would look like
i meant hard pity
but also yeah
oh i my bad
if there was no soft pity
it just keep adding +1.5% every pull after 74
okay so like
when would it?
yeah think so
because the soft pity just reaches 100% at like 87 or 88
but because the soft pity start earlier, it's actually impossible to reach hard pity
but the soft pity start earlier
in genshin, the weapon banner works the same way
if you want a fun fact
it scales very hard
at 74 is baseline 1.5%, then 3%, 4.5%, 6%, 7.5%, 9%, so on
so it's just from 74 forward, it start multiplying the chance
this is the formula btw
is enough for me to be very confident that this is right
so to me, the simulation being so close to that recorded data +
it being the exact same formula genshin uses +
mihoyo being known to not really change stuff up for fun
other colored lines is unrelated
and the blue one is their recorded data
the brown line is my simulation
and this is what i got
and compared that to the number that reddit post got
i used what genshin community figured out is their softpity system work
like what i did is
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
it's the classic one
the data i have is from the one reddit post
but we don't have enough data in gi3 to tease out a soft pity that subtle
i've heard about a very subtle soft pity at 40 in genshin
all the info i know point to we having a harsh soft pity starting at 74
as far as i know, not measurably
code is on my github if you wanna take a look
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
probably start to get 12 or 13 valk per year
i don't really believe it'll be cheaper tho
yes
maybe it change so little that it's not measurable at only 100k simulations
it should tho even if a little
i'll look further into it
weird
i don't think it measurably change the avg at all
yeah <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
or like not even
avg went from 48.1 to 48.05
i mean you can see
it was already really really hard to go above 90
not by much tho since genshin gacha has such harsh soft pity
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
changes the avg
removing the outliers
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
now we just need an awk valk
it is
only rng on current system is card
part of what made essentine so consistent
yeah
f2p player doesn't even know how banner work
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
i'm doing awk now
idk why you thought it'd be worse
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
but i mean maybe <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333> hard to say
i also wouldn't expect the 21 from the exchange to reset, to me it read like just normal resource exchange shop for when they're changing resource system
but i also don't think the real minimum will be like 40% higher
i agree that like them saying the minimum is 13, they very very likely will never go down to bare 13
so you'd need the real min to be like 17
on avg you get 3-4 dupe on h1
and you need 21 to max a valk
they said the min is 13
i mean i agree but like
on avg
it won't be enough prism to max your stigs
but like for a-rank, if you only pull h1
then yea it's way cheaper
if you're fine with stopping at h1 4/4 prob 45/45/45
<:Shruge:1038668224067280987>
on how much prism you need
i mean it depends
even if they don't do anything about it idk if it'll be an issue realistically speaking
since new banner doesn't have offrate
it's not like you'll have infinite income of dupe weapon either
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
spend torus and metal for refinement?
is that even worth it
though tbh
yeah <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i doubt that'd work but that does throw wrenches in the calcs
that's weird
huh
ooooh i see!
oh
wai what
can't afford max stig but like that's fine <:Clueless:996308692133761094>
like 40 pulls for s0h1 4/4 kinda nut
for way cheaper
but now you can scale down to s0r1 4/4
old s0 4/4 = new s0r3 4/4
my final conclusion is that they added more cheaper tier of player
cause they got lost in the other chat
<@218762069338619906> i'll post my simulations here
they're all getting drunk
those guys are not playing well
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
they're having a feast rn
a lot of feet and all i could think of damn must be great to be into it
i watched a frieren episode recently and there was like
i kinda miss when i didn't know that feet fetish was a thing
like peepogun but feet?
<:peepogun:824976159925338112>
i'm like what did you forget to upload the last page
there was another manga where the 1st chapter ended so abruptly
this is the end of this chapter note on the bottom of chapters
i really need like
or did i read an actual incomplete version <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
did it feel incomplete to you too
did you read the most recent chapter
those 2 aren't compatible
no witches
they have swords
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
but like, symbolically
anthy is the witch i think
yeah i dunno it's not too believable to me this fast
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
they have a track of accidents happening to their main actor/idol
honestly that's probably true
maybe that's why i like her
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
do you think miyako would complain if she walk in on aqua and ruby making out
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i guess i kinda see more of the story going forward, the point of frill rant is probably something something even if characters are getting closer and closer to the character they're portraying, they'll prob return to normal after the production
good aquaruby bait
i do think it's funny the i end up dating my co-star rant from frill
last chapter left such a big opportunity
but like man
i mean it wasn't that bad, teasing out another look into ai character
yeah okay
lemme take a peek
meanwhile for frieren they manage for me to shit my pants instead
any other manga if some wh <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512> show up i'd go wh <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
thinking about it more tho, it's even smarter from a story writing tool perspective
i was thinking about, i already thought that the thing frieren told fern about running away from unknown demons was pretty great with a reason that makes a lot of sense in universe
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
is grausam still alive present time?
oh is it just out?
or like maybe not, idk kinda up in the air
my closed time loop theory is probably kinda wrong <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
it was such a great chapter though
it's definitely my favorite villainess one <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
but can be hard to keep track of with so many families with their own self interest
and the politics is pretty well written, lots of parties involved in a believable way <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
most author pussy out by making her a villain out of contrivance or immaturity, artezia's kind of a monster in a lot of ways
the villain actually act like a villain for once
it's pretty stacked though, my 2 favorite thing from it is how
yeah
villain lives twice
that shit is too complicated, i might take this opportunity to reread it
i'm not sure if i will catch up with vlt
the only 2 i'm not caught up yet is vlt and i haven't started the golf one
i'm already caught up <:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
oh yeah it was fucking beasting
not like compared to something like denji and power conversation at the end of part 1
yeah i can't say that panel in specific made me feel like an artistic choice was made to convey denji's feeling <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
i wouldn't mind if he jumped to monthly even
he already takes a break after every chapter more often than not
yeah maybe it's time to just take the jump to at least biweekly
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
surely they're not gone
i am currently coping about that
that shit was fucking hype
yeah i did
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
aw man this is a little fucked up, next chapter ain't even out and i'm already hype for the one after
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i love that
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
holy shit
<:PauseCat:1002644852850298960>
i'm turbo down
yeah
i wouldn't mind this pacing at peak udul
maybe it's fine if we get a second season
2 cour if they don't get to autumn i'll fucking <a:NAHHH:1120795949099384963>
no way they don't go to autumn
oh that's happening in the anime isn't it
yeah for sure
enjin soon <:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
from wh <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512> to top 3
which is kinda nuts
top 3 supporting cast
she's definitely on my like
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
she becomes a giga beast later but even early she's not bad
i'm watching a good amount of the anime and fuuko isn't that bad even early though
i mean to a degree i see it though, for gina definitely early on
<:ICANT:995593696030507099>
you don't necessarily have that limitation with a losestreak econ trait <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
econ trait like underground you can only make the unit so strong cause you still can cashout even if you winstreak
i guess that's kind of the tradeoff too
it's too ratty i think
yeah idk how much i enjoy you have to losestreak econ trait design
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but i should just scout if the win/losestreak matter
i guess it is a degree of skill issue tho, at my rank i don't have to scout and i can guess the avg board strenght
and still lost to people who ain't even griefing
i lost some match with 2-1 piltover even while trapping ekko
oh i mean like set 9
people with 0 gold with a weaker board than i could make even if i tried
when playing with friends, i've gotten some loss streaks griefed by some wild boards
if by low elo they mean like gold or smth
i mean i don't think it's harder to win but like
<:Looking:1154847280529162260>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
stat really is too powerful <:life:1001518241610485781>
yeah that's fair i think
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i mean i'd probably agree if there was more time between patch release and vegas
you really think so?
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
instead of playing rando
especially if you're doing close lobby
i think for playing tourney patch early like this it's really good
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
toast had to blackmail soji into doing closed pbe lobby for practice cause he'd rather watch kdrama than play pbe <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i think he start on 9 and he's going to vegas now
he's a new player, he's one of those that get really good really fast at any game they pick up
no one he knows want to practice pbe
and his comment about that was competitive tft is dead <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
woohoojin dropped out of bootcamp advanced category so he could lab pbe patch for vegas
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
the kids were really cute too
i really like how the close up shot of alpha looks like kyoichiro
i dunno if it's just the artstyle, i don't think it is
i do care a lot about reading too it's just hard to justify spending time reading shit that is a complete gamble when there's other stuff that i've been recommended that is less of a gamble
maybe i'll start once i run out of recommendations
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i think that's fair, i dunno if i have the energy for that tho
i thought you didn't read exorcist stuff
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
did you read dandadan yet
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
almost at 300
it's working too
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
queerbaiting? in my manga? it's more likely than you think
isn't blue lock bl
i don't mind bl
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
which one is it?
i agree though
this weeks yozakura was funny
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
i can't wait for it
rip looking over all the patients
i love the attention to detail
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
okay that was really good
it's so much <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
ears, eyes, antlers <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
like i'm still figuring out how the head would look like
i never realised
it's a lot of choices one has to make
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i didn't even get to the part that would get me hard
it's hard
i'm designing a deergirl
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
i'm also learning how to draw so maybe in a few months/years i'll be good enough that i can join the art trades
i'm down to commission you another time if you have the slot!
i don't mind waiting, thank you so so much! i'm so glad i commissioned you, it looks incredible!
holy shit you're a fucking beast
maybe a negator somehow?
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i'll wait until you pick up the final version and i'll change my wallpapers
woaahhh it looks so great! i love it!
poor juiz man
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
it looks so lively
i really like it! i think i prefer it over how it was before
my eyes are definitely drawn to the second one more
oooh i do really like the colors on that one
like big bro with that's jazz
i think i'd drive down the avg age of survival there
do you think you'd thrive in that environment
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
i already suck at gambling i just need to be good at gaslighting next
i could be a tonegawa i think
true
like what the actual fuck man
people suing for how bad the conditions were on set
i saw some headlines about that
this but unironically
<a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
sorry i got stunlocked, who would go i'll play the kaiji gambling machine, that one is for sure fair
wait what there's a kaiji arcade machine?
that looks sick
wait really? that's fan animation?
oh ok
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
where the fuck is this from
if there's no kaiji part 3 anime
sounds great!
you should have it, i added to the emote server youre in
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
if you don't think it looks good then it doesn't look good
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333> i dunno
wooaaa so pretty! i love it!
it's furry in a philosophical way <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
good job
it's SO fucking furry it's insane
i retract all my comments about totsukuni no shoujo not being furry enough
holy based
<a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206>
3k black slate
17k cherrywood
i'm becoming a fucking beast
<a:Necromancy:1112044496012705873>
some of these skill are not meant for someone to get 99 on
that one was mean as fuck
<:feelscraftman:1040445502740758528>
you never know
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
it has to be an insane s-tier joke tho
even if it's not built up, i could see it being pull off if the joke is good enough
it's really risky
i guess it depend how well you pull it off though
idk how similar that is <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
but a lot of gsr writing just straight skip the first step, no time at all for community to even reflect about it and they're already self jerking that was really funny wasn't it
like with paimon emergency food
like in genshin with a lot of the joke, it felt like it went
character mention it once -> player meme about it -> mihoyo play into the meme
yeah that's kinda how i felt about some of the early gsr writing
i can see it pissing me off really easily though
like if it's a narrator or something i don't mind
i don't think it ever happened to me in a way where it pissed me off
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
can you imagine the chapter when fuuko and andy fuck
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
it really is a romance manga
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196> it was so wholesome too
for slice of life, idk if i really have anything that i'm reading that is purely slice of life <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
that's definitely still my favorite romance one
the one romance manga that ruby recommend that i liked a LOT was 365 days until marriage
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
what's your idea of a low bandwith gnere
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i mean we're talking about undead unluck, you could just read that
i don't think you can make an ending like that if you don't care about the source material
the ending is too good <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
honestly from what the anime look like, it really feels like they do love udul
surely we get to autumn at least
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
yeah
if this is 1 cour i don't think anythings happening the entire season <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
it better be 2 cour
they're probably saving budget for union fight?
i mean maybe at the very end
i thought for sure we'd get thorugh the entire union fight this episode
like holy
they're taking their damn time
my b
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i love it though!
ah shit i just remembered i forgot answer this
he forgot
what kinda answer did they even expect tho
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
if you ever die for whatever reason though they'll have a fun surprise
you think he did finance
i wonder what even was that guy's dayjob at passione
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
and gyro's a fucking beast
it just let him use gyro's power
is it really that weak
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
and it goes
imagine if you get a stand and you go that's sick! what can i do now? punch really hard?
a lot of jojo stand is so situational it's insane <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i think a lot of them make their power system too 1 dimensional
stand design on these later part are SO stacked
i'm a fan of jobin's stand, it had a lot of potential
reading that monthly was fucking crazy, felt like we were in the last 10 chapter and we still didn't know who the main villain even was <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
yeah same, i read a lot of that monthly
forced to let the gang go or else <:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
more like blackmailed
this time he didn't really get beaten though
he'll definitely come back tho <:caught:1175079388874805351>
i might do something similar, i did it by accident cause my source wasn't set up properly on tachiyomi so i stocked up like 4 chapter
that's fair
are you reading jojo?
it is their most popular show though
for some reason i thought they only did jojo <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
oh they also did fire force
yeah <:caught:1175079388874805351>
this adaptation feels a lot better than jojo imo
that's kinda nut
that's making undead unluck
o wait is the studio the same as jojo?
honestly i feel the same way <:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
+2
<a:PU_PeepoChugsDrink:747989825239515273>
the steak there must slap hard
true
at certain point he's more fucked up than the 3 playing the game <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
is he even getting a break
i'm closer to being done than i thought then <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
yeah okay, that makes sense i guess
it makes sense why soul eater last volume is like twice the size of an earlier one <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
i never though about how you'd need like plan the amount of chapter to finish off a series tankobon
oh yeah, i guess that's a little weird huh? <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i think his yapping to mario and mitsuyama is definitely over the line
alright, that's a little weird but i'm down
oh really?
but that doesn't <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i think kazuya does do some shit later that does
but i don't think it affect the outcome of the ideology test
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333> i mean that was definitely cheating by the meaning of the word
it's right after kazuya let chang speak for a bit
yeah they're giga fucked up
i'm starting the 14th round right now
i'm probably way past that
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
okay wait i read a FUCK ton
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
jesus fucking christ
<a:peepoRun:820028507370815508>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
isn't 480m like 2m usd
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
this is where we'll bury you if you die during our game yeah okay buddy
it's not like they're making the 700m back from ichijo's body
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
he can get away with being a pachinko designer slave
like even more than we know about
maybe if he's a beast at making pachinko
ichijo lost 700m that wasn't even his <:caught:1175079388874805351>
muraoka's money was at least his own money
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
that's too much money to lose at once
yeah
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
the hyodos
the only people who haven't shown being affect by gamble are the people who don't care about money
and then it immediately swap back around with ichijo begging kaiji
that interaction was so fucking funny <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah, or just begging to call it a draw with ichijo at the last second
like if it come down to it, he would still beg for his life
it's clear it's just some giga mental gymnastic though, he has the natural instinct for gambling but he's not superhuman either
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
like it'll surely be life or death again <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it's pretty much already written on the walls that kazuya won't be happy with kaiji gambling with the 480m either
he had 3M on start of part 3 and at one point he was gambling with his life <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
my guy goes to the negatives
taking all the money and gambling it all to 0 is one thing
i'm genuinely surprised even
he will end up gambling everything anyways
lowkey leaving kaiji on his own is punishment enough <:caught:1175079388874805351>
yeah that's true
it isn't exactly consistent, nor is it really fair, but their idea of what is fair, they don't stray from it
it is interesting how it looks like everyone in teiai have this warped look into fairness that they never break
all he's done is keep the rules during ceelo
he hasn't done much yet though
yeah, that's kinda scary
even though muraoka is a giga coward, he still had insane knowledge he still used
having muraoka and potentially kazuya as antagonist who actually know what they're doing is more fun tho i think
and i mean in retrospect it make sense, that is probably actually true
one thing that i was a little disappoint of in part 1, is how tonegawa act like he never even play the game
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
yeah i can see that, if anything just from the amount of experience he has
that also makes sense, it's a kinda relatable but very twisted character core
yeah that makes sense, kaiji has balls to fight kazuya but surely he isn't the first
maybe he isn't? like sure kaiji agreed to the gamble but maybe if he didn't, kazuya would force his hand somehow?
so i wonder why kaiji gets that leeway <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
actually idk about that, there was the one 15 y/o kid he killed over that
believably so too, it sounds like pretty much no one ever treat him like a real person until kaiji
literally at every point where he's not just <a:Streaming:1039019999811088414> about the nature of humans he's acting like a 5 y/o
i think it's fitting how his ultra edgy ideology matches his own character, how immature he actually is
that's like fine though
i wouldn't say i'm uncomfortable though, i definitely disagree with him
i can see why people would get uncomfortable
okay hmm <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
but it's not like it makes no sense
yeah, i do think it's well written how like it's clear the reasoning he gives isn't the 100% truth
the amount of mental gymnastic he does <a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
this kaiji man
okay i started reading <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
yeah i'm the same there's no way i'm not reading it
but you also know it'll never finish
like if you knew there was a big chance it would be one of the best thing you ever read
would you not read it
if it was you
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i mean but i can't just not read it either <:caught:1175079388874805351>
that one is on my list, though i'm a little scared to start reading it
act age?
what is it then
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
it was like best hits of the stuff i enjoy from oshi no ko
i think the stage play arc is my favorite still
true
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
though that's probably good for hyping up viewer? i just don't like cliffhangers
so the second half was just kind of a cliffhanger for the stage play
i remember it being a kind of awkward end of season, the concert itself happen on the first half of the episode
of b-komachi
i think right after first concert
is it coming soon?
oh also it says something about season 2?
i think the first thing i thought about how pretty that outfit looks
that's not good
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
some anime goes crazy, they spent 10 minutes on first episode talking about food preferences
i vibe with it now, those girls are so autistic
i remember it being a little boring when i was younger
i picked lucky star to watch for a bit
i don't remember it being that long
yozakura is like 200?
oh shit i've read some long stuff before though
oh that's pretty meaty
i'll take a look at it <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
i'm intested
oh that's pretty neat, i like that
black star only show up in the manga when baby aqua went joker mode
like on first ep of the anime, during the first time ai and ichigo were talking, her eye turn from black to white star when ichigo said that she could lie
cause some of it got retconned in the anime
though tbh i kinda think aka didn't have a good idea on what they meant either at the start
i'm still kinda confused what they actually mean
are the star in the eyes suppose to signify literal shining star status
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
huh i see
from shiranui or akane
she mustve been a beast to take ai spot
i wonder if we should've gotten more backstory on her if that's the case
oh yeah i see
which is not an interesting answe and it's not not bullshit but it sounds the least bullshit
i mean i already assume that he's just crazy in the head
that is true
i think crow girl is already near my limit
if they keep push more supernatural shit <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
would you be fine with that
like literally no way for him to plan that ahead unless he know the future
like that was a while ago, i don't think aqua even was doing anything about the movie then, right?
though i mean probably not, or he has some legit future sight powers
if that's the case, that's insane
was it? i didn't catch that
oh shit
wait wdym <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
in a way, i could see them trying to mold ruby into that
it's kinda crazy
yeah, the way people start talking about ai recently it's almost as she's a god
i'll let him cook though <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
like i dunno if i needed that <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
the connection with hikaru was kinda out of nowhere to me
that's kinda unfair for akane
i wonder if the other girl is fucked up in a similar way though
oh yeah that's true for sure
was she?
this was a pretty good chapter for 2
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
to me, my 2 top interest is 1. business and technical stuff and 2. character
this is picking back up on stuff i enjoy
okay i read the new oshi no ko chapter
<:life:1001518241610485781>
but that's not enough to overcome all her nature by default
like it's clear she loves denji a lot, genuinely
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i think it's doing a great job at adding nuance to what it mean to be a devil
yeah, i really enjoy nayuta character
and that was incredible
i read the chainsaw man one
oh shit i forgot about oshi no ko chapter
you know it's really bad when not even young keilo could stand it
it's trash anime too, mahouka koukou no rettousei <a:DIESOFCRINGE:998328905561804830>
i'm only really consider cause it's the highest rated one
it's probably fine if i also pick up normal decks too right <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
like learning english from teen titans go
i feel like my japanese would be fucked up if i only learned it by anime quotes
literally just anime quotes deck
is this too degen
i lost all my anki decks
okay i wanna pick back up learning japanese
<:FeelsStrongMan:814965624659771442>
they were just like us
prehistoric furry drawings
have you seen the like
so based
<3
<2
is you guys
nowadays
is the answer
i mean probably discord
but like yeah you get used to it, i haven't really found good places for relatively small community
the <:DankReading:1118364427767525518> what was for the content of the post <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
oh i didn't meant to come off like that
it's like what kinda response do you expect to get <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
Should I Play Celeste posted on the celeste subreddit, which has 4 regulars who are clinically obsessed enough with the game to be the only ones posting on reddit about it 5 years later
the funniest post are like
most small fandom subreddit is like that
what
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
cannot beat the silly allegations
eternally salty
i will never get used to it
i legitimately think all algorithm should be banned
that shit pisses me off to an Unreasonable degree
if he was a manga character i think i'd simp him
he's so fucking pathetic
definitely like top 3
i've seen that one before
statements dreamt up by the utterly deranged
yeah i am very horny over my coworkers
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
which is just incest for coward
isn't western most popular tag like step sis stuff
maybe they're just shameless though
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
are they like contractually obligated to have some weird shit?
aka's normal weird hobby is balance out by how much mengo wants ruby and aqua to fuck
like how come we can't have one normal one
if it isn't weird about kids, it's weird about sexual harassment
it's so fucking weird how almost all of them is weird in some way
you just don't get it
riko shoving a ruler up reg's ass was extremely important for character development
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
unironic horseshoe theory for progressive and giga perv
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
jesus christ
probably both?
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
i dunno if fujimoto hobby is some fucked up shit or lying
like, almost force him to go anonymous as an author
i would be fine if there was enough harm reduction on his stuff for it to keep coming out
i mean yeah still fucked up <:caught:1175079388874805351>
but i still like it, in spite of the pedo shit
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
cause like my guy is definitely a pedo and it definitely matters on the plot
i guess the counter to my point of view is made in abyss though
yeah
maybe with some restriction though
i mean yeah it falls under that for me, i wouldn't mind it if he kept making manga <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
the only type of harm it would do is like, platforming people with bad opinion on other stuff, but if he's already in prison that won't really work <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
and if his work doesn't, like if it's about some specific matter where he has good insight and those belief don't enter at all, then it doesn't really do any harm to have that work out there
if his work had some nazi ideal undertone in it, then i wouldn't like it
i feel like if w/e he did was really bad, like say he was into some nazi shit
oh no questions asked, i would definitely let him keep doing it
yes, ruby?
and those are a shitshow
mostly because a lot of what i read before manga was like webcomics
i mean i'm not saying i care about all of them either but there's too much i care about that will never be finished <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
seas and mounts of unfinished work
i guess it's a little more rare for manga, but for other artform it's very normal for stuff to go unfinished
like i keep manga on my up to date list to fetch update every week that i have no hope will ever get a continuation
i think to a degree i'm a little over it <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
god i love fuuko too much
tbh the way i think about it it's not even about thinking there's a chance or not, to me it'd be about giving up on it or not
new volume cover <:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
and tbh i don't even know if it's a bad thing to not get over that
it's probably really hard to get over not having 100% control over what you put out
stuff like movie, aaa game, anime
where a lot of people have a hand in it or it's impossible to get it done
i think unless you're forced into making big production
that's really scary but honestly i get it <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
if it's like a game where thousand of people work on its one thing, but like
to me it's just unthinkable to even voice it out, cause i know how unrealistic it is to have that, especially on an artform so personal as manga
but i also don't think it's a fair expectation of me to put on artist to release that kind of stuff, especially of stuff that is unfinished
i find it extremely fascinating and interesting
i mean don't get me wrong, i'm also extremely nosy, i love staring at stuff like early sketch, early design, concept art, that kind of stuff
yeah that's how i think most author is like
but i mean i respect it
i can't think like that
that's kinda wild from author side <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333> like as a fan or as an author?
that's even more unfinished
i would much rather leave something incomplete than make an unfinished ending that barely meet my standard
i understand that feeling as a fan but i think it would probably not be as much closure as you think it would, and not worth the tradeoff for the author <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
the manga isn't even halfway translated tho <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
from what i remember from the anime i remember it having a nice ending ye
for the anime? or the manga
that's true too, knowing what the author was planning wouldn't really guarantee any meaningful improvement on any fan continuation either
yeah, it would also feel awful for the author, basically just throwing the towel on ever finishing it
i know you're dying but could you just like, sketch out what you think the ending would look like?
i mean i get it but it's a wild take
kinda unhinged but i respect it i guess?
i guess i should since i liked the anime, i forgot about it
i also haven't read the manga to give a proper recommendation
the author apparently isn't finishing it though, took a huge pause because of health issue and ended up dropping it last year
netjuu is about a couple that meet in an MMO and they fall in love with each other but they're both playing gender swapped character
i also heard log horizon is suppose to be good at it but i haven't read or watch it
but not focused on mechanical or competitive side at all
i watch netjuu no susume and that was pretty good about social casual side of games
but he understand gaming at least
you can talk all you want about bnha author
that's actually pretty great
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
i think i remember something like that but i didn't know it was that direct
actually?
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
kassadin main
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
ruin is going to be like a 4chan user or smth
okay nevermind there's some wild ones
i forgot about that one
oh true <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh i guess shen's story is pretty nuts
and even then is not even that nuts, they're just soldiers
like the wildest backstory we have are tella billy and creed
would that be too surprising though <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
i mean yeah probably
i'm also curious about victhor's but we won't see that one
i'm actually too curious to know what juiz life is like by default
<:life:1001518241610485781>
when you put it like that
i think to the end of 100th loop they both wanted to end each others pain in whatever way they could
i mean i guess it is but it wasn't really a spur of the moment thing
is it twist though <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
it doesn't guarantee that they'll do the opposite of what they were going to do, just the opposite of their sense of justice, which could be something completely unrelated
yeah, it's kind of a gamble in a way
oh shit <:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
i never realised it
untruth is pretty similar to unjustice huh
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
this author cooks too hard
the reveal that juiz's helmet is from the armour that victhor made her on an earlier loop that she brings along to this day
there's so many great details, i should reread it <:life:1001518241610485781>
the realisation that feng wasn't even using any negator to 1v4
that was a great arc <:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
surely not, that's a bit cruel
actually i dunno, do they anime foreshadow shit on op/ed that won't even be shown this season? maybe at all adapted?
the question is if we get to summer or not
so yeah i think from the ed alone it's guarantee we'll finish autumn arc <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it's also when she loses an arm
i remember the panel that mirrors victhor's comes from juiz and billy convo at uma winter
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333> so it really is autumn arc when we figure out victhor and juiz real relationship right?
oh ok
the ED is a widow who doesn't show her face (juiz) mourning a coffin, from which a confused andy wakes up from
so i think it's guarantee that the reveal will happen in the anime from that
i'm only asking cause the anime ED foreshadow that a lot
this loop = 100th loop
and victor was still around before and on past loop too
i thought it was really recent, like remember was used on victor early this loop
how much is that? is that like the time between 2 loop or is that a few loops?
4 billion years?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh wait what?
when do we figure out who is really victor again? it's like autumn arc right?
so he just find that out somehow else?
then surely juiz would know about it too and told fuuko
like if he brought that information up from victhor
oh that's true too
that only makes so much sense though, even if sun was destruction he still makes stuff, he makes umas and other rules <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
something like that?
maybe they're like uma creation and uma destruction
isn't 1 enough
like why is there even 2 of them
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
probably not too much since she didn't know about the master rules
so many mysteries behind those 2 still, i wonder if fuuko knows more than we know
i could fix luna
i see, that makes sense yea
masterest rules
i guess that would make sense
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
are they?
oh shit
that was fucked up but i laughed so much at that
it kinda feels like god is force to follow some rules we don't know about to give out negator ability
actually yeah even the cause is like extremely specific
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh that's true
he can mess with the timing though, chikara was born earlier <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
he can't just give it to someone else this loop
like, now that sun decide that like, chikara is the one with unmove
from 1st loop
locked in
do you think it's like
this is the first loop fuuko ever survive, right? like, probably
so he give it to someone in a way that has low chance of mattering <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
since luck is a master rule, unluck is probably guarantee to be extremely strong
i wonder if that was on purpose
meanwhile for everyone else he's making like 17 step plan for the most tragic way to give them a fucked up ability
sun was just like eh whatever who ever she touches dies
fuuko's unluck was like a freebie to god
if you think about it
it is a really cool ability
i was too excited when she show up in 101st loop
idk how it happened but i became a latla fangirl
i'm gonna pog out too hard when latla shows up again
people in undead unluck pick up a lot of skills when they have a lot of free time <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
the reveal that andy is a beast at drawing manga for some reason
aw that was a funny one
idk if they'll make it to 67 in 2 cour like that
15 chapter in 7 episode, not even mention the longer 1st chapter
yeah, they gotta pick up the pace though
we'll prob need another 2 cour to finish loop 100
it's also gonna feel weird later on 101st loop when gina and gina aren't just blending in to the crowd on the convo
spring arc is so good
not getting to spring arc <:sajj:1067071714518892584>
and then end second cour either at the end of autumn arc (ch52) or summer arc (ch67)
so if they pick up the pace we can prob finish that in 1 cour
and chikara arc ends on ch30
they adapt about 13 chapter in 6 episode
okay ain't no way this is it though
yeah it felt so empty <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
it is a way weaker first page than what we really got tbf
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
little did i know
so when i went to the real one, i was like that's a weird addition, though it brings more character
and there was no manga in the pilot
i read the pilot by accident
you know what's crazy?
from day 1
that's actually nuts
nvm
oh in the manga too
she also close the 101st volume in the anime
especially this chapter, which is something that won't even happen
still, this is a lot of work they put in on actually animating akira's manga
i guess this is just a more accurate version of that then
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
i thought i was watching the wrong anime <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
i mean it is, we never saw the manga content in the manga, right?
yeah that makes sense <a:Noted:914214211138244688>
oh i see
so this is standin for victor and juiz on ragnarok of loop 100
oh ok
i mean i guess that'd make sense
oh, then they change the mc?
but fuuko in the manga died during autumn arc, right?
from what i thought, i thought male and female mc of the manga were stand in for andy and fuuko
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
the flashbacks, they flash really quickly
clock ticks to midnight/midday, they stand up, kiss, and it ends
has some omnious flashbacks?
male one grabs her hand, says don't go, she lies down at his chest
the place looks almost post apocalyptic, everything is extremely snowed in
like through thick layers of snow and heavy snowstorm
i assume it's suppose to be the 2 mc, the guy one is lying on the snow as the girl one is making her way to him
i can describe it
and i also don't really get what is even being depicted on that last chapter either
of showing that
and i don't really get the point <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
of the last chapter of akira's manga
i ask because the first episode of udul open with 2:20 minute long scene
that's what i thought <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
cause the story has changed
does that mean that whatever happen after those arc is useless info?
he purposefully leaves the 3 arc unpublish so that he can change it
so about akira's manga <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
that's actually so nice
frieren and kusuriya are too
a lot of good anime getting 2 cour
oh that's kinda sick
like it probably really will end with chikara arc huh <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
did we get confirmation if it's 1 or 2 cour
what can even be 2 whole points higher than frieren
the fuck he watching <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
did this guy unlock anime2 or what
and i think it had enough even there to keep me interested
it turned around pretty quickly though
it's kinda sad but kinda understandable, it was definitely not a part of early udul that i enjoy
how even <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
there's a guy there watching 21 different anime this season
some people on r/anime pull of 40 hour work week into watching anime what the hell
i guess the story carries it
i don't really care about animation quality personally but i thought the avg viewer would, and it would turn them off from it a bit
the animation quality isn't the best, but it's like a lot of people's second place to frieren
damn, people are really enjoying kusuriya
i think i assumed a shallower angle from it, like it only matter for premise, but surely not
that's fair i think, i kinda get how you feel about unique <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yozakura got a +.5 from ai
every furry manga gets +1 point for free
it's my bias scale
my 10 scale is just how much i enjoy it though
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> that annoys me too
so like it's really only one, so i should be done quick
and another is the sidestory to mahoutsukai no yome, which i still haven't decided if i'm reading or not before actual mahoutsukai no yome
i have 3 other manga from the furry author to read still, but one of them only have 3/27 chapter translated
yeah, there's not much to be done about it unless i wanna learn japanese
we're legit like 30ch behind
i didn't know until now
also holy shit we're so behind
they joined forces
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
but then i paid attention to the credits
and then when anime got announced, a group decide to pick it up and i got really sad that it got poached from the random guy
it was dropped for a while from everyone, and then suddenly some random guy (joaquimhawke) pick it up and translated a few chapters, kinda slow cause he was doing it by himself and you can tell he's not good at cleaning up the raw n stuff
with scanlation
did you see the shy meta narrative?
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
that 7/10 is too low to keep watching
does like 9/10 and 10/10 drop on his feet every day
is he living in an utopia or smth
i mean if you dislike it you dislike it, i don't mind it, i'm more surprise that he dropped a show he thinks it's 7/10
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
what the fuck
what world are you living in where your baseline for watching is 8/10 or higher
who the fuck drops a 7/10 show
now i'm looking at r/anime
it'll take a lil bit more i think, i took a peek on the first chapter though
like, the more we enjoy the story the less they do
i dunno if it's on purpose, but i think it's really cool how the story manages to set the gods as intrinsically different from humans even through that
on vacay
you think they were just chillin for 100 loops
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
yeah, from the start the game was rigged to be unwinnable until 101st loop
yeah that's definitely true too, the amount of work juiz have done and amount of trust she put on everyone
and i agree with it too, i love how much love fuuko have for everyone, it's kinda contagious
gotta scroll ike 2/3rds to find a comment like this which is actually saying something instead of just circlejerking the same joke
95% of comment is one of can't wait until next week more shokugeki no soma! this manga is like 80 different genre! or but what about induction stoves
god i hate this aspect of reddit, everyone jump at the throat of the low hanging fruit joke
only shokugeki no soma jokes
no one is discussing about unburn power <:Dank:911882500350046258>
that's so nice though, it slaps too hard to not get recognition somewhere
but like, for 50/50 it feels like it's waaaay more planned than that
well, i think it's impossible to fully plan and i've noticed a few things that if planned better could be foreshadowed better, like the ramen here
that's actually pretty impressive
i went to check on r/manga to see what people thought about udul chapter and saw that announcement
i hope they treat it well <:Prayge:909232418463047690>
that's true
i had to check the comment to figure out it's chii
i saw the announcement and went isn't ao no hako blue box? who the fuck is that
hina gets a pass <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
that's true i guess
that's so weird <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
kyou is not white hair either
the fuck <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
just don't fill in on normal pages
apparently in every color page author draws her with brown hair
me too <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
what the fuck
chii is not blonde? <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
blue box is getting an anime
probably the most direct answer is something something his understanding of what it mean to be burn?
yeah maybe
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
surely that work with the ramen too
like she didn't get burn but she got cooked or smth
didn't unback get cooked alive from the heat?
or something like that
like, i assume it's not by his choice, but anything he touch is prevented from burn? <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
and also, a really weird way that his power works
that is kinda funny though
apparently
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263> sick <:Dank:911882500350046258>
if he keep dsg up for another 1000 year then he'll almost have spend half what xqc did gambling <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
he has member on 4 game right now, valo apex league and tft, looking for a 5th game, a fighting one
he broke even in november though
he decided to try it out for 2 year, initially he was going to spend 500k a year for those 2 year, but now he's closing out the first year having spent 1m
okay so i catch up to tell you
actual monopoly
toast just sign almost all of tft twitch <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<@180679257851166721> 
i was like who drinks cum
that makes sense
oooh
who even is this <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
the gambler ones was emily instead of scarra though
boxbox <:poggfrenn:1087713199215886377> toast <:poggfrenn:1087713199215886377> scarra
it really is, i thought it was just toast boxbox and scarra
and he said he would announce the last one on stream
he already announce scarra boxbox kiyoon rayditz lil bro dishsoap and setsuko
the roster is 10 people, including himself +1 that i don't recognise
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
do you think soji is signing with dsg?
wait
yeah i could see it
your skin color has to be like neon pink to be worth more than a house nowadays
surely not
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
do you think it would be cheaper
i kinda respect people like him, boxbox on stream also said that he's taking all sponsor cause he wanna retire soon, buy a house and have kids
it's like actual spreadsheets of all expenses and revenue
he like, shares all the financial details of running an org like dsg on the patreon, it's actually really interesting for people who care about esports i think
he's taking infinite sponsor deal, he made a really unique patreon too
i think he's doing that thing where he try it out for x time and drop it if it doesn't work
he's definitely doing his best to turn a profit, or at least stay neutral
he's paying everything out of his own retirement fund tho, and i don't think he's turning on a profit yet
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i dunno then, if it's even people that i don't think are that close to him then he's prob paying them some amount
i thought it was just his close friend, scarra and boxbox
oh wait he signed a bunch of tft streamer
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
he signed them so they could have a fair chance in the scene
and the players he signed for valo league and cs were teams that their org got rid of out of nowhere
he does it almost for charity though, i don't think he pays the big name streamer he sign cause it's just his friends
and i guess he's signing tft streamer now too
they did a gamechangers valo team too, they have a league and cs aswell
yeah dsg is kinda old already, they start off in valo
or are you memeing and talking about dsg <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like a separate one?
wait he did?
it's kinda crazy that these guy manage to get so big
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
does miz get brand deal? or like only from a part of otk
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
soji doesn't need the contract anymore tho
actually idk it was prob a good move for c9 to keep him maybe
i mean maybe it's best for both of them tho
oh i see
so he gets paid to be in c9?
idk how that stuff works tbh
oh yeah i saw that
the sojussy must go crazy
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that's just on wsj reddit
personally, i don't like shows (they're not even playing NEW music, just the same ones in their album everyone in the audience already knows?)
what the fuck
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
absoutely deranged
holy shit shonen jump start in lates 60s?
oh but it isn't weekly is it
oh exorcist is also shonen jump
like maybe it was unique back when it release or smth <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that could be a bit hard for some old one like one piece
yeah i can understand that
most like people with reasonable taste i see say that one piece is the good one of the big 3
yeah i haven't read any of them so i can't say, but i have heard it's good
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i see
that one is kinda mid tho
oh wait i'm also reading the mermaid one
sick
then yeah, i thought csm was another shonen jump tho
oh csm counts?
i was reading tokyo underworld and the cipher one but i drop both, might pick up later but not really too excited over it
is the 5th one one piece?
that's it i think
yozakura, udul, blue box, akane
the ones i'm reading are
<:life:1001518241610485781>
that does sound really good
i think i had very narrow expectation from it
the first time i pick up to read wsj i was already kinda surprise by how much variety there was
that does sound really good
i see, that's interesting
yugioh was wsj?
i only start reading manga recently
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
well i dunno if it was better befor tbh
shonen competition is kinda lacking nowadays i think
the constant gag on the anime where the censor flies out to reveal another, smaller censor bar
that's actually really funny
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
holy <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
there's no hiding it
but on the anime man
that makes sense, i didn't notice as much early on the manga
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
was her booba always that big
lowkey tho
yeah true
i like fuuko design a lot tho
i guess i can see it
you really think so
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
even if i love lesbian girls i'm not separating fuuko and andy like wtf
but all of the canon ones in udul are too good
a lot of the times they give so little shit developing the canon pairing
i think it kinda show how good the character writing is when i'm not clamoring for any lgbt pairing
there's fuuko gina for GL
yea you're right it's kinda weak on BL department
juiz victhor is almost kinda BL if you write it in the right time on their story
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
it deserve it more than aot and bnha
<:Prayge:909232418463047690> for udul anime to get like 6 season
i saw reddit thread about it and they're like i can't believe gina died and i'm like read the manga <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
yeah that's how i feel too, i wanna get my friends to experience so i'm trying to get them to read it so they can get into the best part in this lifetime
spending 3 episodes on spoil fight is kind of a lot <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
especially last episode
yeah i haven't been watching it, just skimming the episodes and it feels kinda slow too
but like, unironically
every day of pbe someone recreate the soji fast 9 into roll once and die
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
hopefully it is just some shitty batteries for fun
that's actually fucking sucks for you <:sajj:1067071714518892584>
no rush though i don't really have a reason to have it early or late
i hope you get that fixed
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
LMFAO this is almost comically fucked up
me book
NL988863127BR
okay carv can come back in i'm not gonna datamine anymore
<:FeelsStrongMan:998261742683566130>
that's my streamer
oh i also read wha new chapter finally and that was pretty good
just like a rando generic harem manga but with lesbian mc
and that was really mid
the other one i read is mofu kano potpourri
i've only read the short 1-2 chapter stories so i guess that's to be expected, you can only do so much
okay i read a few, nagabe's stuff is a little hit or miss
he knows
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
least horny lil bro viewer <a:eavLILLIA:1167953746127507579>
<a:peepoTrip:755692813320060959>
i didn't even know there were hours that far
thank you i'm going <:bejj:1067071810853679194>
i am not surviving this class
i am so eepy
<:woah:1002343493055815740>
whoaaa i'm loving it
that shit was so stupid for fun
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> that gave me xenoblade chronicles 2 ptsd
i mean you don't have to if you don't want to
like i'm fine with chainsaw man rules being a little over the place cause fujimoto don't try to gaslight me otherwise
my thing with magic rules is that i'll only get annoyed about it if they make it sound like the system is hard magic when it really isn't
it says they release alongside vol10
you think it's a bad idea if i read the short stories first?
okay sure i'll add it to the list
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i see
oh i see <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
idk if i should read it without knowing anything about the main story
my furry author did some side story for it
is it good <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
so <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
ruby you read mahoutsukai no yome already?
<a:point:619635142264225796> simp
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
it's a payout better than 480m yen
i dunno if it's all of them
imagine being The Guy for monster girl
living the dream
that's kinda sick
it's i wanna fuck a dark souls boss
i kinda vibe with it, it's definitely monsterfucker though yea
something something susume
i know of that one anime that is popular for that
nevermind then
okay
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i mean i guess i'll take it if it's good, i won't lower my standards for that though
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i thought she'd be stand in for taiyo and mutsumi children but they went and had children anyways so
i ended up enjoying it even though she kinda went <a:ppPoof:888543449622667284>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i'm gonna be honest i only started reading yozakura because of ai
yeah
i'm willing to lower my standards
do you know any good ones <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
it's mostly a lot of short stuff so i'll be done quick
i'll pick it back up later, for now i found a furry manga author so i'll read all his anthology <:sirinheh_hh:833153742399733780>
it's also pretty short
<a:NervousSweat:765639934555324486>
that's interesting
so kazuya and kaiji will just watch other people gamble? <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
oh what really?
but like, i don't think kazuya will be happy if he only put the 480m on the line <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i wonder what even is kaiji explanation to wanting to gamble with kazuya, like i'm sure that it's mostly out of revenge from teiai
the cliffhanger for part 4 is also interesting
that last match was really good, the amount of tension put in and the fact that it ended so early
okay i'm done with part 3
muraoka isn't a bit more poor now, he's <:joever:1122752199752163419>
holy shit the luck on the ura dora
okay i'm finishing up part 3 now
miyoshi and maeda status
fucker -> fucked up
he's fucking coming
LMFAOOOOO kaiji <a:PepeRun:641338224580755467>
he did a 100m gamble with kaiji, so kazuya bring 200m just to be sure
maybe trying to one up his father
it's surely fine
it's just a <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> 160m
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
is he wrong tho
yeah
even though he got a suu ankou opener <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i'm starting the 160m match and it's v clear how fucked up muraoka is
but for a game like this, it's more about mental state?
i mean it didn't really matter for game of pure luck like ceelo
i think i'm starting to get the entire flow of the match thing from earlier part
yeah the amount of mistake each one make actually <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i'm a fucking beast <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
turn out to be the one with highest stake
somehow the safest gamble
i mean i guess for kaiji it's dead -> dead
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
that is true though that's fucking insane
i just finished the 80m match
he's a really good actor though
like jesus christ
but seeing all those random stuff that come up during the past chapter actually be all a part of muraoka plan
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like i feel like kazuya only lend kaiji that much money cause he's kaiji
yeah that's kinda crazy the reveal how this was always his intent, i wonder if this happen often
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
but even muraoka is teiai lapdog
oh i see why muraoka is so worried over kazuya now, i thought he was just like a rando influential guy
i mean i get it tho
he's not even betting his life
now that he actually have to play the game he's shitting his pants <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
kazuya is fucking right too, he's such a coward
fucking rat
muraoka is sort of a different character than i thought
oh yeah i've started
<:peepoSpy:1103527119704817714>
you can import and see all my manga/other stuff and how it's organised
it's like my whole library
it has porn in it so beware if you're going to snoop <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i'm moving phone, this is my tachiyomi backup
the fucking body part roulette was <a:NervousSweat:765639934555324486>
i'm guessing you can't make a worthless hand that become mangan with uradora tho
that makes sense, ideally he'd want a 1 man 8 pin wait <:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
couldn't he just have fucked with uradora?
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
but that hand only work if kaiji discard the 8 pin now
houtei ron is a thing?
o wait nevermind
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
giga fucked now?
isn't his hand
i'm up to the part where muraoka is fucking with his hand hidden from kaiji
yeah, that's what i meant by teiai hand
i thought for this arc at least he would be out of teiai hand <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it is really great, the tension is really high <:monka:969065665573027841>
yeah i definitely agree <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
the point i'm at, kaiji still need to figure out the last 4 discard
this round is infinite
but
i thought i was close
when you said you were done
not yet
than gambling
if anything to this point, this part feel a lot more like it's about information control
yeah, though on some times i did notice how his reaction were a lot more chill even on supposedly low info round
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
that's kinda sick
he force the first match to be fair by getting rid of kaiji lifeline too
the first match, muraoka did that on purpose didn't him?
actually holy shit
i was already thinking it was kinda sus how muraoka don't perceive that kaiji is lowkey chillin
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
miyoshi update
homie -> turbo shitter
honestly i think it's a good twist
oh shit
like he eventually past loop figure out how to communicate anyways
yeah untell is a little weird to me, that makes more sense
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
miyoshi status update
fuck up -> homie
he looked fucking out of his mind <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
<:peepoHigh:1037892645269286973>
actually giga fucked
would he just have less piece to discard for the round
but i mean more from the game standpoint
suu ankou potentially
yeah
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i wonder wtf would even happen if he couldn't find the pieces
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
yeah that's how i felt too, i've definitely been there
muraoka is slowly discarding pieces
i'm in the middle of it
oh i see
poor kaiji tho, he's kinda pathetic but it was nervous inducing even to me, getting so anxious and worked up
<:AkaneMorb:1054481239740006541>
you have like a sixth sense for when i pick up to read kaiji
potentially
we get to see another character become a real person and grow
that's so sick isn't it
oh true, god
i'm so down to see more of him
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
unburn is a fucking crazy negator to be
ragnarok in this loop is going to start from andy and fuuko banging
<:FeelsStrongMan:1015766690568618066>
how is this even possible
what the fuck man
holy shit that chapter was so fucking good
pbe is actually realistic environment you see
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
apparently ahri is bug and scale off ad rn
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
did you figure out why
just not as bad
and kaiji would still be kinda fucked
even if kaiji wasn't guarantee lost then, there was still a chance for draw
like for it to come to the very last tile, that's already scary
but i still wasn't sure if it would come to the very last tile
i got the hint of the 5 tile
even that one tho
kinda crazy how kaiji manage to be on the lowest so often <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah
after winning 2 big hand
muraoka will at least not be suspicious
if anything tho
miyoshi better not fuck it up
so it's all or nothin
i don't think kaiji will be able to back down
right now muraoka is trying to convince kaiji to do a 40m game
yeah true, kazuya probably not gonna lend any more money
i mean make sense tho they both just like <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966> at kaiji trying the bog
sound like hyodo <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
holy
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
like
that's what i meant by he's a homie
yeah
but it is nice that they're all unique, easier to balnace i'm thinkin
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
that's complicated
oh god
has to be tile of that suit
that one can't be a rando tile
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
icic
cool!
that one is really special
oh wow
<a:Noted:914214211138244688>
i should check back on it
there was a panel where they list all the yaku that matter
i don't remember how it works
that makes sense
oh ok
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
for doing 4 concealed pong or just 4 pong
but no reward
you get a prettier name for it
so why does it matter
i mean but they're worth the same amount of point?
that's weird
is that the only difference?
oh ok
but then what's the difference between daisuushi and suuankou
nvm then
oh ok
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
does triplet mean in sequence?
oh shit
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
what's the difference between daisuushi and suuankou
isn't pong and triplet the same?
oh ok
?
is that yakuman+ cause you also get han from wind
now that sounds a lot harder
oh
i mean ye, a lot simpler than i thought
that's true it is a lot harder than i'm thinking
i mean ye
o
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
that doesn't sound thaaat hard
oh ok
or does the pong have to be ascending in order
can it be like 555 555 777 777
no i mean like
and does it have any restriction for the pair
or just four pong
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
does it have to be like that?
sounds hard and also really rare
i dunno how much of it i'll absorb though
sure i'm down
thanks
<a:Noted:914214211138244688>
so it's 2 different cycle?
bet
kaiji personal bank
i know why he's here now
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
kazuya is a fucking homie
oh shit
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
that's fun
oh shit
it's probably not that hard
i'm also bad tho
to me
making a 5 han hand in 3 minute with 34 tile sound hard
lowkey even 17 steps is kinda stressful
both times i thought it was at least tanyao but there was a 9 i was too dumb to see
the 2 hand i complete i lost -13k cause i made a hand with no yaku <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
honestly all luck no skill <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
<a:GAMBAADDICT:1088508671144759358>
-40k
i'm fucking
i'm playing against bots for a bit while i procrastinate doing other thing
yeah like
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
what the fuck happens if a wind is dora
holy shit
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> how much are they worth?
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
that kaiji has to discard 17 tile but only 16 of them are safe
i think i predicted the next twist though
my bus home is in an hour so i'll read more then
i did start it already <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
that one i remember from the tutorial i was watching
yeah okay
i'm going to be a fucking beast at 17 steps
okay i think it's setting in
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> okay
yeah that makes sense
you said something about chanta with no winds/dragon being worth more?
so chanta with winds/dragon is worth 2 han + the han from yakuhai from the winds/dragon, right?
okay wait
<:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
i pinned it
oh!
oh
it is, it's 1 han
the opposite of tanyao
it's like
yeah okay
?
so you mean every number one has to have 1 or 9
oh
so specifically 123 111 789 999?
that's pretty good, on 17 steps with riichi that's already mangan
true
oh!
i guess not too much actually
isn't that one also really hard
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh ok
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
by letter you mean the dragons?
that makes sense actually
cool
oooh ok
wait there's 2 different sanshoku? i see <a:Noted:914214211138244688>
oh shit <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
i don't understand this part
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
kinda fucked up <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
and that's only worth 2? that sounds pretty hard
okay
okay
123 234 567 789 xx fine?
is like
<a:Noted:914214211138244688>
it's always in riichi, so it's always closed i think
you can't expose anything in 17 step so it's alright
oh ok
you need to win by completing the pong? or is just having the pong on your hand fine
<a:Noted:914214211138244688>
i also wanna know how much each is worth please <:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
oh <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
you only discard and ron
a lot of tsumo one don't apply cause you don't draw at all
well i mean
like i know menzen tsumo but it won't ever come up in 17 steps, so i didn't need to learn that one for now
ideally i want to know all the yaku that matter for 17 steps
is ippatsu a thing in 17 steps?
<:peepoSmart:641524796290498563>
i did feel extremely smart from figuring out muraoka wait
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
is there a list somewhere of all yaku i should learn
it's really good
you should read it too <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
so i can have a chance at predicting the stakes
but next step i need to learn the yaku that matter for 17 steps
learning the basic of mahjong already made it a looot easier to follow
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
it's peak gambling
it's boiled down to the basics
yeah you start at tenpai and you riichi at the start, that's the point of 17 steps
in the rules of 17 steps, you're obligated to start with riichi
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
i mean sure okay, that's for normal mahjong tho
but right now i wanna learn for 17 steps
and i'll probably play later
learning more about mahjong for this does make me interested in normal mahjong
or like, at least on the rules of 17 steps that is being played in kaiji
but in 17 steps you do <:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
i mean yea not in normal mahjong
in kaiji
that's how 17 steps work
yeah
yeah, you start the game at riichi already, so the only way you draw is by ron
i mean not like confused, i just want to know all the ones that might matter so i can expect it
i know menzen tsumo but like it's not going to come up in kaiji
so i only need to learn certain yaku
yeah
this is the chapter where they explain the rules
it's always in riichi, and there's no tsumo
they're playing 17 steps, which is like a cut down version of mahjong
so i can read kaiji <a:Noted:914214211138244688>
so like, i'm learning mahjong right now
like when you win by draw?
tsumo?
it's permanent riichi in kaiji
oh riichi i know too
<:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
i need you teach me all the rest
o i mean those 3 are the 3 that i already know
i learn some tsumo one but i forget it quick cause it doesn't matter for kaiji
and like that's it
pinfu, tanyao, san shoku
i know uhh
<a:AA_Gab_Bow:914213000594980964>
teach me the yaku please
i mean like kaiji giga gave it away tho but like still
but the second he catch on to kaiji, actually kinda scary, and it was accurate too
like all this time muraoka act like a junkie
muraoka has to lose first
so like
4 1 sou and 1 4 sou, he only has 4 left right?
isn't 5 piece too much
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
also on the next gamble
maybe he's like tonegawa, isn't really too capable to play the game without cheating
but i don't think he's incompetent either
and like surely if he was catching on he'd do it again now but like he isn't
or if he's catching on to kaiji
like idk if he's incompetent and did that trick by mistake
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
though i'm kinda confused on muraoka rn
i don't blame miyoshi tho that was rough
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i come back for the bingo
<a:Noted:914214211138244688>
cause with 7, you don't get san shoku and the hand only value 3 han
okay i used a calculator, it's a 3 4 wait actually
cause like he barely make 5 han with the 3 closed wait cause it was san shoku
was muraoka hand even a 3 4 7 wait tho
still don't know all the yaku though
<:5head:580172701533077515>
and i actually know enough to figure out muraoka hand
i'm so proud of myself, i read a few more kaiji chapter, they just finish the first 10m yen gamble
i'm gonna <a:Nessie:1164016962595209306> out
holy shit
nessie is such a stacked emote
<a:Nessie:1164016962595209306>
oooo it's pretty! i do think i prefer darker like that <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
the 4 cost in this set feel v weak right now <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
akali just jump around and tickle everyone
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
a little scary though
it is pbe after all, so might aswell try out those change
i guess that's fair
it just make normal gameplay more and more cbt and it doesn't even look like it's reducing the amount of 3* <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
i feel like keep nerfing bag size is not the way
<a:NAHHH:1120795949099384963>
is it bait
like how does that even happen <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
yeah that one <a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
nah but i saw the one i think you're talking about
who are these people
<a:AINTNOWAY:1045743052418994206>
<a:GAMBAADDICT:1088508671144759358>
they're betting 100 dollar on every match
oh shit they're gambling on it
the only ones who are very ashamed all the time for some reason <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
it's definitely another change that would make negator very easy to find
i mean probably right?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:poggfrenn:1087713199215886377>
456 last game, 678 this game
emily toast boxbox are q together and they keep holding hands
thank god 4 cost tf is <:barack:1154719413682057306>
tf is so cool <:BatChest:891596027767975986>
won't end faster than the last one
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
you think it's a good thing to have headliner rate limited like that?
oh yeah i see
<:worrythinkhard:1171653124931469333>
old 7 is 15% 4 cost 1% 5 cost
new 8 is 18% 4 cost 3% 5 cost
no i mean
for 4/5 cost?
is new lv8 better than old lv7?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> hmmm i see
it might not even be a real issue tho
probably the small change to headliner to make it more flexible is to blame
so it's definitely not chosen fault
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i see
but being able to see headliner when you already see one is prob a big diff for this
i mean more like if during chosen/debonair if it felt a lot easier to hit 3* 4 or 5 cost
oh hmmm i see
was chosen like this too
and people still hit somehow
4 cost is 10 and 5 is 9?
how much is it at rn
they just keep reducing the pool size <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
isn't it too easy? can't they make it so headliner take into acc how many are left in the pool?
is it just doomed? like i know it feels easier to hit 3* 4 or 5 cost cause pbe lobby but
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
what's up with these champ pool changes
he's such a junkie
i kinda love muraoka ngl
just audience? <:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
maybe he'll call out the cheating? but like probably not
i don't really get what is his deal, he seems important
the 10 year old mental
yeah, kazuya <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i'll have to backread now tho to check the hands and understand it more properly
<:5head:580172701533077515>
if that come up in kaiji i'll feel so smart
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
it's crazy, it's truly all just luck and instinct
a lot of 7 pair hands wouldn't qualify for ryanpeikou so that's prob not what she was talking about
i thought it was just ryanpeikou and now i understand it but
wait no, that's just some niche rule right? nvm
my previous tutorial just talk about 7 pair
oh shit
icic
?
in normal mahjong, both han and fu generate point which is what matter
so like, han is only the core of the game in 17 steps
oh i see <a:Noted:914214211138244688>
but what is it useful for
no i mean i get that
the han i've learned i don't even think i can make up 5 yet <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
yeah i probably need to watch further then <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
what even is the point of fu in normal mahjong?
i guess it could matter for pinfu but pinfu with riichi is only 2, i don't think you can get anymore han with pinfu so you're fucked
does fu matter at all? or only han
well i'm still watching the videos though
oh damn that's kinda hard
and i went uhhhh
i also like the girl i was watching before for the very basics, she just went over scoring by like it doesn't really matter, as long as you win it's fine unless you're playing for gambling
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
they're like if your hand was closed this would've won! that's really bad
this guy i'm watching really hates opening up their hand
that makes sense, so you really do only need the basics + maybe know some scoring to know the stakes
all you can do is discard and win by ron
can you kong into a quadruplet in 17 steps? i'm guessing no, right?
i really care about scoring tho to know the stakes
this is the second video out of 22 on scoring
oh shit
it's really interesting
that's actually insane, i'm interested in mahjong now
this shit must go crazy
holy shit in normal mahjong you can even have more dora?
i guess it makes sense that it wouldn't
damn okay half of these han don't matter huh
that's interesting
oh shit the uradora only matter during riichi?
okay <a:Noted:914214211138244688>
the 17 steps is auto riichi right?
i'm learning mahjong
okay so
actually doing all that for each other just like fuuko and andy
holy shit juiz and victor are a great couple
<:FeelsStrongMan:814965624659771442>
hello
on the mahjong tutorial i found
i fucked zamorak's shit up, now bandos <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
it's one of the 4 normie gods, saradomin zamorak armadyl and bandos
his name is bandos, yeah
took his shit
i fucked bandos up
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
wait is <:barack:1154719413682057306> copium? <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
umas should be the vessels of rules
yeah that's weird, shouldn't it be the opposite?
oh <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
isn't it always <:joever:1122752199752163419>
that is a weird ass rule
mortdog already on it <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i don't really understand how unback even works
it's kinda cute that she counts even andy in
she probably doesn't even know about unhealthy tho <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
kinda fucked up, fuuko
she's counting unruin but not unhealthy
oh damn
that's kinda crazy, i would assume he's just a rando brainwashed that god added in
did she say she wanted to save ruin too?
we're missing top, juiz, tatiana, bunny girl, unchaste girl, unburn, and maybe unhealthy/unruin
there was a really cool page with a roundtable with 25 seats
aw man i should've bookmarked it
she's one of the only one we know very little about i think
i want juiz
now it's anyones game
i mean at this point everyone already complete their own promise
i think that's just knotting
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i mean i guess that does make sense, like i think he cut his own legs for the artifact last time
something something so he doesn't forget?
for the edgyness of it?
so like last loop he just keep his own unhealing wound like
oh really?
like didn't rip cut open sean's stomach past loop?
i think there's a loophole tho
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
let's fucking go latla <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
i think udul is the only manga where i see some shit like that i am genuinely happy for them
<:5head:580172701533077515>
holy shit
wait is it a 3 way wedding?
that's rip and latla too right
like where did a wedding come from all of a sudden <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
no i mean
yeah?
<:peepoCute:1103527329927540736>
where did this come from
holy shit
sure <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
wait it happen again? how common are these leak?
oh that make sense
was there any other morello user than kaisa in 9?
was already midnight
i went to <:bejj:1067071810853679194>, pbe open real late for me
soju special
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
LMFAO
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
the sax is so hype
jazz sounds so nice tho
to try stand united on my first game
not the smartest idea
i did a game and tried jazz out
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
mortdog was talking about it as a good change tho, you don't have to sell your chosen to pivot
that's true
i mean ye
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
you only get 19/20 shop
it's kinda intended on a slight nerf of reroll
o yeah mort mentioned
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
stand united is a trait now
lulu was already toxic enough for me
i think that would make me go insane
more toxic lulu
that looks just like
jesus fucking christ <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
chosen ideally make pivot way more possible, not like i don't have fundamental to still learn tho
i think i don't mind flowchart tft too much cause i fucking suck, not being able to pivot on 8.5 after hero aug definitely lose some game for me for fun but there was still all the fundamental to learn so i didn't feel it that bad
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
most important skill
i was a beast at just getting lucky though
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> yeah
i didn't play 8, just the very end of 8.5
early set 9 had some issues but it wasn't that bad idt
maybe not really, maybe only after they nerf eternal winter <a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
actually early legend was fine, i liked ornn
i didn't enjoy legend
i want set 10 already <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i barely play during 9.5 tho so i don't have any experience
tf enable like all line all the time basically, it sounds hard as fuck
yeah that makes sense, i think that's about what i already thought <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah i can imagine why actually, rolling down for 1 specific chosen while being offered 30 out and taking none
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
competitive player call it most flex tft has ever been
casual complain about it being too rng
yeah this is what i've been <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
<:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
well but then again, maybe it was only chill to get in because so many acc were bugged
last time it wasn't that bad tho, if your acc wasn't bugged it was chill to get in
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i mean tbh i'm not really expecting to be able to play
oh god <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
pbe in 4 hours?
i guess a lot of those, except the one in the very top, are also fucked
paid to be there, he's like teiai employee no?
i thought he was like
is he stuck in underground?
ootsuki is just <:sajj:1067071714518892584>
tonegawa is exiled
ichijo is probably dead
cause like he only got morally destroy by kaiji
well i mean, for tonegawa and ichijo sure, i was asking for ootsuki tho
yea that makes sense
is it like a prequel or a sequel?
that's fair actually
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i mean i guess it was entertaining to see him get shat on
but ootsuki?
tonegawa and ichijo don't surprise me
oh really?
i think i prefer the darker one for that
i do think it's pretty but it will <a:aworryFlashbang:897712369843716126> me when i'm using it as a phone wallpaper
:worrythinkhard:
yeah i do think move is some kind of special rule, something related to luna somehow
nothing too serious
like lose a few fingers
i think he'll kaiji it live
mort even put his life on the line, no balance b-patch
it sounds like a blast <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
this is like, hero augment but flex
it's actually so exciting, like while i logically realise the issue with hero augment, i think the fact that i didn't play chosen/debonair, i don't have the point of reference for it done better
how you pick the one is like chosen, but in term of effect it definitely feel more like hero augment
i think if anything, this is more like chosen + hero augment
if you pivot out of a comp, the whole song changes <a:pepeJam:802372441040355369>
it actually sounds soooo fun
like each trait will add certain instrument, so you'll have different combinations with different comp
the one i'm talking about is how the background music of the game will change depending what trait you have up
also that's not the gimmick i was talking about
what's debonair?
one trick will be like <a:pepeWJAM:1103393167908294776>
it sounds so fun actually
you did watch the thing far enough for the music gimmick right?
we do have some dark color scheme traits, the emo ones
oh yeah, i can see that
actually yea i think i'm underestimating how much fun factor can make up
i mean maybe not even tho
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
which i think i definitely count as
especially for like casual player
that's fair actually
oh yeah those are pretty skins
but i'm still excited <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i know that stuff can't carry the set and it'll blend in after a bit
and the music gimmick sounds sick too
i'm way more interested in this thematic than set 9
but just superficially
i mean probably
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
already on it
oh someone on reddit
4 poppy
2 twitch
5 kayn
4 thresh
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
<:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
hina akari
wait what do you think of
<:wokejj:1118547247567745164>
author is kinda cooking
taiki chii
kyo ayame
hina haruto?
akari ???
who do you think is her final match tho
yeah
that's fucked up
<:monka:969065665573027841>
oh god
oh
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
like how
like neither of them individually look insecure about it, which i kinda vibe with
the way i read it it does look more like it'll boost it further <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i mean yea, i think i agree
i hope the pair to hina won't be new guy
worse fate than hina
introduce to the story to suffer
yeah i really don't mind how these event in particular, i feel sorry for new girl tho
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i do think this kinda of stuff is interesting if it pushes taiki and chii relationship further <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
honestly the only thing that would turn me off from blue box is if whatever happen around taiki and chii make them breakoff
they also did a pretty good job of making andy sacrifice feel justified, even helping the union for 1 minute weaken him enough for another rule to get out
yeah true
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
LMFAO i love chinatsu
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
yeah i think that's reasonable, it does make the future more interesting
they're perfect for each other
she actually grew to be just as Unhinged as andy
i fucking love that from her
that udul chapter was pretty good, i didn't think fuuko would get out like that tho
she's too cute
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966> gina
i'm unironically just
i thought it was a week from now, not this tuesday
oh holy shit
tho if we're going to have a 1 on 1 matching skill, juiz is still not around
cause it kinda match with juiz
do you really think it's fair? the armor really make me think it was justice
okay i'm getting a little bored from the <a:peepoTalk:989369389281329223>
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i'm really superficial too, coming back to skins is cool for me
i do really like the music stuff
okay i'm hype for this set! it looks my jam
and i guess they're adding it to tft now
yeah, they added it to league a while back
it doesn't really matter tbh
they just added a new rank to league to smooth out player curve
emerald <a:BatChesting:903461076614656091>
jhin shieldbreak
paganini? <a:BatChesting:903461076614656091>
that will be fun to play
the music things
oh shit this is really cool
i do like that
chosen's back <:wokejj:1118547247567745164>
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i stop halfway for set 10 reveal
i'll continue reading in a bit
a lot of it is through vaccuum i guess? he needs good timing actually
jesus fuck andy <a:GIGACHAD:999060597247320095>
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
the most politically correct person ever born
the negator for that guy is just
that luck would be a master rule, i think
that makes sense
ain't no way the sister isn't religion
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
so it's probably 2 related rules, yeah
it's not like they're an uma that took a person up or smth
as far as we know, even tho they have human form they're just uma right?
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
yeah they look kinda sick, i like it
so we have 7/10 named already <a:Noted:914214211138244688>
what were the other ones unruin said?
and then we have meaning and
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
those are prob all master rule right?
her 5 example were sex, language, race, death and sick
and the anime is at the part where juiz explain the uma
i watched the latest episode
miyoshi and the other guy made it clear they didn't think it was <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
is this a teiai one too tho?
<:PauseChamp:968665224435609640>
maybe it's fine
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
hmm
oh ok
i think i will <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i'm getting more and more the gist of it tho, just finished the first match
yeah i get that but i don't know how to recognise what is paper and what is rock <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
but i dunno if that's enough
i mean i kinda know some stuff from context, i get the gist
i don't know what the fuck is going on
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
should i watch some mahjong tutorials
real talk though
he feels like his life has no purpose because he does nothing, gambling hypes him up so that he can do... nothing after
his thought process is so insidious, now that he has the opportunity to make money gambling, he jump to it so he doesn't have to do anything
kaiji is actually <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
and that was the one that looked the most fun
i like, looked through all the manga in my plan to read
i did end up starting p3 already <:ohnobirb:948935560091807744>
sheeesh
that's pretty cool
i should get back into learning japanese
oh that's sick
i should read that
i have the first few volume of oyasumi punpun
like physical?
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
wdym real manga
i wonder how fast the meta would degen
they should do like some competition with only old set
yeah i think so, and then pendulum after
wasn't it synchro -> xyz tho?
i think it's kinda funny how they just make the condition more and more liberal for special summon
the knowledge wall to play a random match is way too high
is crazy
but the way it's played nowadays competitively vs the way we used to play when i played it
i mean like physical one
yugioh is the one i have most background on
i think out of the 3, i would probably play mtg? maybe?
or just like a whole different one
is the one you talked about the physical version of the mobile one?
i wonder what's up with that
it didn't look too bad actually, it kinda looked like that one valve card game
they were paying all tft and hearthstone streamer to pay it for a bit
i thought the marvel tcg was the mobile one
that's interesting
are the anime one actually good card game?
oh i never heard of any of those
idk which one i would get into
really? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
mtg, pokemon and yugioh? those 3?
how many tcg are even like alive enough to have local scene
not the <a:despairgamba:1114542929625755718>
i played some hearthstone at most
but i've always wanted to get into some physical tcg, it sounds like a blast
i know very little about mtg, i know like the basic rules
what's the name? <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
oh really? that sounds sick
like, not yugioh where the card game is how society is run, that's fine, but like
i remember someone talking about how they wish there were legit card game show too
is it just doomed
is there even any gaming manga that is good about that
and somehow the lone wolf come out on top
like a ton of clan sharing info and minmaxing
lmfao true <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that's what's fun about competitive game
but like nah just get lucky with a combination and become the best
the actual theorycrafting and grind to improve
it completely miss all the feature people actually play competitive game for enjoy
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
maybe because i care about game too much
yeah that annoys me waaaay too much
i'm probably too picky on my game manga
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh ok
it's too good
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i actually can't wait
that's a pretty good design if they do, the hair is already split in 2 color
they look fucking pissed
kinda look like anno actually
he's a pretty boy now
at that one guy that looked like andy from top down
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
i was just
oh true! i didn't catch that, that's really fucking good
i forgot i can't read japanese
oh
i mean then i'm down
oh it's a page?
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
idk if i wanna be spoiled then
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i guess it's near next chapter, it release alongside everything else right? on sunday?
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
wait there's udul leaks?
that's what i'm saying
fuck yeah!
specifically
just to spite them
you should be confident and love yourself
Unfair, even
that's unfair
why are these kinda guy the one who get to have confidence
i mean that's what i'm saying
some shit i say would definitely bluescreen him
you know, i could break him
he doesn't deserve that confidence but i? i do
we should aspire to be more like him, honestly
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
he would say something like i can fix you
do you think if we kept talking
fuck him up chrom
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
but it's more of a i'm sad cause my heart got broken a lot of times misgynistic
i mean yea
i don't think that comment was necessarily misogynistic tho
i wish i had that confidence
i'm this you're wrong what the fuck?
just say you don't get it man like what
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
and they went that's contradictory
so i just clarify, i'm a lesbian asexual
i questioned them on it and i they said it was weird to make it about sex
and then they went on about how i shouldn't make my personality about my sexuality
and i'm like sorry i'm too much of a lesbian to think like that
i said like too many girls are too good and someone said not too good
i joined on a convo on my runescape clan, and they were kinda like doomer
the unwavering confidence of some cishet man is fucking insane
wondance annoyed me a lot recently so i let some chapter pile up, but author resolved the issue <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i had a few chapters to read of jojo and wondance
i finally catched up with all manga i'm currently reading <:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
keilopilled
i'll wait until it shows up in my tachiyomi to read
everytime i hear mokushiroku i go utena reference?
hell yeah
<:Dank:911882500350046258>
all i think about is that meme where the guy is at the car and he says cargo space? and the other guy says no, car go road
any time someone or i say this go hard or this go insane
i'll get to it eventually, my list isn't too long
<a:Noted:914214211138244688>
oh wow that looks pretty good
is that a manga or
i'll add it to the list though
good art is definitely not my priority i think, my top thing is character development <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
like it didn't even need to go that hard at that point
a lot of panel look like artist just wanted to flex
it's great
true
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
it's definitely easy to get lost though
it's probably the most planned ahead media i've read, the politics go insane
vlt is definitely my preferred out of the 2
second one mc is a blond, artezia rosan
the first one is an enter dating game one, mc is penelope eckhart, pink hair
i mean i'm not actively reading them tho, just up to date
oh god
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144> i didn't notice that
first one is on break, second one just came back
2 villainess one, villains are destined to die and villainess lives again
i am reading 2 manhwa which are based on novel <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
let me know if it's worth it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
what's that
have you started dandadan yet <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
alright, i'll do my best <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i swapped to english translation for part 2
<a:HoVLoading:755152253278617753>
and that's scary cause i'm stupid
oh no
<a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
cause i was interested on like more gambling gamble
<a:Noted:914214211138244688> i see, that does make me excited for part 3
soooo pretty! <:Wow:759857863848886303>
is that a good or a bad thing
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
huh i see
it was paced incredibly
p2 felt turbo short actually
oh really?
i'll take another small break until i start p3 i think
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
poor boy
the trauma just keep piling up for him
<:monka:969065665573027841>
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
yeah
i actually started cackling out loud in the bus
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
kaiji losing all his money to pachinko at the very end was SO funny to me
got his ass saved by kaiji and still scams him of all he's got
endou is a fucking scumbag <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it forced him into taking the loan
i mean to a degree kaiji definitely lost against that final trick
it would've been impossible
even with all the luck on his side
the way it end, it really make it clear how sakazaki was never going to win
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
but it's truly just kaiji vs ichijou
i was thinking before at the start how they would make it interesting, kaiji vs pachinko
it's fucking unhinged <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
so i'm just gonna assume that's realistic
i don't know enough about buildings
yeah
he look down tremendous by the end
i really like how ichijo slowly went from pretty boy to more and more deranged
that was fucking wild
okay i finished part 2
i don't think he's realised quite yet that he's that different
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
not with that attitude
that's still better than dying
i mean even if it cause to no one ever trust the bog again
yeah true
probably something more
but that doesn't sound right
i'm at the 2nd trick still, the way it look right now is that it's just going to be peer pressure on ichijou to turn off the sensor
but yeah nevermind, it definitely look like they left enough clues
i think i just didn't notice cause i didn't even know what it is
oh okay, they definitely did then
i don't remember seeing the tools
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
did they show that?
so maybe that's enough
cause like author did show a lot of times ichijou and the other guy working on the machine
oh okay
but like maybe i was wrong, maybe it's fine
while the past tricks you could reasonably see a way to figure it out before he say it
i mean more on the reader side, like that was one trick that i kinda went cool but it was impossible to guess that before
eh hmmm i guess it's fine actually
that was pretty smart, but i think it was a little out of left field
he already reveal the first trick, with tampering with the tools
yeah true, it's been going great
he'd just gamble more
yeah, there's no way there's no more gambling down there
having to do manual work with that
can you imagine if he goes back underground with those fingernail
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
yeah, the amount he's hardened at this point is crazy
you think that's more painful than getting his finger cut off
jesus fucking christ
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
he might be 120
but don't get your hopes up
i'll try once i get there
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
i wanna get lv99 cooking
all my raw fish
don't mind me
maybe only beg god for luck <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
they're kinda unmatchable then tho, kaiji is not the type who would beg to another person in spite of how he feel like that
yeah i could see that
oh hmmm i see
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i'm more asking if hyodo recognise it at this point
yea that's true for sure
you think hyodo would take him under teiai?
yeah
and demoralise kaiji a bit
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
i think all he's done for now is
oh okay
my guy is down horrendous
kaiji just now went to meet endou
pretty boy?
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:FeelsStrongMan:1015766690568618066>
it's actually pretty impressive that they let him grow this much during the time skip
and taiyo full blooming looks cool
i'm a sucker for like, powerup, new form, new transformation
the end of this arc was pretty nice
oh yeah i'm up to date on that
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
wait do you think if they kill her everyone will be genderless?
oh god the forcefem powers
gonna hit them with the sex punch
i wonder how that will go
yea maybe
oh hmmm
i lowkey think they might not
do you think they'll end up using remember?
<:life:1001518241610485781>
andy and fuuko make a fucking great duo of leader
can you imagine nico reaction if he saw that
way less threatning for new members though
could've just been captured before like phase 2 or smth
maybe that's why he's so small now, ran out of power with last loop
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
oh shit true
he kinda looks like it too
oh move probably powers ark, huh
but damn
we don't need clothy
yeah the cast is fucking turbo stacked at this point
i miss clothy <:Sadge:749389233667702834>
i mean not even clothy
but it did surprise me too, my guy was just chilling and having beef with andy <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
i didn't even realise it at first, they did plant the seed earlier about move having their own motive
like less than 2 per month on avg
that would certainly make sense, the amount of rule that get added from just completing quests is kinda small
i mean yea
hmmm
maybe it doesn't really matter tho
then what happen to juiz during early on her loop before uma justice?
but if justice isn't
like death is a master rule so undead always there
can a negator work before their rule is introduced?
i'm just saying more like
hmmm i see, prob the same with unfade maybe?
i mean yea but like <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
how would like unautumn work
are luck and justice right?
then surely some of the master rule
huh, is that so?
sick even got a phase 2
the 10 master rule the way they are now are also uma right
oh okay that makes sense
oh okay
and sun... did the negators? is that how it goes?
luna made the artefacts to help human
luna bet on human, sun bet on uma
it's like, human vs uma
okay wait remind me how it went
huh ok
i thought he just voiced them out
apocalypse makes them up?
wait is union quests from luna actually?
or like, the other way around
that's why the table is dark
they probably get quests from luna huh
oh shit
and it roll over, somehow
union seat is based on points from quests
i wonder if they have similar rules to the union
that interesting tho
hell yea
6 is motorbikes
2 is probably religion
oh okay, that would be my guess
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
i can't see him
what seat is sick even
i can't wait to see more of their design
oh yeah true
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
it's ion
it was really great
okay i read it
<a:peepoTrip:755692813320060959>
i'll read in a bit
last week
<:nothing:990283279032803338> undead unluck
<:nothing:990283279032803338> <:thoughtbubble:990282637270716476> 
<:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
i've been like
oh shit
yea, doesn't seem willing to do anything new either
weee <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<a:despairgamba:1114542929625755718>
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
i don't think he'd betray kaiji at this point, but i don't think he's making it
but right now he just looks turbo hopeless
i thought sakazaki would betray kaiji somehow
i got to the part where kaiji talks with sakazaki in the bathroom about potential tricks
wdym by first round <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
holy shit
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
let me try
i mean i don't mind waiting
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
if that's the case then the writing was on the walls already
well i guess
damn that is sudden
wtf
where do you read it?
it didn't show up in my source
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
the new chapter
<@483689649727078400> did it come out?
when they show that hyodo and tonegawa were the 2 who won the bog before
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
i went actually
yeah that was sooo good right?
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i feel like that's pretty rare
i'm actually really in shock about how good the pacing is
oh shit is this the only game for p2?
somehow
i lowkey think he'll get betrayed by the new bog guy
yeah, i think that makes him a really good protagonist
he didn't even get that much experience, like amount wise, in p1
i mean yeah i guess that's fair
true, nothing better than that <a:PU_PeepoChugsDrink:747989825239515273>
well i mean specifically during the first ceelo game
him basically going i need to find a casino that is scamming the players is very smart
but at this point it pick back up from the point it was before
i was a little disappointed from the very start of part 2, in some ways it felt like kaiji development had reset
same for during ceelo, i was expecting that the dice rolling out of the bowl coming into play somehow
during the e-card game, we had the 5 minute rule, and i was 100% sure it would come into play once tonegawa loses his watch
is the little hed herring rule
one thing i think i mention before i kinda like
tonegawa2 is kinda scary in that sense, during all of part 1 tonegawa never really get his hand dirty until the very end
yeah that makes sense
i thought it was going a little overboard like outright kicking him out but that is how he look like in the end
yeah that makes sense actually
instantly without the cheatcode he look like he had no experience actually playing the game
tonegawa1 in retrospect was kinda all talk no bite during the actual match
that's fucking 5000 iq
you should've prepared for when your rules are broken, instead of like making better rules
i think it was pretty smart too though, when tonegawa2 show up and say basically
i didn't think he'd go through with the promise of ruining that guy's life so hard
like holy shit
though, ceelo was soooo fucking good
yeah, he's learned about the bog now, interesting premise
gamblings one thing, he's addicted to beer and chicken now
i mean not even gambling
<a:GAMBAADDICT:1088508671144759358>
no self control
i feel bad for my guy
probably doctored dices tho <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but he hasn't explained to the dumb ones (me also) what he think it is
i'm after kaiji figure out something weird about the guy's rolls
oh yeah, i'm a little past that
same
<:life:1001518241610485781>
until i'm max
9 left
yay
yeah
i mean
that's a plus
no overtime culture though!
a few toxic bosses
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
but i draw the line at selling overprice beer
i was fine with putting people in game and making them kill each other
it actually really impress me, the pacing is really good even though it is in some way very slow
oh damn
better meal than i'm having damn
he really did
jesus fucking chirst
holy shit
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
he's about to spend half his paycheck on a beer too isn't he
my guy is down trodden
he actually really is <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i was ready to get into some games
the start really surprised me
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
just now
yeah actually
i only have 10 99s left
99 fletching
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<:farming:982716621338591232>
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but when you put it that way
i thought it was kinda cool that billy notice it
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
deserved 1st place on popularity poll
<:life:1001518241610485781>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
like the amount of growth the entire serie has, from an ecchi comedy start
yeah i think i'd agree
kaiji 2 is 134 chapter?
now i think i'm doing rosen garten -> more kaiji
<:life:1001518241610485781>
damn
it's definitely a 9 now
i think i agree with you, early on i'd give it a 7-8
insane
fuuko become suuuuch a great character
yeah
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
gravity must be another one
sex must be one
like if we know 2 at least
i feel like 10 master rules are too few actually
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i did make a note of that i think
yeah i remember that actually
ooooh okay
how did we knew pain and meaning? i forget
we knew sick and galaxy
like how do they have only 10 master rules in 100 loops?
i wanna know what they are and how they work
i hope they talk further about master rules
i also like how chikara and sean are buddies like top and chikara was before
but the fact she's just built like that <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
like rip
well, i knew it wasn't a negation ability, but i thought it was something she had to train a lot to achieve
yeah same
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
what the fuck did author eat to make this loop
yeah holy shit man, i can see why you give it a 9.5
aw man okay, i'm done now
have they
i mean maybe, people haven't been complaining about pain recently
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
what the fuck is he up to <:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
aw, only kinda
andy's back
OH SHIT YOU LIED <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
sick is kinda hot
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i mean i'm down
true actually
such a great page, everyone is here
wicked sick
sick
let's fucking go i guessed this one
i swear tho half the time i can't recognise nico without the eye bags
actually made me laugh out loud <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that one part where he goes like i'm not saying anything more and now i'll tell you more!
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
that was so fucking funny
apocalypse being comedy relief is great
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
having so many people around the table when it still has only like 4 seats is actually so cute
they can probably move around seat liberally right?
yeah i guess that's fair
on one of the first quests, fuuko say the ones beside her and gina could only be support
is that so?
but i'm guessing it is?
i guess it could be not a quest
everyone was fighting color uma
cause like
also do we know if union got a few more seats at this point <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it's so good what the fuck
same with picking the team to phil mission
<:life:1001518241610485781>
it's great to see, the union fuuko build is mature to a point where members can make choices like that that are better than fuuko's
yeah unironically
i just go <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
this is like smash bros when someone new gets confirmed
LATLAAAAAA
cause nico doesn't know about it
but like mostly fucked up for fuuko
yeah it's fucked up <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
it is a really interesting timeline
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> true
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
actually made me cackle
she'll butt heads but for the other person now
true, she's so funny, i wonder what's going to happen between the 2 when andy come back
fuuko character is just SO good after she died too, jesus fucking christ
yeah, the way everyone is evolving their power in a different way
literally wh <:OMEGALUL:1009060763706601512>
what the fuck
how the fuck is sean a character
yeah like
yeah it's soooo good, it's so nice
he's going to show up with like a haul of artifact
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
that's kinda surprising
getting close to up to date, so is andy not back yet?
i love chikara, i miss him
also fuck yeah, chikara time
yeah, it's just weird cause she's the one that we have no info on, i think
<a:HoVLoading:755152253278617753>
wait when is juiz born
yeah that's pretty fair, that's how everyone is getting stronger too
and gina is very entertaining
nico and ichico is a cute couple
yeah, i feel like they deserve it
i thiiiink i get it
oh <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i was like okay so there's going to be a few losses? <a:NervousSweat:765639934555324486>
i actually got legit scared with fuuko unluck on nico
i'm surprised god hasn't done anything yet
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
that one is SO fucked up
i don't get untell new power though
yeah, i'm starting the mission to save phil
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i don't get it, it was already pretty good before
it is actually SO good
i took a nap, i'm more calm now
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
this 101st loop is fucking insane
did they get a power up too
what happened with author
jesus fucking christ
i'll pick it back up in a bit
i have to do some college work, this is a good breaking point
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
i do prefer luna but i hope they manage to kill them both
yeah that panel was really great
but my mind immediately went to oh so it's author favorite character huh <:dogKek:1155341517637042196>
i guess it makes sense that fuuko would start with anno
okay i'm starting the 101st loop now
<a:NervousSweat:765639934555324486>
i wanna know how it works
she'll show back up next loop right?
weird ass power
actually crazy how much development a bunch of them got
holy
chikara is a fucking beast
<:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
akira's here
OH SHIT
i like luna more though
sun design is kinda cool
now victor just ask her for something and she went yea sure
the deal juiz made with her, she had to give up something
i mean like
luna is kind of a homie huh
i mean there's no way right <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
that's probably going to matter, right?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
where fuuko unluck bring magma that shouldn't exist
oh that one thing you talked about happened
yeah that makes sense
i kinda assume the previous loop kinda happen like you me predicted at first
i guess that makes sense actually
is that so?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
how did he use it to withdraw money
also damn, the atm card is plot relevant?
okay i'm reading that now
anno?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i guess shen died
not a lot of people were suffering
if all he cares about is people suffering
well i mean yea
surely not bored? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
you think god was like scared a little? or like bored?
i like when bullshit happens in story and the characters go that's bullshit
it was a great part for me
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh i remember a thought i had, it was sooooo turbo bullshit that messing with the seasons just happen to start ragnarok right?
yeah that's true
then i would imagine that power would stop working
if he lose faith on himself and loses his goal
idk if it's weaker in strength, but it also depends on his own goals
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah, i don't think you can do much more with unruin if it's a self targeting type
yeah
cause they've made it clear that negator are explicitly always external or internal type
eh probably not though?
like, if he makes a plan, he maybe could use his negator to make sure that plan isn't ruined
it could be more proactive, maybe
like, the reason he regenerate is so his dream isn't ruined, right?
ruin can be more abstract too though
like, at least not in the same way that andy negate death
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i don't think so
but i guess the easier answer is that he isn't
then like why the fuck is he only doing shit now
i was like wondering, if he's just like undead and has been looping all this time
also, i'm glad they're answering my question
billy stealing unruin is pretty sick
i'm just liveblogging me reading now <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oooooh that's sick
yeah that makes sense
so ruin is 3 rule at once? i was racking my brain really hard trying to figure out how unruin could do that shadow fuckery
it's a very narrow understanding of fair and it's already that strong
or something like that
his understanding could be like it's fair for each person power to work
and he negate that
no, i mean, his understanding of unfair is that it's fair for each person to only have one power
like his understanding of unfair is already pretty powerful
damn, billy can be insane op right?
but nah i really enjoyed it
cause it was all at once at close to the end
this part is really good too tho, i thought nico backstory and development would feel more rushed
oh ok
she's hotter i think <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
damn did they fuck with fuuko body
oh is this the best part of the loop?
that's some 5head fucking with someone
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i'm asking like what's the fucked up situation she got that
yeah
at this point he giving them these negator isn't about hindering them trying to kill him, it's just to fuck with people for his fun right
i wonder what ichico story will be
he also joined union before being a negator? that's kinda interesting to me
poor nico
yeah that's fucking insane
actual torture
but jesus christ, unforgettable is just a terrible power
i don't think the backstory is as fucked up as rip and latla
oh my god
probably nico?
oh
mostly because of the 2 in 1
i think this backstory is probably the most fucked up of them all <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
actually so fucked up
i'm actually really into how hopeless it is, i don't see it that often
oh damn i'm hype then
<:life:1001518241610485781>
what a sad ending to this loop
i'm just at the part where andy kills rip
yeah <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
nivea men for manly men
i'll share cat tax i promised earlier
did you write it down
<a:Noted:914214211138244688>
2 for 1 combo
nice
<a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:1147101420449976331>
LMFAO i don't even have to say it
revolutionary?
as if it's not literally the easiest and unchallenging path <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
they're like oh but i must suffer through this, it's a shame but it must be done like they're acting like they're working hard and doing a heroic sacrifice
you know, my biggest pet peeve recently is people who fucking jack off on their own suffering
that's kinda crazy
turns out that's also really tiring?
damn
but like if you do that sounds kinda sick no
realistically speaking
i mean yeah i don't think it's actually possible to say that and 100% mean it
but like if you are that direct idk man, live your best life yk
i get annoyed if people run around the point
kinda based
honestly
yeah
my guy is going aha! you see, those people just have bad media literacy because they never developed good media literacy! it's not their fault! i'm a genius for pointing that out
no
some people are just dumb <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
like what good does it do to go actually everyone who has a bad take is so sad and hurt :(
that's such a bad point too
<a:GIGACHAD:999060597247320095>  yeah
LMFAOOOOO
that reveal was so fucking good
yeah that's fucking nuts
i guess that's obvious, he's in under, he has to be a negator for the table
oh so he is a negator
both the following time it happen i'm like  <:DankReading:1118364427767525518> did i pick the wrong chapter
kinda funny how we see the same rip flashback like 3 times
it could be just a ,.. bossbaby moment from me tho
in a good way tho
reminded me a lot of makima going to hell
juiz going over to luna and making a deal with her
when you put it like that <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh that's true
because of the moon stuff?
<:Looking:1154847280529162260>
wait did they?
for a good opportunity
<:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
you think he's just like
but it does show how fucked up god is, like all that was on purpose
that was like literally everyone's backstory at that point <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i thought it was a little funny when chikara went i killed my parents and fuuko was like <a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
yeah true actually
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
.
before max, 99 all
this is my last one of these
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
weird my runescape is dying
test
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
me too
i'm interested in the god stuff
yeah that's true
god is such a petty bitch
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh yea that's true too
i forget that the pen is an artifact, for a sec i thought the drawing stuff was part of his actual power
oh wait i guess i see what you mean
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> really?
kinda cute how all the wiki take shit extremely literally
i think it's funny, i took a peek around the wiki and they have him set as definitive alive
do you think akira is actually around still
wicked sick
okay that's sick
ooooooooh
and then the thematic culmination with anno un of how andy change inside the book
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
the part where the narrator goes he won't be able to draw anymore double pages after this and you realise the entire chapter was drawn in doubles
oh wow this last chapter of autumn arc kinda slaps
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
is he actually blind? i thought he was lying about that
wait what the fuck
yeah that's pretty nice <:life:1001518241610485781>
it is really cute though
that one i think she was unconscious or like barely so after being filled with apocalypse memories
the was a little bit of that early on but also some good bits
the shit i hate about most ecchi comedy i've seen is that the punchline is almost always haha sexual assault
yeah absolutely
which i'm fine with
like there's comedy involving sexual themes, but at this point it's p much entirely between 2 consenting peeps
at the point on how fuuko and andy is, i wouldn't even put it as ecchi comedy as like, stereotypically ecchi comedy
but it's been pretty chill since then
i was going to say, at the very beginning i think there was some ecchi comedy which was like eh i could do without
yeah, then i kinda see it
oh okay
this is pretty great
i'll say though, the way you say, i thought first ~60 chapter would be a lot worse
and they don't really take long here either
how fast the fights end
it was one of my favorite thing on chainsaw man
yeah i definitely enjoy that
oh okay
he goes <a:Panda_thanos:598682299940470785>
no, not yet, i'm just after anno dies
to me, it definitely read like anno doing his best to defy fate as he could
anno's dead tho
i guess i'm not done with the arc yet
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i wanna see more of juiz, she's sick
and like yea she was lying to a degree then
i went back to a chapter near that and she went last rule is ragnarok, i think that means the end
i mean yeah that's fair
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
then wtf was juiz on
but like that makes sense
weird that death and sex ain't one of them tho
that makes sense
oooh wait i see
though galaxy was pretty important, for 99
i'm guessing they're like each 10th or each x1st
oh wow
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i see
so i kinda thought earlier loop would have less rules before ragnarok
for some reason i retroactively made the connection between 100 rules before ragnarok = 100 loop
oh hmm i see
but by anno rewriting the story and removing the 3 arcs and turning it into 101 volumes, it symbolise his change in fate turning it into 101 loop
if the intended number of loop was way higher
oh you know what would work for me actually
the weird thing is that they mention that there was 3 arc anno didn't write
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i mean i guess that makes sense, that would be my first guess
but i can't tell for what
i also feel like the fact that the you and me manga have 101 volume is some type of foreshadowing
i kinda wanna see these fucked up earth with barely any rules
undead is kind of the weird one? but i guess not really, he doesn't have to worry about dying before death exists
there will be a time period in there where they negate a thing of which their uma hasn't been born yet
so like if both of them loop to the beginning of a new earth
and also why anno un was certain that rip wouldn't be able to use the ark, he wouldn't be able to leave latla behind
the way i interpret that is that ark is 1 person only? that's why only juiz and victor looped
so he probably just gigachad survived ragnarok
probably nothing right? they implied victor manage to stay around even though he wasn't on the ark? i think?
i wonder wtf happens to unburn if you kill uma burn
it is cool how thought through it is though
like you wake up and there's stars now and you go what fuck lil bro and they talk to you in another language
can you imagine being a negator? like one of the ones that don't know all the bullshit?
yeah that's actually insane, right?
and the reward of unifying language immediately come with a bitter scene of shen losing his language and part of his culture
the 99th punishment, uma galaxy, even tho you can see a bad thing that comes from it, it also comes with a lot of beauty
and like, how the rewards and punishments from apocalypse being kinda ???
how a lot of negator act purely based on user and target intention
like instead of trying to gaslight the reader into it all makes perfect scientific logical sense, they kinda lean on stuff not being perfect
you know, one thing that i do really like about the manga is how it is fine with stuff being unclear and a little messy
that's weird, i guess i never thought about it through, if you kill an uma, it would make sense that the concept would be deleted
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
like it is for us but not for you
she goes oh yeah! that's weird but like no it's not
it does make fuuko reaction a little weird
i wonder, probably all artefacts come from there, right?
or else they wouldn't know what to call em
like so meteorites still exist before uma galaxy right? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
well actually, it's still a little weird
oh also yeah the explanation for the meteorites are pretty great
for a second i thought they were all immortal for some reason
poor girl <:life:1001518241610485781>
that was a pretty sick power huh <:life:1001518241610485781>
i made me pay attention to it during unchange arc
like outta nowhere
heavens door
i did find it a little weird that autumn was just
yeah i see
oh shit
i only got the easy ones
that's pretty sick
ooooh i see <a:Noted:914214211138244688>
i did notice with phil tho
i don't get fuuko then
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
on the fight with rip earlier, she immedialy beheaded andy, no hesitation
slowly embody Unhinged
i actually love that development of fuuko
true
that's pretty sick
they actively evolve according to their own understanding of it
i'm really enjoying how malleable the powers are
yeah this arc is pretty good
juiz is a pretty interesting character, and she's hot too
like, all the 100 times even
so that part didn't surprise me, the fact that juiz was the one looping by herself did
i did get myself spoiled on the loops being a thing
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the manga is lore important
i can't fucking believe
i'm starting the autumn fight (for real this time)
cause i was reading on the way from college city
oh i went pretty far
that's pretty great
they set up that rip's negation is completely about intent, and then he use that further
oh shit, and then the next twist
yeah that was kinda sick
i mean no matter how optimistic you are that's still a very low amount of time since death exist <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah that's fair
well, that's if they fail every time
but i didn't catch the timespan
i read death was an added rule
wait is that what they said?
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
where the fuck were the comets coming from
galaxy wasn't a thing before
wait i just realised
she's actually hidden insane
now fuuko can be just as unhinged
that's pretty good
oh, they found a straightman, unmove
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
yeah that was pretty good <:life:1001518241610485781>
but you can definitely see he's extremely capable even with the limiter, being able to deduce a lot about other's abilities by himself
like, a worse manga would make andy a completely different character with and without the limiter, maybe with he'd be completely braindead and only there for pushing ecchi forward, but without he become <:BatChest:891596027767975986>
i think the reason why i'm fine with the ecchi comedy is because of that, the character actually feel like character which have ecchi comedy around them, instead of just vessel for ecchi
there's a lot to like, the main duo feel pretty well written too
the one where gina is introduced
it had very little ecchi comedy, good if a little heavy handed foreshadowing and great world building
maybe it gets worse but like, chapter 5 was really good i think
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh i see
i think it's entertaining how down unluck is like, p much off the gate
idk if my standard are low for ecchi comedy because i've never really read any, but i don't mind this too much
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i see
i read the one shot first, by accident, and it had a few bits that the actual first chapter didn't which were pretty funny
very entertaining
really strong start imo
yeah started a bit ago, i'm up to chapter 9
runescape reddit is built different
you know more about it than me
oh shit <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
<:wholetcook:1151659795531710534>
and k manga is blocked in brazil
cool, so after chapter 68 they're only doing the simulpub through k manga
inina and coustas
that's more like
okay cmon
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and she often really is thinking about fucked up shit instead of being a kid
some small writing choices, like during richeunie arc where she goes if i can save the golden people, maybe i can save my mom does so much to fix that
that was my initial issue with coco, we never saw her worrying about her mother, we only heard that she did from other people
and actually show don't tell us that
but the author made it really believable by giving her a fuck ton to think about
like, unearned empty head, doesn't get the hint from others
the way she act would get me annoyed usually
actually insane
during this arc
coco character writing just went up like 200%
coco ibuprofen
she's cooking, cherry
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
about tetia not getting development
you also lied to me
and that slapped harder than any other coco ever did
2 panels of brimhat coco
we had like
it's hard to compete
brimhats just slap so much harder
but god damn it
of pointed hats being what they are
i think i kinda get why the symbolism
ngl i don't like his drip
are you a quifrey hater
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
it's just homestuck again
oh shit
if he just look like a random guy
can you imagine
but he probably looks like quifrey
i don't think i care
the cops are definitely the closest we have to villains
like for sure
that guy's fucked in the head
wiki says it's easthies
esthetie or w/e it is you spell it
the unhinged ones right now are from the magic security team or w/e they're called
but will take a bit probably
i can add it to the list if you want
there's definitely unhinged people here but there's no easy answer
most of the time, the author really want you to think the issue is extremely complicated but in reality it's extremely straightforward and one of the sides is unhinged
is actually grey
one of the first manga i ever read where the grey issue
this might be like
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
nah they're definitely planting redemption seeds for inina
if whatsapp exist in witch hat atelier, coco reading phone
quifrey: You should tell me what's wrong
tartar: i NEED cock
agethe: i NEED cock
it's like
my girl is down down bad
and he weren't as much in love as agethe is with coco
i've read romance manga where the entire series was lynch pin on how mc felt about his girlfriend
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
and like the rest wasn't bad already
and also way better
it's like, different to the core in a lot of ways from previous arcs
it isn't just me right
did she have a secret anime powerup
did she like have a really good vacation before this arc
be honest
but like actually tho
i only remember it start with a z and there's an o in there
it's not zeno
it's the province they're at
like what
but you can't tweet out lore
and i was like okay this is pretty
and it had hashtags like zeno lore
i saw some of her art from twitter
author is girl?
to a point where it's so obvious i don't even know why they're not saying it <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
it's like
but they didn't even say it out loud
it was very clear implicitly
so based
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
they're like we were really close.... closest even.......
also why is the author so scared of just saying they're lovers
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
ghostwritten by aka akasaka
but i'll write them out later, i'm almost done
i also have some like, real story thoughts <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
poor guy
you have a crush in the most lesbian girl i've ever met
man it must suck to be tartar
some other witch hat atelier thoughts:
act 1 is extraordinary but the rest is definitely a lot weaker
really interesting, really weird game
yeah, i think it's definitely something that inscryption was pretty unique in its way to portray
i mean bittersweet, so the emotion are both
both?
kinda bittersweet
it was the unveiling of how little the mechanics of the game actually mattered and in the end, it was just two people having fun playing
well it isn't like, sadness
that's fair actually
you need like cooldown time?
the manga probably won't get to a 10
i care about endings a lot
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
it'll depend on how well it ends
what the fuck did the author cook
like holy
this arc is a strong 9 tho
riche arc an 8
i think before this arc i'd give witch hat atelier a pretty strong 7
also homestuck
great panel 2
great panel 1
it's actually really great <:letcook:1093482053879742474>
damn what the fuck did author eat for this silver night festival
hopeless
you look so...
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
please, just a few more rounds
your deck starts to thin out, i sense the end approaching
you enter the fight expecting one final bossfight, but you leave it as a one final goodbye to a friend
while the world are you disappears, the knowledge that the very last thing to disappear is leshy himself
you just keep playing, setting down meaningless cards, beating up his meaningless cards, dealing points of damage that don't amount to anything
i don't know why that exact moment meant so much to me
we don't need to keep score
he reaches out for you no matter, let's just keep playing
the balance, the thing that keeps score, is deleted
you deal the last point of damage and
you play normally for a bit, and you probably win kinda quick after learning all the tricks
he deals you your cards, and you start playing
the game is being destroyed at this point, you get ready for your final fight with him, the final boss before he's completely deleted
the atmosphere of the first act is really strong, but at this point you're kinda used to it, it's almost comforting going back to where act 1 happened
back then he was really scary
right in the middle of the final act, you meet again the first person you met in the game, leshy
thinking about the end of inscryption
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
i don't think i'm good at that actually
sure?
well, it's hopeless now
so close
fuck
i already unlock everything
why would i count higher
sounds good
i stopped counting after 18
i was born in 2001 you can do the math
idk
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
idk why i thought you were like 21
fischl would go
fischl would not say that
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
<:letcook:1093482053879742474>
chill
2005
10 years ago was like
stop gaslighting me
nah i don't believe it
i thought you were like 20
i was going to say, ain't no way scratch existed 10+ year ago
okay i believe it then
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
you're 17?
ain't no fucking way
how old are you again
neopets?
like there's someone who likes the parts of you that you're scared to face
are the same character trait that made me like her
isn't it nice that like, the reflection you saw of yourself on agethe made you dislike her
B.
is that accurate
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i'll say it in ugly words then
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
this?
do it
you said you can read minds
word my thought pelase
okay go for it
idk how to word it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that's a little deep, i was going to say god women can't do anything but i went to google it to see if that was the actual meme quote and this is what showed up
what's wrong with a girl who's a little mean
because she was mean?
and that's pretty cool
the characters end up becoming who they are through that
but this one is very willing to let their character face and work on those flaws, and it works really well
it's like their only gimmick
and they're too scared to let the character work that flaw out, cause they don't have anything else
i feel like a lot of manga give their character a flaw
can't say i don't enjoy her development though, it's really good
so when i realised she wasn't being just mean, she was a tsundere, that's where i got disappointed
i'm just resident tsundere hater
i want to clarify tho, i didn't stop enjoying agethe because i stopped being attracted to the 12 year old
these one being on different pages was really good too
some examples
it's not only the sheer quality of it either, the composition and panelling is also consistently pretty great
it's also probably the first manga that i ever consistently admire the art
it feels like a different manga, it has way more purpose on its strokes, i think
lots of moving pieces, it's kinda nuts
i'm a div beast now
but they keep it on the lowkey
i like how author clearly has a hard on for brimhat coco design, and i can't blame em, it slaps
some early mistep in writing made me underestimate how planned ahead the arcs were, pretty good
the main 4 cast is pretty strong now actually, tetia is the least developed but i already really like her so i don't mind
i'm prob like halfway into the silver smth festival arc
her characterisation feels extremely natural and very interesting, worthy of being mc now
but a little before this arc and especially during this arc, it feels like the author took off the training weights
coco writing was very mid
and she really stole the spotlight of the main 4
i did enjoy the second test arc, it probably solidify riche as a really really great character to me
of witch hat
ooooh this arc is really fucking good
we just get more autist instead of having periods
yeah me
it's really pretty
if you both prefer the last one, that sounds good for me
it's between first and last for me
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
doesn't hurt to try right
i mean
<- she is doing crack cocaine for the experience
so i'm 1/5th of the way there
which is 104m xp
120 herblore is really really important
woah cool
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
arson
ancient <:wokejj:1118547247567745164>
or that i got 90 slayer and 90 summoning
it didn't announce the other 2 miniquest i did
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
this bot fucking sucks
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
or not i fucking guess
<:life:1001518241610485781>
until they release more ofc
next one is the last one
<a:BatChesting:903461076614656091>
<a:stripp:1157061089104777226>
<a:stripp:1157061089104777226>
i'm stripping him down
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
stole his gloves
sure it's RemoveBlockedUsers
cause most eggs feel that way but very little have the confidence? maybe? to spell it out in a such honest way the deeply contradictory feeling that it is to be like that
i think what makes that post good is how honest that person is
i was like this
good post
runecape have some good names
sick nasty with the snow
i'm a snowman beast now
then i hit 95 and a part of me was like why not
by 92 i was running out of will to live
i started at 87, aim for 95
to go for 99
it was probably a mistake
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
we found each other
a lil bit of both
and i found him
yeah
one and only
that makes it okay, no ?
which is kinda yuri if you think about it
i killed him multiple times
okay so
did you both like twitter search problematic to come and answer
<a:HUH:1129107980634312724>
am i problematic
i didn't
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
i don't think reading his diary is the rude part
so
and took his diary
i killed him
well
according to my research he was kinda of a bitch
yeah
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
yes LMFAO
do you know how much strength i had to have to answer with the real answer
and someone ask what is dragon day
and i sent in clan chat hell yeah today is dragon day
and today was the day they grow, so i went to check their health
it takes a week for them to grow
in runescape, you can have your own farm where you can grow your own animals, and you can grow your dragons
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
i'm done
<:life:1001518241610485781>
that's the last quest
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
i've been there
nothing below a2 is actually alive tho
i wish i lived on without that information
i hate that
??????????
isn't easier MA with 2s boss and t100 lbb like the only reason
why else would you stay in masters?
idk
LE is a fucking beast
they still have 2s MA
it's masters tet
okay they might be playing checkers instead of chess but do they know the rules of checkers?
??????????????
wait they don't have LE?
i have no faith in mihoyo
you're right
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
sp hn
i don't trust them to follow rules tho
i mean that makes sense
oooh a bookmark
so they aren't too fun to look at
shit like this
the textures are just uh
oh this is a sirin sfx
the new chibis too i assume
there is some other stuff in here like lots of new stage textures
like thanks mihoyo
you can pick between $100, 10p, or a pile of shit
what kinda box even is that
there's an AE SN 6S box?
she won't be in honkai 4
i assume these are related to the hua lobotomy
ChapterARK_Pictutorial

necromancy is so fun
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>

<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
and that one is a repeat
pogging out so hard rn
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
that's what i was looking for
<a:LFG:941559466590077008>
dainsleif
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>

like i can't complain cause that's sick
but i'm not here for that
i'm getting turbo lucky with the actual good drops
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
i'll have to figure out a better way to do this tho
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i think this is child veli/seele without a face
summer griseo
okay no textures yet

owo math 13 * 0,1449
??
owo math 13 * 0.1449
tf you mean
owo math 13 * 0.1449
glad i didn't go ultra unlucky on it
<:HandsUp:465017146955661312>
send help
the yellow is invention, brown is arch
this is my daily xp this month
and invention
of archeology
so fucking bored
i am
<a:Fire:700056721720082524>
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
i'll get 60m arch xp and then go to sleep
can i not?
but i'll need to touch 3s boss to get lite
since i'm playing honkai for a bit, i'll go for t1 on the 2s bosses
but i can just use the spreadsheet for that
oh i was going to ask for old MA ref for 3s hepha
wait
i still watch them
abyss they're all the same tho
yeah this is fun in MA
can you imagine
no thank god i don't care about abyss
and i'm like ???????????
and people used elf voice line timing to know when to start
where you waited like 20 seconds before starting
kasumi abyss
there was like the
and i went huh
and someone went oh yeah for this part i use sound to know what to do
like i remember i was discussing husk
you're more normal tho
most of the time i watch them muted
and weird timings
i'm like paying attention to damage thresholds
i still watch them as a honkai player when i do
i don't even care about abyss and i don't have an aponia but i'll watch what you're doing magery
and i went alright i'm down
and every abyss cycle ref start popping up on my sub box
i subbed to like 10 different ref channel
back when i cared
i loved watchign refs
and now she's back to pulling for skin
huh
i did that?
and now she's what
i had like a temporary effect on tet
i think it's funny how
yeah i think tet too
and it was fun
i look back at my messages
i miss my honkai days tho
and i'm not good at keeping things
i don't like to make promises
if i do leave tho i can p much guarantee it would be out of nowhere and silently
like i've been most active in many places before and of course it always ends
yeah it's been a while
2+ years is when i started playing honkai i think
maybe 2+ years is wrong
and it won't last forever
and i've been here for like 2+ years i think
i mean i've been thinking about it, this is the server i spent the most time in right?
because of the runescape bot in here
even if i do that though, you'll still know if i exist
sometimes i want to leave all the servers, i want to delete my acc and everything online to start again
sometimes i want to leave this discord server
you know
<:Shyggers:1113819313145659422>
do that
i checked though, i did indeed
i didn't realise that i did that
woah
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
that one is right i just don't like the answer
ok buddy
2k???
owo math 300 / 0.1449
wrong
that's
owo math 300 * 0.1449
if i'm becoming da vinky
maybe i should
i'm not really going for capping tho, i'll do that later
thank god
oh ok
<:ohnobirb:948935560091807744>
there's more?
wait after?
yeah the government
oh
the runescape government?
that's wild
oh shit does it really?
but i'll get there
which is to say, you get nothing for capping invention
so the 200m limit was like, completely insane
most skills had content up to like 40s-50s
and then people did
yeah no one is getting 99 lmfao
and even maxing a normal skill back when it released it didn't really give you anything cause the devs were like
it takes 13m xp to max a normal skill, everything above that is just for fun
runescape is an old ass game
well so here's the thing
so i'm 1/4th of the way of capping invention out
the max xp you can get on one skill is 200m?
did you know that in runescape
<a:peepoSTRONG:762078238213799936>
i did do that, so i guess i'm alright about it
okay then
oh but that is
110 archeology isn't good enough to be comemmorated
i guess i didn't
i wonder if i did something
yeah
you unlock a new level and your character goes i wonder how i could use that to murder
US invention
runescape invention is more like
do that
i did indeed
<:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
<:pauseCat:1064950487486582784>
i will pausecat in expectation
a 40m xp in invention message?
will there be
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i'm pogging so fucking hard
yeah kinda pog right?
<a:Clap:802373413716623391>
and that's a wrap
she's very pink
no clue buddy
still
this one is my favorite
i kinda love this art style
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
hare name on the files is FeatheredRabbit?
wait
i won't post them all then
sounds good <:okk:1058108494995263539>
they look like normal ones but darker
there's a lot of new? skill icon
nothing on the files, i'm afraid
assorted currencies
mahou card emblem probably
and this is them adding back in
or they removed
so the either update the tutorial from last time
yeah, these are new files tho
this one is named RpgQSpringFestival
new event is named MahouCard on the files
seele going <:Prayge:909232418463047690>
okay i'm wokejj
i'm <:bejj:1067071810853679194>
i'm not doing everything today
<a:chatting:877611584736874556>
i start extracting files
cool
it would fuck with genshin very hard tho
if we had an event in genshin and in like gsr at the same time and they meet each other
that would be cool
and then we roll for the next one
oh it's cause she's going to die
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
pyro archon
ummm
uhhh
it's gonna say i got a pet
ok
oh
she's going to spend the next 35 years in federal prison
yeah i fucked her up
did i do that?
that's true
i did do that
the datamining for that will be fun
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
when's cn patch?
i did do that
that's true
i'm down!!
whoa really?
i have DIY LY if anyone wants to play
<:LilBlush:679815015007780884>
<:HUH:1004782798277718077>
mihoyo calling you bitchless
since i already posted all the datamine from before
but it isn't that interesting
i did the thing
listen to it later
i mean
i do really enjoy it, i'm marking it so i can read it later <:okk:1058108494995263539>
the first and last seele suit this decade, better make it count
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
for like 5 years
and they've been working on this
that specialise on seele
there's like a small team at mihoyo
maybe we shouldn't be surprised
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
and a total of 3 people have seen it this year
some intern at mihoyo worked overtime to finish up DPe normal attack string
how mihoyo create cool animations for no one to see
it's a pet peeve of mine
that's actually pretty cool
that's fun
really?
do you even do those?
huh?
but that's honkai in 2023 you're playing
i mean yeah she's probably boring to play
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
actually no complaints from me
she's a pretty good release all things considered
is if they hard niche them, make them wt, or do what they did
in the next like 3 years
like lowkey, the only way they could ever do another phys psy
they did it well tho
yeah
probably not a  fair comparison tho
i think 9s HoT team beat whore score in v1 tho <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
idk if they bugfix the lightning resistance on it
maybe it's doomed
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
didn't HoT steal it in v1 tho
when the boss stop feeling like they just happen to be countered by certain valk, and they start feeling like mihoyo scientifically lab made the boss to require every little mechanic a valk has
if you make it too artificial, it fucks with the players
i've talked about before how i think there's real value in kinda hiding the shill
it feels so much worse when the score diff is that big
it just fucks so hard with community mental, idk how else to word it
but man <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
they prob make more money that way, if i were to guess
but they just package it in such bad ways
in terms of outcomes
objectively speaking it ain't that much of an issue their boss design for less competitive player
yeah like
just make a new weather, why fuck with the old one for fun
like cmon mihoyo
the one thing that actually tilt me to another universe was the SK change
actually does that even change anything <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
mihomo so kind
oh ok
like 3 bio mob as first wave
i just assume it's normal jizo but with hare weather
not really <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
hare still clearly easily top score
v1 hare weather was actually pretty fair
yeah it's kinda disgusting what they did honestly
stuff like this doesn't really matter if you can still retain with -400 score
if you're like a 1 1/2+ y/o player who hasn't been completely trolling your pull decision
but if you lower your standard, like from RL standard it will never really be that bad <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah me too
but everything else, in RL it doesn't even matter that much if there's no other great option
cause i think those 2 team everyone invested in for fun
is HoH or trio
to have a hard time
the only ones i can realistically think are even possible
in RL
i'm more just saying, sure it sucks without the valk, but is your lobby even realistically going to be 20/20 shill valk?
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
you got the one player in NA who rolled v2v
congrats
if you get 1 v2v player in your bracket in RL
but so what
sure anything not v2v sucks balls
like kosma
like if it's something like qua
but it depends
that's kinda fair i think
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
and i will
fund me a trip to EU
well
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> you think so?
or got really close, idr, in nirv
like, i clear sidestage once with CI dps and proper team <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
support is so much of the team power nowadays
and retain RL
and one random valk to take space
you can just run 2 good support
like every type of damage besides fire maybe
that's nice but to a degree i think that's just how honkai is nowadays
it was probably even better in v1
cause in v2, they nerfed it a good amount the cdmg int
interesting
also, was it v1 or v2?
maybe it's just cause GC whore is broken
cause i don't know if that's because of that mechanic in specific
i wonder tho, is that just because they're running a random dps with great support?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
do you mean the 100% crit?
wait wdym
but i'm so for it
that surprised me so hard
yeah actually
i can grab model to share, but idk how to mess with it, like render and stuff
i can do cn too, when 6.8 release
this is like a shopping mall
<@416445660443967491> let me know if you want anything from datamine <:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
<:OkaygeBusiness:945151371869560953>
i'll procrastinate another 2 day then
sheeesh thank you
the bi goblin
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
but some of it is so fucking funny
runescape has some genuinely pretty good lgbt representation
<a:PANIC:1069826466889605201>
i haven't finished backing everything up
@someone who plays the game
wait fuck when's the patch?
<@964806731471405086>
nahida feet?
what do you want?
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
for you, i can try
those are it <:okk:1058108494995263539>
using any fonts that are in honkai
if anyone wants to do stuff
<a:Monka:465018118608125953>
22gb
just the texture + sprite + mesh end up like
shit maybe more
i think it'll end up like aobut 30-40gb per patch ver
realistically i should only keep 2 version per client, the newest and one older
i guess i'll finish exporting, see how big it is
i also wonder if i care about keeping old versions
i wonder how though
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i should organise this
it looks pretty good, there's a demo available right now
<@309634550273933314> 
but people might
i don't wanna
should i do gsr/genshin stuff too?
idk already closed it
fine it's yours
weird
purple BR isn't here tho
and it's uncensored in live
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i literally have it
lemme check
for anyone to see
it 100% used to be there
huh that's so weird
maybe check collection?
wait it used to show up there
and blue skin wasn't
in NA, base and yellow skin was censored
i think we got a lot of the censor, but i remember finding it weird how like
<:Truege:1114141621022375997>
cause the censored ver isn't in NA
which show up as new here
that's one of the other ones
has a simple recolor skin
i think every old valk
either censored or not in NA client
censored stigs
these are all i think
which i assume have been censored too
there's also a bunch of stig
these they are in CN
but no they are different
i was like huh i did something wrong
like how all himeko skin are different in CN
oh damn now i realise a bunch more of stuff
you knew that?
it's censored in CN
<@309634550273933314> <@483689649727078400>
oh shit!
on future patch i'll be able to compare better
i'm comparing NA 6.7 file with CN 6.8 file
oh wait it might be innacurrate
6.8 files
that's really surprising
6.5k files removed
2.2k files added
than i thought there would be
files removed
there's waaaaaay more
oh damn
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
my downloads folder is now a mess
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
actually sound right
half an hour
uhhhhh
<a:Essayge:1084932331766304829>
maybe run it on my ssd actually
the best way to improve it would be buying a better hd <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
oh i'm hardcapped on hd usage tho
i think it's halfway done after about what, 20 mins? ~1 hour to run is very acceptable actually <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
wait my program isn't that inneficient
any degens? <a:ModCheck:1021871712339505232> are there a lot of 3d honkai porn?
i actually have no idea how many people are doing that already though
maybe i could get into the business of 3d honkai porn
but it shouldn't be too hard for me to extract character model, if anyone is interested in that
or artsy enough to work with model
right now i'm really only working with image cause i'm not smart enough to understand game code
this should easily work with non-image too, so i could run this to check models and stuff
let's see how long it takes <:Monkahmm:699392223049023528>
okay i started running it now, it's comparing about 57k files
oh shit i just thought of one
but for others,
i can think of a few optimisation i can do, one of them would be writing it in not-python
this shit is slow as hell
easily =/= quickly tho
so i can easily check every file added/removed every patch
okay i made a program now
thanks for the hard work, detective
i think this only works when they're the same, otherwise it'll say they're different
maincordpilled
actually braindead
python just does it
turns out
i went looking around for library to compare image when they're exactly the same
lmfao
:wallace:
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
griseo has had like 50 events
you say that
there's a lot of these, idr where they're from
these are kinda pretty
okay i figured out automating it
idfk
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
i have cunny.png
my beloved
that used to be given by that system before
like the AL and gold pin
i think the reward from playing you get
it was a weird abyss reward system
ooo i found entente shit
so open ended
do you have any requests?
didn't see anything on the files though
if you look it up
maybe
idk
the window on her forehead is pretty funny
pretty good
bye aster
griseo is drawer
cat is cat
the file names for these are really cute
there's more items if you want
that's pretty good tho
her face is still so funny to me
more rita offerings
what's this?
that's elf dudu phone texture
LMFAO
LMFAO the hua one
i had to unplug it
one was so hard
trying to extract this files
3 times
i actually crashed my pc
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
there you go
lowkey kinda ballin
damn the hair kinda nice
mei is the most complicated though
there's other characters too
where does the elixir go
well you say that
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
and see who builds the best mei
like everyone gets the same pieces
where's tet
this should be a mario party minigame
honestly
figure it out
does that help?
that's 4
only numbered
look they're not labeled
oh yeah maybe
only one
eyebrow
no
here's an eyebrow
there's so many cherry
lil stubby feet
oh these are the feet
she has no feet
they're only numbered though
i guess 5 is not that many
idk why
she has so many limbs
i think these are her arms
LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOO
her face is SO fucking funny
i can give you more
that's so fucking funny
LMFAO
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
true
<a:omegadance:899503970274394123>
kinda threatning honestly
there's a diy mei here
oh my god her hair really is really long
those are ingame keychains
all the ritas
what do you want?
oh there's tons of rita things
cause they can't keep a color scheme, like wolf and kasumi shield are just different <:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the elemental shield ones are so funny to me
these are from the new tutorials i think
oh shit this is cool
it go crack crack
no spine
but there's some that are just straight up mispelled as rouge
LMFAO everything in ER is named under rogue
they're under rpgrestaurant
i found it
damn pussy out
hare bobba?
pretty
kfc kiana
oh i have the actual stigs here
himeko lust
<@483689649727078400>
pwetty
back when it changed into cum cubes too
yeah it changed a while back tho
there you go
oh shit
highest quality typing <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
it's basically the same thing tho, to level up a weapon you use 3 shards instead of a cube
only honkai shard
no
i wanna find kosma
there's assets from the griseo event
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
there used to be this crazy thing called honkai cube
other than sakura wills
there was 5 other different type of mat
early honkai had a fucked up skill system
like bio and mech skill mats
i think it used to be divided into types too
intermediate skill mats
what abouty basic skill mats
you've heard of advanced skill mats
i'm p confident that's the highest quality there is
<@964806731471405086> higher quality
<:ohnofischl:1002738024406319144>
the new returnee event is newgoback
goback
the name for the returnee event in the files is
i can do that too
if you want stig
there prob is though, methinks
some of them have only 2 quality, some have a 3rd higher quality
i'll let you know if there's a higher quality one
<@964806731471405086>
right now it's all an unorganised mess tho, idk if i'll find it again <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
and there was a himeko lust event asset too
i know it exist cause i see this tho
the lust one isn't here yet, or it doesn't exist
these are all of them i have right now
i can look for like full art later
so i assumed it was from something after i quit
yeah it's in chronological order
fu hua pain
i think it's from the current event
this one is pretty too
ok gimme a sec then <:okk:1058108494995263539>
i can grab all emblem for you if you want
it's new i think
idk where it's from tho
there's this one which looks pretty nice
that's the dice event one i think
i'm already over halfway extracting tho
i'm still extracting
but i have this one
i don't think i got to it yet
lemme see
that's in the game or has been in the game
it's literally any asset or texture
but maybe eventually i could do that too
i'm not looking to mess with any 3d stuff right now
i can do my best to find it
if you have any request tho
or it'll get dmca'd
don't make it too big
yeah kinda
it also does genshin and gsr
that decrypt hi3 file
it's a modded asset studio
PE motorcycle?
what the fuck is this
the 7 sins according to mihoyo:
- envy
- pain
- gluttony
- greed
- lust

wendy envy is real
wait holy fuck
furry ai

dark crystal
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
happy second anniversary guys
mei cooking
any request?
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
very high quality RL
i might be making progress on honkai datamining
but also
<a:xdddanse:1090944080105713664>
including runescape
time to pick everything back up
i'm done with college semester
:inventing:
i'm a professor <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
<a:Aware:1021872319930564678>
two is enough, one for each hand!
but it surely wouldn't give me a third hammer, right?
ok cro made fun of me by giving me a second hammer before the torch
actual AI is more expensive and if it's too good, it'd be less funny
it's for funsies
it's supposed to generate random, most of the time nonsense stuff
it's not a sophisticated thing
i'm not
one model for each person
for each person
i'll make a bunch of models
yes
cause this is the same thing i said earlier <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
new though, i don't believe that
i mean good sure
there's an implementation of it
i'm doing it in python
i just know it's sorta simple and it's exists for a while now
idk like detailed how it works
look up markov chain
i don't think there's anything big about it that i haven't explained
what more do you wanna know about it
i'm working on it
that would be so unexpected and <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i really hope i get a scripture next
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
missing torch, boots, chestplate and book
torch gonna end up being the last item i get, just as i don't have to do the boss anymore
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
overall theres 9 items + pet, i have 5/9 and no torch yet
which makes the boss sooooo much easier
there's one item, the fyrtorch
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
when i get a level we go
runescape progress bot
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
won't complain
kinda turbo lucky
dying a virgin actually turbo chad
is it the optimally saddest way to die
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i don't get it
i've seen so much of it
i don't know the dying in a glue trap meme
why would you try it though
i mean note taken
jesus
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> so many levels
with keqing!
it's like my favorite game genshin impact!
<:BatChest:1021180786650648608>
you'd think having to cook all the supplies yourself would make it easy
weirdly hard skill to train as an iron <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<a:Cocking:1009511504405606481>
<:peepoSitBusiness:984923134706716752>
i'm glad you're enjoying it is all
aw sheeeesh, gamer astra
there's like 2-3, the rest is all HoT to 917
yeah sim battle has basically no more interesting strat
spicy even
steezy
honestly i'd say
no one offered and i'm scared if ask someone like baban
and check book status
can you log in to my honkai acc
<@309634550273933314> you're my friend right
the murderer was the cook
oh don't worry i found out who it was
<:farm:447329812831535104>
it sounds fun though
i've never played much of any mmo besides runescape, sorry
sheeeesh i think!
<:peepoSit:1016193458307862609>
i think i'm just going for 120 arch now
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> thank you
i need one more pls
what did i do
why are you so mean to me lately
<:crying:757445037402619974>
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
with your help
i keep forgetting these are a thing <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i'm just lazy
i should be max already on combat stats
<:rooWizard:799669084458319893>
and then just randomly a new quest namedrops runescape out of nowhere, it actually has a meaning in the universe <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it's kinda funny, the game is 20+ years old at this point
apparently runescape is like a plane of existance in the lore
i wish
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
is so fucking slow
god this skill
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> a level
so every time i get a level i can go
i bribed the mods to bring this bot here
my runescape progress
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
but i'll take it
it's a miniquest
that's a lotta level
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> i didn't realise
4 pets out of 28
4/28
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> a pet
<a:Aware:1018788549077782548>
5 left
making an actual decent rs3 collection log
new project i'm starting out
sheeeesh
and i go huh i guess i should've done that
every time someone reblogs something i posted they add like 35 tags
and i feel like such a boomer
i'm actually getting into tumblr right now
those are so useless <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
and when i got an item, it was the most useless one
went 3x the droprate for an item
funny
<:Clueless:996308692133761094>
from now on we're cruising
but that's the hardest quest in the game done
that shit was hard
that quest is where we kill mah actually
<:peepoBusiness:1002644854175715328>
i hope she shows up again, i liked her character
that's a panel that you'd think was photoshopped <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
me except i was crazy about part 1 too
god it's so good
and the first thing that shows up is asa chainsaw man autism
you look up asa chainsaw man
i'd tear my every organ for her
and i love her
she sucks so much
such a failure of a girl, the femcel to rule them all
pathetic
and now part 2 has this girl who is just
she doesn't get less racist, no
and after 50 chapters i'd die for her
tatsuki is like so there's this racist, narcissistic and liar girl
and then makes you love them
makes the most awful people imaginable
chainsaw man really fucking
my chainsaw man brainrot is back
it's a feature
LMFAO okay
likely something with php
to only work on the first button
you probably hardcoded something
yeah so
then you're probably sending the information on what to update badly
because if all other buttons work but update the wrong thing
or does only one of the buttons work properly?
okay, so like, does only one of the buttons work?
if stuff is working as in updating properly
and for the other issue
and if it wasn't then do some kind of alert
you ideally want to check if the data that came back was a success, and if it was, reload
and then on that function
so on the php that accepts the requisition, you should give some kind of output like success or fail
so like, data will be whatever comes out from the php that accepts the requisition
yeah
just put that on the ajax function after a success
window.location.reload();
damn
how long is the extension?
jesus christ
just force refresh
yeah it makes sense
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> 2/28
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> new content
it released today!
sheeesh
i got it 5 mins before it announced it
wow that was a fast announcement
<:Loggers:1002644846449791137>
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
i want 90 to unlock ports
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i went from 74 to 86
i'm training thieving
while away at college
that review is really funny because it's clear the reviewer didn't enjoy it
ign famously gives inflated scores to not piss off publisher/fans
<@309634550273933314>
it just doesn't show up in the pop up that it's an option, but if you make it then it works
then it works
if it's webp
and you type the name of the file
yeah like if you go on emote uploading on discord
you just gotta force it to
discord accepts it
webp ain't that bad
and the last installments are so hopeless, which i kinda enjoy but i wonder where they're going with it
the execution blows balls kinda
and like i really like the ideas from it
it's the tzhaar lore again
kinda hated that quest lmfao
it's not very useful but it sounds cool
for the funsies
maybe i should get base level 80s
with a passion
fucking hate slayer
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> invention
defence is brit, runescape is all brit
defense is the american one, bud
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> a level
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
everything is fucking gacha
i'd hate that
like uh normal competitive i mean
so is pokemon, i'm learning
soz
yeah that's not the one i'm playing chief
what even
the more you specify the more i go from oh i think i remember that to what the fuck are you talking about
i'm very bad at it but it's fun
competitive pokemon
while doing afk stuff in runescape
you know what i've been learning now
**reqs for quest cape (not extremely useful but fun):**

another long term goal <:pogg:1035066559351226388>
since they only happen every 10 levels, and the max is 99
you know, slowly eventually there'll be way less of those
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> a level
and i'm done now
those were like real late game goals for me
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> quests
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
it's like 1/6k
it's actually insanely rare, i've learned
it's something so inconsequential
so fucking funny that that's an announcement
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> quests
jesus that's a lot of quests
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> pet
first pet
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
i didn't read any of the dialogue
good quest, i assume
arson
lmfao how is that a thing
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> plague's end
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
i was aiming to get this quest done by the end of the year
lmfao
rip
i need my cocaine
runescape is in a 3 hour maintenance
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> this close
i'm at 74/75 crafting and 72/75 ranged
and now i'm only a few requirements away from doing it on this acc
on my main account, my end game goal was to do plagues end, to unlock the highest level city
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> a level
don't have to do that anymore
i remember on my main account having to suffer through early levels of some skills
it's fucking crazy how good some of them are
21 left
yeah i guess i'm rushing to finish all quests somehow
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> quests
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> resting
i rushed shit too hard, tomorrow i'll take things more slowly
okay i'm stopping for today
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> quests and a level
the story was nice though
extinction was hard as fuck
even more quests! :D
today was quest day for me
if you play you can also be here
runescape
zei did a bunch oh wow
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> quests and levels
it's so slow, i need level 74 and i've been at it for 3 days by now

fuck embeds
this video is cursed, it never works for me
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> small progress

you can change some things
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it takes a while to get used to it
yeah
poggers
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> swan song
chill, i'm trying my best
i'm going to sleep soon too
fair
you don't exist
oh rip
<@453263261467410442>
is it still going on?
and windows sure as hell ain't taking 50% of it
right now
i also only have 8gb
yeah i don't think windows should be taking all of it up
how much memory does your laptop have
and see if something is acting up?
can you open task manager
hmmm
that's kinda weird
has something changed?
even before updating drivers?
that's kinda weird
is it done installing?
oh no
<:pogg:1035066559351226388>
in the middle of the 2 steps it gets weird
it has to uninstall the old ones before installing the new ones
updating graphics drivers does that
yeah
unironically
that's normal
<:dogkek:664517636524343344>
it shouldn't be that way
but that sounds wrong as in that's kinda stupid
like that sounds wrong not as in i don't believe you
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
i'm sure it'll be okay
that sounds wrong
hmmm
oh
oh no i don't think that's the case
then there'd be nothing to remove
i mena if you haven't messed with those settings
good chance it'll make other stuff run better too
but if there is one available, you should prob look into it
the game will probably work without an update, yes
you should update the drivers if you can
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> a level
we go
so when you get a level
i can put you in here
if you play the game
oh yeah
and if you don't get the game, that's fine
i can help
if you're confused or need help
yeah just saying
pretty bad
runescape new player experience is
i wanna say though
~~cause i'm not a bitch~~
the first one
i play rs3
and even failure is still progress towards self improvement
then that is absolutely under your control
but when you're playing for self improvement
cause those goals are not completely under your control
and that can be really tilting
people play to win and stuff like that
yeah having the right mindset really really helps
same score
or you miss them throughout with tons of breaks
like if you miss 10 notes at the beginning
which is why i like it
all that matters is precision
breaks literally don't matter
osu!mania
and i suck at them
but there's only 7k maps
kinda sucks too cause there's tons of maps and cool songs that i want to play
if i started on 7k they'd be both on par
i'm a bit better now but i'm still nowhere near as good as i am at 4k
like i only did 4k and i sucked balls at 7k
which is what i did
if you start with 4k, then you have to relearn from the beginning 7k
but if you start with 7k, you can then easily play 4k whenever you feel like
yeah
it's just as easy
you'll have a similar time learning
like, if you start with 7k
i would actually recommend learning 7k
and you'll end up fcing unintentionally
try to challenge yourself and play stuff that's engaging
instead of playing to fc
you should try to play to improve
hmm
oh god
that's kinda monka
you gotta have a certain type of personality to enjoy it
but it's certainly an acquired taste
hmmm to me it is
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> a level
<:Oldge:1006451665110564905>
but i wouldn't be surprised if this is the avg experience
it wasn't like this before i quit
<a:pepeMeltdown:933941237021569035>
and meanwhile i'm on my side going fucking
while killing it they're chilling, bonding about their children
they're teaching me a boss and like
wanna join vc i can't my children are sleeping
what the fuck
everyone in my clan are parents
nowadays
what even is runescape
sigMA carv mindset
i'm proud
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
i'll get there if you
almost there
i want 70 cooking
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> a level
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> a level
and then i get another one
the one thing i already had was a berserker ring
dragon axe, berserker ring and warrior ring
bitch drops 3 uniques
but i really feel like not making it in your face, so artificial and clear does a bunch to how fun the game is
i know other games, including runescape, also have design to purposefully make you sink time in the game
it feels very artificial, making you sink more time in the game for the sake of it
yeah i don't really like that
and stuff like that
like new items aren't just the same as the old one but stronger
yeah i dunno, i think one thing that i enjoy about runescape is that none of the grinds are too artificial
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> a level
lmfao

i don't think destiny runs on my pc
they're asking for shit i won't get until like 3 months for now
requirements to do raids is so high for no reason
most of the stuff there is useless, i just like completing stuff
i could also rush the important shit and then do a game per day to unlock the rest
that's like a day of playin
that's actually not that bad
9 hours
owo math 27 * (1/3)
each match takes 20 mins i think
games to finish that minigame
so 27
owo math 28.7 - 2.4
owo math 3.5 + 3.5 + 1 + 3.5 + 3.5 + 2 +2 +1 + 1+ 1+ 1+ 1+ 0.5 +0.5 + 1 + 1.5 + 1.2
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> a level
it's been 12 hours since i got that level
jesus christ
**reqs for me quests:** (help with crafting for plague's end)
~~80 magic~~
78 attack
78 strength
71 firemaking
70 construction
~~70 smithing~~
~~55 summoning~~
~~25 defence~~
~~76 woodcutting~~
~~70 fletching~~
~~67 slayer~~
~~63 farming~~

fuck i'm doing them all, that's like 20% of my goal
i can get 145k xp from quests instead
owo math 20 + 20+ 25 +40 + 40
too much
i've been playing what professional call
runescape
pure and natural skill, i know for sure i didn't even try because i just found out right now that i was even competing
rank 1600 at dying
apparently i can say i'm one of the best players in the game at dying
i wanted a simpler fraction
god damn it
no
owo math 449/259200
send help
i need 800k xp
is effectively 46k xp/hr
the method i want to level up my crafting
owo math (202.5 * 67.5) + (202.5 * 85) + (101.25 * 107.5) + (30.38 * 137.5)
that makes me feel dread
oh no
i think you're homeless
if you and your parents are addicted to gachas
imagine being in a runescape clan with your parents
now i'm like so how's the meta's changed since i've been away? and the clan leader is like i have a child
when i saw the name i went aw and accepted it
apparently they just recently moved from another clan where some drama happened, they're named myriad and they randomly invited me
i think i joined a clan of boomers
LMFAO aw that's so nice
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> a level
oh sheeesh it updated
what the fuck i have 400 hours in my account already?
owo math 17 * 24
idk anymore
i think
i have to log off for the levels to show up
oh i'm stupid
very cute
that's new to me
LMAO

and then all the alts made it SS-tier
A-tier
peeposit is like
unbridled joy
god i love these emotes
:sajj:
aster is turbo pogging
holy shit
i think it only does milestones
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> a level incoming i think
that race was created in the first place by that same god to mould the earth, so now they're just wandering purposeless waiting for extinction
it's so fucking sad and there's no moral
so now what the tzhaar can only do is wait until they die off
and now recently one the gods came back, took control of the hivemind, wiped all their memories and reforged them into mindless weapons of battle
and then the tzhaar had been just slowly dwindling over a good amount of them just dying and a good amount just joining the hivemind so they die but at least have their memories still around
the tokhaar
after so many of those deformed offspring though, a second faction split off and merged into one hivemind
there's 2 factions of those, the tzhaar which have multiple beings, and have to have offspring to keep the past memories alive
it's so sad
this is actually my favorite story line so far
so the way to free the currency is to merge those memories with the bodies without any memories
without any memories
the more background is that them as a race, when they produce newborns, they transfer all their memories to the children, but recently they've been having deformed offspring
i got so fucking mad
and that's somehow the way the quest ends
we shouldn't do it cause then they'll know they feel pain
so instead of liberating everyone to free them of their pain, the player's take is
during the quest we find out that staying in that form, only the remains, is extremely painful and torturous
there's a different race that when one of them die, the remains of them keep those memories and they use it as currency
my current n1 proof that we're a villain is the most recent quest i did
you steal them of the money to buy bread
they have 3 coins each
well i'll tell you, you start levelling it by pickpocketing common men
i'm not even joking, we're such a dick in literally every quest
i'm like 99% we're a villain
yeah that's thing about your player in runescape
thieving is so fast now it's kinda nuts
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> a level
idk it's kinda very vague
don't wanna bother the devs with stupid questions htough
i'll see if i can find something there ty
say when i do shit please
<:sakurawtf:992649489762488321>
i don't get it
<a:ppwiggle:959752665917698078>
as many as you want
she ain't 2d
caling her your first 2d crush is pretty misleading though
she is pretty hot
yeah i can't blame ya
i remember hearing some drama about it
isn't sylvanas a self insert?
and it's just W-W for no reason
like the 2020 glasses
to me it looks like someone using very tacky glasses
i thought you were making a 5head metaphor about the game
oh
like they have a consistent art style and it doesn't look that dated
lmao i think WoW kinda keeps up though
but i like it
it's really old and it kinda sucks
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> rpg
it's an rpg
which is a little more boring than what i had in mind but okay
maybe it takes a while actually
soo
i be tracked
<:smoke:808652033007157258>
i got a level and it didn't show up
<:PauseCat:1002644852850298960>
i'm getting a level in a sec so i can test out
should work i think
lemme try
getting infinitely close to being a mod without being a mod
i'm that one paradox
i don't have perms to add a bot
i'm a weird mod
elenora
like if i get a cool drop or a new level
there's a bot that connects to their api and can announce on disc whenever i do something
i'm playing a fuckton of runescape
<:pogg:1035066559351226388> a level
it'll announce every time i get a level so i can go
or <@309634550273933314>
<@416445660443967491> can i get a bot in
just have to learn
no
i'm also figuring that out
and how to decrypt, that's the hard part ain't it LMAO
and then those .wmv files are just compressed .unity3d files
games -> bh3data -> streamingassets -> asb -> pc
for honkai it's under
they also change how they encrypt their files very often tho
so it's just decrypt it and then unpack and there u go, you have the files
for honkai, they do encrypt their assets files
so for a lot of games is as easy as just drag them there
that's a lot of programs already made for unity games where you just feed the game files and they spit out the images and stuff
game to game can be easier or harder
in general is just try to display game code/assets
<a:rimbox:900859337197645915>
might take a while tho, mihoyo encryption got hands
yeah i'm trying to get into it
i have the perms now to do this
oh i was just asking for permission/if you thought it was a good idea
i needed someone to send a message somewhere for my bot but no one answered me in <#966951945103347794>, but you sent messages anyways
<a:Love:534242801131454516>
thanks
you're still getting them?
like the patch?
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
good luck
i think i'm a boomer now
okay
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that doesn't help
i don't get the sound
prettiest boy
it looks really good!
i dunno what words you like
or like, maybe not pretty
i do really like it
woahh it's so pretty!
<:TeriKleeDerp:959782563201839185>
and then the third is just 413 + 612
the other one is 612
i just felt i had to
oh it's a homestuck day
happy 1025
i'm sure it will go well
i'm glad
hell yeah!
sheeeesh, i'm proud
you figured it out later than me and are working on it before
but that's sick progress, you've done exponentially more than i have
well i hope it didn't go poorly or else my message will only remind you of it
oh it's been 2 days
holy shit
actual character writing and story writing of homestuck peaked at act 5 act 2, everything later just got steadily worse and worse
if you like the actual like lore though i can see how it's kinda shit
making roxy use 3 different pronouns depending on timeline and part of the story is accurate to real life and also really fucking funny on people trying to discuss it
and how they tried to fuck with the reader a lot
i really enjoyed the meta stuff, like how the story was told as 2 unrelated stories that joined later
yeah that's fair
i think it was interesting, better than homestuck^2
like for a whole semester of college i read it in commutes
i downloaded it all and read it as i commuted
i enjoyed the experience
like at most i got really invested in john terezi during the epilogues
i don't think i ever shipped much
i got hype for a sec there
aw fair
i respect it
eridan tavros ship is kinda wild
like sbahjs or w/e it was called and vast error
there's some fanventures which looked cool
i've never really got into fanfics...
fanfics?
reread?
what are you supposed to do when that happens
hey chrom, i'm having a homestuck phase again
fluffy tail
but i like the designs
i still don't know them yet
that's pretty good
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<#1079789802116882532> right now is just cherry going
the halloween art is really nice
oh i just saw that
<a:modCheck:820069730030714890> meat
<:okk:1058108494995263539>
keep it up
i really like yours
good feral art is hard to come by tbh
thos are reeeeeally cute
you get a good furry/10
dogboy goes really hard
oooo i vibe with that
so idk if i'd like it or not
i mean i never gave in
like if the trash is too far or smth
are you not the same
do it
eat the rest of it
every time i eat an apple a part of me is like
oh ok
i'm glad i didn't give in to the voices
apple seeds have a what
awaiting next boss spawn
it's just like
yeah, the UI is still there
you can still find it
if you know where to look
and the damage you deal is subtract from hp total
everybody on the armada get to fight it for 1min
like it was a boss with a bagillion hp
yeah
armada boss
that was for a specific thing
that's not even the skin
insane unit
<@309634550273933314>
spawn a field of pumpkin
her ult
like in action
have you seen the db one tho
i do prefer kallen one too i think
i love it
it's soooo tacky
they fucking slap
fuck yeah
childish spite
which is why purple and orange are my favorite colors
out of spite
so then i made halloween my actual favorite holiday
because the entire class was about how halloween is of the devil
and i got it right
and one of the only one left over was halloween so i said halloween
to the question what is your favorite holiday, obviously is the one they are baiting for, not my opinion
so i, being the good student, decide to choose the right answer
so at one point i realise they're baiting for one answer
and all the answer was going through the entire list
and they were all like uhuh, that's cool, anything else
easter
children day
and people start answer with normal stuff like chirstmas
they start by asking us our favorite holiday
so like in one of the classes
LMFAO no, oh god
it's a very big playlist
there's a LOT
and they do like child acitivities and classes n stuff
during the sermon
and then at the back of the church, there's an area to leave your kids with staff
and then some more songs
then sermon
we have like lots of songs at the start
like on all reasonable sized church here
during the boring part
and i went to like the children back classes they have right
we don't anymore
when i was younger, our family went to church
idk if i ever told this story but
like enby?
it's purple
um
wait for what i was before that <:dogkek:664517636524343344>
be more stereotypical
nah
o not bright for me
orange 2nd fav color
i agree tho orange is giga based
aren't cherries red?
you look pretty cute
i do think it looks better!
that looks waaay different for some reason than the other pics you posted
woah
i'm never clicking a spoiler from you again
maybe it's better not
can i joke with slurs
trans hb confirmed
haxxor....
do you really
<:Huhh:1031234964903166035>
it's so good
holy shit cherry
it's so pretty
HOLY FUCK
<:Prayge:909232418463047690>
good luck
now i won't know whos who
everyone's changing colors
we are talking about our experience with the object
when we call something yellow, we are not saying anything about the actual object
i dunno if it makes sense, it's kinda like
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
so that's the thing it truly is, because that's the definition of to be yellow
like for something to be yellow is for it to make yellow light bounce off of it
think of it like this, when you figure out something is yellow because it bounces off yellow color, you might think then if what we are seeing is just bounced off light, than what is it? but the thing we are naming is not the thing that exists, we are naming the experience we have with it
i mean it is something we experience and we categorise, how we experience and categorise is subjective
so color is what we decide it is
is something we made
but color is a social construct
to make it look like certain colors
things have different compositions that make different wavelenghts of light to bounce off
the answer is color has different meanings depending on context
yeah your name doesn't leave much room
so i went with second best
blows
but the purple god in runescape
my fav if purple
it's not my general favourite
so good pick
just because i liked the color
i picked the cyan god as my favorite
yeah back when i played runescape
cherry hi!!!!!!!!!!
<:BlushEmbarrass:814547132865970196>
i like the miku cyan
<:scaramouch_lurk:925161879322624110>
