üî¨
new and improved senti <:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
they should give hot a new dk.. like annually
shes janky as hell without trio but replacement support within 6 months, and not all rounded, is grossge
lmao the ones i saw a second ago were like pog htr replacement

<a:WOT:1069628996221935727> omg i hate going to the bank i could never
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
im pretty sure gresham has moved his direct deposit to hsr
doesnt even touch dudu elf, ez skip <:FeelsCozyMan_lum:492488572146941982>
imo it looks like a nun cap <:shrug:877047647511384064> im pretty underwhelmed with the design but let the seele fans have their moment. they waited 40 years for this.
<:MeiWow_lum:602273747214270514>
1st one is actually pretty
some fucking shithead horndog was like ‚Äújust use the one with the exposed tummy‚Äù
they really chose the ugliest one this time
senti summer skin does not exist
this time capsule is busted 
hofin - D
hotr - F
mei - C
you had me until i love bronyas lumi
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
mei's is mid too but its bchip. i'd buy kiana's too if it was b-chip but its absolutely not worth a pyramid
i'll prob get mei's only.. bronya's is absolute cringe and hofi look lazy af i really cant believe its pyramid
he's vietadian
one of us got that right eli i bet it was you
okay brad
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
hasnt seele always been white? <:HUH:1009812797040889896>
lmao wtf is racist seele
what is at <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
i dont  care about any of these new characters i miss trio <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
true love is real
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
you're thinking of blizzard
isnt tencent like a cockroach that never dies? always trying to break in and dominate any asia platform they can
is nikke from jp?
<a:jerry:864556009874522152>
nikke not here? i thought it was making money
what  game is the light grey and pink one
mihoyo dominating th whole market
jesus
what happened
who is designing these skins
yes
<:life:1001518241610485781>
when will kiana get a good pyramid skin
is that confirmed tai or youre just spec
THAT is kiana's pyramid
you cant be serious
did they say how they're attained yet
its kianafelis <:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
finally
omg <:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
restore hp? <:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
yeah thats true there was a lot of talk about that but tehres always talk about this no matter the s rank.. if f2p have to always pull sp they never get a s rank
also not sure what you mean by everyone saw it coming with JK.. if anything everyone was estatic jk was farmable and made it easier for them to pull on hoh
everyone's priority was always herrscher back then
ok bud hindsight is not foresight
you say unless like it might not happen <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
damn exciting patch for hot garbage enjoyers
when skin reveal
its the new ice support of the new ice seele <:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
<:Lmao:966624069363597362>
just raise the temp a bit more <:Smilechamp:970181655576846376>
hare with the pull now? <:Smilechamp:970181655576846376>
trio suck
LESS THAN 24 HOURS FOR PEACHY SPRING
she should be free just from pulling on the next s rank
sometimes i think about aponia and how she was truly the most skippable valk of all time
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
next year everyone will be like elemental is just dead right now, use phys
i agree trio sucks but they'll kill elemental just like phys this year
elemental died with trio
AT?
whats 6.8 then
<a:awkward:876231014232514571>
her skills sound like dudu
if they make qua elf they'll just add 10 more layers to qua shield
i rather demote to sinful than play that ugly ginger dancer
im gonna be up shits creek without a paddle if no seele herrscher and im sitting here without a qua dps for another year
can i skip prom tho ruby <:reallyy:823957003721768972>
yea i think i cant avoid her thb
yea but i have no bke
seriously?
i mean i hate her but her base model is pretty she just need a skin <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
is she worth puling
they nerf a lot of hare numbers
yeah same im gonna look ü§ì
i saw that but im not buying it until a real doctor confirms, that fuckhead is probably tryna get out of jail
what tet
coz im still confused
that can explain to me like im 5
for genshin's most recent archon quest
is there any video
hey
mihole
i really hate so much about hoyoverse but when it comes to their art/design team, they never cease to amaze me. that open world looks beautiful.
shame all this optimization comes after im over it
this looks so good
imo this was the most bloodsucking patch yet.. spa at least gave free stamps through ER and spend event. they took that away and put mei on a special ~~scam~~ supply
doesn't matter im done with graduation
oh
<a:Madgeclap:911017183478431764>

fen cleared the side stages with htr vg ac today <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
she had the worst character entrance of all time. im pretty sure one of my first messages in ac was ‚Äúwho is this durandal bitch? fuck off‚Äù
go back in ur vv hole
why does gresham hate mei so much
i got an idea dont call her a herrscher if she isnt one <a:pogfish:1063841859664891978>
um why is she called a herrscher if shes not a herrscher idiot <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
<a:britneyeh:1063841874785337437>

its cheap
mei ult only 75 sp <:Woggers_lum:608915988351811584>
<a:DownBad:1054188364498219049>
sickening
well i wanted my blue flame kiana too <:PES2_SitPensive:682654354091540533> maybe im just sick of this pink/white aesthetic
yeah i think so and the strings/ropes stuff
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
good im not crazy
but it does
like idk why
also idk why but the design reminds me of 2000's teen fashion for some reason
thats how hfs felt, i dont feel that with this design. some of the animations stay true to form, especially the bat and kick, but the color pallette doesn't scream kiana to me at all
i'll be honest, she doesn't look special. it looks like their favorite design recycled for the 5th time. <:PikaXD:966624196564242432> she looks pretty of course, just not as special as i was expecting
250 frags from s0 to ss, 600 from ss to sss
so she has to be awakened then
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
did i do the math right
300 for non-awakened?
so its 850 frags for 3s awakened?
owo math 180+70
owo math 60*3
she has to be awakened
and how much frags is that in essentine
for every 25 pulls you get 10 frags
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
this sound like adv for non-awakened doesnt it
- For the first 100 pulls, for every 10 pulls,  get HoOrigin frag x10.
we dont know if shes awakened yet right
well with that kind of deal how can i not <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
so origin banner is in 6.4 then, not 6.5
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
hoo is sp valk
so basically
In 6.4, HoO is free by completing events and Chapter 34. You can also pull Herrscher of Origin from special expansion supply
- Guarantees S-rank drop within 100 pulls, with 1.5% drop rate (same as regular expansion).
- For the first 100 pulls, for every 10 pulls,  get HoOrigin frag x10.
- For 101-300 pulls, for every 25 pulls, get HoOrigin frag x10.
- You can get a total of 180 HoOrigin frags.

Herrscher of Origin special equipment supply
- New gear guaranteed every 30 pull
- Every 10 pull gives 5 Focus card, max 40 cards (80 pulls)
- In 6.4, after completing Chapter 33, you can get HoO stigma box.

<:woggers:652740192653934633> <:woggers:652740192653934633> <:woggers:652740192653934633> <:woggers:652740192653934633>

alhaitham drip in 6 days <a:Streaming:1039019999811088414>

<a:worrysweat_hh:770947100174843904>
<a:worrysweat_hh:770947100174843904>
the visuals of this boss look great
surely this boss isnt meant for pe
?
‚Äúfree 1000 crystal‚Äù <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ugly
oh theyre releasing f2p options before the suits come
<a:smadging:1034847088737005628>
what are all these new weapons?
<:Deadge:966011458691416124> <:Deadge:966011458691416124> <:Deadge:966011458691416124>
yeah th she will replace eden since eden was never meant as a support for anyone but aponia anyway <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i bet she replace ae in fire and fischl in lightning <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
the sooner we get ae replaced the sooner we get new hua suit <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
well thats what i suggested but ruby says no
i wanna know who does him
i cant wait to see kevin boss
im js.. making a suit for one MA boss sounds pure cope
im assuming bull but idk i think she will get at least one
bronya will be the most useless suit ever if all she does is benares ma + 1 abyss boss
we'll see about that
<a:Yaeslap:966597937696223232>
NO SKIPPING MEI
surely the new team for fire kiana (when not using trio) will be bronya+ac <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
i seriously doubt bornya will only be used on benares though
ofc you should get bronya for more coverage but not having ac for the fights fire kia will need her.. probably anything outside ma benares  + 1 abyss boss.. will blow hard
whatever
CN
ai chan
i see a few in sols talk about skipping ac for bronya
<:KleekPoint:998911499315728404>
i was gonna say gresham how you gonna justify skipping support
<a:Walk:1025390261406285874>
back in my day everyone said ice is the worst investment you could make <:PU_PepeOld:532626230562783242>
beta: 3 new dps trio to top ma benares
live: hot top score
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
that would be fucking cringe
her 2s will be imposible to ignore for nirv players anw
probably if there isnt cn will complain until there is
<a:believer:1018349083800379482>
190 pulsl right bbefore cny dont miss this once in a lifetime deal BAAAAAAAAAAAAT
vv best tf abuser
<:kekL:939008918640787476>
hoh skippers really making the biggest move of hte year
thast because only poor poeple have have s0 hohe and no poor person can afford 3s jk rn
im sure hotr will take all the neutral ice bosses with ranks <a:smadging:1034847088737005628>
prefer powercreep on 2 yr old suits  <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
dont start kei
wouldnt be crazy if they released like a mech phys dps since we havent seen one in 84 years? that would be wild
well it wont be hard for new kiana to become the best fire dps<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
sry i just realize were notnin spoiler chanel
she only supports herself and fire/lightning
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
why they dont put the element here? sus af <:sus_stare:988542793272139786>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
good point
why would it be like not? id prefer a support over another ice dps
<:life:1001518241610485781>
so the rumors of her as support are true then?
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
shes confirmed img ice?
whats in time capsule
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
coz its a rerun<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:worryweird_hh:770947100199747606>
all her designs look terrible, her paid outfit still much better <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
omg they added affix mats to coin shop <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<@416445660443967491> i think you wanted to know if SN was still in supply shop in 6.2.. looks like she is along with gold witch
i never have asterite as it is <a:smadging:1034847088737005628>
are these changes good?
theres no shot bronya comes with new phys elf right? im not tryna 4s dudu today to get her replaced in a patch <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:paimonthink:945212327022702652>

imagine they replace hos before ae
da bronya is coming
it looks like a tiki post
omg pistol kiana is coming <:woggers:652740192653934633>

NO
GIVE ME BLUE FLAME KIANA
<:ReallyMad:971219475045154856>
NO MORE PINK
ai chan er
ai chan's kit is most likely structured for a new fire dps so <:shrug:682697895769800777> whatever the case, it's probably a kit looking toward the future that may not fit perfectly with current teams
raven is not that bad though, depending on how long the fight is.. that 12 sp could at least give her an easy 2 rotation
idk man we havent' even seen any testing
people are awfully confident raven is getting replaced over AE <:kekL:939008918640787476>
they.. added andrius to er?
<a:aPES2_SadGeSmoke:929006632900370483>
this is kinda garbo
SS - Upon counter hitting [Aimer-Œ≥] Chakram unit, all team members restore 12 SP, CD: 15s.
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
QTE
Triggered when enemies are affected by Time Slow or had been ignited. When Chrono Navi enters field through QTE, triggers 3s Time Fracture, restores 300 Œõ energy, deals 120% x 8 ATK of Fire DMG, at the same time triggers Charged ATK's continuous tossing of [Aimer-Œ≤] Chakram unit, deplets all Œõ energy, switch CD for the character who was switch off is reduced to 4s.

they're still bickering <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
just a little drama in sols server courtesy of fragile <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
now its devolved into them saying they can't retain nirv because they lack the gear but fragile says its skill issue and now he's dissecting a nirv run they did and pointing out all the things wrong with it <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
thats where it started
this person said hfs was trash valk for 2 years and ai chan was finally coming to make her good
fragile is currently destroying someone in sols as we speak <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>

idk where the original post is, this was just shared by marisa
copium for consistent ignite and sp regen
she aint givin any breach

kit is what? tomorrow morning? like 24 hours?
i really hate playing ae <a:aPES2_SadGeSmoke:929006632900370483> now i will have to skip hor bundle and get ae to ss instead
i cant believe ae survives another year
not a fan of the eden model, makes valks look like giants

by the time you level up those resources it iwll be 7.0 <:OMEGALUL:968951852957859850>
3 sranks
imagine
i think its
6.2 fire support
6.3 bronya special supply
6.4 kiamei
<a:PU_PeepoLeaveExit:855157057887535164>
kiana bronya mei for cny with two of the 3 being farmable is delusional
that trailer was so crazy i cant get over it
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
WE DONT KNOW
herrscher upgrades no doubt
someone please share trailer when its up
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>

fair enough <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<a:HyperRun:751420612014112829>
what the-- this is like an unforgiveable take.. its not even a take, it's a straight dumpster opinion
the only vfx i see is a rubber ducky <a:PU_PeepoLeaveExit:855157057887535164>
true
it looks mid anywaysss
such a long way to see this skin in game when it looks so simple <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
frags i mean lol
so 80 stamps total?
there should be 8 sushang stamps from 6.2 to 6.3 in bp right?
you mean sushang gear + hor dk and gear <:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
i dont have mobius, aponia, or vv.. half this patch will be nothing but a struggle once again
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
im uninstalling
are you fucking kidding me
still not in beta <:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
the select is perfect for them because they dont have hos gear either
otherwise i think they just continue to suffer with no phys
but only if we get that select
ye they want PE i just told them to get her <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
is it worth to pull PE still if you have no phys dps <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
you never answer my question ruby
if glb doesnt get select <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
im gonna have to roll for sushang too because i have no currency
wont be a problem, i need too much.. sushang gear + hor dk + pe skin.. i wanted aponia or ss pe but i doubt i will go there since im already certain im getting fucked with not one but two gear banners <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
this hor shill is so fucking irritating.. rather pick up aponia or ss pe but noooo lets shill another dead valk for nO REASON
i'd need 1340 currency to get 3 star durandal but i only have 700 currency left after buying sushang stamps <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
yeah
<@180679257851166721> was it 6 stamps we can buy for sushang with chips? only enough for s2 <:PES_CryComfy:643089269375762432>
so max currency we can get is 2790 assuming no bundles
<:woggers:652740192653934633> <:woggers:652740192653934633> <:woggers:652740192653934633>
ah isee okay
2sp/s would be 4 sp affixes? since they max at .5 right?
she require 2 set for optimal performance in separate game mode?
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
mei as fire seems wrong <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
bruh new phys kiana would be pog
fuck that, im not investing past ss on hor
for 1680 chip
you can buy card or stamps
no
wow firepower be busted
<:Derpasaur:646964229261492235>
i cant remember
wait was gris released alone
i remember SW > PE/SPA and 3 s ranks in a row > Herrscher
i dont think they will give us break before anni, they keep trying to murder before big patches <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
so maybe they take it easy on us for 6.2 with a rank or sp release, 6.3 would be the sw bait, and 6.4 duo release
<:worry:860766151671676948>
or you mean 6.4?
6.3 is already cny? <:huh:966619839307321394>
<a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
6.4 glb or anni or 6.3?
6.2 sp suit followed by new super bait valk for 6.3 <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
how many times do i have to teach you this lesson old man<:grisob:975016058928914452>
yea
isnt it the 11th in cn already
wait
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
if the stamps on sushang, you should get sushang <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
oh good
<@180679257851166721> i just realise theres no spending event in beta.. is there possibility it will come in next beta update? surely there would be one.. <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
lmaoo aka doing evade spam sp farm during that transition phase <:deadge:975652771082698782>
um why does her gameplay still look so boring<:deadge:975652771082698782> just give infinite krostytum in bike mode
i thought hov always immune to lightning only
does it say so
ya
omggg aka is absolutely destroying kasumie wit hohe/sushang <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
ely boss
yeah much higher dmg with sushang
aka test with sw/sushang and the difference is big
looks cool
9S HoF RC JK
31946 MA Hellmaru
<:Copium:834822065231364156>
rotatoins with sushang/hohe look so much better than using hb
pog
but you only pick up 4 coz she had more for ss in er
wasnt it more than that?
in spend event
how many stamps tehy give us for spa again?
mm
aka playing with sushang/ely/cat right now
mid burst: she recovers so much sp its- wait everything's already dead <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
- She is farmable from War Treasury. Costs 480AL + 480AW until v6.3 (discounted). Price will be   640AL + 640AW from v6.4 onwards
- Frag costs 8AL + 8AW per frag. Weekly limit unknown
- She will be in Battle Pass in v6.2
- You can also get Sushang stamps from spend event / Bchips packs in v6.1
- In 6.1, you get 10 free pull in her gear supply
mariso said something about her stamps actually being buyable with chips?? <:huh:966619839307321394>
idk if she has ER stamps
well for nirv anyway
oh definitely
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i forget s0 sw exists
idk
(S0)JK (SSS)HB (SSS)RC
Hellmaru 
RL 445D
769 pts

lots of new bosses in this patch which is very pog, im sick of them redesigning old bosses with dumb shit like type counter!! new boss!!
yes
it depends tho we still dont know about aponia either
eden not confirmed for bingo, mariso just said its speculation
nice
so she wont have collapse?
who is the vv boss meant for? herself?
<:durandalsmile:973569999757254666>
can you link aka stream?
mg streaming beta rn 
yea
also we do not know what a score with hohe on hellmaru is WITH sushang in team either
thats a lot of investment just to reach s0
sss jk being on par with hoh is not that weird
er is polarizing for a lot of people, plenty of people are just dead set on skipping hohe coz shes not part of main cast
anni patch looks really good tbh, it will be hard for people to choose but tbf they have the option of choice, you dont HAVE to pull everything.. and fall guys event looks so fun
i dont think they will
g4 stig will be on her dk banner right? coz iaint farming that shit
<:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
oh yea i type that wrong
sth hot doesnt have and shes already broken on everything with 7t lol
40% td against psy
it looks exactly like that, more dmg against her type counter.. hor also have built in dmg for psy type too
dk or sus weapon
which one soe again <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
whats wrong with the weapon
so pratically on par
oohhh
i thought so too tet lmao
who is susannah?
we still have 2 ely boss and 1 kevin to look forward to as well... are these gonna be for ice comps? <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
i need to go find what hodou looks like then, i thought it was his sss version
bull is not hodou?
i thought that hor boss?
idk seriously considering just 2s ely now especially with the rumor kiamei suits are coming <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
tbh i think i agree as things are right now, and if you're forced to choose between hor or hohe and you're looking at the most economical route then picking up hohe elf and getting hor will probably be better since after farming out sus she can fill the hohe role as dps in lower brackets <:nerdge:980201016853164144>
i dont think you should skip sushang for hor but thats just my opinion.. she looks like a killer support that you can use as a dps after farming her
its a lot, she gets sp from like half the shit in her skills <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
tbh she will be suitable replacement for hohe with lesser ranks at lower temps
so curious to see how she perform with hohe
id assume 4 tho if its 9s
they dont share what elf star is in that vid
s0 hohe with 3 star ely elf has 853 @ 435d <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
445
lets see what v2 brings <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
she look very good
Combo ATK 1 [S2]
Decrease 10 Sword Will usage when Jade Knight casts [Sharpness of Thunders], can automatically cast [Top of the Clouds] once. [Top of the Clouds] trigger CD: 0.7s.

Combo ATK 2 [SS1]
Upon casting [Nine Wild Swords] and [Million Swords Return to Heart] skills, all team member's Ranged ATK, Basic ATK (including Charged and Combo) and Burst mode ATK ice DMG +5%, last 18s, refreshable.
Ultimate Skill 2 [SS]
Ice DMG dealt by [Edge of Taixuan] +50%, shield break ability +100%, upon casting [Edge of Taixuan] all team member's shield break ability +25%, last 18s, refreshable.
Passive Skill 2 [SS]
When Jade Knight releases [Million Blades], will additionally form 3 giant swords, DMG dealt is doubled, at the same time will additionally restore 5 SP.

Passive Skill 3 [SSS]
Under Sword Array mode, enemies receive +5% DMG from Jade Knight (independent effect).
still waiting for full ranks
so predictable <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
sushang needs a skin already because im so bored of looking at her <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
its hard to play due to specific timings and frames etc
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831> QTE
Triggered when enemies are affected by time slow or enemies receive other team member‚Äôs Combo/Charged ATK DMG. Jade Knight uses [Nine Wild Swords] skill to enter field, restore max Sword Will, at the same time initiate Sword Array mode. The switch CD of the character switched off field is decreased by 4s. Upon entering field through QTE, [Nine Wild Swords] will trigger 1s time fracture.
she buffs the normal/charge attack so much it doesn't matter i think
yup
Ultimate Skill 1
Upon casting [Edge of Taixuan], every ice tag Valkyrie will enter elemental penetration state, Ranged ATK, Basic ATK (including Combo and Charged) and Burst mode ATK will receive +14% elemental breach, last 18s, refreshable.
sushang also gives breach
she really doesnt offer sp to team
so yeah
Combo ATK 3
Under one Sword Array mode, upon casting [Sharpness of Thunders] 3 times, can press ATK button to cast [Million Blades] once, counted as Combo ATK, dealing 30% x 6 ATK of ice DMG, restore 20 SP, all team member's non-Burst mode Ranged ATK ice DMG +40%, last 10s, refreshable.
sushang translation
finally
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
the freeze trauma fills out perfectly in the roto it looks like
i saw mariso said that
well i just woke up
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
is it true she built to support hor and not hohe?
if having too much sp is an issue <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
where the fuck the kit translations
maybe her kit gives sp somewhere
if shes support it makes sense coz you want her off the field as fast as possible but her team would have to keep up <a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
i thought even her stig give sp to team
bruhhh wat the helllll lmao
ty
is it true that sushang gives 120 sp to teh whole party?
i dont mind them being different color, pe herself is the same, but the light blue/white looks too much like bke
yeah they will tweak it for sure
the entire knight design is just sooo perfect, its beautiful
idk i love morbmaid, its so colorful
honestly mobi design is pretty to me too but it has no vfx and morbmaid just outshines it in every other way
or they just put all the effort into kinght form and were like oh yeah the other form
its like they made a mid free skin for her and then they were like, actualy we need another pyramid supply, we running low on money <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
exactly
and her guardian is mid af
pe's knight form is the one best designs they made
imo
just become skin gamer
eden's skin is really nice, they added a lot of detail to it
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
is aponia skin not in the beta yet either
ig it doesnt matter much if thetes two gear supplies to pull tho
youre still not pulling for the srank
why? i thought this patch economical?
the only thing i care about anymore is that pe skin<a:PU_pepeAngel:931102992831234088>
has anyone uploaded pe skin in action yet
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
legit ice ae<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
how do i see that
sw's insane team buff when using ult <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
devastating blow = dps <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
sushang is a dps that buffs her teammates.. sound familiar <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:C_TaoCreepySmile:958713165196177419>
70% of people saying im skipping hohe is going to waste pulls on her supply anyway, guaranteed. these are not exactly smart players. <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
that's disrespectful <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
there is server art contest going on, submit art and win chips/crystal <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i hope you guys are pulling ely elf but shes gonna be abused the fuck out of for at least 3 patches <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
3s sushang by end of patch<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
it looks like senti tbh <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

everyone who has been avoiding investing in ice is going to be in serious pain the next 3 patches minimum <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ngl i really want da dk <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

reaper literally posted that in fen's discord to copy+paste it into his survey, that's all <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i think paga is a possibility too, its been 6+ months and not gone off rate yet
i think himeko turg and zhenyi at least <:PES_HmmSpecs:672161497413189680>
you guys think theres a chance of bastet getting in ely's supply?
im pretty sure reaper posted that in fenrysk's discord as a wish list and someone took it as real and true
<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
im still amazed so many people skipped bastet when most knew the herrscher would be ice <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
i think it just force you to use bastet b instead of cezz b
i dont think its that bad since they buffed her dmg outside herrscher form
could you with ranks?
<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
are you going in on that adv supply
becaus its been awhile since they release a s rank gacha dps that has such high sp cost
<:deadge:975652771082698782> ruby
very shitty spend event, the entire format of this release is disgusting
new gen
i the next elf has sp regen im gonna flip a lid
i wonder what bundles they'll offer

my parents split when i was 2 and my mom never cared what i watched but when i had to go live with my dad in the summer, he is  strictly mormon, and i would only get like 1 hour of tv watch a week which was always some mormon propaganda video. i remember when i got older like.. 13 or sth idk i begged my dad to take me to go see the mummy with my little brother and we had to leave in the middle of hte movie because my bro was so scared and crying <:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170> by that age i was watching shit like hellraiser but my siblings never got exposed to this kind of media
im old enough that i grew up on the original mlp cartoon lol i loved it then but i never watched the new gen stuff
you dont know of this subsect of people hacker? grown men addicted to the mlp? <:woggers:652740192653934633>
she was the life of my life but one day she disappeared, and one day she disappeared into the sea of quanta. i dont think she ever liked me that much because she kept calling me budget kevin.
khanriah obviously, i will develop a vision and fight side by side with dainslief
ely has been on my bridge for 6 straight months, she will soon be replaced by the only person who could replace her, herself.
<:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
thank you su
he rerolled and got herrscher ely, the best timeline
aponia should've peaced out from the fighting and made a yt asmr channel

omg of all the people to die fighting hote its pardo, such a brave innocent baby <:grisob:975016058928914452>
<:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
6.1 will prob be new s rank psy wt valk and new s rank psy gacha valk

i dont think they will ever make another img suit tbh, you either have pe or you dont. i also dont think they will introduce anymore img enemies
fuck bke, i hate her design and i hate her playstyle and she's a million years old. give a new mech phys already, im done with that suit
if bke is given another indirect buff i will LOSE my fucking shit
i would prefer a hos sidegrade somehow
i believe you
the 6.1 spending will make this one look like trash
but its better than nothing for people who have to pull herrscher
it sucks imo
im legit spending all my spending event currency in 6.0 on skins and affix mats <:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
its one of those people who think elemental affxi is good
isnt s from ss a significant amount of attack too?
<a:praygirl_hh:757338631747928161>

back to back
yea but that means anni will have big spending event
they're not even offering the elf frags from the last trash spending event <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
this spending event is kinda trash tbh
oh man the outrage is already starting, people are mad as hell <:durandalsmile:973569999757254666>
good riddance
i'll just get 2 skins + resources <:durandalsmile:973569999757254666>
650 currency?!
they really want people to go broke
hos adv supply
i seriously cannot believe this
i finally get the hb outfit <:durandalsmile:973569999757254666>
what are they planning for anni?
wow
ohhhhhh
is that another bride skin for ely?
HOS ADV SUPPLY
oops
this looks like a mini scamming event
wait
YOOOOOOOOOOOOO
ruby spending too much time in maincord
<a:aPES4_EyeRoll:726511347189284914>
you wont let her down, right lmao mihoyo pls <:PES2_Tux:513339892860715021>
damn thats great youll def get ely
you and keilo
<:durandalsmile:973569999757254666>
i swear reboot you only ever come in here to share information that was posted 6 hours ago
its literally just her typing for me, because she's psy theyre jumping through hoops making sure hfs/hot can't compete. its dumb af.
oh, you want to whale for me? <:durandalsmile:973569999757254666>  
wow carv literally working for ely
save your butt off and hope for select with anni patch
i think ss looks good
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
they should start putting elf frags in bp
i was malding that shit for days and hours
that thing is the worst
no klein = garbo lightning team
klein is just too op with that force qte
when she does that big slash thing
idc its just that i never notice it, probably coz senti and pe already do it for me
is it me or dudu elf gather kinda fuckin weak as hell
marisa said the switch cd is for all valks, but oh yea i forgot about the tdm
its literally the same as dudu elf unless you want to say phys is more important than ice then yea you could make an argument for that
sirin is very cute, so is dudu.. the rest cannot compare
yes
hard to picture a scenario where you will need that switch cd in that comp when hb is already in one of the slots <:Lmao:966624069363597362> its just better for a f2p for account utility if they're c onsidering pulling first elf
yes i think she will be good enough for nirv
oh i just realised good enough
are you sure we does more dmg than ely elf?
shes basically dudu elf but better dmg for ice
yes
why does everyone in nirv have 4 star we <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
dw im sure they will release another ice valk that can take adv of this passive soon <:kekcry:973697358799978626>
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
<:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
like kevin?
ely does
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
full skill description
just tell me how to wake up
nope its a new fun feature! <a:aPES4_WickedDash:838744542445830154>
i wont be surprised if she struggles with these changes
so glad hov is in ER so the ancient ass hov simps can finally stfu and have a place to use her
so dumb
epi doesn't even have ae, if spending event card has ae or hot, i'd still choose ae. if ae is not there, yeah, i'd still choose a *free* hot from the bucket of dorm for sure.
i mean pulling on a hot banner
absolute garbage trash game üöÆ
the point is, she is in a similar situation to bke. she is not worth investing in for a f2p at this point when most people on the server are going to have a leg up and not to mention, her bosses were just converted to ely's bosses.
hot is dead now nayway
806 with SSS 
i cant even use paypal on my honkai
was it 4 star sirin?
im acctually shocked shes not awakened
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<@180679257851166721> you said it was around 2k to sss your hfs right? that include gear and sirin?
so cute when she qtes in she says her little hi!~ <:MeiHappyJuiceBox_lum:686671081255469114>
that heph looks like it will be hell on earth without ely
full bastet full turg
yes
full team s0 4 star elf
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
if i see 4 star we over 4 star ely elf im gonna commit
its just we again
and ice team does need switch cd? they could've given that elf some better account utility SOMEWHERE
since she buffs elf its not that surprising
super cringe, not only will people be easily ranking her up but they will be getting elf too.. wtf is an s0 no elf ely gonna look like <:kekcry:973697358799978626>
ofc im nothing but a slave to this pos company
nvm its for ice only <:deadge:975652771082698782>
is it true she recovers .5 sp/s for whole team? or is it also restricted to ice?
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
but frozen is fine ig
its just more restriction
frozen also?
the only way to trigger her qte is when someone else on team uses 100 sp <:kekcry:973697358799978626>
but nah lets do all this extra work
could've just made her anything but psy
lazy af
all the old bosses just shafted to ice up/ice only
so much of her skills are restricted to ice valks like that shit is useful in any way beyond hb/cat
yes it does
watching akayuki unlock skills like im looking at sw rn <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
can i find translations for the elf and ely ranks yet anywhere
why psy? what the hell is the point of doing all this extra work to keep hof/hot from competing with her? im so tilted
<a:wtf:479509240046682114>
now thats the standard
before everyone got SS
people used to say that
<:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
really? whats your channel?
he could just use a voice coder if he doesn't want his voice reveal <:huh:966619839307321394>
im waiting for more info on the elf coz right now it looks like more disappointment
<@218762069338619906> since you do community stuff on hoyolab, would you ever consider doing a youtube video of the history of PE honkai lore into ER lore?
is anyone drawing kevin/ely art <:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120>
im over honkai impact, when are we getting PE impact
they really would make the most beautiful power couple of all time
i did, timestop when she enters creating her domain does not mean excessive time stop
shes gonna need excessive time stop with those animations
but they can do this for mobi? nah
wow another psy suit? <:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930>
elysia is bait
barely better than hfs, hot, griseo, AND mpe
skip
Save for next herrscher
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
ely better have start sp and tf
<:grisob:975016058928914452>
any chance still shes op support <:kekcry:973697358799978626>
psy was the worst move possible but whatever, i'm hopeful they will stll treat her well
lightning husk is aponia
defintely
? so hot dead again
the question is her coverage <a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
too precious for this world
anyone have hd download from bili?
it looks like finisher
<:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120>
so shes prob dps then
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
<:MeiHappyJuiceBox_lum:686671081255469114>
or the guy at the gates
for some reason it reminds me of like.. the river styx <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
yeah i saw that i mean the entire chapter tho<:woggers:652740192653934633>
its like romeo and juliet
i need translations <:meiMad:997543209221750834> do you think its possible they kill hoc off quick and the last acts are all about the banquet? i really wanna see kevin kill ely
<a:PU_peepoHappyWave:531794954675159040>
<:MeiStare:458045366063857668>

previous baby angel
we will be rewarded
we have endured the shills and must pulls
we're so close to the reveal, the story, the cg, the music
<:Copium:834822065231364156>
<:Copium:834822065231364156>
<:TeriAhe:973793204237398106>
we knew this would happen, at least its a saturday beta and not a monday one. also, valk reveal still tmr <:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
<:MeiHappyJuiceBox_lum:686671081255469114>
never <:grisob:975016058928914452>
someone in maincord said it would be on the summer supply <:HMM:966625453194485760>
aqua chime?
which one
<:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
eden and aponia will be spending event summer outfit for 6.1 anni
by fresh do you mean boring
its very flinestones
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
doubt
so close but so far
they really said fuck eden and aponia
hot is exception because mihoyo hates mei
if ely is mech she would kill hor good one like hor hasnt been on life support for a year now <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120>
<:MeiHappyJuiceBox_lum:686671081255469114>
so tmr outfit reveals?
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
will be much lass of hassle to do now
thats so pog
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
why not? ofc they rerun her with her skin
hopium they change the box on the next pyramid
yep
at least now i can skip in good fairh
<:E_KEKpat:849972793314902057>
whats not to like
her colors and the outfit looks like lingerie and she's riding a ghost horse
:sentistare:
unicorn krishna <:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
<:PES_HmmSpecs:672161497413189680>
maybe the new years pyramid this year
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
she needs one

whats the costume bp
<a:TeriDance4Top:959782332276027392>
YESSSSSSSS
i dont prefer vill-v though <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
doesnt this indicate 6 week pathc?
the date here
i sure hope so <:Copium:834822065231364156>
it was my first boss after breakthrough and idid the same thing lol

true
they should remove the mona lisa from the louvre and put this there instead
thats art
miss cute summer elf
miss cute elf
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
theres nothing wrong with it until bruhs the one posting it
its f2p what do you expect
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
yeah im curious how many rolls that took lol
what an icon
lmao thats bottom of the barrel for sure
yep
<:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
its not that different to someone swiping to finish gearing a valk on release when they could wait for a rerun
literally
75% of the way you spend money in the  game is to bypass the time restraint
coz they dont want to farm
the person whaled on farmable valks like ely and fr
cn discuss
people fighting in maincord, mad how whales spend their money <:Lmao:966624069363597362>
<:PES_TuxedoToast:585724570082738178>
herrscher, elf, bp skin, wedding skin, cg, new pink brdige
6.0 elysia palooza
please just give me my ely
i want 5 week patch
but mariso said the events end in week 5, thats why she thinks its possible patch is 5 week
yea i think they just do the 3 week gimmick for supplies that get gear in them
also when we know bp? thursday?
was sw the same?
retire andrius already <a:aPES_RageShoot:619845777807769611>
pog another ignite week with no ignite support <:woggers:652740192653934633>
they should do something with eden's hair to make it more summery
i cant picture eden and aponia is in swimsuits
what if another pyramid summer outfit too <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
who will be the b-chipper
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
thats when
on ely herrscher
kevin stig when
is his shirt unbuttoned <:huh:966619839307321394>
<:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>
they look touchable
i can see his calves
if herrscher isnt 6.0 im flying to mihoyo headquarters to have a talk
<:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
<a:Yaeslap:966597937696223232>
um what
seh is too precious
<:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
i cant wait anymore <:grisob:975016058928914452>
maybe she saying this to someone else like you said idk
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
is this implying that this herrscher is the same one they defeated in PE when ely went herrscher?
<@180679257851166721> did elysia say to hoc when we last said goodbye.. she knows the herrscher of corruption?
banger music 
sadge its over
it was longer than the former for sure, although it probably didnt feel that way since every chapter before the final kolosten felt like it dragged forever
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<a:Yaeslap:966597937696223232>
this will be the most epic cg ever
vill-v makes decisions with trust in her companions that they're not at fault. when she is deleted, she is making the choice ot sacrifice herself so that she will remove herself from the scene for the bigger picture. <:terithink_hh:746352763092336682>
<:grisob:975016058928914452>
THEY HURT
THE BLUE BALLS
I CANNOT WAIT
Chapter 31 will be a very long chapter, probably like Kolosten final chapter. Expect the unexpected
pleeeeease give more story crumb <:grisob:975016058928914452>
keeps his mask on at the beach <:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
i hope they give us a bunch of summer art with FCs <:grisob:975016058928914452>
blue flames would be awesome but shes perfect how she is
what are they saying <:grisob:975016058928914452>
what happened to elysia?
i can't tell you
whatever happens to elysia going forward depends on how much i like you as a person going forward
<:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
that freakin elysia pillow

um okay sorry to offend <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
if kevin has hote powers why doesn't he use them to just kill all the herrschers himself <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
so literally just a person <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
what even is hare?
oh so she lost to hare?
herrscher of thunder taken down by raven <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
shocking <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i don't see the problem tbh mei and kiana should just join forces with king kevin and destroy the world together <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
what does mei have to say about all this? or is she still clueless? <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
has the real kevin just be absorbing hote energy this whole time and his stigma is the one we've seen in every earlier chapter interacting with the main cast? <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
so
this chapter looks pog i cant wait <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
put me in a kevin sandwich <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
fine by me, they both look like kevin idc who's real <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
lucky teri
omgggg how cute the way he saves teri
i found it <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943> 
me too, he will never leave my bridge <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
great, i'll wait for you to share the link <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
where can i see his abilities <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
omg i wish <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
so he just sprouted out of real kevin's butthole like a mushroom? <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
what was he though? like a clone?
im confused with kevin stigma vs real kevin means.. what the hell is the a stigma <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
APHO mid sucks <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
fucking bullshit <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
when we get to see dudu training her lil clone sis <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
s-rank and wt take it or leave it <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
it will not be augment, people need to spend something for 6.1 anni <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
sushang found dead in a ditch <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
its teri for sure <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
thats because hi3 is ending in 6.1 <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
fucking LYLE gets one
<:PES_CryComfy:643089269375762432>
the only thing i want from this update is hote kevin pfp <:PU_PeepoCatCry:594631410887819265>
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257> you take that back
she has bigger boobs than my mei
her model is very adorable
did MEI do anything of interest in this ch
i know its a good one
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
kevin is really hot
i thought it said PE herrschers were replicated from PE exactly the same so that CE knew how to fight them
if all herrschers were replicated from PE then what about senti? i dont remember a senti in PE <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i refuse to believe seele doesn't get herrscher suit <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
where seele hod <:huh:966619839307321394>
what is he gona do when he's absorbed all of hote power? kill himself?
so what is moonbase? does it belong to shicksal or ws?
wtb kiamei reunion
does kiana have plans to join her?
did teri just randomly show up on the moon?
is she on the moon?
what was kiana doing in this chapter
where diavoros? he must be crying tears of joy
right so would make sense for her to get a new power up for rematch in act 2
is teri the 6.1 suit <:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
kevin is for real becoming hote? <:MonkaGIGA:638533425988370462>
if they created WOH and WOH has the ability to influence herrschers, why this convuluted plan? just influence the WOH to make the herrschers nice or kill themselves?
i legit was just coming here to ask someone to explain the new chapter to me like im 5
aponia is milestone and eden is b-chip <:WICKED:897590154691248149>
4 more weeks for griseo outfit <:MeiStare:458045366063857668> her hair is too cute
winning what?
kevin in the summer event has been giving me so much life, i love it
<:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120>
love kalaps' smile
NEW MEI SUIT?
DR MEI WILL BE CENTRAL CHARACTER IN ENW STORY
THEY SAID
HES SO BEAUTIFUL
lmaoo
<:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120>
fucking asshole
why is kevin's quote just rejected
winter whiskey sour
morning mimosa
but they will give raven for free with discount gear supply
6.1 will be s rank sushang and farmable wt s rank raven
i wanna see seele suffer and go evil for a bit <:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
im getting a little tired of this nice herrscher bs
but im ngl
she's prime herrschey material
if fucking teri can get a herrscher suit, theres no reason seele can't
thanks
i see
seems like a lot of effort that serves him no purpose toward his own goals
i guess my question is more.. what was the purpose of kevin sending her there? to learn why CE herrschers retain their humanity? why?
what was the purpose of mei working for WS if kevin just tells her bye now
what exactly did mei learn from ER
i really hope the next patch chapters don't have that stupid bug that skips text <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
oh right, i love that one <:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120>
someone share it

<:pepepause:877793228714287144>
every patch update is a trauma
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
qua ignite weather, pull vill-v or demote to agony
is that saying we no longer get frag drops with this change to essentine?
but that leak also said herrscher wont be until 6.1 (if thats anni).. i cant wait thta long.. i will go crazy
<:SakuraWTF:588421743526281216>
<:Suspiciouspepe:920083771217285130>
there is really an elf coming with vill-v?
yeah for sure
this patch looks so dead though.. i think for sure that mobi skin is coming with her, what else?
yeah i dont regret going for sw at all, she hard carries a lot
yeah but shes so pretty to look at
very true
looks like a dead ass money grab
i cant believe they've done this.. s rank fire dps that sits in a turret style gameplay. how im supposed to evade? where my ignite support? what a waste
good make sure you drink lots of fluid and rest up
are you still there?
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<@309634550273933314> are you okay? i saw you say you went to hospital
my only thing with that is where the thorny crown fits in still, it still matches ely's old aesthetic
anyone check in on dia? i hope he's doing okay after teri hoc title been yoinked <:FuHuaSmug:857524710223904768>
also im so curious what ely herrscher will look like, if she will have similar aesthetic to her recolor since it looks icey
i really thought she would come 5.9 because of all the good bait in 5.8.. the fuck are they gonna do in 5.9 now with vill-v
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
also if herrscher is 6.0, does that coincide with cn anni? or is that 6.1?
oh i see i see , thanks tai
og herrscher? like ely will be hoc?
what is the theory now? elysia will come back somehow in her old herrscher form to help mei defeat hoc?
i have the opposite problem
oh nvm you're saying your jy planars are actualy good <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
planar farming is a different kind of pain
i was farming all week and got fuck all

they were def being serious
no they wrote 3 more paragraphs after that
i dont know how they do these mental gymnastics <:ICANT:1091897440220745848>
lmao right
and then someone replied with this i cant believe theyre being deadass serious üíÄ
it was like 3 paragraphs but it was a decent enough summary
someone asked how blade is immortal and someone gave a thorough response summary on jingliu's quest
the blade mains server is so full of people telling lore like fanfic its crazy what these people actually believe is going on in the story
how can i kill this npc?

you guys should try positoining jy like he's looking left or right and then use his technique its hot
<:madgeslap:1062064024776360037>
that 1 fuel is the difference between having good spd boots now and having them 5 minutes from now
doesnt it accrue slower tho
I CAPPED MY FUEL
ty
i thought maybe she'd get an eid that gave her an extra follow up
like at e6 blade is 4/4 follow up instead of 5/5
kafkek doesn't have any eidolons to abuse her follow up attack right
definitely not less than 3600
owo math 90*40
me everytime i pull
dont let the game win
just a few more swipes and it's yours
damn lucky as hell

for hwo
unlucky with the lack of cr rolls but atk is good for that set
yeah not bad
when you do a swarm run and have nothing but busted dmg sigils but forget to pick up any defensive so you get one tapped by a flying fish <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>

we will keep the box blah blah
Prisoner: Shuhu
Summary of Crimes: This prisoner is accountable for numerous acts of invasions and associated war crimes.

Remarks: At present, we are unsure if he is the one sealed in the box or not... We will keep the box in the lowest level of the prison for now. It must not be opened unless authorized by the marshal and the Ten Lords altogether.
thanks to your blurb on shushu here lol
i found out where that theory came from the other day i posted about
im never unlocking this stupid fucking trace and its so triggering like what is the point of this <a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
CRUSH THEM
to guard and defend

do most turn base games operate on dual dps? is hypercarry not that popular?

hows that new set perform on him?
oh yeah thats a nice upgrade
having a rm on ur account is 100x more vauable than having hh lc
üò≠
ccp is just all up their ass man they cant do anything anymore, raking in way too much money
yeah i sawww <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
i saw they alrd nerf pink girl too which is the only one i think is kidna cute
yeah at least the designs are unique but not many are my  style either <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
i hate the ui
yall playing zzz? this game doesnt interest me at all from the streams lol
bffr
<a:yikes:859858182889144331>
wait they have actually have fx and they didnt know that? <:C_HuJerry:807167698626281492>
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
not only that but kid just tryna live.. obviously jl is not the answer
right? <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
literally so annoying just use jl <:PES5_PepeG:803737872536043531> 
üò≠
no tbh i stopped hoping maybe one day i will be pleasantly surprised <:Sadge:790930438733955092>
yeah and dont get me wrong i love seeing bronya and the others in these verses in completely unique ways, i'm just saying it may be adding to the freshness of all the men we see.. we don't have many to compare to, especially not as memorable
i only mean in the aesthetic, we've seen bronya model - its bronya, her outfit is unique but some part of this whole unit we have seen it before.. then there is one like sw who just straight up is bronie with the same hb color palette and attitude, this one i feel like has even less uniqueness imo
100% agree with you there
yea
yeah my point is, its not that unique.. it gives vibes that we've seen this before in some way
i meant it in teh broader aspect of their whole verse.. we know himeko, we know bronya, sw is basically hb, hh is referred to as sucrose, acheron is (failing) serving mei, clara has teri/klee vibes, etc
yeah all the designs look new
honestly.. this is true, a lot of the girls have very honkai/genshin feels, like you'd seen them before in some other way. this the first time hoyo has put it out so many men with the freedom they have to designs/story. maybe that is why they have an upper hand in feeling unique too <:HmmCall:1029615650815082557>
<:Deadge:942802905046581248>
she just looks like dan heng üò≠

i have the patience of something with a lot of patience

they think i will give up after 90 days of defense boots and ehr chests
its that mihoyo gives me trash and makes me feel like i'll never attain greatness that keeps me going
bro my luck is jsut as shit as everyone else
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>

<:KEKShook:1131355161298743396>
ty
<a:DIESOFCRINGE2:993217039453917244>
now that sounds like a skill issue
hp?
and dont tell me its that break effect set please i cant farm that
guys whats ruan mei relics
it is sa me issue because i wasted a shit ton of resources on  building him and i dont even use him <a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
he takes 300 years to get his ult
welt's a garbage can <:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
i dont agree with topaz and welt on the same tier <:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
om now i gotta see this <a:Run:1096961646053826700>
you are not allowed to refer to jingyuan as mid anymore
<a:alert:960403776991264798>  PSA MIDYUAN OFFICIALLY MOVED FROM MID TO S TIER <a:alert:960403776991264798> 

if you use fx skill, will it only protect from the first hit? or is her series of hits considered one action?
you know the new enemy we have this patch that will attack a few times in a row, the first one applying dizzy and the last hit sometimes causing cc
<@416445660443967491> you have fx?
<:KEKShook:1131355161298743396>
i finished it <:DK:861368415717818369>
jingyuan has the dumbest eidolon names
i havent read the convo heki i just you guys talking about topaz/clara and imo its luocha for those reasons but i forgot you had him for dhil alrd
lol
actually
yeah thats what i mean by mid -enemy turn, with luocha if your clara gets hit, he will auto cleanse you and clara will stil retaliate.. idk if that works with hh
she auto cleanses at 50%?
yeah you gotta wait your turn for it
just my opinion tho <:HmmEZ:823833820385378325>
imo luocha is better than hh for clara/topaz because you get healed every time you attack with follow up, and luocha auto cleanse on clara your tank is nice
yeah she is hard to build without crit lc üò≠ i had her around 60 for a long time
shes pretty well invested just on a rainbw set <:dead:808739535419998239>
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>

<a:danceboi:837740326390464532>
topaz clara march and luocha in swarm is so damn broken i loveeee it
i got a 5 star <:KEKShook:1131355161298743396>

<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
<:EZ:953617687735566356>

hell naur
im hungry
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

support lcs are only worth if it provides team buff, and most of the time that aint even worth it

<:HmmEvilge:991086148032036955>
<a:mhm:1046326820389273600>
<@82358863155703808> are u supposed to burst heal after furina q to fuck with the fanfare or before <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
they intend for you to work thru it the whole patch
the first part is why it feels like theres so many events phase 1 lol
no content game
<:ReallyMad:930908505890770954>
i feel like i go days and days without getting any
is it me or its hard to stack jades
<:ewww:1135378799874293770>

<:HUH:1009112689487908944>
TIME
SINGLEE
and i gotta talk to that bitch EVERY
and i lost to topaz like 10x
yeah fr i hated that!
i havent looked too much into him since im skipping
lmao
<:deadfromdrugs:850811543037411349>
ill just slow farm
this is too much work for me
i thin ktahts what greshams list is
ok that doesnt sound too bad <:DK:861368415717818369>
oh so i could go hunt path and just farm occurences in p1?
maybe im around 10 <:Really:1141123215117262908>
oh 20 right
you have to get it how many times? do we know?
yeah idk man i think i might just slow farm this last one
thanks
i wish i at least knew how far off i am
<a:DIESOFCRINGE2:993217039453917244>
thanks
didnt know it counted
okay ive seen that
ohhhh yeah
or you mean hunt appears more ifi  choose hunt
like i will randomly get the story dialogue?
right but neko said there was something i could do <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
how do i finish this
<:worrybrothers:1079909134155128892>
yeah i still dont know whats going on in the story either though tai <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122> the next chapter should be the final arc/reveal if you wanna catch up
nah i cant accept it until its done
im coping skirk reveal is not her playable model, maybe she transforms before playable <:COPIUM:816800535394517003> right now my only for sure pull plans is shenhe, cr, and clorinde
once we get a proper healing set its gonna be joever for the no-healer meta
c6 baizhu you dont even ever have to bring him out on field, he does everything off field without ever even bringing him out lol
i have c2 baizhu, he's very good.. i think he's going to be insane with furina
idk much about her cons hak just that c1 and c2 are greatly preferred over her weapon
she wants a new gen healer that heals the entire team, right now the only ones are like.. baizhu and mika <a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:952287130812571758>
^ that will be true for quite some time im sure
i think you have ot have a healer with her <:Really:1141123215117262908> baizhu over zl would probably be preferred.. im not sure how she functions with zl tbh
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
yeah i think her hyperbloom with raiden/nahi is one of the highest team comps
im saving for other gorgeous women üò≠ shenhe and cloud retainer
yep she does not need fontaine units
yea shes next week
unless she is too fun to skip, i will skip her.. i want to have a lot saved up for lantern rite
im thinking i may just get her c0r0 for now lol
wtf i thought that was a perk <a:MadgeLate:1041152916209279016>
argenti got lynx too
i didnt get shit <:Really:1141123215117262908>

üíÄ
dont mess with me <a:aPESXMas_Fight:786228586038034432>
i hope another girl gets the bitchy treatment
seele has the best ingame voicelines
clara's feet fell off a long time ago, she actually uses prosthetic legs now <:KEKShook:1131355161298743396>
istg when im playing shenhe i always stop just to stare at her for 10 mins doing different animations
i have charactesr i do that with but the old bronyas aren't one
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:KEKShook:1131355161298743396> i literally did not even know this
CRUSH THEM
TO GUARD AND DEFEND
bronyas design is really good minus the christmas ornament earrings... she looks so boss in her dress and long ass gun
yeah their models are beautiful but the dresses all have similar tailoring.. like every single one has off the shoulder, turtle neck dresses with frilly layering
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>

what is this? 3 months? can't get a drop
no cdmg once again <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
used my custom relic on yet another longevous spd boot
<a:mhm:1046326820389273600>
guina looks a lot better in model than art imo
depends on the character yeah
probably both gonna look a lot better when we get animatoins
i know what you mean lol there's not much unique about the design itself but it has enough tweaks i still think she's v pretty
i saw pc twitter talking about 'why teh designs have to be all sexy qi pao <a:aPES2_SadViolin:929006632858439731>
hes gonna shit on dhil ü´°
ratio wont be mid though
free 5 star soon
dw hsr anni is right around the corner
<:sad:887911300284428309>
but hoho will outclass him with eidolons
luocha e0 is still the best imo
she seems more like a whale/dolphin unit at the moment
lmao so true
here we go with hoyo posting art but not providing skins <:tiredge:1147515880834613349>
of course not
new food for topaz <:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>

just one luck streak
that would've been e5 in less than 400
but if i had been going for one character here:

<a:Classic:1117932592554057789>

ok i c6'd him and he now can clear 6 seconds faster than my c0 ayaka <:PES5_NerdWow:827518508409683978> <@416445660443967491> <@370438895965306882>
i handed it to him and i was like here you go, its dry and flavorless <:sajj:1067071714518892584> 
the last time i did i made steak
i cant cook either but my bf still expects me to cook for him
damn cata you fucking lucky, eli cooks everything for you huh<:ReallyMad:930908505890770954>
<:Really:1141123215117262908>
did you hear the alrechinno mains subreddit banned arle/aether art because its out of character <a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:952287130812571758>
people are so mad <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
lmao i keep seeing it on twitter
my next pick up will be cloud retainer > finish shenhe > clorinde <a:dancenezu_hh:746361236224213022>
yea thats always the problem.. too much grind sometimes <:tiredge:1147515880834613349>
that team will go nuts honestly lol
she basically just turns your healers into dps that hit 80k+
she is actually one of the strongest teams on my account, she's absolutely absurd with baizhu, nahida, koko
nilou creates a ring of water with her e, then you swap to everyone else repeatedly to do dmg.. you only swp on her to apply the ring/ult
no shes never on field
you literally have to on field him to do any dmg.. what are you doing? throwing out hsi dendro bomb and swapping over? <a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>
yeah tigh is not a sub dps
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
they havent seen his true potential yet
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
hes literally wrio except he requries a c6 faruzan
idk what wanderer is doing in t1
where are the belly dancers
i just wish they'd stop making so many layered maps like who asked for that
tbf the pyrmaid lookin ass thing was pretty cool
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
the part where we save nahida and beat wanderer's ass was so good
it was really good lol yeah
my c0 ayaka clears the same time my c4 wrio does <:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
but they fucked him
i also like his va
wrio looks and feels good to play
hot take but i hate fontaines exploration and the story is mid so far too üë©‚Äçü¶Ø
exploration though.. <:Cringe:975612628779024434> i will say its not as bad as fontaines
but the story was so good i ended up loving all of them
when i first saw sumeru characters i thought they were all mid (bar alhaitham).. now i own and love every single one (except cyno)
sumeru had the best story out of the entire story so far imo
also blind gresham for not even looking at alhaitham tho
omg based gresham <:DK:861368415717818369>
they just released an artifact set in fontaine that gives free 36% cr so a lot of these chars will end up having stupid ratios
but ayaka you had to grind the shit to get to 300 with good er, neuvilitte just gets his wep/ascend, slap one cdmg on there and its already at 250 <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
well not the norm but its becoming more and more common, neuvilette ascends with cdmg and his weapon does too, i odnt think theres any other char in teh game that does that besides ayaka <:hm:826181803626725406>
now 300 is normal in genshin
lmao yes
<:DK:861368415717818369>
300 when tho
thats the dream
<:KEKShook:1131355161298743396>
if my goal isn't to have hte best blade on na then what am i even doing
thats not bad
its teh same shit in genshin, i wonteven bother with a weapon that doesnt ascend with crit
i mean really most are
clara is really hard to build without a crit lc
lmao it is tho!
cata <:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
dhil literal placeholder for my topaz at this point
i dedicate my life and resin to blade relics
its really not
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
thats about what mine is too
idk neko maybe it just me then, i always roll cr and never cdmg
i feel like in genshin its really ahrd to roll cr but in hsr its really hard to roll cdmg
<:worrybrothers:1079909134155128892>
good now give it to someone else
roll it
but they nerf'd her anyway
we're all devastated with that
me first
ive never been lucky in my life
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
it wont be a problem
i have 10k jades
<a:dancerumia2_hh:782759053548847133>
come on lets do it
e4s5 topaz in less than 100 pulls
what are you talking about neko
gresham said he would
cant you just pull 7 hoho in 1 10 <:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
do it eli
yes
i need to find leviathan hoho simp to test out her e6 with him too <:DK:861368415717818369>
but the follow up dmg % goes up with refines no?
i mean i wouldnt put it on blade
im gonna be really tempted to go refines on that cone just to see what blade can do <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
damn nice
im still in the trace blackhole
<a:Classic:1117932592554057789>
<:ICANT:1091897440220745848> 
that day is 2 weeks, you get your first topaz set and then as you continue upgrading her, the worser piecs go to jy <:DK:861368415717818369>
yea exactly <:DeadPaimon:589276370127814674>
2pc i dont have to worry about spd tuning lol
benefits of living in messenger domain
dude no matter what istg hes always missing .01% energy
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
because i wanted to be able to burst every rot and i was dumb enough to think s2 would get me there and then it didnt and i was like this gremlin isnt even worht it
my current build for her
spd tuning is the devil
<:dead:808739535419998239>
not awful
need the last cdmg roll
you wont last <:DK:861368415717818369>
<:PES2_HmmmmNoted:849698641412096030>
she has traces too
no i dont mean just her s1
but if you end up getting heavy cdmg on all the set pieces the cr/spd one could come in handy
she gets i think 36% free cr with s1 i think
i would hold onto both of them
<:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
her eidolons look to good
i think im gonna whale on hoho
right here
üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

omg cuuute

yeah good thig <:tiredge:1147515880834613349>
<a:exit:998945504257921214>

WHATEVER ITS GOOD
<a:Modcheck:1033094910712230119>
u had hp and full crit roles
what
stfu
ive seen ur boots
bro
<a:NOSHOT:1137423060153143306>
those boots <:bladesob:1113435864018726994>
<a:skillgib:975244908090781787>
we‚Äôll suffer together <:bladesob:1113435864018726994>
just cant get these damn boots
solid.. ive got like 5 cdmg at this point <:bladesob:1113435864018726994>
i just crafted 15 boots and 3 were spd but still no cdmg kms
i cant believe ive been farming this blade relic domain since release and havent got a single spd boot with cdmg sub
<:tiredge:1147515880834613349>
jl has a load of her own lore in her archive and somehow every single thing ive learned about her was from her text.. i didnt get a single crumb shown to me in her own quest
maybe its more complicated and df had just lost too much in his life, baiheng was just the tipping point for him. hopefully its not the end of this story because for the most part i agree, i was kinda pissed when i finished that quesr
worth the wait
but anyway if all this is true all i can say is i said it first dh is a fucking loser
i think (cope) maybe theyre leaving something out with blade still which is why they refuse to give us his companion quest <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
but apparently its df to yx
i thought it was yx saying this to df<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
yeah man idk what to say.. also i literally just realised that conversation he references about yx understanding sacrifice and df not
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
df: okay im ready wheres the flesh of abundance?
yx: oh.. i got hungry
‚ò†Ô∏è
this is now the only canon i can accept
‚ÄúHow did blade get immortalized? How does he have the ‚Äúflesh of emanator‚Äù? Did he eat shuhu‚Äôs rotten corpse while no one was looking?‚Äù
im reading it now but i had to stop for a sec
ill put the spd boots back on when i get a spd boot with cdmg sup <a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
hes perfect the way he is
theres nothing to fix

it doesnt feel like it, he's only going once
like yea the dmg is bigger but i prefer blade going more
omg right? this shit aint it <:Really:1141123215117262908>
maybe he really is then
oh seriously?
idk
well maybe it is in cn..

he is
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>

but i was thinking of her en va
no she doesn't uh idk
and i was thinking to myself how good mei jp was, even when she was ara ara hot she didn't have ara ara voice
someone was saying it doesn't even fit the context of her character in this trailer
i was reading so many comments this morning about how sick of ara ara voice they are after jl trailer lol
<a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>

thats pretty cool

oh wow

not SSS ive failed fhim
whats your dot team?
yea
<:PU_PepeEZ:531790526786306048>
but its so hard with the spd <:dead:808739535419998239>
so much room for improvement still
omg congrats thats so cool!
i never get spd on my ropes
this mfer raining spd on ropes
<a:mhm:1046326820389273600>
helllll naur dont waste that spd on clara <a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
<a:Run:1096961646053826700>
i said waht i said
im sorry

yeah
gresham not everyone has asta <a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
<:dead:808739535419998239>
but she want spd boots right?
wait
<a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
but then they suffer in spd
i want more cdmg badly on all my units
i notice i can never get busted cv
wtf that is so lucky
hows my topaz looking <:Really:1141123215117262908>
my life owuld be so much easier if i could just... not have to worry about speed <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
im still running this <:Really:1141123215117262908>
yeah hes plenty good
idk actually it was just a trace domain <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
that fuckin seele is a one man show
like my blade does dmg but he still need his support
but man after using that seele e6 he dont compare to the dmg she shills
yea hes so comfy to play
lucky
i dont have a SINGLE spd boot with cdmg on it
hypercarry means your dps is doing the majority of the dmg, carrying the full team.. clara/topaz are two dps split for full team carry. not the same. <:PES2_HmmmmNoted:849698641412096030>
i do but she's usually tied to blade
i know im just looking for comps outside clara coz rn clara is all i have for her and i want to be able to run topaz hyper
ok ill do that then
my clara is disgusting with blade's lc but i kind of would rather build around topaz to see her do big number
maybe hanya can work with her if she needs asta spd buff
unlucky
asta and himeko kind of play into buffing topaz, whereas clara is the otehr way around
<@370438895965306882> i dont have asta or himeko built and i dont intend to build them.. am i a flop topaz main? <:Really:1141123215117262908>

<@416445660443967491> i  gotta pee
heki's pings crack me up, they're always so fucking random
they dont even offer paper bags here, i have to bring my own shit
you used to be able to put them in bags but now you have to bring your own bag
you put them in a cart and move them to the car after you pay for them
they just keep walking until they find a store that does
its actually crazy, like they're doing the work for these corporations
no like you actually go to the store and you pick it up and bring it home yourself
they do, these peasants leave their house and actually go to the grocery store
alrd cleard it <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
yeah destro's gold roll allows you to turn one blank and gain the rewards
if you use your pulls right now you could use it <:DK:861368415717818369>
because im drawing a blank with any sort of usefulness in that path
maybe it was elation
<:PES_Think:639363477458255874>
no abundance is the mercy one <:HMM:966625453194485760>
and the destro one where you can make a blank domain
i like that one
which path is it that you get to jump tiles
if its all you use, you prob a seele haver
im just saying
i know im not blind
all my chars are follow up <:DK:861368415717818369>
i only use elation destro and abundance
spot the seele abuser <:DK:861368415717818369>
ive never finished with hunt
i tried jy last night but i get fucked i nthe end as always <a:gunpull:1145875569179906079> my signet luck was trash tho will try again

in this economy 2pc 2pc is okay on everyone <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
i dont think it will take much to replace bronya, its not even that bronya gives the cdmg share that makes her so cracked, its that damn skill that is so broken
was it hanabi?
fr you think the line up looks stacked now, its joever once they start on those 5 star harmonys <:COPIUM:816800535394517003>
<:DK:861368415717818369>

idk hsr schedule

we love you gresh <a:patlao2:1027877178387468308>
because every pull he does its a 5 star
thing is it doesnt even matter for gresham
you're not stopping at e1 good joke
<:ohnoswipe:961788853486780466>
we know
imagine complaining about e2 bronya <a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>
omg i literally cant with that guy
3
oh yeah thats what i meant
he can ll twice in the same turn?
if you get 142 on jingyuan does he go twice in the same turn
i also just stacked her with a fuckton of defense, didnt pay mind to much else
worth a shot
<a:mhm:1046326820389273600>
i odnt like gep on her because then she starts taking more hits over my clara <a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
do you have march's?
when you're grinding it is long stfu
<a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
what kind delusion
70/80
mine is pretty garbo rn too lc is lvl 60, u rly just need her to proc a shield and the sigils will do the rest
any askers?
her blade luocha and march/gepard would be pretty good, double sustain isn't bad in there either. i've been running clara a lot in there with march because the destro+pres path really makes them tank/hit.. my clara does have whale build but i made it to the end with only 3 elation sigils and she still cleared after a long fight with no deaths because of all the defense i had stacked up. i always just take as much defense as i can and pick up dmg second
do you have clara i cant remember
yeah it does take a long time
noooooooooo
i've found going destruction is really comfortable if you can get the golden preservation sigil that provides shield at start and upgrade it at the end
are you stuck on an elite or the final boss?
what team are you using tet
fuxuan not looking so impressive right now from what i've seen
luocha is good for that too
you haven't built pela? <:HUH:1009112689487908944>
omg thanks <:PES5_CuteHiThere:815524041486106655>

<a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>

<:omE:1021572030119821342>
the grind never stops <:tericross:902580093304586320>
its the martini occurence
2 more days until fx saves midyuan
i jsut streamed for an hour but my hoyo pages says i still have 0 hours <:Really:988350458659762186> why
wow gepard lc looks really good for her <:bladegasp:1136513716788133948>
so now it makes me want to hold on to self model longer for shit like this
i still havent got a single drop for keel er rope
and i dont regret it because guess what
now i have 2 self model resin just sitting there because i dont wanna use them since i used the rest of them on 4 er ropes
istg the best thing you can do with your self model is just make an er rope on keel atm
yep
<a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>

2 more to go
<a:NOSHOT:1137423060153143306>
<@309634550273933314> is there acheivement for finishing with 1k frags? or is it like something ridic like 9k
i swear to fucking god diff5 is rigged so sw ALWAYS applies the wrong weakness
omg same
<:KEKShook:1131355161298743396>
so like if bladie is 138 and bonya is 137 right now i go blade > bronya > blade currently.. if i got 143 blade and 142 bronya, what does that do?
<:PES5_Noted:804692177249894430>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
or am i reading it wrong
147 for 3t? i thought it was 142 üò≠
damn what the hell
<:tiredge:1147515880834613349>
whats her cap
isnt that a heavy hit to her attack
oh wow you're doing the hp for ting?
salsotto it is
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
shes so pretty how can i not, would love to use her in open world
i have this for jl <:DK:861368415717818369>
so actually salsotto best for me right?
ohhhh
i like topaz but she uses rutilant right
but im up to 4 er keel ropes so it would be more like.. min maxing bronya farm at this point, could still use a wind rutilant orb but salsotto probably better for me at this point if farming for blade/jy
yeah its between salsotto or more keel farming
yea but which one <:dead:808739535419998239>
i cant decide waht to farm <:Really:988350458659762186>
how did it roll

<:dead:808739535419998239>
ew
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>

<:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
is anyone able to clear this without a shield <a:eyeroll:574721171548012569>
this is so fucking annoying dude
mfer's supports cant survive
bruh how does that flop ass daniel survive in 5 using propagation main path?
i literally fell asleep on my phone playing last night at like 12 am lol
just have to clear 5 one more time and its done
<:seelepls:1069254242554093618>
but yea the preservation super op <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
i always stuck with abundance
when i ran destro in su before i never tried it with preservaiton
will finish tree after work.. except the golden cylinders <:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520> that will take some time ig
abundance is good too, for blade though im enjoying destro rn and it almost feels infallible lol
destruction+preservation = invincible <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
this is iv with disruption 6 but i tried it in diff5 last night too and it works exactly the same
ive been grinding swarm so hard i forgot to burn my stam and overcapped <:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
im just grinding
i know it doesnt have tobe one
its too late ill just do another one rq <:tiredge:1147515880834613349>
i tried ur method lumi and it was working but jy died on the second plane <a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
<:looking:1144614223041810453> ill wait
ohhhh
i gave it fortune after i used it alrd
oh yeah thats what i did
i gave it a curio i think...
yea

i just got that one and ive done so many runs lol
i havent got it yet
is it?
yea they make it look so welcomig
this card is ass
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
whats the cheat code for this one
it makes supports hit like a dps <:KEKShook:1131355161298743396>
propagation sigil is so fun
jingyuan should be with all the aoe but im struggling with him <:PES2_MadgeDistort:888440873061339168>

sir.. <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
yea but it makes it so much easier to build stacks and get multiple turns/energy
i hate that elation gets paired with rememberance and abundance <:PU_peepoEyeRoll:773561804622266378> why two defensive rolls
why though? he likes spd and attack <:PES2_MadgeDistort:888440873061339168>
got my ass kicked in on the last phase <:Sadge:790930438733955092>
pray for me <:Woke:759887282042830889>
trying to decide if i should go back to salsotto for blade/jy or keep farming keel <:dead:808739535419998239>
LETF GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
this is the last one i need
i just did diff4, using abundance, and nothing happened
mine is 9
what do you mean?
<:bladegasp:1136513716788133948>
omg look at this beasthttps://
<a:Modcheck:1033094910712230119>
anyone?
what does htis mean? how do i unlock? abundance is already higher than 8 in tree
IT IS
one more to go<:pog_hh:808435351617142845>
how much longer til i unlock propagation üò≠
<:bladegasp:1136513716788133948>
omg i just got both those lottos and the adventure barrel domain was next <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<:Really:988350458659762186>
death by trotter
here lie tingyun and sw
surely this will end well
<:bladegasp:1136513716788133948>
that trotter just wiped sw from existence
of course there is <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
fr guys does it matter what im choosing here? whats the purpose of this?
if i'd pulled gep before bai i would've just used him tho
yeah i use bai and lu too
who are your sustainers gresh
for as long asyou can
hold on to that <:life:1001518241610485781>
i may or may not have cleared 300 the first week
someone hand me a weapon so i can kms
i pulled on standar
<:whip:1024122299034632272>
we're all out here grinding
<:PES5_Noted:804692177249894430>
oh i hsould run hunt for this?
the hunt?
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
i tried when my tree had like nothing and couldn't get past ssecond boss
bronya cleans up so often with it and propagation
that fucking space eidolon is so good
no but i usually choose blessing over curio
the power of the tree lol
it was actually a lot easier
<:pog_hh:808435351617142845>
ayo i actually cleard!
its joever
i made it to diff5 final boss but my count is 3 <:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
nihility is prob the worst for me, rememberance and perservation arne't bad if i get the right one for my team
i think rememberance, nihility and perservation are the paths i like never use
wow swarm just gave me all rememberance sigils for no reason <a:Modcheck:1033094910712230119>
4 star i mean
rare breed
it is nice tho when u can find a super strong 5 star and invest in them like that
<:Clueless:947671183103508530>
surely
i thought you benched him and eveyrone else for qq like a month ago <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
ill be honest
<:hm:826181803626725406>
lol im pretty sure gresham's qq is holding his s5 midjyuan lc <:omE:1021572030119821342>
ive been playing genshin for 3+ years and i still dont have a circlet with more than 12cr
<a:Classic:1117932592554057789>
i still havent been able to get a crown, roll it
how is blade good fro that
<:pog_hh:808435351617142845>
is there anyone else thats good for the games besides dhil/kafka?
<:Really:988350458659762186>
you have fuel stockpiled?
oof
surely the sigils can help tho
whats her ratio
lmfao
same
idk i should've asked them lol but they said they only celar coz enemy never got a turn
hunt/elation is so good, the prop is really good too.. with midbibitor if you can stack a lot prop+spd (hunt) it makes the swarms a lot easier
because they got all hunt sigils on seele and the swarm didnt get a turn
and clear diff5
someone in wfp didnt finish their tree
what paths are you doing
<:omE:1021572030119821342>
its taking FOREVEr to level up the tree
i havent cleared 5
i can in 3 and 4
<a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
you're fucking cheating neko
<:PES2_MadgeDistort:888440873061339168>

<a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
<a:skillgib:975244908090781787>
the way blade just takes out entire swarms with his follow up is so satisfying <:PES5_CuteHiThere:815524041486106655>
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
i want bronya so bad im tempted to pull on standard <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
i guess i wasnt lol

<a:begging:1100153544461529200>
can blade propagate <:PES_Think:639363477458255874>
NOOOOOOOOOOO
and i ahve 3 destro and 3 elation and i didnt get either double
but i chose abundance
same
i thought you only needed 3 sigils
how the hell do you get the double path
<a:mhm:1046326820389273600>
should you avoid swarm domains if you're not running propagation?
literally didnt even make it past monke
<a:jerry:864556009874522152>
the worst part of this swarm is that i dont have my ult on final boss <:tiredge:1147515880834613349>
or do i want ot go all over
but do i want to just go direct to the boss
what route should i go
someone explain this to me like i'm 5
on the FIRST AD
its taking 2 rotations
i just started tortorous
<:HUH:1009112689487908944>
ohh ty!
how do i know what double paths are available in swarm
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
absolute luck sac
wow
in what world
pack it up midbibitor pullers, the cn bros have spoken and in two weeks he's just another trash dps unit and blade is back on top
<@370438895965306882>
yea thats the only reason i ended up clearing coz of that mercy cheat
i kept trying to keep it above 0 so i would tyr to make a straight path to the boss but then i'd end up with barely any sigils
yea
<:Derple:646956861861658624>
and how do you manage keeping it that way
are you trying to keep the tile count low or high
so
but i cleared 4 last night with abundance<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
i didnt get around to trying it tyet
<:worrygibdudu:936074075074342912>

im just waiting for fx and i will try him, his relics are mediocre af so its not helping lol
i did try clara though and she worked fine for first half
i haven't tried jy yet <:HMM:966625453194485760>
embrace who you are
<a:Peepo_Gaming:837615065410568213>
ah
i dont think yaqning has qua weakness
tell me how that fairs im curious
i did run ting on 2nd but midbibitor takes him out fast enough it doesn't matter.. yanqing hurts if you don't kill him fast enough
first half you just suffer from dots, second half there is a lot of heavy one shot type dmg
i did use him on yanqing but i think he might be preferred for tough due to the all the wind shear, depend on how quick you can take out the minotaurs or 2nd half i suppose
<a:YattaGive:974402839646449714>
i hope you lose your guaranteed

its pretty cute and she also mentions his home world was destroyed
in it she talks about blade, she met him when he was still a child craftsman
dunno if u guys have found it yet but there is a book written by baiheng called View of the Universe from a Starskiff: The Xianzhou Zhuming

dan heng is such a bitch man
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
i wish she was future proo like kafka
man i wanna pull for topaz but shes gonna be powercreep soon
he shares my thoughts
ive been talking about this with da wei for awhile
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
he's not wrong unfortunately. its just the way he goes about it. he didn't do this kind of segment for anyone else, it's so obvious he just wants to throw in a kafka-is-better caveat into his video *because* he's the best damage dealer since seele.. without addressing any of her own issues like, oh idk, have fun building a dot team that has the same relevancy as jingyuan's damage until a 5 star dot dealer comes out. and don't forget, the most relevant dot dealers are going to be 5 stars from this point. if you're investing kafka, you're only investing in kafka. if you're investing in a hypercarry, you're using supports that are universal and can be shared.. like right now. not 6 months from now.
midbibitor lunae
not mr pokke making a 20 minutes segment in his dhil video about future proofing just so he can say yeah he's good but he's not kafka <:ICANT:1122863033979506809>
next year for sure this time, its the special 5 year mark <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
nihility
i remember
literally just the 10 pull. remember how last year they initially were going to sell a glider and the community dogpiled them so they gave it for free? this year they're selling the glider. generous hoyo. <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
thats another free clog to my inventory
hey i get a cake every birthday
then let me put it on lumie so i can remember <:ReallyMad:971219475045154856>
you know whats crazy to me is the amount of trinkets we pick up along the way that we can't even use.. like that inazuma mask from the festival, it just sits there in our inventory. why? nobody knows.
blade first
thats more than me <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
well u got a roll int ospd
idk anything about samp sorry <:Sadge:816798647760584757>

idk but blade mains says cdmg
wasnt that changed to cdmg
maybe someone in that circus knos
let me ask blade mains
we've had this discussion multiple times and no one can give me a definitive answer
i just want to go back to blade domain
and im so sick of farming for his stupid ass
im missing cdmg il STILL
suck my dick heki
without it enemy has a chance of going first and thats nagl <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>

its the 2pc that kills it in hsr, genshin just require the 1 4pc which is still ass but hsr want you to do two on set
exactly its so hard getting spd
i got this one for dhil but i think hes gonna use cdmg chest üò≠
let me see <:binoculars:1048675942261858304>

hi neko <a:aPES2_Wave:552223735139139594>
oh ty <:Derple:646956861861658624>
tahts the name of the clip
anyone know the name of the song playing in jy trailer
no doubt
fr i had to exit the clip when he start typing on that notepad with her RIGHT behind him
yes so cringe
imagine fighting over a dude that never leaves his computer or clean a single room in his house his entire life
adept at the top again <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
you remind me to check on lsf
so pathetic
so ridiculous, all guoba did was make a snarky comment on his vid and then immediately delete it, and this dude still had to go make a 3 part video drama about it
my bad
it was actually blade related
i totallly forgot
oh
i only know of him because a couple weeks ago there is this newer genshin tcer named smack daddy that got into a rift with him over the dumbest shit ever.. this dude smack daddy even got tectone involved just dogpiling the guy for something so irrelevant, i'll never watch him again lol (not gouba but the other dude)
are you talking about his drama with genshin or he did something else?
the genshin one?
ty
whats her yt? i dont know her
honestly.. i was watching his vids every now and then, i opeend his debut kafka vid last week and the bias was so bad in the first 5 mins i couldn't even make it through
pokke posted a new jy vs kafka video
i cant with this community
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961> <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961> <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
you should bench jy and pull kafka unless hes e4+ <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
im a big vertical believer <:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
yeah it also depend if ur horizontal or vertical too
i 100% get that reasoning, its just my personal opinion if you cant pull the dps+lc then wait for another dps. like most supports still outshine without lc, thats definitely a new char more important than a weapon thing. i just think not getting wep for ur dps is gimping urself. f2p shouldnt be pulling dps often and should rather pull support and save enough for dps+cone when theyre rdy. just my opinion tho obv heki and anyone else should play however they prefer in pve <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<@781539392039682058> are you on 50/50 id say just burn all on e0s1 and burn whatevers left on fx, full skip next patch

wow that was ass
I DOTN THINK SO COZ I GOT JACK SHIT THIS MORNING
STARTIN
come onnn star the strimm
her sales look really close to blade's
how many days left on kafka?
the pacing in this game is truly agonizing rn
better be a 4 hour long epilogue then
is that a spoiler or
2 hours left for stream <a:mfwshake:878631990730059786>
theres no way to know how long its gonna take u lol its like pulling the banner with no pity
my blade relics are decent and i spent 60+ fragile on top of farming every day with full daily resin for 3 weeks
thats not wasted midyuan is SSS tier
wasting hua va on that design smh
<a:smadging:1034847088737005628>
he looks so puppy in top right
some sweet midjyuan for the soul <:PES5_CuteHiThere:815524041486106655> 
i will only e2s1 <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
ty tet
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
but even better if he wants cr since i have a good cr chest
he gets a lot of cr from trace/lc
idk about that one cheif
ive only been farming a week and tbh all im missing is a cdmg chest for a decent copium build <:KusaHehe_Axiliyah:992975299446845460>
i thought you have been farming for him for quite a while? <:HUH:1009812797040889896>
<a:Y_PepeClap:792820714704470027>
yea you should definitely do that
its easy <:EZ:836143275021959189>
in midyuan case you save for the lc then save for him
well said
always a good play too
i said it before and ill say it again, whatever dps you choose you sholud always save for their lc
<:waiting:1027534309298544640>
how he plays though we'll see
he deals a lot of dmg for sure
<:EZ:836143275021959189>
i wont be able to to mono img anyway coz im not taking lu from blade
you regret pulling on luocha?
idk heki maybe you're right and it will be one of his best teams, i'm not an hsr expert.. the biggest talk i see with him always routes back to ting/pela tho
2
yeah im doing ting/pela
<:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
that is way too much sp
also i dont think you will want to run welt with dhil if that's what you mean
the lower the spd, the less turns you get as the fight goes on
im pretty sure even if your'e going first with 104, you wouldn't be by the end of the fight
im not sure, ill try to find out what the spd sets are in moc
his base is 102
i cant imagine he doesn't want spd boots, there's no bonya on his team to help him out and you dont want your supports to go > enemy turn > then dhil
midyuan
bonya is the only one i know that wants 164 for special hyper teams
134 is the breakpoint for 2 turns on 0 cycle 
i dont have kafka but the vids i see its just delayed dmg, like everyone goes and then your dmg hits
does it function the same as hsr?
is it actually?
i put her in a team with story relic and my dot sampo and she clear moc in 300 turn
actually kafka requires no investment
<a:patlao2:1027877178387468308>
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
not f2p relics you did that domain more than once
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
he must've pissed off some kafka fans with this one
this vid got 16 dislikes
F2P Jing Yuan is bad
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
but it will have to wait coz dhil is calling <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
i need 5 more spd and 20% more cdmg <:dead:808739535419998239>

has it been mentioned at all in the lore previously? like is this past or present?
tf is the jepella rebellion?
like we're about to go eat dinner with kafka and hes gonna serve us
he 100% does
TO JUSTICE
ill bring both of you
in that case
<:PES5_DankGun:827518509373456404>
how am i ever gonna convince anyone she does good dmg if i cant get a decent 100k+ screenshot <:ReallyMad:971219475045154856>
thats exactly why kafka sucks
when i sayy invest more i dont mean with money i mean with relics/traces to the dps and team üò≠
<a:KEKsip:961615405464563752>
explain this then 
<a:KEKsip:961615405464563752>
dont people just run sw/ting+healer with her if no dot
jingyuan is mid
wdym? i heard she's the best dps in the game <:HUH:1009812797040889896>
<:KusaGasp2:1024101486076117082>
its funny he voiced both jy and cyno.. cyno was also probably the most mid unit from sumeru
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122> 
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
are kafka and luocha from the same world?
these nihility event mats are so nice, can level up my sw and welt a bit more without farming <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
no yeah you have to level his na <:dead:808739535419998239>

thats coz the companion quest are basically the story quest version of genshin
<a:believer:1018349083800379482>
it amaze me this game have so little content and they cant even give a long companion quest
<:PES5_DankGun:827518509373456404>
yeah thats fucking bullshit
cant you find him in the fight club now?
same difference carv
mr i pulled kafka and hime in 10
wth are you mad about
im inhaling that my jingren copium so hard rn
at the end blade says he needs to speak to someone
i also heard
<:PES5_DankGun:827518509373456404>
and i cant evne do the quest when it comes up coz ill still be at work
you're fucking tellin me
stfu neko
lmao
whats the secret threesome ending
what answer do i need to give kafka for her to hand over blade's leash
lmao
i want to say yes but
<:thinking:823956695469654017>
wait you dont even get to do the quest if yo usay no? or you say no and it starts over?
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
they should
<:haroldcringe:854639707958673408>
i know you get achievement for saying no, did you get achievement saying yes?
lil bro NA still not live for another 5 hours
no it didnt he got her for free basically
imagine being lucky
<@82358863155703808> i saw spoiler that kafka says dhil/blade were good friends but bad for eachother, it sound like she confirmed this sin of dhil was committed by both of them. since blade is a craftsman, maybe dhil snuck him into vidyahara center so blade could build something for him for this big crime? <:hm:826181803626725406>
so really <:Shruge:1135237627562446908>
its just you have to invest in dot units
kafka is good for f2p
still 10 hours for na
<:pog_hh:808435351617142845>
is blade in it
deserved
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>

<a:duckass:1121931766597435443>
omg congrats on your baldie <:bladeHUH:1132194991997976606>
i think i will just get dhil and fx and call it good for a bit
she's too demanding, i dont have a single dot unit built and i cant afford to sink resources into an entire new team rn
<:Sadge:816798647760584757>
is anyone in here even pulling kafka
yea
i cant stand how bad he is when he gets imprison
i think that fuxuan will help jy a lot
just to keep everyone alive
i had to use fmc on svarog
this shit be hitting hard af this moc <a:jerry:864556009874522152>
woah triple crown gepard <a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>

guys
üë©‚Äçü¶Ø
yyeah it comes and goes in waves.. that kiana patch was absolutely brutal for me. you would think that special supply for hoo would be a deal, im pretty sure it cost me more to 3s hoo than it did hoh. and i went to hard pity every single time for the elf. it was disgusting.
my genshin luck feels similiar to hi3.. i'll have some streaks of good luck here and there. hsr hurts every time though <:seelepls:1069254242554093618>

i have only won 50/50 twice
i dont think ive ever claimed 60 lol
yea impretty sure thats the max you can claim at once
sometimes its 2 sometims 4 sometimes 10
yyeah i have no idea coz i just login sporadically throughout the day and claim
<:Shruge:1135237627562446908>
how to be stellr
<:worrybrothers:1079909134155128892>

im mostly thinking of actual traces/ascension mats lol
and i dont even wanna think about lynx/fuxuan
im having to work on welt <:Deadge:966011458691416124>
some day though
oof yeah i chose not to invest in her for now
CONGRATS!
SAVOR IT FOR MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
THAT PARADISE MAY BE UNREACHABLE FOR ME
FUCK
<a:patlao2:1027877178387468308>
<a:KEKsip:961615405464563752> cute
and i cant get a single fucking relic for 3 weeks to save my ass
i have to pay for everything
i do
oh i thought you mean hsr seele
you say that like i did
i fucking hate you
thats like a week old with your slow ass
i would prob use the first one for spd
better than mine
i swear i have the most cursed hsr account
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
when will it be my tur
not a single good drop
hp ropes are useless on keel and great for the other set <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
thats literally what im saying tho
<a:classic:1106936806756319344>
i just did my first planar drop and got 4 broken keel hp ropes with cracked stats
gib ME better gear
<:seelepls:1069254242554093618>
killed on her purpose so you could see this dmg without her <:EZ:836143275021959189>
<a:catjam:870348154422329345>
he just needs a name change
dr ratio looks promising
by that i mean hes just very godlike and royal and anyone else beneath him
i read his some of his voicelines and bio from next patch and he sounds like an asshole <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961> 
idk he is still just so very pretty to me, jy/blade have sex energy
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
dhil is pretty but jy and blade are h o t
the only pull to make
but like who wants to live by those rules when blade and jy exist
i think f2p best move is seele and dhil teams
literaly just whatever is next
topaz
<:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
on yours?
in well invested account probably
i need new story today <a:Dies:1008341585085337711>

<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
it just says unnecessary
what is this
also
it probably only accounts for personal dmg and not the path buff
i hit 1.1m with blade in su yesterday
yeah i have those but the highest is only 700 something
rip i guess it doesn't account for su total hit dmg <a:KEKsip:961615405464563752>
oh i found it
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
it tells you what you hit in game?
that doesn't tell you what you hit tho
<@309634550273933314> is there acheivement that records your biggest hit like genshin has?
the difference is negligible and i'd rather have the benefit of gearing my support while i farm
im basicaly just farming rutilant and using crafted pieces for salsotto
if you're e0 rutilant is better anyway
another week of garbage su relics <a:crying:682697447226867725>
we're gacha players we never had that ability
the main stat idiot
aint no fucking way yanqing is included but dhil isnt
love this game
and it all rolled defense
<:Really:988350458659762186>
üôè
pls god let it roll good
omg i finally got my custom relic from bp
probably gonna go 100% break effect
but not even rolled and no spd
yeah i got this for him at least <:DK:861368415717818369>
far from it but i dont have a choice but to farm for dhil lol i dont even have a single one of those imaginary relics
i have to start farming dhil once kafka comes <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
there 8d left on blade right
thast not til wed i dont have patience
today i will get a wind piece with cr cd hp and spd
time to do su
<:Doubt:455428799572606978>
if he does get the jump off with me two hits dont kill my bronya <:duduL:963697489179975710>

login click daily, kill trotter, logout
no content game <:DK:861368415717818369>
this is every patch
im trying so very hard not to read the story spoilers üë©‚Äçü¶Ø
you should aim for 70/140~ i think, but that's dependent on how much cr you can get without his sig. he does get a lot of cr elsewhere, like trace and relics so i think you should be able to do it. if you have bronya you can just run hp boots, but spd is going to be ideal.
im not sure how much is attainable without his sig
600803617
he doesnt have a talent but he has some taunt just by being destro
how is this my 3rd cdmg body and this is still somehow the best one
im just now getting around to forcing myself thru it
same dude
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
<@82358863155703808> iwtl first tip was the one you're trying to explain to me yesterday <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122> 
<a:duckass:1121931766597435443>
you're not anymore?
yeah he looks rally solid for moc
if i get her it would be a total waste
but i havent decided on fuxan still
ive been debating building my gepard <:thinking:823956695469654017>
i just hate kids in general, especially bratty ones. he and scaramouche would have a grand ole time together
yanqing is where i draw the line
yes
lol im sorry i cant take any of your opinions seriously now
<a:duckass:1121931766597435443>
ill kill you lumi
yes i do
dont i like the most attractive character in the game?
reroll
yeah
whale
congrats tho!
if u had my luck ud have pulled bailu
it sucks without a cleanse or tank
to try to avoid the imprisons
i use fmc/jy/ting/bailu here

<:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
theres a difference here
i spent 3k fuel
<a:classic:1106936806756319344>
our spd and cr is exactly the same
wtf it is p good alrd üò≠
and now whats he look like with all your crackt pieces
LFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
omg
not on my watch
a beast at losing
<:PES5_DankGun:827518509373456404>
dont ever fucking say that gaain
yanqing is not part of the quintet
<:DK:861368415717818369>
dhil+blade first half and jingliu+jy on second
when jingliu comes out im gonna do a full moc clear with only cloud quintet
<:bladeknife2:1129129046714880080>
üôè
<:Really:988350458659762186>
i have no fuel <:OkaygeBusiness:893571936658026496>
and my relics aRE DOGSHIT
im -3000+ resin at this point
i hate you
whered u read that?
i am so lost lmao
what is going AWN in this story
wait so did jy free dh?? not dhil? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i need it to be next patch alrd <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i cant even get crit rolls much less spd
impossible
it was jy/dhil? where was it from?
i can't find it now
but it's okay maybe what i saw awhile ago was fake
oh i think this is older text lore though
death in general when it comes to the quintet
i know, it just feels like semantics atp
<a:classic:1106936806756319344>
maybe i got hit with a misinformation nancy
<@82358863155703808> bro i looked everywhere, i even went back to try to find the tweet but it was deleted
is it? <a:oprahomg:826656660264452107>
lmao maybe you should've killed him 3x
rip sry fenri
i can't find it.. <@218762069338619906> do you have any idea what i'm talking about?
yeah that's why i thought it might be him
was it his lc?
let me see if i can find it
<:dead:808739535419998239>
nanook saved him? <:huh:966619839307321394>
yeah well they say she killed blade a million times and he's still walking around crying about being alive
bronya speed 
<:CatCry:762687771432845332>
i wish they give us some answers already
i'm wondering if that is the same moment from jingyuan's cinematic when he killed her
something about the darkness, jingliu killing him repeatedly, and then a man with eyes as golden as the sun saving him
there is a character story on blade
especially since she's out there still looking for his ass
but killing him as a test dummy?
i know she killed him over and over
is this actual lore i missed or just reddit being reddit
wind is marginally better but if you have better subs on hp its fine
bitch im farming every day i cant pull good relics out my ass<a:collapse:859859231503417344>
wind
<:derp:960359265032339496>
because it consumes all that hp
i thought you're supposed to use his ult first before the skill
so i wait for bronya > advance to blade > then use bronya ult?
ohh
idgi <:thinking:823956695469654017>

oh god

because im  not doing it
nothing
oh im gonna run
if you want to play with yukong you could use her over asta too
luocha-blade-pela-asta
seele-tingyun-natasha-fmc or clara
step 1 pull bronya
hua better be broken or its joever for hoyo
im not waiting for hua
im sorry but the man meat in this game is too hard to ignore
didn't he? or he just stop at s5? <a:classic:1106936806756319344>
heki investing in a mono ima team so she's only ever able to complete fights that are qua or ima
i would only pull for blade if you want him
hell naur fontaine starts in 20 days
i only took lu to 8 and thats prob where he's gonna stay <a:classic:1106936806756319344>
they're both trash trust me jermy
hes my only one cata
yes he is
tec is pretty bad too
who do you guys think is the most annoying hoyo streamer and why is sekapoko
you can get away with hp boots using bronya but even then the opitmal way is as much spd as possible
he's slow af
yes you do
omg congrats!!! <a:oprahomg:826656660264452107> you just need to stack hp/crit/spd if you can
<a:PopcornMunch:751417674277322834>
its an all out ship fight lfg
i just visited the hsr subreddit
im in <a:hacker:998945514894671912>
every time i go back he's still trying to clear su 7 üò≠
ive had envi's stream playing in the bg at work for like 3 hours now
<:wow:1012493633968160880>
woah tet is such a lao
never go to the blade mains server then
idk i wasnt paying attention
and skipping lc supports
honestly if you want the real deal, you should always be saving for lc on a dps
big shocker
so just focus on farming out his team and he'll be fine
from what i've heard his dmg will be competitive with seele
every time people are talking about it her fans are like wow dont be sexist, the man made his choice um... listen little teeny bopper, you really think that affair started AFTER she left her husband? you really just absolve her of her own actions knowingly becoming involved with a married man just because she have a boob? do you believe in santa claus too?
cringe as hell
i saw a clip that compiled her entire relationship history and every single one involved cheating <:haroldcringe:854639707958673408>
bruh ariana is gross as hell
pulling for automode <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
i just dont know if i would enjoy playing him
he will definitely be a very good dps
he wont suck
so thats a flop
well im not taking luocha away from blade
ill have to see it in action coz i have no idea what you're telling me rn
and if i somehow mess up or need a heal from luocha, it's very forgiving in that he's still gonna do his dmg if he starts on 0 sp
but he also isn't using his skill for 3-4 turns
i will wait for the vod <:Evilge:960548412271505418>
did you?
nope
<a:dancerumia2_hh:782759053548847133>
hes so awesome
i am so happy for you tet
but since you're on 50/50 you could burn it on his banner and if you don't get him, it's jingliu <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
yeah
and dhil looks like the opposite
blade's spoiled me too much with how efficient his sp is
im kind of waiting it out to see how he plays
tough call
<:thinking:823956695469654017> K

i heard blade is the only e0 that can solo moc <:DK:861368415717818369>
impossible
blade can't die
gets all the babes
blade truly living his best life
if the deal he made with elio was to basically give his autonomy to kafka or she actually cares about him
i'm still so curious how their relationship came about
what does she say again? something about i can't have you two and my bladie right? lol
about how the cn trans is different?
the dialogue allows you the option to say hi bladie! and he tells us he'll kill us if we ever call him that again <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
if you don't talk to the kid first you can find blade at the statue
there's a part where this kid says something about a weirdo staring at dhil statue
have you guys talked to blade from the event quest?
so much beautiful blade this morning <:BAALWOW:871937442192699403>

but sals got the defense with it so it's better for me to just keep farming the new one
yeah arena is just for blade and its competitive with salsotto anw
i really need to farm for bronya man but i also need to keep farming blade and his -300 spd
yeah
i put the keel one on luocha

with that sp cost you will need a cracked support team which isnt always ideal for f2p
yeah i really dont blame you heki, he looks amazing visually but 3 sp? come on now <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
since he is part of the sh
do you guys think we'll continue seeing blade throughout the story even when luofu ends?
i hate to say it but i might skip dhil because i hate the sp sucker units so bad üò≠
jingliu next
<a:Nod:961616084014862366>
its pretty rare my fave char gets a kit i love too
i did not expect to love him this much, his kit is so braindead simple its perfect for me. like haitham is my fave genshin char and hes powerful and all buti dont really care for his playstyle
ITS SO SATISFYING WHEN THE FIGHT ENDS WITH IT TOO
YES
üò≠
lmao
the sheer amount of unnecessary i get in every battle thanks to luocha
<:PES5_DankGun:827518509373456404>
<:HeartHug:774300073642557470>
guys i love blade so much hes literally the best
<a:Nod:961616084014862366>
im not sure how about his e4 and if you lose that synergy with it tho
no because blade just wants to take dmg and accumulate, his dmg bonus doesn't go once he's healed
deserved
<@516591030326525983> 
luocha+blade too perfect
blades follow up is so ü•µ
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
i think all this can be summarized as an issue with the game's storypacing right now. i think they're struggling with balancing their character release with reveals through story, as well as pushing out content asap. because this specific chapter really did not give much in the way of the backstory/information we've been wanting to learn since 1.0, it just feels off. it should have been in 1.1, especially since blade barely got featured as it already was (and i have a feeling will be featured a lot heavier in 1.3). it does make me worry that there are a lot of things that need to be explored through specific characters still and not much time was given here. i'm just hoping it's a pacing issue like i said, and they're not just going to gloss over real character development.
it shouldve been in 1.1 ill give u that but i still really enjoyed it
it wasnt the ending so
this is literally the first pic i ever taken lol
oh
its fucking huge
üôÇ
ruby make it sound like a cult
the luocha conspiracy theorist need to die off, he's clearly just a walking memer in this verse
i dont need to know what fu hua wanted to do, she was right
yq fucking sucks
omg wow a flop from birth to death
jy or yanqing?
i never finished ss
what happen
its not like they kill fcs we already know they're dead
sure bro
without fail, any time someone discuss hoyo deaths, someone is like Well achskully in hi3 they kill main characters a lot
ikr lmao
classic hoyo <a:classic:1106936806756319344>
<:PES5_DankGun:827518509373456404>
real talk if hoyo somehow found the balls to kill someone, jy got that himeko code writen all over him
imo just work on your supports and jy/dhil <:worrybrothers:1079909134155128892>

o
BLADE TMR
if i want the atk boost i do <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
i notice when i start with his technique, af will always end after his second turn so i will use his burst on tingyun turn and then i have to wait until someone takes -50 hit or its his turn again to activate the field
for ex i have spd boots on him
the argument revolves around abyss flower uptime tho
can someone explain to me like i'm 5 the argument for luocha wearing atk or spd <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
<a:duckass:1121931766597435443>
then yeah youre good
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
so everyone in america needs to wait for me to wake up
yeah but i go to bed before the update goes live
murica has to wait until wednesdya <:dead:808739535419998239>

btw that lvl 75 defense for tingyun was not worth it <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
i have to save my xp for now for blade
ting only one i brought 75
so many 75.. most of mine i just ascend to 80 and leave it

be careful with leaks in here carv reads this channel <:slap_hh:743649008140156929>
fu xuan is definitely coming after dh, her splash drip art was already leaked <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>

whats your team
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>

omfg aint no wayy thats what he left on the title page
oh my god lol
renheng shippers are probably already spoiled for the story but they've been around since the lightcone art <:hehe:931645468360970310>
most of their content will come next patch
2pc atk set pretty universal for a lot of carries
its like the glad set in genshin, at least thats how i thik of it
it can be a decent off piece for any dps really
<a:KEKsip:961615405464563752>
that depends how it rolled
yanqing quest thoughts:
yanqing has to be the most annoying character in the game. like wow they really went above and beyond to make him sound like an obnoxious brat. i like jingliu way more than i thought i would, her eng va was great and this is probably my favorite quest so far. now making it my goal to have all the cool kids sitting at my table (jy, jingliu, and blade) ‚ù§Ô∏è 
why isnt blade on starrailstation acsension planner yet? <a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
4pc musk or 4pc wind
im only mean to winners
congrats on being a lucky little shit
probably
i hate logging in and getting 10 BUY THIS pop ups
i wish mibobo update hi3 ui
susang
yea actually insane
luocha is actually broken, even bailu feel extremely weak compared to him <a:yikes:859858182889144331>
i was watching razor on twitch the other day and he insisting wind set for all dps just for the action forward lol
oh yeah that is nice
i havent tried that one, what does it do? <:PES_Think:639363477458255874>
<:Thumb:961498460585078814>
that one is pretty good with jy
when i use her with jy i use the asta one, do you have that one?
yeah i prefer her with jy but im kinda forced to use her with clara rn
raising bronya as buffer i think will help with that
oof
so far in my experience literally everyone except clara want spd tho lol
i dont play her so im not sure tbh maybe <@370438895965306882> knows
welt is actually really good but you need investment <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
you could put sushang welt luocha on one side with a buffer like tingyun or bronya
from what i've seen sushang is pretty good
imo you should level up bronya 100000%
clara and jy are my dps <:paimonthink:945212327022702652> i also have sw to help me when i have an enemy with no suitable dps for a weakness.. the luocha/clara team is just unstoppable really
welp.. thanks luocha
i havent got one
outgoing heal on chest, spd on boots, atk orb and atk rope but i think he may prefer er rope
this is what im running
the natasha one
would be nice to see him on his own lc
i havent seen that recommended at all unfortunately
yeah post op is the best option
im using quid pro quo rn since i already have it 50
post op is the best option from what i hear
it should've been tet
ü§°
and e6 yukong
i got e0 luocha
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
he still heals my allies full health
with this lc btw lol
actually fucking unkillable lol
i heard blade and jy are in yanqings quest so i guess ill do his first <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
lets give him a kid
but no
it couldve been a hot dude
bro hes like 12 and he gets to work under jingyuan
he is the absolute worst
how much new event give
i believe üôè
you change your tune every 5 mins

wtf?
i rally want e1s1 but i dont even play that often its not worth for me <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>

been hanging around cyno too long
i just did the first part to unlock the games
ikr
<a:Run:1096961646053826700>
free pulls lets go
omg i forgot its shop reset
not really she doesnt have any aggro and you want clara to get hit anyway
lol right so many people saying hes the best pull now
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
she heals for days
yeah just hp
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
no actually it looks like i already had it
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
omg that is amazing lmao
okay thanj u
ohhhh
wil wind take prio
and if youre playing 2 wind, 1 qua, 1 img
i thought its not random tho
if i want her with blade and luocha what would be my 4th
you need 2/2 in team?
what is sw gimmick again
somethung about credits magnum opus etc<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i didnt get anything interestung
now what
what map is it
<:zerotwoblind:930101195878576201>
can u show where u at on the map
im still in bed bro im hungry need coffee<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
where is it
exactly
i just dont even think its possible for this game to be as successful as genshin
i think theyre just not expecting the same level of international success genshin has, the 1 pity system seem more appropriate for a fairly simple turn base game
crazy weapon banner used to have no pity, i used to only pull to pity once because of that. now i go full pity thanks miholes new system <:A_HuThumbsup:813014699561058304>
im js in my experience most people who whine about not getting c6 4 star before a c2 or c3 are f2p who get lucky on 5 star pulls. im supposed to feel sorry for that bitch i dont
c3 isnt c5 and again, i bet these peopel got lucky with their pulls. someone who wins 50/50 and/or pulls early isnt going to get a 4 star loadout unless v lucky
ill have to keep an eye out for it
idk them
id like to see the pulls. yea pullin 4 star can be v painful but getting e5 jing before e6 ting sounds like they just got lucky with jing lol
who hasnt had fomohomo before
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
i keep seeing people say they regret him like how <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
he is so satisfying with his lightening lord shit
how can people not like jy
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
you can't import your stuff?
does it have a tutorial how to upload
next week begins sw farming <:Sweats:959781948274909244>
comment i just saw on a yt video talking about luocha pros and cons <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920> facts
and tingyun died, somehow still a relateable showcase <:FeelsCozyMan_lum:492488572146941982>
maybe shes getting a buff there sometimes
it doesnt happen all the time, now that i think about it mostly in su
no
i accidentally do it all the time because for some reason game just auto puts on her <a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
is there literally every a time you would use bronya's skill on herself
i took jing ll trace from 7 to 8 and the difference is actually so noticeable <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
<a:keqphonelick:852191184951705650>
istfg that bitch can't take a single hit
does tingyun have the lowest defense in the game?
stop pulling belobog challenge mission impossible <:PES_Rage:501693392909107200>

cant blame you for wanting otto
they also have seele so like.. it would be a win/win but <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
if you have nat and bailu alrd why not get sw
owo choose e0swe2sw
<:EZ:836143275021959189>

i am so skill issue <:PES2_HandsCry:681576255757484050>
i havent really needed pela for anything except when its ice in moc but then again i havent got very far
seriously there are so many different opinions on her
is sw worth pulling or not
gresham will send you the paypal deets
<a:oprahomg:826656660264452107>
ok are you blade tho
yes all in less than 100 pulls <:Peepo_Pray:836166621675913226>
i will give blade my credit card to help with is debt
oooh
blade seem to imply he has also is one htat should pay ap rice tho
yeah but he has a story quest in that patch, it could be from his story <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
yeah we know that much
i hope there is story continuation next patch, i ddnt see naything in livestream about it
or is he jsut hiding the truth
but now he can't remember? like it was a past life?
but idk straight pairs are rare in hoyoverse <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
i seen some people think danheng was in love with jingiliu
<:PES2_HmmmmNoted:849698641412096030>
but we dont know why she did that yet?
his voiceline seem to imply jingliu gave him all those scars
with jingyuan and jingliu too?
oooo <a:aPES_Think:493353113332219924>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i cant even tell anymore
are they fuckin or are they the same person
when are we gonna find out what danhengs relation to blade is
wtf alice u lost every 75/25 on cone? how many?
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>

<a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>

idk for me theres so many more chars i want im just restraining myself with jy whaling rn
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>

i always put her next to tank coz she has most hp
<:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
everyone knows x.7 and x.8 are dead patches to prepare for new region.. all they did was fill their pockets for those patches too<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>

<a:classic:1106936806756319344> heki
i havent done any talent in like 4 days, im just farming ascension/relics üò≠
i spent like 500 resin roday and it feels like i made about .0001% progress <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
sure just donate me the mats
haven't seen this one yet <:cringe:610393728087228440>
istg those emotes look like they're from a handheld film horror movie
but i have to start qua soon for sw too anyway <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
yeah i guess it doesnt matter for now since i have to farm the set for jing which gives me def set
my fmc is literally never below 90% hp much less 50% so <a:HUH:960281654046375986>
i still don't understand why this set is better than the defense one. his defense contributes to his dmg right? i just dont. get. it.
kiana is the mascot forever and always
thats literally impossible
its bai and lu for now
to level THREE healers
but i dont have resources
okay I KNOW
I KNOW
bitch my bailu is e2s1 what is the point anymore clearly god has a plan for me
<a:jerry:864556009874522152>
i did say that
<:Sadge:816798647760584757>
im sorry but can this bitch leave me alone üò≠
just did another 10 on jing for funsies
unstoppable <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
this team is the goat
i dont think anyone will be using dan after dan/blade anyway
does your friend use the def set or the dmg reduc set
lets see if it pays off
yeah imma ignore the haters and keep investing
<:Smilechamp:970181655576846376>
mfer kaeya is really good in abyss with c3r1 shenhe <:DK:861368415717818369>
no atk main stats?
<:DK:861368415717818369>
but like how would they know that at this stage
but i saw some rando saying they fall off in moc
i really like playing with them so if i can make them endgame quality i'd like to
yeah im curious how far we can push it
<a:aPES_Think:493353113332219924>
what does she ult for gresh
cant i make any character do decent dmg
is this game like genshin or not
someone help me make my fmc do more dmg
<a:broke_hh:891735085303345252>
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
idk ruby its from the gays server
ohhhhhh
when it says it last for 3 turns does that mean the next 3x jing goes or the next 3 turns between your team and enemy <:deadfromdrugs:850811543037411349>
like whe nshe gets 2 turns in su
can ting apply her buff to more than one person
kingyuan's follow up is so satisfying <a:aKianaSmug:959706302332928000>
as he should be
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
that doesnt look 8
wtb cryo dps
no geppy <a:exit:998945504257921214>
those dots hurt in moc
if youre playing right you shouldnt be dying <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
cleanse is too op
yeah and i cant imagine a situation where nat doesn't dominate her
i think shes going to be deadweight when lu comes out <:Sadge:816798647760584757>
<:hutao_cute:818185545175662682>
also shes cute
i shoudl really stop investing in bailu too but well shes all i got rn <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
yeah it only feels like the end of hte world when you see people progressing faster than you but i went thorugh this shit in hi3 and genshin too, its growing pains
unless you're me and then its i have problems clearing with a full team of 5*s
idk if i want to continue investing clara either
i have to focus bailu bronya ting fmc and nat <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
i dont want to invest welt anymore so thats dead
ok i guess im hurting more than you
ive been stacking mine so im in an OKAY spot with that but im down bad for books <a:DownBad:1054188364498219049>
right now i need book xp coz i have to actually ascend everyone and their cones
i think at t6 you should give up on talents and work on relics for a bit
and
just pull them early
<:DK:861368415717818369>
<:meikms:664716301695975426>
well i still dont have the walmart diluc one so ig i just have ot keep uisng hers for now
<:PES_SadShrug:646092743378206760>
i dont have this one but i see people even using sampos on her, idk how good her own sig is
are you sure about that heki
yeah

omg this was so easy god bless kingyuan <a:classic:1106936806756319344>
i feel yyour pain
its okay gresham is right, once you stack his defense its very easy
he's like my comfort blanket <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
my fmc tanks everything, he always last alive when im losing
<:Okayge:816800409804210196>

it kills you when you dont win, the amount of money you have to burn
-$450 i think for e1s2

<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
-$300
he lost every 50/50 even on his cone and kept going
nope it was for him
he never whales
i was shocked
also one of my good friends who is waifu degen whaled on him
yeah i was surprised too gresh
and whaling on jing doesn't?
your f2p days are long gone

OMG THE EVENT STARTED
600803617
i literally have nothing <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
i aint won a single 5050 and mfers out here winning 12
i hate these people
lmao im saving thay
theres a reply there that says its just like kpop stans, always competing to see whose bias sells more
i have no idea i just love watching drama over mihoyo sales
is bailu lightcone worth getting
im about to hit 50 and i have zero xp books <a:aware:965946296236122172>
you can use gresham's too he also has her e1s1
my bonya isnt even that good, she has trash gear on
<:HeartHug:774300073642557470>
yea but they didn't test on animals or use animals to build the product, therefore they can say this is VEGAN!! BUY IT! it's like a buzz word <a:cozyWave:1049152310569340958>
i want a refund
i just lost to svarog d2 with jingyuan
istg tingyun dies just by looking in the enemies direction sometimes
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
dude i used to struggle for like 10 mins on every elite and jy take 2 rotations at most <:C_HuJerry:807167698626281492>
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
what sigil do i want for elation
yes
i wish i owned mihoyo
<a:Cocking:1009511504405606481>
he reminds me of a doofy ass version of that villain from sk8 the infinity
im not building sampo
my clara team work for gep but yeah i cant even get past the wind bitch
doesn't matter, i will single handedly push blade's sales to the top <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
uba's post is so arbitrary coz it only considers the no lifers logging their pulls on starrailstation in the first place, it's literally just for fun.. but people be panicking in every direction when they see he has 1 more pull than her on a single data website <a:Run:1096961646053826700>
he didn't do well, it's because people were riding on the free resources on seele, its because the numbers are inflated, it doesnt matter kafka will do more, also its because jy has good 4 stars, its because <a:PU_PeepoTalk:855159902783406100>
the amount of ‚Äúwell achshually <:nerdge:980201016853164144> ‚Äú replies to this tweet are hilarous
no clue
<@516591030326525983>
still got it totally f2p though so can't complain
max pity <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
relateable
mobi card is coming to bp right
i was saving for hoh at the time

<a:HUH:960281654046375986> hows that even possible when he heals without skill
he is too good and blade's best support
oh im DEFINITELY getting luocha
ugh that should be a crime
seele is a dub at least
i thought you had someone else? who is your other one?
so sw should be easy <:Smilechamp:970181655576846376>
yeah at least now im guarantee for the next cone and the next char

<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
i just need 3 more <:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
imagine paying a dude to sleep with you <a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>
its short for kylie
she is actually a pretty good phys carry
i think you should if you don't have clara
<a:oprahomg:826656660264452107>
i cant believe people still name their kid that
who the fuck even is freddie üò≠
<@1053015370115588147> have you ever read the phrase 'know thyself'? you don't seem to have a lot of opinions on anything.
<@1053015370115588147> do you think alhaitham and kaveh from the hit game genshin impact are in a romantic relationship?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
wow this AI truly knows nothing
<:Exit:1042800026537177178>
<@1053015370115588147> as an AI, who is the gayest person in this discord server?
oh
<@1053015370115588147> are harry styles and liam payne actually dating for real?
also why does he look 50 in that pic
outside = same place <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
the drama was because olivia was married but she cast harry in that film because she was a fangirl, then she split with her husband during filming and there were a ton of rumors it was because she was fucking around with him
you didnt hear about all that drama from his most recent film with olivia wilde? <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
yes
so true
and plenty of people love that shit
nothing to be ashamed about tbh if you love it thats all that matters
and not a single one of those movies was good
twilight is really bad lol ive seen all the movies because yeah i also keep up with all important media
despite jensen being an obvious homophoboe
yeah they were very well known for that
even though i didnt like either show i heard about it nonstop
johnlock truthers were on the same level as spn fans when it came to shipping
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
and also my ships are not real people
i still have my ships im just not active in the insane shipping community
<a:collapse:859859231503417344>
i had my insanity era, i used to ship members in EXO <a:kms:639428905400401930>
lmaooo
i have a good friend, who is completely 100% sane, EXCEPT for her larry era. i dont know how, i dont know why, but she was a larry BELIEVER. she was smart enough to keep it to herself and not act totally insane but she would read all those conspiracy theories and fic religiously
those were the days
omggg
<a:jerry:864556009874522152>
what da hale they're literally just walking to the car
look at the way matt healy leads her to the car. joe would never have done this! this really shows that matt just wants her to be happy and independent! he is so supportive of her career.
some of these tweets i see on my timeline are insane
in the context of gatekeeping who their idol dates
swifties remind me of kpop fans they're so obsessed with who she is dating
<:Bedge:882201591627804703>
so basically just damage, damage, and more damage
<:Bedge:882201591627804703>
do any of jing's cons make it so his big dmg goes off at immediately instead of waiting 34 years
<:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
its huge, probably heals for about 4 hp
e6
march will be a healer after i pull on jingyuan <:Woggers_lum:608915988351811584>
idc about su i need someone to carry my ass in moc
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
omg jingyuan sucks i should skip üò≠
wtfffffffff
<a:Y_dies:818190915096281089>
so actually 8
however many hours until 7pm est
should've gone asia <:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
<:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
jingyuan still 7 hours
im just in a mad melon mood today
<:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
<:PES4_WeirdCringe:726511348128677988>
omg i just saw some poor sob lose the 75/25 to bailu lc <a:collapse:859859231503417344>
there's a 2pc from SU that gives ER too but like i said, no substat means youre sacrificing dmg any way you look at it
the rope or ball or i cant remember
not em
only get 'em
have to rely on shoehorning in a ER support <:cringe:610393728087228440>
i hate this game doesn't have ER substat
so many people feeling whelmed my jingyuan imma finna say fuck it and pull seele <a:Run:1096961646053826700>
e6s5 jing in 60 pulls lets go <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
nvm
i used this and nothing happened <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
where do you plugin codes again
<:KKona:932813351581540422>
we wont get early sunset again til sept
summer is  so ass
its fucking annoying
hak are you havin a stroke
rn it around 8pm
server reset was at 5am, banner reset will be 7pm for east coast
annoying af <:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
like NA server already reset but jing banner doesn't rollover until this evening
server reset is the same time for everyone, the mid-patch banner rollover isn't
NA gets it in 10.5 hours (7pm est)
11 hours left for NA <:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
usually around 4k a day
i think the highest i ever got was 10k
<:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
oh its delayed top ups
üò≠
what does that post say gresham
lmao
i cant read it <a:Denthey:1066829911907639456>
should i get seele lightcone for danheng before the banner leaves <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
right
oh
actually?
<:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
i just press buttons
or how nayone works
idk anything about how he works
why they release all these mid 5 stars first i want blade
really? <:cringe:610393728087228440>
i believe it tbh <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
anyone got a serval vs jing show case yet <:deadfromdrugs:850811543037411349>
congrats!
thats a big dub
right
but if you got 2 that means you just got a free one from standard
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
its not mine lol
yea but im on na so still several hours for me. congrats on seele btw!<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
gl to jy pullers
luocha is must pull <:DK:861368415717818369> jy is just so skippable i would if i didnt have gacha addiction
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
yeah it sounds sensible enough but i end up having to basic with her quite often so idk
ok im sorry heki i dont have a good memory in my old age
oh heki might be right
the vid i was watching said its better to level up the basic first because she does a lot of basic attacks in rotation and it turns her into a quasi-dps
actually adorable
i thought maybe heki knew they always speak with confidence what a joke
i know i should've known better
sure
wow i asked heki yesterday if i should level ting's left or right skill tree and they told me left and i jsut watched a video that said leveling left side is useless, right is better. thanks a lot. <:Madge:816798899816759306>
im directionally challenged
<:derp:960359265032339496>
wow mihoyo making progress
oh?
is it long
i still have to do these <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
i have been refreshing occassionally, you're so right! $5 for a new HP% chest relic and 1 green talent mat!! <:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
ugh im hitting 47 today.. 50 is coming for me and my 0 resources <a:Run:1096961646053826700>
is this considered leak? or beta?
yeah i think this will confirm it, once he says whos in the coffin
well i hope he is not ss otto, i'm sick of the kallen simp version. im ready for a normal one
he doesn't really act like otto at all, at least not yet
i thought every hsr char has nothing to do with hi3 timeline, it's jsut another universe (expy) in the hoyoverse
you're telling me luocha is literally otto in ss?
LN?
its all the same hoyoverse üßò
i mean luocho otto
mei miko and otto are so clearly expys.. those are real
ithink if someone hadn't said it's a su expy 12 months ago, nobody would even be drawing comparisons
i disagree, i dont think they're alike at all
they're saving al the fcs for khanriah <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
haitham just isn't a su expy, its simple as that
its like an unwritten rule that literally every character they've ever created except kevin will be playable
same why do we have to wait so long <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<a:PU_PepeLove:551569455050915870>
<a:oprahomg:826656660264452107>
well said alic
i dont have hook
yeah i have her built and i use her but ting and bronya dmg buff is way better
IM NOT BULDING HOOK
asta doesnt do dmg tho she just breaks the shield
fr i should invest in danheng but i'm getting blade in 2 patches what a waste of resources <a:Run:1096961646053826700>
if i was smart id pull seele since i can put bronya with her and ting with clara but no i will make bad choices
my clara team is pretty good but i dont have a second dps <a:crying:682697447226867725>
im still 1 star on him too
yeah im still 1 star on that <:Sadge:816798647760584757>
yeah <:Sadge:816798647760584757>
i cant event beat floor 1 in halls üò≠
no
time to die in memory of chaos
<a:RIPPBOZO:933915477296705598>
this server about to have god tier luck
me in 2 days
<a:Run:1096961646053826700>
<:OkaygeBusiness:893571936658026496>
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
but rn he is like one of hte few doing dmg on my account so <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
my only guess is that his dmg is worthless in endgame and you'd rather build him full on tank to take as much dmg as possible
yeah so he gets the benefit of extra tankiness and dmg
then idk it seeem like defense set would be better
does his dmg scale with defense or attack
<:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
why does fmc use that dmg taken set instead of the defense one
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
what 4pc set should i use on pela
mfer convince him yourself
convince rossy to be friends with wallace
what the hell is this daily mission
when bronya gets a turn and she uses it to buff cocolia's ult
maybe ill just try it. what could it hurt <:deadfromdrugs:850811543037411349>
<a:aPES_Think:493353113332219924>
did pgr pc client come out
4 immersifiers and a dream <:Peepo_Pray:836166621675913226>
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
yeah i think so
i thought he needed more echo of war materials so i did that stupid boss twice instead of cocolia.. but he only needs 2 so now im stuck not being able to continue leveling more chars this week <a:Y_dies:818190915096281089>
i messed up again
i guess i should do pela first since jy would use her
or should i do clara
i can only unlock one skill tree this week.. which one <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
mte
maybe im just familiar because diet
this server make me feel  so old sometimes.. i like to mald in honkai but genshin is nice for me because more than anything i just wanna have a smoke after a long day, turn on lofi, and chill
dude i fucking hate puzzles man... i like to explore and see new things and kill stuff.. i dont like to have to pause every 5 mins to think
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
unfortunately
its like saying i cant believe you never got into fat free cheesecake
genshin is the best game mihoyo has sry 2 not sry <:FeelsCozyMan_lum:492488572146941982>
its kinda like comparing hu tao to yae miko
lmao nah im not worried about meta too much, been playing genshin long enough to khow'
i just can't see a world where seele isn't the better pull over jing when serval exists
she enable that, she doesn't do that shit on her own.. xl pyronado is a beast even in mono pyro
<:PU_PepeKekThis:749989194818125855>
she is not a dps, she just enable reactions.. xl is another tier
yeah kuki is basically bennett for dendro
bennett is not important either if you invest dendro
venti did for casuals, but he is still top tier meta for whales
it does not matter if you clear 1s faster
yeah but this is pve
get one dps 5 star every 6 months and invest in 5 stars supports in the meanwhile
i will tell you guys how to play
get supports
if you pull seele just skip jing
i think if you get welkin you get a 5 star every patch
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
i get the lc before jing
apparently there is no if on the lc.. it look too good
<a:believer:1018349083800379482>
im only pulling jing coz like.. tf am i gonna do for a dps in the meantime
i really just want blade tbh
venti was my first 5 star on his rerun can confirm <a:Yep:766430960031629323>
yeah gresh same i wil pull if i want them on the first run
i would not.. i dont like her aesthetic so i wont pull
i mean im kinda talking out of my ass though tbh i dont know how to play turn base <a:Run:1096961646053826700>
yeah like i legit cant see jing being a better pull over seele but we'll see
because my gut says seele is the better pull being qua but we'll see <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
im legit actually curious, social experiment lol
lets see who makes better progress
this is good though
<a:Y_dies:818190915096281089> i really can't remember.. i know i def i had bailu and serval. i think the other 2 were fmc and bronya
i just went abundance for funsies and it worked
tbh i didnt use remberance on ii, thats what i used for i so it's probably good on ii too
you should be okay with abundance though, thats what i used for ii difficulty
no
wtf gresham whaled on seele? i'm the only f2p+ left <a:crying:682697447226867725>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
it takes me half an hour to kill anything but i can stay alive <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
i have no good dmg dealer
i use elis seele a lot too
<a:exit:998945504257921214>
i was watching him play this morning, it was hilarious. he couldn't beat anything
i just used yours on mine and she hit a 51k <:binoculars:1048675942261858304>
i am too, my favorite trailer music is hua/zhongli that shit is so good. this one definitely had those vibes
my fave music from a hoyo trailer in awhile tbh
<a:DownBad:1054188364498219049>
i just watched the jingyuan trailer
no mei kiana bronya elysia pardo = dead game
honkai is dead, the best girls on vacation and not playable penises <a:classic:1106936806756319344>
lmao
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
you cant do it in na
has to be one of those captains that logs into honkai just to talk to their homescreen valk
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
thoughts?
im curious
she's pregnant
you guys check dont share for new leak
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
i saw this this morning on twitter, omnyouji or however you spell it really has gorgeous art
next livestream will be the summer patch and then the next one should be fontaine preview <a:Y_dies:818190915096281089>
me too
if this is the first 5 star anemo girl we get since the start of the game i'll cry
anemo kazuha now dead
im not head canonig the only reason he ask us this is for his dating profile on grindr
yeah man im sick of these short people whose dick i gotta suck for a new 5 star mommy
what did you guys think of charoltte
zhongli means sex god from where i come from
<a:Birb:1050944258040934482>
<a:Cocking:1009511504405606481>

i paused this part to take screenshots too <:FeelsCozyMan_lum:492488572146941982>
you're right mc and welt so boring
personality is important okay look at tighnari that is the ugliest mfer on the planet but he's actually kewl guy <:Thumb:961498460585078814>
at least he's an asshole
<a:aPES_Think:493353113332219924> even male mc has a slight upper edge
<:heh:990308225314328576>
nobody in this game looks more boring than welt im so sorry
bailu is so fucking adorable i love running around with her

<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
relic domains are so fucking expensive like HOW
no 80s for me yet <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
her outfit looks like a santa outfit
or IS she <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
yea it all depends on how lucky you are <:DK:861368415717818369>
idk you gotta ask ruby lol it cost around 1.2-2k for full gear sss and elf.. its 1200 for 12 top up packs which equates to 105.6k xtal
thats.. 28 10 pulls
yea athats true
how man did i have for elysia? and i still had a good chunk left after that
yea
<a:kms:639428905400401930>
i came home, she shit all over her crate, gave her a bath, turn around to get her leash, she pees on the floor, take her out and bring her in, go to the bathroom, come out and she's shredded a roll of paper towels
im fr about to punt my puppy off a bridge
hoping to see blade in the cinematic tmr <:Peepo_Pray:836166621675913226>
i dont have any dot dps i think so <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
im just curious how it's going to work honestly. so far the game seems quite literally like genshin which means vertical invest in your faves and pick up supports. i prefer this style but i wasn't sure if that's how cons will work. kafka looks like dot support but her c6 look like it take her to monster damage so yeah, it will prob be exactly like genshin lol
<a:Y_dies:818190915096281089>
starrailstation.com
am i seeing this right? you've only gotten cones from standard?
<a:pugSit:1057825395145183262>
i could be saving those mats for sw kafka blade
yeah..
he was so meh in the story <:dejj:1067071941367824474> not what i was expecting.. i dont want him as much as kafka or blade and watching his gameplay all i can think is why not just use serval <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
im seriously considering just skipping jingyuan too <:C_HuJerry:807167698626281492>
yeah and abundance give revive too
but with bailu and abundance even if you die you're back up
probably could
i did svarog difficulty 2 last night with full abundance and no matter what he did he couldn't kill me <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
you had all abundance formations too?
is it even possible to lose su with full abundance
come to america we support child labor here <:KKona:932813351581540422>
no thats ur card
i will tell you this little trick to get welt
they got3 bronya lc and not bronya <a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>
i saw someone dumping their jades in standard and every pity getting a bronya lc

<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
keep using my bronya heki i need the credits
i'm getting the itch to whale the fuck outta blade and save all my resin for his relics but then i look at all the shit i gotta level and i just... can't.. not... use the stam üò≠
<:C_HuJerry:807167698626281492>
its actually disgusting
i did not know it was so expensive
you know i max refresh in genshin for a month one time
fuck it imma blow my load
the problem is they will keep max refreshing and that is like 300 if not more a month
<a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>
idk why i even ask there
lmfaop
i think everyone has but me

im doing it as soon as i get eq3 <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
im curious too

<:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
somehow she is my strongest dps rn with danheng
i thought you can use them together
you benched serval and danheng for hook üò≠
whats your core team
me too but the problem is everyone is relevant <a:Run:1096961646053826700>
ffff i should've got pela mat oh well i can get it next week
ok i have enough mats to level 2 chars.. i think i will do fmc and tingyun <a:aPES_Think:493353113332219924> then the rest for jing next week
yea
dont make my mistake <@370438895965306882> üò≠
you're saying i could've got 2-3 drops
oh heki
because i can do the math well enough to know what i need once i get there lol i can only do this boss 3x, i have 10 characters to level up, i want jingyuan as built as possible so these mats will be for him.. other chars will have to wait
we'll suffer together <a:broke_hh:891735085303345252>
i wont be able to level up any of my chars weekly talents in eq3 this week either because i have to get the weekly for jingyuan next week lol <:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
oh thank god
im 300 xp from eq3 im not ready pls <a:Run:1096961646053826700>
i got 1 drop
i only know pain and suffering <a:jerry:864556009874522152>
<:HeartHug:774300073642557470>
yeah i got e1 bronya from that
yes i have welt, welt cone, clara, clara cone, bronya e1, bronya cone and gepard cone <a:Run:1096961646053826700>
yeah on standard guys i didnt even top up that much i just been using all my pulls on it
yes im well past 300
<a:Run:1096961646053826700>
<@370438895965306882> <a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>
thats super helpful, thanks
so if you have any preservation in party they automatically are slightly more likely to take a hit
huh.. interesting. thanks for explaining
<:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
idk what that means
why not
im still prefarming all the ascension materials i need for eq3, havent even started talents <a:jerry:864556009874522152>
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
ahhh
<a:Noted:910618494045913098>
i meant does ehr matter for m7
yeah exactly, the increase hit chance sucks for her
does effect hit rate matter for her?
and the bp one looks nice for fmc but only apply 1 time per enemy makes it look pretty meh for her
looking at it.. her sig looks like the weakest
there's also this one.. idk if this from bp or what
this is hers
this is geperd's at full refine/max level
<:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
i dont even have e1
i dont, someone else shared it in another server
<@416445660443967491> if im trying to build the most crackt m7 ever, do you know if gepard's lightcone is preferential to her own?
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
the thought of pulling a character i dont have and draining more resources is stopping me thank god lol
<a:aPES2_CrazyNopers:888440873308790794>
prayge clara cone
and now im at 60 pity again
idk i stopped using jades when i got to 300
im already almost at standard pity again <a:hyperjerry_hh:770947100862971904>
<:heehee:800177689494290488>
<:HeartHug:774300073642557470>
did you guys know you can give your friends nicknames
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
all i see is nahida
i was just thinking that
<:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561>
well if its anything like genshin bp you'll finish with 3 weeks to spare <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
im at 38 <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
yea i think so
yeah i had no idea lol i just saw enviosity explaining it today
if they dont make it available in game it's pretty fucking bad.. one every 60~ days and you're stuck with whatever subs you get
you can salvage i think 10 or 11 garbage gold artifacts to craft ONE gold piece of a set of your choosing
the other resource you get, only in BP right now, will allow you to choose the main stat of that piece you're crafting
btw i didnt know this before, i learned it today so ill share it here incase you guys didnt know yet
i switched my bailu to outgoing healing body and she heals a lot better now lol i had her on hp
nope
idk i still cant get my clara to do fuck all
whales probably run preseravtion clara with mar7
idk i dont have her <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
i think it was fmc himeko asta and nat
enviosity is actually able to autoplay cocolia using only nihility lol
i failed a lot too, i just kept going until i found the best path for me
yeah try that
<:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
i think you go elation for clara but im not 100% i havent run her yet
im no expert tai but i think the path you choose is most important, abundance for kafka was a must for me
ohhh gotcha
wdym you stopped? you stopped progressing the tree?
<:ambersmirk:830995385916325908>
this lightcone is so cute üò≠
LFGGG
im sure hook instead of serval works great but i dont have her built, serval worked well
coco is weak to her
<:HeartHug:774300073642557470>
so true
kafka is hot though she can kill me all day
ITS SUFFERING
THANK YOU
EEEEEEEEEEEE FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!! <@370438895965306882> <@416445660443967491> <a:danceboi:837740326390464532>
closest i got was around 30% i think <:Sadge:816798647760584757>
omg congrats!!!!!! <a:bloodlao:959706412685099038>
yea but i was in phase 3 and i was waiting and waiting and waiting holding the hunt passive for those ice spikes and she never summoned them and now im dead <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
does coco use the two ice spikes in phase 3
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
<:PES_Okay:669833789781966848>
does fmc want a fire or def neck
im guessing no <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
does it usually take forever for you eli
i was surviving okay my problem was it was taking too long so i just quit
is bronya in phase 3 too
me too gresh <:worrypat:986461060104081508>
save the princess is such a cute acheivement name for that

right
he has the worst selling debut banner in history <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
yeah his wep banner might be the worst in history

stfu
where
nah yukong mid
blade bond <a:peepoShy:882201240530989087>
superimpose means refine?
what is this
her c1 is
idk anyone playing xinyan in a superconduct one
thats why everyone play her in pyro comp
itto's weapon gave her a good  boost, code's xinyan is ridiculous
<:Okayge:816800409804210196>
which one
omg someone buy a yanqing account? i bet they could find someone that would pay them to take theirs <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
so who cares
maybe but she's by far one of the prettiest
yeah lol
how do they even determine that
who the hell wears pants at home
im on guarantee <:duduL:963697489179975710>
imagine being a yanqing owner <:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:smadge:1014211860364529664>
like a pic
is there naked blade con
<a:collapse:859859231503417344>
not even funding myself.. if it unlock that full image would be a different story
soon
stfu you pulled seele
i dont have hook
is that what you used to clear su6
<@370438895965306882> what you use for s6
actually true tho <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
imagine having relic xp
i might be offended were that coming from anyone that wasn't you
i want zhongli
my bailu with 3k hp heals for shit
would march over bailu be better
i wish i built nat instead bailu <a:Y_dies:818190915096281089>
my strongest are bronya, welt, and danheng.. i was using fmc/serval/asta/bailu. if i do fmc i could try destro?
good idea <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
but then she just take no dmg
and you're right, her and serval shield break pretty quick
i had full hunt + asta <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
yeah im doing like negative fucking dmg to cocolia
no im saving my guarantee for lightning lord
i'll do serval then ig she always feels weak af tho
well i dont have seele <a:exit:998945504257921214>
is this team okay or should i change someone
i want to try this now
my friends tell me the same, i just really need to be in the mood to quest and i rarely am so i end up missing a lot while trying to force xp
i speed clicked the quest <:dejj:1067071941367824474> tbh i'm finding it hard to get interested in these side quests, i really only pay attention if a character i like is involved
i do and it still sits there
why do these screens last 100 years? who reads that slow?
2 more tb left til 40 <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
he does for hsr
why is that considered leak
omg
lmao
<a:exit:998945504257921214>
theres no use tet, just leave it
lil bro its patch 1 relax
itsl ike that on twitter too.. 13 year olds writing 1/34 threads on why genshin story sucks in comparison to hsr
forget it ill just stay eng til 1.1
<a:slap:1061775506355277885>
ty
of course she will be around next patch or more
bro.. im asking from the current available story quest if kafka is done showing up in it so i can change my language from english
after she jumps off with bladie
oh i just ask if kafka was done showing up in the quest now
dude i would fucking love that
kk
ok ill try that one first
can someone tell me if kafka is done at this point in the quest? i'll just change now
i gotta change the lang stat
ottos en va is actually unbearable
dude
secondly, i have enough babies to play with already im not building another oe
i literally thought hook was a boy wtf
first of all
watching asmongold play this has been a treat
once you do the first stages of halls you go to the next one that resets every 2 weeks
i havent tried w6 yet coz my fire sucks, fh im on the reset level now but i cant even pass the first stage <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
yeah im in the space already where i dont know what to do outside quest.. too slowbrain for forgotten halls, characters too low level to expand in su <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
yeah im gonna do it today
<:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561>
blade be like
MY BRAIN IS SO SMOL
YES IT IS
bro i HATE these things
i only have the first two
i dont have her lightcone then <:Sadge:816798647760584757>
because some chars are on light cones that are apparently not hteirs
which one is that though
what is nat's best light cone
oof
does middle east not teach arabic for first lang heki
one se
every day i wake up on twitter to people arguing about genshin vs hsr now like who fucking cares its the same damn company <a:collapse:859859231503417344>
cats movie is so bad lol
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
yeah weekly drops are pain.. i still need weekly for like 6 other diferent characters but i rather stack as much as i can for jing first
well obv i cant max him out day 1 but if i can at least get 2 weeks worth
jingyuan is the week of the 15th right? i need to make sure i reserve his weekly mats
this game giving me the content i deserve first thing in the morning
is that the bis for march
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
so probably in his head
its mattjestic
<:hosderp2:857411460283367424>
mattjestic reports you can improve your odds of winning by using these simple techniques in hsr 
right? me trying to level up a relic with 10 green ones > +1 <a:hyperjerry_hh:770947100862971904>
non-existent
fr
i tryto +12 if main stat is what they need but i never have enough xp to do it for everyone
<a:Y_dies:818190915096281089>

the best change they made with the game was the weapon and 5 star weapons in shop.. putting standard 5 star weapons in the gacha shop is actually useful for long term players
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
anyone else

eli
i hope i never pull budget mika or geperd from standard now.. literally anything but those
well i do pay attention to main stats i just havent been looking at sets

sampo looks like a fucking toad in drag
yeah but dan heng can help wind coverage right <:wot:998941267041996862>
my main dps rn lol
dooooo it eli he's the best
im just using random shit
is it?
me too eli i want to spend all my pre-e40 levels farming nothing but xp/talents so once i get there i dont fall behind
yeah that is so much better than genshin its insane
is there a pity on the weapon banner? like if you lose the 75/25 are you guaranteed on the next pull?
im so brainwashed from genshin i saw that weapon banner and was like WHAT A DEAL <:Pog:816798522275004466>
taking care of your seele <:SeeleAra:585641463883235328>

i aint got a single early yet
lucky ass
<:KusaHehe_Axiliyah:992975299446845460>

<:Cringe:975612628779024434>

<:A_HuLickL:832066165869903883>

the boys will be worth it

<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
any character at least?
wat did you get <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
its okay tho im gonna get REALY lucky on their banners
she gives speed boost to team and wind pen to danheng with ult, her skill is pretty good too for fire dmg
i built her gresham she's quite good in my teams lol
we'll see how that holds up in 6 months <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
ive been using my freemos on standard too so <:DK:861368415717818369>
ok thanks ruby
shut it mr. e1 bronya <:PES5_DankGun:827518509373456404>
bailu doesn't really help in sheild breaking if shes the only electro tho right? all she can do is her 1 hit
<a:Noted:910618494045913098>
yeah so i really just have to be aware of all counters and find the dps that fits right? but for supports i'd imagine those are better for certain one
is it cool to run otto in over bailu once he comes out? or bailu still better for him?
oh perfect thank you <a:Noted:910618494045913098>
do we know what jing yuan's best team will be?
<:creepysmile:996838443827073105>

it was literally kaveh's ass demo
theyre giving hte people what they want
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
i just woke up to kaveh's ass demo
like i know she is prone to the aggro but i was wondering if there were ways to increase it further
this is all i can find in her skill tree
yeah im just tryna figure out how to keep aggro on clara coz i see others get it too often <:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
is there an aggro substat
how do i boost speed without bronya
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>

<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
oh hell naw
hmm i should watch that one
i like shows with clever dialogue and lots of manipulation/social politics
i didn't care for any of the characters, tbf i only watch the first ep and never continue
i did like squid game though but im sure they're gonna shit all over that with a second season soon
i tried it, couldn't get into it
i cant think of a single netflix series they put out that was worth watching since like.. arcane. love death robots is really good too. that's about it. <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
succession, industry, gilded age, last of us, hotd
i watch like.. all of their shows lol
but every show on HBO is bingeworthy
i live on hbomax now
all they do is flop these days
rip
and i like john cho
it looked so bad
i never actually watched it, the clips i saw completely killed any curiousity i had
they got some for the last joke they made cowboy bepop
i dont' recognize any of the names attached to it
no way that doesn't flop to infinity
seriously?
<:C_HuJerry:807167698626281492>
is this supposed to be live action
ah
why is it a terf game
yeah nahida's skill is awesome
haitham's team is garbage for explore, so slow walking around everywhere
i wish every character had some unique overworld utility
nice for exploring though
he's literally just garbage without c6 faruzan
midmouche
byee aster have a good day <:hug_hh:710968170814505031>
yea that sounds right
oh uh.. i forgot her boss <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>

its like a social for cinephiles, you can like or review movies and it archives the ones you've seen and rated. then you can follow others with similar likes to find more things
are you on letterboxd?
but i cant even remember now so i should give it atry
someone spoiled me for the end and it turned me off coz i hate getting spoiled <a:Madgeclap:911017183478431764>
i actually still haven't watched it <a:HUH:960281654046375986>
babadook? or goodnight mommy? <a:aPES_Think:493353113332219924>
if you like visual horror, it's also a masterpiece. the score is done by johann johannsson and it's literally one of the most beautiful, memorable tracks from a horror film. utterly haunting. the movie is like a psychedelic horror metal show from start to finish
have you seen mandy?
if theres anything ari is good at, its making people feel uncomfortable <:PepeLa:1058108502763126906>
its certainly gotten better from the early 00's tho
theres not enough quality these days
i was sad when i heard ari say he's taking a step back from horror
<a:animenod:814063051854446653> one of hte all time greats
üò≠
seriously how can you even comprehend it
like i was totally numb watching the fall out for the next 2 minutes
i felt like i was in shock with him
i wish more trailers were used and marketed like that
never seen anything so good
i went in totally blind and my jaw just fell to the fucking floor at that part
NOOOOOOOO
ikr
right? ive watched that movie so many freaking times and pick up on new things every time i did
i'm huge into horror media
and see grandma was doing yt even before gacha 
yeah def
ohh
still a good movie but herditary is a masterpiece imo
i disagree, i think hereditary is very deep, i just think midsommar was told in a weaker way
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
<@309634550273933314> are u big into horror or u just like ari
i dont think midsommar had too much gore, its kind of more abstract
hereditary is one of the greatest movies ever made u should really watch it lol
those who know
belisimo <:WRChefsKiss:831146195732529182>
this is his mdps with ayaka's blizzard build
this is his sub dps build with noblesse
<a:Suswankage:935413585235021845>
haitham definitely fucks from behind
not cute
but belly buttons are fucking disugsting
belly button is such a cute word
also i just realised
belly buttons aren't allowed in this game, it'll disappear
can't wait for baizhu to get a redesign
it does work well on him but god its such an eyesore <:Cringe:975612628779024434>

she does work as intended, but i cant remember what is different.. if the element needs to be on her or the charater i cant remember what it is

i only have c1 kuki myself <a:aPES2_SadGeSmoke:929006632900370483>
i used dmc a lot, theyre actually really good lol
i built mine recently too
shes def worth building if you like dendro
yea shes really good now
should be fine but you usually want her built with em then
i see a lot of people running tigh, fish, kaz, and kuki if you have them
yea
i think its fischl zl and flx
he looks songood ongof ill have him
AHAHAJSHAJHSHAJAHAAHAHA

baaat is a state of mind
it was some awards show,  the presenter pronounced it that way
BAAAAAAAAAAAT
oh i know, it was hilarious they were accusing genshin of it.. like genshin needs it!
<:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
after we took out all the bot votes and we still all knew it would be genshin <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>

tbh your haitham support isnt looking to good so yeah it wouldnt be terrible if you skipped <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:kekL:939008918640787476>
kokomi is amazing i never take her off my team <:mfw:840549220406263859>
ew
if baizhu is healer he will be must pull <:mfw:840549220406263859>
you know what hak yelan is so good i would let that slide <:mfw:840549220406263859>
yeah that roster looks pretty stacked to me
koko and kaz aren't, that's two really great 5 star supports <:mfw:840549220406263859>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
why is that stupid?
who do you have?
he's just meant to have a shield, he does have cool combat which is the only thing genshin cares about. i wish they would've allowed him more overworld utility with his flying though, that would've made him worth it for more people. overworld is such a huge part of this game, i don't know why they limit character utility like they do. it should be one of the perks of a character you pull for that they provide something unique and helpful in overworld too. units like yelan and kazuha should be more standard with 5 stars.
awww little baby kiana
<a:Cocking:1009511504405606481>
<:kekL:939008918640787476>

if no drip tomorrow
no

faruzan ai chan expy confirmed

<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
i didnt even notice
oh
right? i thought it was last year
if a year ago is recently then yeah
albedo and eula also dead in a ditch
i was thinking the opposite, if he's spread its prob haitham/miko/kuki/nahida
hu tao seems likely as well
assuming they release haitham and its not all reruns
yeah will be big patch
but yes lantern rite is next aster so its very likely yelan will be in 3.4
should've given him poise rip
and use all stam <:Peepo_Supreme:847376455625342999>
i was watching some abyss footage of scara and it looks like he needs a shielder coz he just gets tossed around in the air <:woggers:652740192653934633>
yes aster dont pull
lmao
we're still 6 weeks from lantern rite, they're not giving shit
guaranteed its just going to be the scara trailer again
<:clown_mirror:988542980967264256>

<:mfw:840549220406263859>
yeah i read the archon quests and some of the characters
i liked kaz's first story quest but his recent one was boring. idgaf about his grandpa <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>

13 hours
<a:Cocking:1009511504405606481>
800 total
lol no
electro slimes??
i dont blame you chasm is ugly af
exactly, it feels like a bunch of stuff i've already seen before
yeah i really can't wait for the hydro archon and tsaritsa but its still so far away
enka is still my fave region for exploration, it's so pretty and calm
<a:animenod:814063051854446653>
i actually really enjoyed sumeru storytelling, the forest region is extremely meh to me but i like the desert one for exploration
the only character im really excited for until fontaine is haitham
hmm.. i guess tartag and dottore. none of the harbingers from the christmas video really stuck out to me, i'm sure i'll like them more once i learn more about them though <a:Streaming:1039019999811088414>
alreccino has an army of stans already
my only thought on that aster is that's always how i feel about scaramouche. hard for me to relate to a 12 year old going through an existential crisis for teh last 2 years
what i wish i'd never been born? lol
just when i think it isnt possible to make him more edgy they find a way
did you guys see scara's teaser
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
you will need to send da ticket to mibobo tet
one more day
yes
cardboard personality
eula is so bad that this is what people are doing to make her look good 
keqing can do dmg i just kinda hate it
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
no she isnt lol
hate claymores
keqing just has the most disappointing burst ever, the numbers are so low
diluc's movements are definitely slow as hell
deserved
<:huh:966619839307321394>
miko diluc and keqing have some of my least fave gameplay in the game, they suck
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
i thought i had more time before 5 star <:Deadge:966011458691416124>

great show lol but yeah i htink they were running low on ideas the more it went on
the entire history of you, playtest, nosedive, and striking vipers was also memorable
my faves are uss callister, million merits, white bear and san junipero

<:woggers:652740192653934633>
yeah diona is fine
everyone wants hydro. pyro dps? vape. cryo dps? freeze. dendro dps? bloom/hyper.
yelan is amazing, you can use her in any team and he's amazing for open world too
<a:animenod:814063051854446653>
aster i would wait for 3.4 <:life:1001518241610485781> you can't go wrong with yelan or hu tao. maybe haitham will interest you? pull whoever catches your eye really this is genshin
oh rip i wouldnt bother with any dendro teams without nahida personally
^
i see ayato in a lot of burgeon these days
ayato also good with dendro now too
theres a reason i skip hu tao and its not because she's ugly, its because she wants someone with skill to play her <:mfw:840549220406263859>
then you're playing her wrong
3.4 will have haitham yelan hu tao and shenhe im sure of it <:KleekPoint:998911499315728404>
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
i dont think dendro changed any ayaka speedrun teams but last i checked she was used with a variety for speed, last patch it was kaz/shenhe/ayaka but i seriously cant remember the last spot
with kaz/shenhe?
isnt ayaka speed run with ganyu? i cant remember
i dont have her <:ReallyMad:971219475045154856>
my bf refuses to use anyone but hu tao like years later <:kekL:939008918640787476> he uses her for everything still
i benched my ayaka awhile ago, i hate the way she plays now i played her too much.. my shenhe goes with kaeya now
kokomi doesnt do anything in that team but lay down a jelly for freeze, she's a very good unit but in that team she's literally just tehre to apply hydro
congrats citrine!

or she used to
just trisha things, she like lives in her kitchen
everything trisha does is offensive lol nobody cares anymore
trisha paytas
its def nauurr lol
heki next time this happens and you don't want to take my solid high road advice, do your revenge the correct petty way and compile every racist thing he's said into one image and then spam every server he's in with it <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
no theres conversation happening here, heki nver blocked anyone they blocked him
yeah and if i was only sending that msg to new bf because i was worried for them, i wouldve said ur bf racist heres the screen send block.. same with the ex
<:Peepo_Supreme:847376455625342999>
the answer is always silence i'm telling you guys, listen to your elders. in situations like this the person who broke up with you either a) doesn't care about what you have to say so trying to educate them on how they hurt you or others is only hurting yourself and b) they do care about you and the silent treatment would hurt them more than anything you could possibly say. in 90% of break ups, it's the best thing for you to do. if what you want is revenge anyway.
^
i like how this guy keeps saying stuff its not an issue now and IF it ever is an issue... like at some point in his life its possible he might change race
did your friends say anything?
did you say anything in the group chat?
i give my friends the same advice in situtations like this, ignore it and move on. reaching out to his current bf isn't gonna help anything. i know its corny but the best form of revenge is to not care and live a better life without him. silence says a lot
that's really fucked up, i'm sorry
wow it took him 5 months for him to realise youre indian, sounds a little slow <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
did he actually say that to you heki
<:Peepo_Supreme:847376455625342999>
and terrible design
thats the only reason i hate him, he gets so much story relevance for having such a shit personality
i cant wait for 3.3 to release so he can finally come and go and never been seen again

i tried subnautica last night
9 more hours
that is what all the gacha games say <a:smadging:1034847088737005628>
yeah okay i will try subnautica <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
you have to gacha ?
it look like a low budget destiny
is warframe p2w?
yeah fr they're all blockbuster garbage
let me give it a google
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
i am a big horror movie fan but most horror games are difficult to play
i will check it out
ive never really played a horror game, i tried resident evil but it was hard <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
is warframe and god of war the same game?
i will try this one then
yeah i like that
what about subnautica <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
<:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
it have bad rep, i think if u play it u grow beard and get fat quick
ive never played mtg
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
can you play mtg online?
like irl card games?
what card games
<:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
isnt dakr souls hard
i played it already ruby
<:Deadge:966011458691416124>
something rally pretty
no hard game pls <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
what rts
<:Deadge:966011458691416124>
what dota
no gacha pls <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
i dont like teh graphic design in it and i suck at fps <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
i really want a new game to play <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
wtf i never knew this vampire lore <:nerdge:980201016853164144>
ah
i completely agree with them that gaming info/leaks are a thankless job but one week is kinda <:paimonthink:945212327022702652> good for them though, sounds like they know what the ywant
are they saying they created a patreon that lasted a week and shut down coz they werent satisfied with the income?
if hes fun i will pull only if haitham isnt in 3.4
literally 12 yo brat <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i honestly believe they had no intention of changing the male model design at all until itto happened
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
to this day itto and albedo are definitely the worst art to models designs, but scara dont even look good in art
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:kekL:939008918640787476>
is this really how people see scara
70k rts and 130k likes
the responses on her birthday video on the eng side have all been really positive people on glb seem to love her too
people's perception of nahida is really good too, theyve written her character into the story well
interesting, im excited to see the numbers
ofc i'm pulling for nahida
we'll see <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
really?
i think scara has a good chance of doing higher numbers since people have been waiting a long time for him and the ones that haven't are likely to pull anyway since he's the first aerial combat character
do you guys think scara will do more numbers than nahida
i hope you can showcase them ur profile <:WICKED:897590154691248149>
no rewards system tied to pvp <:kekL:939008918640787476> classic genshin
i wonder how these cards are obtained
omg i totally forgot ganyu has the og black suit
who wore it better
dude i love haitham but no one rocks the suit better than her she is so hot
scaramouche is ugly

i pulled for poe on the first firepower i saw <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
i have a simlar story
<:huh:966619839307321394>
mobi?
closest thing i can think of is paga vs cezz
idk.. i dont think i have anything thats been powercrept yet unless you count hfs which i wouldnt really
this was when i was real f2p but not f2p just not spending that much
and then i finally was able to full gear my hfs on the expa in december
yeah i only got raven stuff i remember that
i really dont remember i had just started playing then so every banner looked amazing to me <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
this patch gonna be dry as hell for glb
oh another adv?
what is that da thing
like you know the honkai devs had to specifically ask for this shot okay so kiana is going to punch mei and mei flies across the room- no, no, not like that- we need her legs out and her xxxx right THERE
bronya doing the splits right in front of the camera in cyberangel really had my face like <:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
moonglow: extemely emotional, serious chills ---insert kiana's boobs for no reason--, amazing music, incredible art
sounds like hoyo alright
<:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
i mean most men aren't into that lol i think its a select demographic
its hard for me to believe any grown man is into that boob art but the sad truth, they exist
because men are degenerates
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i dont like that type of boob art either, it looks ridiculous
ew fishing

nahida skill showcase now
he has several different phases and you're given a pet that looks like a spector, you have to use this spector fill up tramua gauges (<:Lmao:966624069363597362>) before your attacks do dmg
these mechanics look annoying af
hes the best
scara boss fight is looking like a zhongli carry for sure <:kekL:939008918640787476>

stream is about to start
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
its also left unsaid what really happened but insinuated rhanerya had daemon get him killed
yeah but they're doing this for EVERYTHING.. first with rhanerya's husband (he's not dead, he's just partying in ibiza with the gays), then viserys telling alicent about the prophecy on his deathbed thinking its meant for her, now aemond didn't actually mean to kill luke. like bro.. let these characters take some responsiblity for their actions
<a:Walk:1025390261406285874>
in a nutshell
its so ridiculous
like if this show writes one more critical plot point as a misunderstanding i'm done
i can't believe they wrote it like aemond made an oopsie by accidentally killing luke <:kekL:939008918640787476>
i kept getting spoiled so i just watched it
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
i downloaded it
yeah
<@704867526877904908> i just finished the episode <a:Walk:1025390261406285874>
it is
in case he's released with a new arti set
im stacking all my fragile for haitham release
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
and the flowers are limited, you should def start farming what you can now
actually its just 10 days <:nerdge:980201016853164144>
her boss ascension mat and her talent ascension mat is not in the game yet
yeah the real shit thing is half these things needed for ascension you can't get yet <:Lmao:966624069363597362>
this is the total count for max investment
uh gimme one sec
this would be such a cute skin damn it <:RozaPout:645515131777974285>
thats actually what i like about it, 99% of shows are so afraid of killing off characters the writing eventually starts to go to hell because of it
<:life:1001518241610485781>
as it always goes
hinting that they shared something special, more than friendship, then later divided by men
i think that was the writers intention in ep 1
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
<:ReallyMad:971219475045154856>
i mean if it werent for otto she never would've married him, she'd have been totally content without vying for power if she couldve lead her own life
me <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329> 
otto has it coming man he's so conniving
from criston in particular
i want to see some suffering
ikr i cant wait to see the finale
plus daemon does actually seem to care about her, like he'll kill anyone that threatens her lmao
oh yeah it doesn't bother me, its just the rules of the world they live in <:kekL:939008918640787476>
you leave all morals at the door when watching got <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
this show moves so fast
<:dead:808739535419998239>
oh
yeah
yeah i remember that but i didnt know they already went thru with it <:huh:966619839307321394>
shes married to aegon?
aemond def deserved the title
aegon sucks
yeah for sure cant really blame him for holding a grudge but its not like his OWN brothers weren't in on it <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
also aemond is like a walking meme at this point with his zoolander looking ass low budget daemon attitude
criston though, i'm coutning the days for a violent death
aemond is not that bad, like i dont hate him or anything, hes a good enough antagonist
too funny
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
this meme sent me 
valid
every episode im praying for it
waht this kid

really any kind of engineer does
software engineers make so much money
ofc software engineering is one of the best places to go into, you can work literally anywhere in the world for a high dollar wage
new jersey minimum wage is $14/hr but you go somewhere like oklahoma the min wage is $7/hr
idk tho
im gonna assume total
my boss was telling me at his old job he had a 4 hour commute to the city every day.. like.. hell naw <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
same
<a:aPESXMas_AngeryNod:786228585664872478>
yeah my bf does it, he works in nyc but we live in jersey. its like an hour or two commute for him depending on the traffic but he makes a lot of money
a lot of people will work in cities like LA/NYC but they dont live there
3k a month is more than enough to live easily in most places in america
yea exactly
well yeah, if you're staying somewhere like san francisco you will need to make more than 3k a month but these places are rare.. we're talking like LA, SFO, or NYC
yeah most places in america pay every other week
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
3k a paycheck is very good, 3k a month is good, 3k a year is very bad

im sure it was injection if shes had teeth removed
yeah i haaate that feeling
<:C_TaoCreepySmile:958713165196177419>
it wasnt pleasant but dental work is more just discomfort than pain in my experience
there's this thing that some people are born with, like excessive gums over teeth. they offer cosmetic treatment for it, they can cut the gums back and stich them back up to expose more of the teeth. i got it doen in high school coz i was so self concious about my gummy smile
it will be worth it
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
i've also had my gums cut back with lasers and stitched back up lmao
yeah ive had a lot of dental work my whole life
i understand, when i was a kid i had to had to have 8 teeth pulled at once to prepare for braces and it was sooo horrible <:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>

its been a year since i spoke with my aunt (i moved cross country), but im seeing them again next month so i will check on the status then <:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
they have a facebook but they blocked everyone in our family
its particularly difficult when the abuser is someone you love, it is near impossible to open up your eyes to the truth
yeah thats what i mean by abusers keep stuff so private, it could very well have been in the house. i just don't think that's the case though when his other siblings can't understand it either.
there's no way to know, abusers can keep stuff so private
just sad
its a sad situation coz he's such a good kid and siblings love and miss him so much, like his little sister still cries about it all the time
yeah, i can't nkow what goes on in the house privately but my other 2 cousins still get along great with everyone. i think his wife is abusive somehow, but theres nothing we can do. he's cut contact with everyone. my aunt resorted to going to his work just talk to him but he refused to even see her, the desk just told her to go away.
he had a freakin baby and to this day he wont even let my aunt meet her
same, we were really close growing up but i hardly speak to them now <:Sadge:968951892598210600> one of them i don't speak to at all. he met this girl and got married and she completely isolated him from the family, he won't even talk to my aunt (his mom) anymore. completely cut everyone out.
most of my cousins are male too, but we were all still pretty close growing up
re-reading this i just realised i'm the weirdo cousin <:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
i dont have any weirdo cousins, all mine are cool as shit <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
gross, sorry heki <:worrypat:986461060104081508>
honestly though, too many of them literally think they can just go out and touch women like they're objects <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
yes imo you shouldn't be touching people until a certain point in a flirtationship <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

next fire elf will increase switch cd <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i looked it up and couldnt find it but maybe i missed it
raven only take 20 minutes to ult, i dont see the problem
hfs sp regen isnt bad but who cares about that <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
idk tbh i dont have her
i think fuxi is technically better than sirin if she isn't 3 star <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
yeah you can ignite with 2* sirin
fire always get the shit end of the stick
switch cd no longer unique, it's expected <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
i dont think klein even has like.. the standard swith cd ability like dudu/ely has though, it's just straight force qte which also reset switch cd by doing so. it's a lot more op than just having a switch cd which is probably why it's locked behind 3 stars
yes thats why shes so op, the force qte for lightning valk
klein's force qte is a lot more impactful than just switch cd though
dmg ig
ya
ellie is still good, she gives switch cd and gather but her gather not as good as the other gather elfs
yeah its becoming standard to have at least one elf with switch cd
switch cd, gather, team dmg
dudu
2* = üöÆ 
3* = <a:Suswankage:935413585235021845>
<a:believer:1018349083800379482>

when K.K. arc <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
maybe lumine and aether are just more kaslana genes, ofc they would be royalty <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
wow kevin knows lumine? <:woggers:652740192653934633>
carv is talking about the og promo for genshin
oh

Beta 6.1 v3c 
+ increase Sushang ultimate CD from 18s to 20s
+ adjusted Sushang passive skill [Thousand Blades Return to the Wind] SP regen trigger condition to land a hit on enemies
not before andrius
ideally it would just be ice rpc the whole month but you know <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
yes next patch will be:
kasumi / clock
hodou / kosma
heph / clock
kosma / hov
sushang / hellmaru
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
it was the same shit for vv, first 3 weeks you get bosses, last 3 you don't. next patch she'll get 3 bosses again just like vv got this patch <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:WICKED:897590154691248149>
is the other one fire up?
oh ty, looks like my friend will not be clearing side stages today <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
idk what youre talking about can you show screen <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
what are the side stages today
i played the game, i think thats essentially what keanu's character was? coudl be david would play this role
it would be too fucked up, i rather them just introduce a whole set of characters from corpo to follow for s2 if it happesn
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
yeah i hope he is dead but adam saying something about him making a good project or something before killing him was sus
i want a s2 that focuses on corpo.. i hope they do not bring david back as an adam smasher prototype though <:Sadge:968951892598210600> 
did they confirm s2?
<:Copium:834822065231364156>
i like rebecca but ngl the en va make me cringe xinyan vibes <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

nah heizhou is good
heizhou is actually a really good dps but.. he's anemo <:kekcry:973697358799978626>
yeah 4 star dps is pain to build
leaks said she has diona shield <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>

i actually really like layla's design <a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
cynos combat just looks kinda lame to me
venti has become quite good again for abyss lately
that means venti is better than cyno
venti > cyno for sure
probavly the state of every genshin player <:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
are you guys pulling on cyno/nilou or waiting for nahida
cryo

someone sponsor me this
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
casual
yeah maybe they didnt know turg was coming
yeah definitely i thought they were trying to pull hfs gear on starter equipment supply though lol
thats fine too
oh you recommended them just stop on hfs and get hos
the starter gear supply is ass
yea just tell them to stop and wait for her gear supply
my dumb friend kept pulling trying to get hos and went pity 3x for hfs <:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
yeah really you shouldn't pull on starter banner at all, just wait for hos banner, but for the impatient ones they should stop after 1 s rank for sure
maybe just a hot rerun
yes its fucking awful
yeah its bchips
<a:aPES_HappyClap:622096721408950295>
oh shit
you're almost done!

idk wht her ranks are but there is def a score desparity in nirv with them, unles the ss i see is ss+
nyx is not gonna help me in nirv though, i've seen her scores and her fights.. i can probably do better with cope malding than s0 nyx malding <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
50k for sushang gear + hor
how's that gonna help me? you seen nyx right <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ngl im desperate for a qua dps, i literaly had to buy my way through that tona nirv stage <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<@180679257851166721> should i get vv, aponia, or ss pe <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
she seems very polarizing
<a:PU_pepeNOPERS:850330663415578654> the first time i met ely i didnt evne like her
i pulled on her special supply ofc she 2s <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
<:PU_verySUS:850330022132187146> i literally start playing honkai for mei <a:Madgeclap:911017183478431764>
i always liked ely and mei before bronya <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i really need vv but not with the dated fire supports <:nerdge:980201016853164144>

<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<:WICKED:897590154691248149>
you guys get the point <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
irene is still good for fr
sounds like aster is wokring with what they has, the team is fine
and? <a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
if you play abyss long enough, you want to try out meme teams for fun.. at least i do. side stage are the fun part. <:WICKED:897590154691248149>
save for sushang gear, save your elf pity for when she comes back
no
whats your crystal count aster
<a:Whale_luma:458386265776193536>
do you even have 1 crystal
heki using pe on sushang this week? <a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
<:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
no thanks <a:PU_PeepoLeaveExit:855157057887535164>
where you need an ely signet early on
i hate playing with valks like that
what about aponia?
hua and griseo good on her?
<a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
havent played her in like 8 months
<:shrug:877047647511384064>
she use 1 or 2 kalpas?
anyone have any up to date ER hfs builds? kinda wanna give her a go too with the new herrscher buffs <a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
because your current signets are arleady max
<a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
when hoh skin <:huh:966619839307321394> i want to see black wedding dress ely
<:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
and her slowmos are always so pretty
she is so fun in ER, it feels like you're just swimming around up and down with her the whole fight once you get all the right signets
support skills are not important unless you're going for cap speed run, it doesn't matter hak, vv is fine <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
gearless im guessing
did heki pull hoh btw <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
what happened <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
i use whatever support skill im currently farming signets for.. start with hua and end with vv <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943> doesnt mattter tho
no youre not you always helpful <:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
<a:dancerumia3_hh:782760380799647745>

woah aster <a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>
probably cb19 over m <a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287> not sure though
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
<a:dancerumia3_hh:782760380799647745>
make sure when you come out of ult you just charge attack until your ult comes bacck, one of your signets i cant remember if its awakening or bloom cuts down your ult cooldown with every charge attack so you get it up faster
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
idk the build for charge attack
ult is way more fun though, you just swim around once you unlock the right signets.. hua core for breach > griseo core breah > vv core breach > sakura evade cd reduc + core > you just spam evade in ult form for constant charge attack on manta ray + weapon active
yea
try this way, you'll be good
ae+le for your support, you just ult off rip when you enter the floor > weapon active > evade > charge attack
are you starting with awakening/bloom + hua core
<:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
<a:PU_PeepoLeaveExit:855157057887535164>

real??? it looks so good
where?
pe skin - > sk
b-chips - > hor
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
im literally 3 frags away from ss ae <:OMEGALUL:968951852957859850>
you think i should get her frags over ae or hor with the chip packs?
<:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
im probably going to have to <a:Madgeclap:911017183478431764>
i could be putting that currency into ranking up hor more or buying sk
its not that i dont have the currency to buy her frags, i just mean im struggling with the decision of even continue to farm her over other dorm buffs
and regardless i wont have 3s fr by the time lobster comes back so she'll still be cope
im struggling even buying fr frags at this point, i dont know if its the right decision to continue farming her over dorm buffs.. like i have mpe for kosma.. fr would only see lobster
but like if i get to 6.0 and i still doint have enough to buy her card then i just wasted 6 weeks of farming <:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
i really dont want to slow down my dorm farming though <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
what should i do with my al.. do you think if i only buy out fr frags between now and then i would have enough to buy sushang card? or should i just say fuck it and continue farming hor or sk?
ruby

yep
yeah zia is ultra leviathan
heph ma fight wants 2 sp lines, ziasis even said he wanted 2 dupes because there are fights where she prefers a) all atk b) 1 sp c) 2 sp <:deadge:975652771082698782>
issok from what i've seen she prefers having a dupe for affix if you're really trying for score
<a:aPES_CoolClap:655414093045563392>
dupe for her is good at least from what ive seen
<:woggers:652740192653934633>

ty heki <33
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
he died
taihen is reight
whatever the reason
tbh thats probably why then lol he got cold feet
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
maybe he was scared of the gay, is he experienced in gay relationships
it happens, maybe he just wasn't into you. it doesn't mean anything except you can find someone better for you
he got up in the middle of the date and just left and never came back?

<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
i like paimon too, but i agree its annoying as hell they give paimon all the dialogue instead of traveller. also no one needs a 3 month recap retirated to them 3 second aftr story finish. like i just did it, i know what happen. <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i like the story of traveller but they should've made it as an independent character instead of trying so hard to make it a self insert for the player <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ruby so childish <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
pho is delicous <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i dont remember everything, it was the 90s so no internet at the time. word of mouth and news story was saying shit about a finger being in a kfc box and they way they produce their chicken was unhealthy and disgusting <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
KFC is not popular in america either, they ahve bad reputation they got in the 90s that still haunts them to thisday <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
you dont get the chicken when you go to mcdonalds in ameria, it has bad reputation here <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
its more of a candian thing
jollibee isnt popular here
texas?
more popular than mcdonals?
its $5 minimum in murica <:KKona:932813351581540422>
whats angels burger
they learned from itto and made alhaitham <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
they really popped off with HSR, its like they said finally i can bring all my male fantasies to life <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
they will never put male valks in the game but they're trying to cut corners to give them more features like with the fall guys game and the playable males in story
i was watching this asmongold video about how popular genshin is in the mainstream west and he was attributing part of its success due to how many girls the game attracts. apparently it is one of hte few games that has a 40/60 m/f playerbase. i never thought about it but it makes a lot of sense (cute girls like cute things big surprise). and how so many recent honkai playerbase is genshin transfers.. hohe design is very feminine and appeals to a lot of the female playerbase imo. the game has seen a lot of growth in featuring male characters too. i think they are aware of this trend and trying their best to capitlize on it. <:nerdge:980201016853164144>
anyway...
heki in 6 months with 0 crystals after dropping a pull on every banner that drops: i'm gonna drop a pull on HOR dkey
we already know
you will want to max out purana like yesterday for the next two patches lol
oh yeah thats true

<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
whatis your team
its 1 pt heki, you can beat that
guys imagine PE s-rank selector box is FC selector box <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943> choose between mobius/aponia/vv
<a:luminelick:910325061582463026>

remember that duke that got caught having connections to jeffrey epstein and sex trafficking ring and then was just kind of like no, i dont know him, i just consider him a good friend that lives with me occassionally <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
same tbh like i just normally thought she'd outlive everyone <:deadge:975652771082698782>

holy shit
it looks cool but it hurt my head <:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
as i was typing that i thought to myself i already know keilo is going to reply what a blast this fight is for them <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
you know keilo
its kevin boss for 6.1 and hohe/sushang will absolutely destroy his ass <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
you guys dont remember this garbage 
yes he does
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
I LOVE BRAIDS
i see it keilo, it does look like dxy horse but shes so pretty idrc rn.. maybe horse look better in action
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
joan of arc vibes fr
omg
she literally looks like a princess knight, my favorite aesthetic <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
its hard to see it yet, she looks beautiful in the art and if i squint it looks like her loose hair framing her face floats a bit with the wind.. im sure im going to adore it <a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
mihoyo is such a butthole, sushang should've been this patch and hohe in 6.1
i desperately need second cezz b <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
DK and cezz you say? <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
if you intend to use fr as dps you need her 3s <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
hey man i farm her every week, im at ss1 but im not gonna keep doing that over sushang <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
it wont take long to farm sushang though, she has stamps in ER AND BP <:huh:966619839307321394>
my fr never getting finished bye bye
<:woggers:652740192653934633>

lmao
yeah wheres my afk gaming team
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
what if sushang doesn't have timestop on her ult though?
<a:dancerumia3_hh:782760380799647745>
i like pe combat but i wont lie, when you have to do the sword slam i cringe in abyss watching the counter tick down <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
looks like tf
maybe tf while this combo
those just look like basic attacks and my bet is that she is a support and therefore not meant to be played on field. hopefully she will be like senti in that specific combos might provide a buff but you essentially just want to ult and swap
sushang gameplay looks like its gonna be senti for elemental <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
new hohe gameplay gonna be like
i love it
<:huh:966619839307321394>

idk what the tags mean tbh, i usually do my research via reddit/discord from people who have used specific sellers before
ive had more bad experiences with shipping buying things off taobao than i have scammers, but i  do a lot of research before buying.. and the shipping isn't necessarily the sellers fault, DHL uses a fucking pigon or something that drops the package in the ocean repeatedly before it makes it here 3 years later <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>

no i think that was the banner he got like 5 mitternacht <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
she's okay, memento might ourperform in certain fights <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
personally i plan to use HOR for all hohe content, heki told me this is the play <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

heki will have one roll ready for hohe <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
wtf is this <:PiKek:973573411911659540>

wrong channel
what was kiana doing in this chapter?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
how do i do this

i think you mean its gonna be halloween in 1 hour <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
it's made of all the leftover meat no one wants
jerky is like salty and chewy
being an american, i have had jerky quite a few times in my life <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
the only thing i'll give these genshin grand standers is that candance would've looked better with a darker tone <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
that settles it <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
owo 8ball is genshin racist? <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
it was said about hilichurls before too, but social grand standing has gotten much more popular in recent genshin years <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
there are a group of sand people that are trying to resurrect an old god that they believe is the rightful archon and they have darker skin <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
epi do you get anything <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

you're not wrong heki, c6 zl best healer <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
what is JST doing there <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
project stigma TONIGHT <:WICKED:897590154691248149>
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
zhenyi and turg too easily obtainable at this point, sushang will replace AE <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
isnt this expensive?
why they put newt instead of cezz b on pardo
also i just check that ref
ofc ofc <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
wow thats pretty pog i wonder what 3s gets

<@180679257851166721> how come no one use hoh on kosma instead of sw? <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
and for next month it will be
Kosma - SW
BKE - HOT
the genshin collab of dreams <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
that would be amazing <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

nothing more unattractive than a man who carries around a coffin for a hundred <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943> but i'll let it slide this time otto, you're too hot
awww <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
you know otto is really hot its a shame hes such a loser
fuck
owo 8ball when will ruby stfu about tero3 <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
why every time i come to this server someone has to talk about tero <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
its only s1, 3s will demote PE to DB level <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
my hoh will kill every boss for the right price <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i am but a fish looking for food and i've foudn it <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
of course cherry <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
im about to get lucky in 3 weeks when i pull 10 hohe in 1 <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
its the same shit, sometimes you get lucky sometiems you dont
stop fucking pulling jesus
omg i assumed that was a dorm card pull heki wyd <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<a:modcheck:848583401728507931>
would've been faster if you skipped 2 ely sigs and got aponia core <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:dancerumia3_hh:782760380799647745>
<:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
idk i never played with her <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
aponia doesn't need signet rng?
pardo just so much easier than everyone else for the simple fact she require no signet rng <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
sry i was afk but rev 2 is the best now, choosing rev 1 doesn't matter much though. i can still clear easily using either core <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
lmao i was scared at first the first time i went without it, but you'll see, it is no problem <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
fine keep griefing yourself <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
oh yeah i think its felis2 now instead of felis1 too but it doesn't matter they both work great <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
follow it and its a 5 min run, although 5.9 you prioritize VV2 first and its probably even faster <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
idk how it works i just know ive used a million different variations for like 3 months now and hidden claws/cat eyes give me the best result
even if you look at the Cn guides they all say to start with hidden claws and cat eyes
<a:PU_pepeNOPERS:850330663415578654>
yes
for the love of god stop picking up tailpiece, the only thing you need is cat eyes and hidden claws <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
? no i just use my money in gacha for gacha luck
just save, we prob get wt valk in 6.1 <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
dimension braker <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
its what i do best <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
no thats a headcanon<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
its not a headcanon that kevin was obsessed with MID due to an unhealthy mindset but his true love was really su <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
idc kevin should be with me <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
she sucks, used kevin as nothing but a tool and then flopped and left him with a surprise baby.. who does that? surprise im dead, and here's a ton of responsibilty and debt to leave you with <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
better not be, kevin is way too good for dr MID <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
hope we find out the valk through story this week then <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<@180679257851166721> does 6.1 beta also start this week? or is that next?

heki didn't ask me, i guess this guy is better <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ruby idk if you know but heki has a lao sensei <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
in nirv, anything less than full gear is cope
me too, im proud of you
heki i believe you can make it to nirv, but i also believe you would've retained if you'd pulled for hoh instead of wasting your crystal on vill-v <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
heki will not reveal it, but says they're nirv retainer <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
maybe <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<@148145559897636865> do you know who heki's sensei is <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i didn't get aponia and still got eden guns because i'm smort <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
should've pulled them when you had the chance <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>

<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
did your sensei advise you pulling vill-v over hohe was a good idea
too late <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
who is it heki
1 of the 3 people on NA server pulled vill-v and can retain qua weather.. who would've thought <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
and did they pull for vill-v
were they retaining before vill-v patch
lmao
oh yeah
just tell me
wtf
who is it
is your sensei a nirv retainer
heki you're in for a rude awakening <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i would believe if you weren't using every crystal you have for vill-v
oh lord marg on fischl <:Copium:834822065231364156>
wow look at heki, im so proud <:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
true that ruby <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
the worst part about the vegan life is actually cheese, the meat substitutes aren't bad but you can't replicate cheese <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
np heki use it wisely <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

weren't you literally just telling us you were the class kid bully <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
idk where you get this nini is mean thing from <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ive hated him ever since he took that role in star trek <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i went back like a year ago and watched all the fandom history on sherlock and spn.. what a treat <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
those were the good ole days
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
same shit
the vision
the crystal
the gnosis
the knowledge lamp
maybe he just didn't want to give us the gnosis because he doesn't even know us <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
that's not true, he's a good guy
no
what you guys think haitham's dreaming about anyway <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
idek
then how is everyone trapped in a dream when we just met the whole city
were we dreaming during the first act
what was going on anyway.. it was dream within a dream but the princess was dying but then she was still alive but then we broke out of the dream and dreams are being harvested and this somehow kills people too but idk why <:Derple:646956861861658624>
too smol brain for this one <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
real talk, i just enjoyed act 1 more. the collei story is interesting and so is haitham's. i was into the loop act at first but it really started dragging and it was hard to understand at some points.
i am offended, how could you think this of me <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
loop concept is great, execution 0/10 <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
literally the only good thing about the archon quest was the first act and haitham's back is now broken from carrying it <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
nope <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ruby is so uncultured <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

ruby i would never let you in my account, i'd probably login to find my teapot full of kid models <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
you would do it for free aster? are you a masochist? <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
dmc is the meta dendro character because its the only dendor character <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
it give you cons for 5 star traveller <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

where can i pay someone to collect all my dendroculus <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
missing out one week on reputation, is missing out on one week of dendro wings <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

tigh looks nice for the sake of convenience though, but you right, not worth the struggle of leveling <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
walking around with dmc as your only dendro unit is ass <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

Kandake was the royal title for queens and queen mothers of the ancient African Kingdom of Kush, which was an ancient Nubian state centred on the confluences of the Blue Nile, White Nile and the River Atbara in what is now the Republic of Sudan. Some of the queens ruled in their own right; others ruled with their husbands, but these queens were not merely consorts, they usually had equal power with the king and sometimes more.  The Kandakes had absolute authority, they ruled and were tasked with creating their sons as rulers. It was not unheard of for a Kandake to order a ruling king to commit suicide in order that he be replaced or even depose a son.
candace was not a person, her name is derived from kandake which was a *title* for queens <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

Kandake, kadake or kentake, often Latinised as Candace, was the Meroitic term for the sister of the king of Kush who, due to the matrilineal succession, would bear the next heir, making her a queen mother. She had her own court, probably acted as a landholder and held a prominent secular role as regent

yyeah real talk genshin is an amazing game, just look at TOF, everything about that world looks and feels devoid of any emotion beyodn dollar signs. hoyo does actually care about their story, design and music
genshin can't even release a skin more than once every 6 months, you think they're capable of improving their models? they simply don't have the manpower <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
isnt that just a harbinger <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
after the itto outrage they realized their models can't handle muscle, so they put some tight black spandex on haitham and im not complaining <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
HSR has all the hot men, i wish genshin would collab <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
yes the problem with that model though is like.. everything about it screams 15 and under
albedo's model is 12 year olds, his art is 20 though <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i know hes like a million in reality but he looks like a kid
yes i classify xiao, albedo, and cyno models as 15 year olds <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i honestly thought ayaka was older but someoene told me she is actually 14 <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
not klee kid but ayaka kid model.. who is like what? 14?
she has kid model
i understand that, it doesn't change the fact that it's revealing
interesting nilou, the light skinned half naked 12 year old dancer, has a good reception and representation for persians but candace isn't because she just isn't dark enough
and what is candace supposed to be
are you persian tet
what makes nilous well made
sorry but i find most of the complainers to be people who are complaining just to get a RT <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
honkai draws inspiration from a lot of things.. regions, historical figures, legends, etc. then they make them into their own... for a fantasy video game <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943> keyboard warriors crying for specific skintones down to a technical shade need to get a grip on reality <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
is that joan of arc? <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
that was benjamin franklefurt <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
who the fuck is jeanne d <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
what will they think of next <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:Suswankage:935413585235021845>

<:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
colorblind issue <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
if candace is hydro why is she purple <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i had to do 200 pulls on albedo's banner for 2 bennett cons <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
wake me when fontaine gets here <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
let me guess, it's all about skin tone <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i never 100% anything, i just explore and do what i want until i get bored and start complaining again <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
its usually tuesday night for me
maintenance tmr night?
educated guess <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
unbelievably, no
i'll have to skip candace with those banners sadly.. kusanali will be 3.1 <:durandalsmile:973569999757254666>
haitham probably wont be here till feb <:deadge:975652771082698782>

<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
she has mechanics, idk what they are because i just kill her
it makes no difference for vv, shes same as every other fc
is there some sort of skill i need for vv2? <:huh:966619839307321394>
and istg my damage went DOWN
i already reset but i had a full arsenal of vv including enhanced breach
still i odnt understand why she'd be hittng that low with a core and good amount of signets, makes no sense
i'll try with my usual set up
yeah not great
and yeah she is good with my usual signets
i dont understand, she's hitting like 20k in her ult form the fuck
i did
i started with vv2 and im struggling on fucking benares <:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>

<:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>

how many new qua bosses did they introduce around her time?
<:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
how many qua bosses were given to nyx? +3 in 2 patches seems so excessive.. if qua wether starts appearing more regularly i will need a qua valk. maybe seele herrscher will be cny <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>

her dmg isn't coming from her ult though
why? you just spam her combos repeatedly
i always choose hidden claws and cat eyes, and thats all i take for the duration of the run
ah
like when she released?
pardo does not need that signet
you guys take the ult cd one? i never take that <:huh:966619839307321394>

oh wait yea i think i did do this one
d2 raids take so much coordination
yes
that one
yes
2
i cant remember the name.. it was queen something.. and there was a boss with an ogre in the middle of the raid
im so fucking directionally challenged i must've wiped the group 100x

i dont remember doing that one
i dont think i ever did this raid <a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>

its the best part of every game, 3 hours on character customization and 3 hours and 15 mins of gameplay logged <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
its actually worse than unnecessary, it sucks not being able to use your full party and you can't even complete dailies or if you're doing a quest
i dont let anyone in my world.. the last time i did they friended me and started messaging me every single day asking how my day is going and do i want to co-op? <:huh:966619839307321394>
the new event forces you to do co-op
6.1
i thought they may say something when drip marketing happens but idk
genshin anniversary is upon us.. shouldn't we be getting an announcement in the next couple weeks? <:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
why do i NEVER have coin
i'll prob be sleeping myself though sicne its coming out around 2am for me <a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
what the.. that sucks <:huh:966619839307321394>
the only time its okay to pull for vill-v is if you put simping first, then i salute you
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
üöÆ
vill-v sucks
i agree
the ely strat looks bald <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257> having vill-v would make life so much easier
<:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>

griseo patch is over, when ely server icon <:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120>
they had too much faith in the devs
i still think to this day it was a project that was shelved a long time ago and then when the cyberpunk trend started to make a comeback they were like omg remember that game? lets do that and lets do it this year, someone get keanu on the phone!
yeah the new devs obviously just pushed it out as fast as possible
lmao anthem and cyberpunk were a whole next level of crash and burn
all the tof streams look shit
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>

Loli is a form of Japanese anime. It depicts underage cartoon characters in sexually explicit situations. The cartoons are focused on sexualized plots and characters. Lolicon is anime that depicts underage girls. Loli involving underage boys is called shotacon.

does that show have gays
dead
i just remember the age discourse and the actors constantly encouraging the shipping (innocently from their standpoint im sure but crazies are gonna craze)
yes and women
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
you guys should watch dragon prince on netflix instead, its way better
there was way too much discourse on the ages of all the kids on that show too, it was sf cringe
it was like war between keith/shiro shipers and keith/lance shippers but neither got together
nothing happened, thats why the teens were always so mad at the show
its klance you fool
that fandom is a cesspool
<:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
i cant be a homphoboe
i know someone that is gay
wtf
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
BABAN
popeyes hurts my tummy
they love the gays now go buy their chicken
see chic fil a is no longer homophobic
Chick-fil-A is arguably best known for three things: its juicy chicken sandwiches, its employees‚Äô perpetually chipper attitudes, and its long history of donating to charities with anti-LGBTQ stances.

But one of those things seems to be changing next year. The fast-food chain is changing its charitable giving approach in 2020 ‚Äî and says, in an oblique way, that it will no longer donate to such organizations.
its not christian, its mormon
chic fil a is so good
youre entitled to your wrong opinion
because its fucking delicious
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
who in this server is not gay besides me

one time in middle school this kid came up to me and told me his friend wanted to date me, i said Well then he can ask me himself so this poor kid got the courage to ask me and i just said no and walked away. i still feel bad about that. but i was terrified of boys in school <:huh:966619839307321394>
we all did things we are ashamed of in the past, all we can do is move forward and be better
yeah thats fucked up <:worryweird:987958026071834634>

im a completely different person than i was in elementary
some bully kid stole my cd player in middle school once but i ratted him out to the principle and he got in trouble <:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
stealing is bad <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>

epi's decision isn't a bad one, just prayge they get bastet <:Cringe:975612628779024434>

its gonna be so fucking epic
flamechaser cg so close now
i even got teary for bronya/seele animation when bronya cuts the line <:grisob:975016058928914452>
i did get teary when bronya and kiana said fire.. its not a sad cry, its all these emotions and stories coming together to achieve victory, its still emotional
wdym thats just testament to how good the animation is. when someone can feel the emotions without even knowing the story.
lament of the fallen is the greatest animatoin of all time. nothing will ever top it. its better than any anime, any show, any movie, any piece of art. shakespeare wishes he could take credit for it.
i only know that deep down the world means nothing to me... WITHOUT YOU!
why would they replay such a sad memory
<:PES2_OkSip:674278888611774474>
hes not
nah shes still a bottom
^
they will do it together
before mei leaves er elysia will give her her core, they will become one mind body and soul, so of course when kiana and mei give birth to mar 7th, you will see some elysia in her
mar 7th is mei ely and kiana's childe, all their genes combined

<:woggers:652740192653934633>
why would they do that.. 2 sss boss already feel like 2 extra abyss
me too
they should be either lightening or mech stages right <a:Thinktastic:479509259684413450>

NOBODY HERE

same
nyx is a wt valk
oh i know, there's no shot in hell he'll see everyone here pulling and not do the same
poor epi
do you have turg?
did you skip sw or did you have 0 crystal
heki you've never skipped anything in your life
<:Suspiciouspepe:920083771217285130>
not after epi claims to be the biggest ely simp here.. thats lies and deciet
i will not
thats cap and you know it
am i gonna be forced to pri sos for this bleed weather <:PU_PepeWHY:587034819905454180>
but many nirv players have ss+ nyx at this point which is perfectly fine coverage for this qua weather
indeed
she wont be essential for vet players that have other qua options but she will be for relatively recent ones.. the qua weather will be torture without an s rank qua or well built sp.. even this sp talk sounds like mass copium to me. ill believe it when i see it
for real
i like vill-v i dont like what they did with her and its not exactly a good financial decision on my part to get her when i'm going to be spending money out the booty in 6.0
but nkowing mihole they'll shill as much as sw
i would if i knew qua was only lasting that patch
i dont have sn anyway
i dont have stigs for sp
im poor
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>

im sorry keilo i really dont know, maybe celine would be a better ask <:sadge:814362586631503953> i feel like most vids i see are just s2 or ss0
doesnt it proc with 7t regardless now? idk
its powerful but idk define worth lol it feels like a long animation which is never a good thing and usually your perfect rotos arent gonna involve that in the first place
thats the one with the evade right
yep
ive decided im getting da and her stamps myself but bke may be more useful
hmm idk
why does NA have to be so freaking far behind every other server <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
there as nothing but the water next to one of those enemies
and no elemental reactiosn to fight with lol

<:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120>
people in genshin do not know or understand the importance of gacha gear in honkai
the gacha in honkai is so much better than genshin, you get a lot more crystal and the 5 stars are so easy to pull
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>
you shouldn't give him the time of day

not stupid, but be mindful and be careful
well you are still quite young i think, we all do dumb things like this

arc-city lookin good today <:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120>
youd be surprised how many regular rl/agony retainers have ss+ valks<:PiKek:973573411911659540>

yeah that'd be great
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah its a) just farm sss tp or b) use carole.. motherfucker i'm not farming sss tp to compete with the 3 s0 bke's left on the server and carole is fine copium for now but bke has been around since jesus ressurrection, it's time for a new s rank

so i can play with him
i hope not but it prob would
<:FuHuaSmug:857524710223904768>
who would you guys pick for honkai xover to genshin and why is it kevin? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
i would legit die if they gave a honkai character for free as collab/anni
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
this anni we get free aloy c1?
it was just joke carv <:CryingMan:861897710595735562>
the anni drama was iconic
probably coz you got the same amount of rewards
if you aint got the weapon, you aint got the drip <:PES_TuxedoCigar:667742303120785408>
you could get him and still have enough for archon probably
carv has 17999 primos
obv if you just like your teams no reason to
<:holothink:963352118855626753> well no because those comps are full but he could open up a lot of new ones

they already got that other hot white hair dude
pls not that one
<:Copium:834822065231364156> in another hoyoverse
i like the girl only honkai because of girl power reasons, some of these captains that prefer it for degen reasons are kinda cringe doe
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
indeed
yea this was one of my concerns too but i didnt honestly think they were gonna ever bring in a male valk anyway
i bet there are so captains that interact with their valks daily on the bridge having a wank before breakfast
i am degen thats fine but i dont have this idea that im married to 2d pixels and dream about fuckin them every night
tbh the players that have played forever and played for a waifu game, even i can understand them being against the idea and rightfully so.. its just some of these people are so outwardly cringe about it
thats reasonable at least
<:yikes:877047689521532979>
were people so butthurt and outraged
i cant believe theyre giving compensation for that
is this real <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
i will get kebin in genshin
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
theyre all great
man look how perfect our fc cast really is
also why is su a
the initial 140p leak img where everyone said its not real she looks like the perfume lady
i only remember the npc controversy
remember when raiden was in beta and they were saying her heavy attack was a reference to kiana on the moon because it forms a crescent shape <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
modern weapons these days need crit substat unless its different scaling/support

i pray for kebin in snezhaya with bronya archon <:woggers:652740192653934633>
i wonder if theyre going to model the pyro archon after himeko still or if shes already been done with diluc
really high heels? <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
i hate that we dont have the archon skins for each of these statues
venti your days are numbered
ik some people hate it but i think its purty
but his c1/2 are too good to pass on
fs is so pretty tho
especially with fs being paired with lp <:yikes:877047689521532979>
i really wanted his sword too but cons sound better
you have a shot for sure
oh damn
that would be nice
yeah okay i should be able to get him before banner endsd

hourly reminder
ikr
we know heki
very good score
who designed blockade and thought it was a good idea
dalao
yea fr mine still sleeping
infused with ely's love
yea
it means giving someone a reason to play
i get what they're trying to say but it's the way they go about it and the hypocrisy of it all. we decide what can be leaked and discussed. if some leaker that has nothing to do with wcp is leaking information that that wcp thinks is too much, it can't be discussed. it is their server so that's fair enough but back in my day any leak went in wcp, now they're just working for the man! <:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
<:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
peoples lives are at stake!
what channel is the drama in
yea still no idea how to play eden
when i first pulled pe i thought she sucked coz i played her wrong
maybe it takes me 2 weeks
is it? i thought i was slow
it takes me like at least a week or so to get used to new characters
once i get ah tu i'll only be missing one dk <:pepepause:877793228714287144>

wfp has really gone off the deep end
maybe if i'd been playing longer and was more comfortable there but i still hate going nirv
just rename nirvana to purgatory and make another nirvana
the only time it wil feel good is when you get top 5 which will be rare for me so i'll just be stuck in nirvana lookin pleb forever
its just endless suffering
<:deadge:975652771082698782> i hate this

<a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753>

<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
the hideous bunny outfit
ugh not captainverse
who would be the most likely candidate for an aug
ft and mobi were both really good
i think its fair to say they get a solid valk for their anni then
was
what as the anni before mobi
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
because cn always gets op s rank for their anni, but herrscher is in the patch rightbefore anni
i do wonder how this is going to work though
CH aug over herrscher this year, you heard it here first

isnt it aoe when you do her qte attack of after aim
<:Prayge:968951880623484928>
i didnt know zhenyi was single target, i thought it did apply to everyone <:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
prayer circle jizo and hos are gone forever
keilao just said to apply zhenyi to all enemies or sth
<:holothink:963352118855626753> idk im wondering too.. i know fr still has wolf with her but idk about other  comps
ely: tank boss!
*hfs releases*

i did that last patch too <:Lmao:966624069363597362>
<:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593> idk tbh how much do you want to pri gris/hot?
ik what you mean.. soo many pris and so little resources <:grisob:975016058928914452>
i htink you can do better but not max pri and zhenyi def brings it down a bit
not even max pri
i mean yeah i'd say not having zhenyi is an issue for that team <:grisob:975016058928914452>
what is the 761 on top of you running?
is it a gear issue?
sw hard carrying my pleb ass as always <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
doesnt matter
i dont have sss tp or hekate pri
do i look like a mobi/bkek haver <:Suspiciouspepe:920083771217285130>

lmao
<:grisob:975016058928914452>
only pain and suffering in this game
have to just lucsacc gear tho
if you only get mobi skin these entire 2 patches, im sure you can get herrscher + ely
i needed irene so i pulled on this one, 12k crystal. got one zhenyi dupe, columbus, and irene m which i already had. <:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
you didn't see my pulls earlier reboot <:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
sorry then i guess i remember wrong
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
wtf didnt both carv and ruby say that
mihoyo said syke, vill-v take it or leave it
im pretty sure we been saying qua herrscher pls for liek 2 patches now <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
im motivated but i have no crystal to spend <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
thats what im wondering, i know she just got spend event skin but if 5.9 has one it looks like it'd be either chip or spend
i dont think they'd do that bu who knows
but anni is 6.1
5.8 had top up event
i would be surprised if there isnt because 6.1 will surely have one
i think keilao said that people were retaining nirv without it levelled
i wonder if that will be wher pardo skin is obtained then
eh i'd wait to off rate it somewhere, just use cerulean
but we just got that in 5.8
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614> <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614> <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
do you guys think we will get spend event in 5.9?
he says it all the time
dia thinks hoyo hates mei
classic
and then what
what do i do with these
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
yes , the best
honestly the best honkai event <:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
its a skin
i do, i left a couple there in case i need more torus tho
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
idk off rated that garbo somewhere
at least i got some cubes
i think.. 60?
7tr will
not on this supply, ill just hope i can off rate an extra b from gris or 7t
i got full zhenyi now + extra t for hot
<a:dance:861906808428167168>
I GOT IT!!!!!!!!!
AHHHHHHHHHHH

i just complained about the ER open world garbo on mine
you dont have to whale for that heki
i whale so my profile looks drippy <:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
but im never gonna top score anw so who cares
i would never top score coz theres no way in hell im waking up at 5am for memorial arena balding <:FuHuaSmug:857524710223904768>
<:E_pepelol:792804369749377024>
how am i supposed to top score when everyone has the same gear as me?
that would be boring
its fine <a:aPES2_SadGeCopium:903234074372632616>
this is just there way of bringing WC back to meta, yall laughed at mariso start but just wait. soon the only valk you will have left unlocked is WC <:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
MA is like the end endgame from my viewpoint.. its where players go to die. sick of teh same shit in abyss and the time to have incredible infrastructure on their account do different/crazy things given the content
that i do agree with, im js 4 is too much work
sss fights just feel like normal abyss though, ss requires more niche gear/strats/a ranks that i dont have
4 ma bosses sounds exhausting <:A_HuDisgust:805786818070970389>
12/12 ogier team
thats a lot of work tho
<:PES2_HmmmmPray:888440891830845490> interesting, lets take this idea and apply it to this boss as well
double gacha gear gonna be a lot more important
what do you mean might <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
sp elf <:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>
<:worrypat:986461060104081508> i like more SSS bosses but i think it takes away from teh uniqueness of MA in a way for right now, i think over time will probably change
will it? hows it any different from abyss at that point lol
no all the news was coming at like 3am for me i was sleeping <:grisob:975016058928914452>
yep lets keep it that way
keilao <:worrypat:986461060104081508>
on demand evade
hfs will never die thanks to ma
its unfortuante mihoyo hates mei so much they keep giving her all these bosses
of course i love when my girl is meta
<:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>
you thought you could keep skipping qua valks? we'll see about that
no qua demote to sinful
i never fought husk with pe
i never fight husk
husk is awful
why cant hod stay as option
nooooo
<:PES2_BlushFBI:838743170229207050>
carv doesnt do those exams, he writes them
new MA is gonna be second weekly abyss <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
imagine having cubes to sacrfice
someone add SKIP text to her canon button
<:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170> 
every patch
tet also into fish fuckin
<:PES_Blush:661970504667758614>
because the first hos adv will have AE frags as well, you will be able to SS both on the same banner
if hos is being added to sim battle that means she will have adv soon
mei kevin and ely are all i need <:PES_Blush:661970504667758614>
whats gay
basically
i like sk abyss
i actually enjoy some of the qua fights too lol
i like clock
theres no helping u
a jizo when, i might be able to get a good score on that
ely elf is precious
at least we get see her in a bikini while we wait
when sp elf <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
such a loving person
tet likes everything
see
<:C_KEKTaoWait:841148745383149609> real?
what isnt tet into
bianka sp will be good
they sound pretty confident though
everyone around them was just having a separate ma convo lol
i think they're talking about abyss
actually teh context was ma so idk
im sure
my fave kind of tc
time to pri my archeron <:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
true and real?
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
do it <:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
preview of my score later today
<:E_pepelol:792804369749377024>
is cn like impossible to rank unless you whale?
oh my LAOO
very straight
lmaoooo
gay
straight
sure
<:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
its a lemon grade
its because i choose to invest more into my fave valks like hot, and gear is so expensive as well
yeah i am still baby 366 days
they really dont have to pick and choose valks either, they pull every gear+every valk.. even with the amount i spend, i still have to skip valks
ziasis is levia.. i am whale
even though i do have both da weis.. like this is pennies compared to people with SSS across the board
i dont consider my lineup leviathan at all
then what is leviathan? i think da wei just means whale
to me that is reserved for people with mostly SSS and all gear
what do you guys consider leviathan?
i'd consider myself one of the mid whales tbh but its all perspective.. i only go for ranks on valks i like but i do spend quite a lot
idk tho there are def plenty of dumb new leviathans too
i agree, + new
people's experiences vary so differently in honkai, its highly dependent on a) if you spend b) your luck and c) your infrastructure. look at keeby, he has played long enoug hthat he now has the luxury to CHOOSE what valks he wants to retain with. he retained myriad with SSS aka on benares because he chose to invest in her. investing in WT valks is something only smart players do, sry 2 say. you cant expect someone who doesnt leviathan whale to be able to keep up with every valk, thus investing in the WT valks is a great alternative.
<:huh:966619839307321394>
yea im gonna do some pulls on foca since it has some off rates i need
5 hours until zhenyi supply <:Prayge:968951880623484928>

yeah i hope im wrong but i cant even blame her if so
im in the middle of budget season at work and i have to design the budget with my co-worker and our boss has really been on our ass about deadlines and she has been through the ringer lately. today she is not responding to anyone, didn't show up to work. i think she might jsut not be coming back. <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
this is so off topic but
lawachurl x reader lmaooo
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
the sheer amount of people that dont even do abyss or cant complete 12 is staggering
<:grisob:975016058928914452>
general genshin community cant even deal with a lawachurl
jizo <a:modcheck:848583401728507931>
you can have a game of ukelele, take it or leave it
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
cryo has a had a full year of abuse, dendro will push it back a bit
i'll  be getting kazuha and then not loggin in until sumeru
typical genshin player
we're all here to ignore mental problems
is any gacha game?
that would actually be hilarious tho
<:E_KEKpat:849972793314902057>
herrscher will release same patch as sumeru archon this year
my sw loves hit count bars <:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>
damn f2ps always forcing the whales to wait <:grisob:975016058928914452>
<:KianaBat:683947254972678171>
not when im dying for ely
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:grisob:975016058928914452> maybe flop-v will be 5 week
ignite coming in..
while continuing to create further niches through support and putting the pressure on ranking up as quick as possible as well
<:grisob:975016058928914452>
man i havent see na crystal task in over a month
get a frag from open world today <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:E_pepelol:792804369749377024>
no you will not lol
getting through 5.9 will be torture
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
like you're going to convince someone to change their opinion to your liking
and then proceeds why your opinion is just not right
those are my faves
keilao likes to say smart things and end them with im dumb
exactly lol
and then proceeded to explain why sirin fans are excused from the same behavior
<:KianaDerpBat:683947698251890718>
<a:PU_PeepoTalk:855159902783406100> ahcutally guys carole was always meant 2 be niche <a:PU_PeepoTalk:855159902783406100> sorry but you should all known that they would introduce an entirely new weather back to meta and your paga would be niche <a:PU_PeepoTalk:855159902783406100>
idk why but every time this person opens their mouth in cn discussion i wanna <:slapbaka:974814370817273876>
<a:PU_pepeNOPERS:850330663415578654>
i wouldnt doubt it keilao
i imagine they go straight to a2 when exalted
yeah ik i see them all the time lol
theres sooo many of those in NA server
they're milking the shit out of the genshin transfers and its working
we still dont know whats the island like or what happened in the banquet, i am hoping this is what the cg will be - a flashback for all of that
if ely elf gets shoved out with vill-v it will outsell vill-v herself <:HoSDerp:956555543378538596>
<:Copium:834822065231364156>
elysia has the perfect size for booba imo <:PES4_BlushDetective:797579203565846549>
maid outfit better
just skip teri herrscher and gib another hua elemental support herrscher <:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
i like that hua is always such a full coverage herrscher support so i hope it stays that way
skip vill-v and it sounds like a win to me
AE adv supply
paga will prob get a rerun, thats it
i mean supply wise <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
what are they even gonna bait with this patch
which means - she'll be a dumpster fire unless SS
sorry, can only apply ignite with her sig set <:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>
<:E_KEKpat:849972793314902057>
but everyone called hfs trash with no ignite
and i was barely into honkai then
yea even i remember that
lmao
<:C_TaoCreepySmile:958713165196177419>
i still struggle with the qua ones <:worrypat:986461060104081508>
the nirv side stages will be impossible if its qua ignite
lmfao
nyx is bad tho
i like qua <:sadge:814362586631503953>
<:PES2_SadGeGun:929006658540175430>
i really wanted a qua valk and this is what i get
thats what sucks
i'm so salty
yeah def
i'll wait to see the beta stuff and decide then
yeah i think so
yeah
and i dont want to fall into that trap where i have to keep spending to stay competitive for valks i dont even like
i dont want vill-v like at all
im seriously considering just skipping vill-v and suffering and SS hos instead lol
esp aka
lol def not, my skill issue always shines in nirv
<@295285226446520320> <:huh:966619839307321394>
another 5 weeks of waiting
<a:aPES_Cry:503906222425112635>
iconic art 10/10 belongs in the louvre
<:FuHuaWaiting:723672423542554644>
yeah i hope she will be better when dendro comes but for me it was just the playstyle in general
ohhh my god i forgot <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
there wasn't a back entrance?
her gameplay looks awful RIGHT HERE RIGHT NOW
prob dendro
it was c7
cant relate
gnite heki
lmao i cant
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
i need an expert opinion pls
ok what are the chances of herrscher in 5.9
how much longer must i suffer
even carv believe no reveal tonite <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i skipped yae and pulled on her weapon instead just for my lisa/ning <:Lmao:966624069363597362>
nice ER, im always struggling with that ratio.. i usually ahve to swap to 4 eosf depending on comp
i cant remember tbh but iirc its to the right of it up top
lol uhh..
my lisa <:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>
lmao
i have amos and no ganyu
fenrysk mains amber often lol he always uses her
same bro same <:PES2_Tux:513339892860715021>
my kaeya and lisa are lvl 90 c5 <:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
lisa is awesome wdym
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
theres a back entrance
just zither
i dont have hekate btw
shuijing or paga?
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
this hit count shield is killing me
should i be using sa on jizo with pe instead of carole?
this is entrapment lol
fhem too lao
47.2 with vg 
i think it was 47
sure, great idea!! pri your starlance prime today!
i am the herrscher of bad predictions, take them with a grain of salt
if she is like fr for fire, yes, it would be awesome
qua would be amazing
i thought vill-v would be mech since hot is fighting her but i dont think they release another mech fire so close together <:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:PES2_HmmmmNoted:849698641412096030>
i havent seen a vid, just pic
it was uploaded into the glb beta for some reason
oh boss fight? <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
that's my point though, you don't need a lightening team. you need to worry about what you can feasibly worry about, which is fleshing out your already existing teams and waiting to see what the new herrscher can offer. if you continue to stack out your other teams, by the time you're done - a new lightening dps will come.
heki you realize that i have not seen ag3 once, bounced nirvana consistently, and i still dont have a lightening team?
you can use other elements for lightening
you cant actually believe that heki
and what if next patch is herrscher
skip 7tr
and 7tr
how would you even have enough to pull hot after hos?
<:FuHuaWaiting:723672423542554644>
7 hours
^
i like the way you think
yeah iirc they also said kaz/klee is first
next week prepare your resources
oh hes on kazuha isnt he
tis the beauty of genshin, you can play whoever you want
itto is very good, i just dont like claymores
i cant pull for her because shes on that corndog banner
i really think people are overreacting with her, idk why theyre so obsessed with making her do dmg when shes clearly for support/reactions
yes
you mean dk? i always do 7 days
story should start coming in like... 7.5 hours right
thats soooo pretty <:grisob:975016058928914452>
OMGGGG
ill be in nirv for aka, sushang, and then finally.. my time will come.. bke lightening with my hot
gj heki
i dont even know what to say
yes
this is soooo sad its almost unbelievable
lol oh my god
scammed
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
just tell him good job baban
<a:aPES_HappyClap:622096721408950295>
right i just wasn't sure if theres something special i need to apply it beyond a hit
kk thanks lol
ah i see, what is it that applies turg initially then?
<:E_KEKpat:849972793314902057>
for turg to take effect, does there need to be something on field while they're off field? like cat's can or hb's guns?

<:grisob:975016058928914452> im sorry but i would rather suffer in poverty than wait any longer for herrscher
we're always poor, just let me see ely <:grisob:975016058928914452>

<:PES_HmmSpecs:672161497413189680>
ahhh i see
we might be talking about 2 different things, this is the one that procs with her new weapon tho i think
<a:modcheck:848583401728507931> are you confusing me with someone else? my PE pulls were so bad that my 9 lance screenshot was meme'd in 4 different channels on maincord
i thought that was ss2 keilao
it really doesnt
you're acting like im lucky in this game?
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
im hoping against all hope vill-v is wt
herrscher ely + ely elf <:worrypat:986461060104081508>
lets see what tonight brings
no its just simping
so imma have to pull her like 3x <:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
ill be 86/150 to ss3 after top up next patch
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
do you have supply shop currency? you could get her to ss1 if you wanted next patch if you do
i just need like 500, totally doable
hope i get my hot SSS with frag drops <:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>

<:SakuraWTF:588421743526281216>
wow what the hell so we will only get our cutscene next patch though?
that wasn't released the same patch she was ?
or was that like datamine/announcement?
was hfs revealed in story the patch before?
if ely herrscher isnt wearing thorny crown i want a refund
yea maybe i feel shes not worth coz i already had a well invested sw team
yea i feel most of her coverage can already be covered unless you want tippy top nirv
and not worth that expense
i feel aponia is like this year's nyx
<a:W_HuGao:807164661137014784>
lbr no one ever cared about 5.7
are we getting herrscher thursday or not
ruby

guys.. im trying to save up enough cubes to level 7tr, gris weapon, and fischl bow.. my question is.. should i level cerulean or mitter for fischl? this would be for hot team, not mobi
im so happy DP is on hot's banner lmao ive wanted ranks on her so long
yeah thats the thihg that would drive me absolutely nuts, if i have SS mobi but not full on FR.. i like the teams i love to look/perform perfect <:E_KEKpat:849972793314902057>
yeah but trust me there are several weeks in MA where i'm like damn if only i had fr ranks lol
really i just hurt myself in the end because i sacrificed weeks of FR farming, my FR still onl yS3 because of that
yeah i didnt buy her card from bp either, during anni i got enough legacy to buy her card thru wt and i had been farming her frags for awhile already
no but i did buy out her frags with ballls
i have 4 more weeks for SSS ely :)

k
<:huh:966619839307321394>
and can you only reset 5 times a day?
but isnt there a limited amount of resets regardless?
there is no way to guarantee bingo outfit on the first day right?
<:A_HuDisgust:805786818070970389>
nah not this one, he got exposed hard, tried to brush it off like he FELL out of the chair like.. i cant
i even saw this one on yt doc on this popular streamer that was in a wheelchair and setting up go fund mes for another wheelchair and then one day on stream he just stood up from his chair to walk to the bathroom <:TeriRip:801041888642727937> <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
havent several tik tokers been exposed for faking tourettes? <:A_HuDisgust:805786818070970389>
that or parents
i get it, but its my own experiences of what i've seen, and it really bothers me <:sadge:814362586631503953>
call it what you want, it's my opinion. i have 3 siblings who are severly autistic, i grow up with them, i taught them basic school knowledge from home as a tutor. i have lived/dealt with austistic behaviors my whole life. i watched my stepmother fall into pyramid schemes, desperate for an answer to autism or anything that could help my siblings. it is such an abstract disease with so many variables that yes, it does piss me off when i see people on twitter/tumblr acting like it's a cool kids club. of course there are plenty of people out there with a lower grade form but a tumblr diagonsis ain't it.
yes, because of my own life experiences it does bother me. they should see a professional or therapist for a proper diagonsis. there is this weird trend online that many teens are still trying to figure themselves out and they take on this title of 'autism' and wear it like a badge of honor or a way means of acceptance.
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
i disagree, there are too many people that think just because they're not social or have a few quirks they must be autistic and i'm ngl, it annoys the fuck out of me
self diagnosis is never good lol
is it stigmatized badly in the middle east?
autism is very complicated and has varying degrees
Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. According to the Centers for Disease Control, autism affects an estimated 1 in 44 children in the United States today.
no liking physical touch is a very common thing for perfectly normal people lol
i didnt kiss a boy til i was 17 because i was so afraid of the opposite sex, i would literally start shaking if a guy tried anything on me
you're still very young aster, that's totally normal
that's what i thought too for a long time because i think so many women are just so beautiful but no, i don't like fucking other women
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
yep lmao
i just said i'm not saying it is accepted, it's fetished and not taken as serious romance from men and therefore women who kiss other women are not stigmatized in the way a man kissing another man is
of course there is plenty people like this, but when you're growing up sexuality is confusing, for men especially. i've been in a relationship with a woman before but i'm 100% straight, i kind of learned this through growing up and experiencing different things. it's harder for men to do this because of the stigma around gay men (and i'm not saying being a lesbian is more accepted, but it's more accepted in a different way from men)
trying to label sexuality is just not as cut and dry as we all wish it was
yeah thats a big part of it
nah i know many boys growing up that were gay and fucking straight guys, lots of straight men dont care what/who is sucking their dick as long as it's getting sucked. love and sex are two different thigns
lots of straight men have thoughts like that, doesnt mean they gay
anyone on na wanna do dk raid?
absolute mad lad
hot banner is 7/15 so still about 4 weeks

why sometimes i claim my dorm coins its 80k and sometimes its 160k <:sussge:968897150249484389>
üòê
i cant do these
im old heki
i'd rather fight SSS jizo
this rhythm event in genshin is actual torture
yeah shes best for sk but like.. her coverage so little for new s rank
boo
i think s is 40
<:CryingMan:861897710595735562>
oof that steep.. you dont think she could even beat an s1-2 hfs?
i wonder if gris ely ma would make her top hfs tank
ely does not get enough use
i hope she makes ely more viable in MA too
gris ely buff? <:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120>
yeah if shes not the first option, shes the second in every phys scenario <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
me tooo
we need more kiana sister content :)
i think they do teri before seele
if its herrscher surely teri
i wonder who cny will be this year
they also gave klein
cn anni got something simliar iirc, i got free CH from that one last year
or spina
you could get enough fragments to buy a full wt s rank + hot or bke
i cant level up everything here, what is most important?
i do not lack turg or anything else in that supply aside from zhenyi
yeah im seeing that and its making me lean toward just skipping zhenyi foca but knowing my luck..
senti far and away the funnest hua suit
sk is torture. i have noidea how to play her
but ruby says new valk only so maybe just for new valks and select which means no hot frag drops for me
i know expa select offers frag drops coz senti frags dropped for me on last one
like sometimes when you pull for valk in expa there is a chance for frag drops too
will hot expa also have frag drops or is that for new valks?
damn congrats
i wish that were mine <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
<:MeiStare:458045366063857668>

zhongli: childe i need money again
tao/zhongli is one of my fave genshin ships (non romantic obv theyre just cute)
idk i saw something on twitter that itto stole the ms hina cut out so he could beat off to it in secret, and in gorou's story he said that he was actually ms hina dressed up
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>

<a:aPES2_PepeGaLick:849698803324813333>
holy
i think if i go zhenyi this patch, i go da wei 7tr
zhenyi also in gris off rates.. im just scared as hell i will not get a single one and im missing 2
do you really think i should skip zhenyi foca? if so i will do it <:E_worry:792812046563016704>
you really did, i will never doubt you again
i'm too nervous i would end up pulling skemsal forever to get a missing zhenyi stig
yeah i saw it, i'm still going zhenyi this patch > gris > 7tr (maybe dawei it depending how bad gris pulls are) > hot sss expa
someone add this emote to the server and call it heki
<a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753> im nice
we dont
no
heki you're going to 80 pity and thats it
<:huh:966619839307321394>
awwwww
i need 8 cubes before 7tr gets here <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

what happened?
i aint risking not getting the stigs on skemsal
nah im still pulling on this patch zhenyi
next patch will the stamps still be in elite works? or do they remove those and only leave equipment?
ah right
who is SJ?

rolling for torus now
heki you need a lot of things.. you need to just focus on one goal or you will never get anything <:sadge:814362586631503953>
<a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753>
i dont think it works like that
so the off rate stigs have a higher chance to drop than the up rate stigs???
it says right there stigs are 3.8% drop and weapons are 2.685% drop
?
stigs uprated higher than weapon on skemsal
wiat
yeah skemsal always has weapons uprated higher than stigs
yea but she hasn't even given it to mei yet
ah okay
so weird theyre putting 7tr in supply before even making it to story
if sakura is the herrscher this year just no
bruh
the more mei the merrier <:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
yes we go way back

yeah thats what keilao was saying
<a:gurawoke:882491099929796668>
i think could go higher
my run, full bastet <:PES_TuxedoCigar:667742303120785408> 
i think its s0 but im not 100% sure the score was 31360
apparently hfs fr bd can score
<@148145559897636865> do i need to put an orb on fr in p1?
my hot does so much dmg i cant wait for next patch gdi
fischl skills and weapon arent levelled yet either lol
so i switched to fr/hot/eden
but i realised people brute force p1
you had to do the ball mechanic on the first phase so i was using her for FR ult <:Lmao:966624069363597362>
i thought
<:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>

-1s kills incoming <:PES_PoggerSip:585724569197871105>

<:A_NoteTao:928234793844486164>
or thats right is cezanne cutting down on the newt?

icefire got that score with PE?
what the hell
cake toma senpai the ultimate teri shrimp is in my bracket <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
this is the first time i actually checked coz i woke upat 5am and i was like wow what if i can score first ubt the lbs were full
people really up at 5am reset maldin ma
do the FCs one, there are a lot of people that dont even play honkai and have seen FCs but know nothing about them
carvlao moment
<:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561>
imagine if cat was qua and not img <:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
yea thats what i mean <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
you know how to play honkai when you choose LE as the pfp <:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>
<@148145559897636865> is rino running thales here because its better than ragna for this situation? 
<a:PU_pepeHmmMath:850331115637833728>
that might be why?
oh heki you're not part of their armada?
theyre very nice there tbh you have nothing to worry about
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
heki you can dm the person who let you in and just ask them how to gain access to the channels
thats not a question hua
oh ok ok
you can buy them with pins
arsenal
no im saying
are you buying out arsenal and doing raid/blockade?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
its in your name heki <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
and skill and money apparently
ill just buy out arsenal too ig damn it
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
so actually she wouldnt be SSS until start of aug
and yeah already bought my 30 this week
i will if i have to but i'd rather put them toward ae img and metal if i can
if i take 30 fischl frags every week it should be enough to SSS her before 7TR right? i need 200
im farming her SS rn <:HoSDerp:956555543378538596>
bn sucks but its one of my fave skins in the game, imma tkae it
no im just that down bad for asterite <:CryingMan:861897710595735562>
like the last few patches i have
one of the few times ill be taking the outfit over asterite <:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561>
shrimp <a:aPES_FatEat:625255082405134336>
yeah like ruby said you dont have to make a decision today, lets see how you feelin when you're in EX and her banner comes
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872> well, you've heard what i think but i think you're gonna die on this mobius hill
NA anyway
seriously doubt that matters in RL
<:E_pepelol:792804369749377024>
so still hos boss
oh
oh thats right, isnt her next cycle lightening
and guess who can do sushang.. hos <:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>
my point is, you cant cover everything so you have to think how you can effectively cover the absolute most with what you have and i think going gris gear is going to proivde a lot more coverage than going for mobius with no zhenyi is gonna be
benares in abyss, good one
true true
like really if you have a fully geared phys team inRL you can retain despite the weather as long as its not lightening
okay well you would have a fully geared phys team for any enemy that is mech or bio, meaning you could even take on ice or fire weather with this team if that enemy is type countered, the only one you would sleep on lightening because that would be phys down
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
who?
lets say you go gris, do you have a phys dps right now?
my friend got 2.5 full set zhenyi when trying to get xeno <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
you might get 3pc zhenyi <a:aPES2_SadGeCopium:903234074372632616>
and since 7tr is coming, we can expect mobius lightening bosses to show up less than hot's
like i just cant ever recommend skipping sp gear, especially griseo's.. the off rates are decent, the gear is good, and you already have 4/4 hos. her sp gear will last a lot longer and do more than getting mobius weapon without zhenyi or ae would.
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
this may be controversial but imo let the mobius dream die, shes not gonna do jack shit without zhenyi anyway. get griseo gear, you already have 4/4 hos, that leaves you with gearing one phys dps to dominate phys cycles. for elemental, wait on the herrscher.
you have hos 4/4 right?
do you have zhenyi and irene?
you should go for griseo gear anyway
2 SS SPA full gear teams in my last cycle and both sub 700 scores
in NA people dont even try in RL
then again, she's also a beast for MA no matter what
yeah a master of one type and a jack of trades to every single other, what if they just stop putting hod/fgo in a couple more patches <:CryingMan:861897710595735562>
kill core
you will struggle at first but everyone does
its just growing pains tbh
wdym you're fine!
yeah thats fine
oh you meant for your team
not in RL they're not
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:E_KEKpat:849972793314902057>
oof
just try everyone
i think spa will do fine if you have her and her team geared
i should be in RL for that cycle anyway so who cares
my only other option is ss dps carole <:Lmao:966624069363597362>
yeah i think i will ruby
gnite
tf she gonna do to tc hodou
is he immune to fire or just resistant?
idk why im gonna use for hodou myself
but mobius should be fine for tc hodou
i dont have anything for jizo, i just sleep when hes in rotation
just use her anyway
just use mobius
oh you do have mobius
do you have mobius
everything is a bke boss for the next 6 weeks <:A_HuDisgust:805786818070970389>
yeah hor works
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
lmaooo
im about to do the big brain movie and start salving for cubes too <:Lmao:966624069363597362>

IF
ok how about this
uh i should have around 7k by zhenyi supply.. i'll be swiping on griseo
seriously?
well im swiping for herrscher no matter what
but only if i off rate at least 2 pieces
i'm at 60 pity on valk rn so i dont think it would be too painful
<:sadge:814362586631503953>
since linn is in off rates for zhenyi and griseo.. if i get at least 2/4 i will pull on mobius. smart or dumb?
ive decided

and i never know what to look for on p2 when trying to break his balls
yeah same
yea actually works surprisingly well
<a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753>
its a total garbo run lol the power of whale carried me
lmfao
heki <a:pat:969402615538520064>
<:A_HuDisgust:805786818070970389>
heki back in RL for jizo <:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930>
but you score 800+ thats really good carv <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
tbf they dont have any max pri or elf
glad im not the only one lol
i hate when they address captain.. it makes me think of some sweaty neckbeard heavily panting oh yes kiana i'll go anywhere with you
na moment?
is full marg weapon active before or ult again? i cant remember
hmm.. i really want to try it on aka.. i saw fen do some crazy shit with it in nirv on aka
should i level cerulean before mitter? i think it has more use at this point <a:PU_pepeHmmMath:850331115637833728>
keilao
tbh i would try this strat if i had my archeron maxxed but i dont so i wont
no thats sp isnt it ruby
I KNEW IT
black magic shit
this requires way too much skill
imo you shouldnt salvage any gacha gear you only have a single copy of.. just my opinion
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
hes in ag3
well see if you can retain with what you have first
theres no rush for you to do this heki.. you dont have hos
ok ty hekilao
idk i saw someone say it once so it must be true
cant seele use pe gear
what do you need dirac t for?
i cant talk, i bought a dirac from exchange when i was leveling up <:E_pepelol:792804369749377024>
lmao
ah
hekate better for gris? <:C_KEKTaoWait:841148745383149609>
i'm saving for HOT stamps
so am i, my klein is still not leveled either.. that doesnt mean im gonna go buy asterite with my supply shop resources lol just be patient
NO
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
NA RL is a joke
yeah
<:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930>
if that were that case fragile would just run her mobius on husk since he's completely obsessed with her
idts either
i think its pretty good for a boss that aint hers
<:huh:966619839307321394>
i mean ive seen some decent scores in nirv sushang/husk currently with hot.. like yeah, she'll want ranks at this point but 7tr sounds like a great change for her
how though?
<:huh:966619839307321394>
and gris gear will be on the shittiest banner imaginable
mobi gear will be rerun before gris gear is guaranteed
get gris gear, use whatever you have left for mobi
imagine being in ex with no hos
nyx should make this easy for you
yeah right
<:C_KEKTaoWait:841148745383149609> what er you waiting for

<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
idk though does thales hofs have different roto?
that ref is fine ig, its just that the points they earned is in RL.. so your score in ag should be much higher lol
<:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
thats red lotus score sweaty
i'll just take my score and sleep lol
i cant be bothered to mald this week
<:E_RaidenPat:882522815532781618>
its not that i dont have faith in you heki! its just that spa has type advantage on this fight so they should win
rexgor coming thru with the max skill issue
brooo
<:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930>

you're asking me.. the herrscher of spending.. if i have raven fully geared

how is it heki
owo 8ball should i nap
<:PES2_BedGe:849698641169088533>
does abys reset in half an hour or an hour and a half
i think the ER haters might lose their mind
fuck
so 5.9 is the last er chapter?
doesnt 5.8 conclude the er story tho
idk seems like a lot of effort to reveal a valk we've already seen
lets go
wt vill-v, pyramid mobius, herrscher elysia
i cant even imagine what a teri herrscher will look like
<:E_pepelol:792804369749377024>
ruby is speculating second herrscher
without i mean
i just think you're gonna be really struggling with cezanne in this bleed weather
gl with that
oh neither, there you go
owo 8ball should basilisk go for paga or cezanne?
paga m, the best one
paga gonna end up being niche abyss weather + MA
i agree
the off rates are so bad and mobi is like.. non-existent next patch
you're gonna pull on that scam banner?
<:huh:966619839307321394>
+10 atk ty
i have AF but no BKE
i dont have bke or tp
i hope so.. i am so tired
bruh c'mon its a bke boss, yeah i can USE hor and spa but lbr lol
griseo isnt the dps though

<:PES_TuxedoCigar:667742303120785408> its time
lmao this guy really just like got out of bed and came to this thing
thats how bad it is
they literally couldnt even put in a second of gameplay footage
this looks so bad
how much longer you think hoyo is gonna have to suck nintendo's dick before they just tell them no
black adam ramble ramble black adam ramble ramble black adam ramble ramble black adam ramble ramble black adam ramble ramble
wrap it up dwayne
<:huh:966619839307321394>
not hemsworth
wow this troy baker guy looks like such a douchebag
<:PES2_BedGe:849698641169088533>
why does the combat look like it <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
is this d2?
their pr team is like okay, we need one boy and one girl to present
when they go to events like this
do you guys think these companies
the main reason i hate cod is because my bf plays it and he sits right behind me and literally screams into the mic all ngiht
lmao
first person is already instant turn off for me too
idk
oh
exactly lmao
right.. this been playing for half an hour
i think its just the war setting in general, i prefer fantasy games
im not a fan of shooters in general.. the only ones i played for a bit were pubg and d2
idgi those games are so ugly and just boring
yeah xqc is like crazy gambler.. he plays slots with 500k credit every day
i hate cod
honestly sometimes he and his chat are just so funny
hes one of those i never consistently watch, but occassionally tune in
looks pog <:PES2_BlushFBI:838743170229207050>
xqc twitch streamer
yes he does slots all day every day now lol
<:E_KEKpat:849972793314902057>
any juicers in chat
space monsters kinda hot
fr i'll be putting MA off until saturday <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
tomorrow
i use spa every time its aka or andrius
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
yeah my spa still sitting on s2 <:A_HuDisgust:805786818070970389>
yes
did you demote to a3 this cycle
thats your main problem
heki you dont have hos
but yeah i do have turg, aslaug, paga, and swords.. my point is, thats prob why i retain top 3 every RL cycle, the people below me that aren't getting trophies have a lot less gear
ive been able to bounce nirv since i broke through despite not having any lightening team at all
i have never been to a3 tbh, but while i dont have bke or morbius or aponia, i have no concerns at all about retaining RL every week (and i'm always top 3 anyway). as long as you have your supports geared, you will retain RL. idk what A3 is like.. but with a 4/4 hos you should be fine to retain on phys weather. i think RL retain is guaranteed as long as you have a type counter dps for every situation and support.
dw heki me too
YESSSSSSSSSS
like carv said, you will be fine
progression is just really fucking slow in this game if you're f2p
lorelao
<:huh:966619839307321394>
we dont know yet, we dont even know what weapon we have to sync it with
yes
if you're at 1.8% today, you'll at least be in the top 10% but def not t2%
my first armada was portugeuse
no shot heki
my fr only s2 <:deadge:975652771082698782>
skill mat poverty
my fisch only SS and i dont have the mats to level her skills
why fischl better than eden?
fischl turg?
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
yeah i have full sss eden geared
as i dont even have irene
fr would be in turg though
the other 2 bosses are phys
but no
omg yeah
i dont have zhenyi
how bad would fr/eden/hot be
i have two options: hb with collapse or fr
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
normal rng behavior
true
when it should
sometimes it doesn't dive on second phase
yes it does
is his rng on dropping balls as bad as abyss
ok then
am i supposed to turn it on?
heki playing with training wheels?
<:Lmao:966624069363597362>
oh
wtf is buffed mode
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i thought after the 7tr change shes in benares now
fuck im still missing a second b piece
<:C_KEKTaoWait:841148745383149609> people are still using handel on hot?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
wait that says 36 not 46
hey thats probably better tahn what im gonna score
the fact that a literal thesis needs to be written out in maincord for people to understand
omg bro
with that starting SP people gonna cash in
lots of people are gonna be SSS griseo in the first week
i need 7tr
i need zhenyi
i need herrscher
its dragging til the end of time
this patch is literal torture right now
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:Suspiciouspepe:920083771217285130>
a cannoli!
<:CryingMan:861897710595735562> sorry
like when i go to someone's world to take their resources and they friend me and they wont stop messaging me every day after and i'm like motherfucker i was USING you
i hate co-op in genshin
wyvereins is hideous, mariso's is perfect
<:E_KEKpat:849972793314902057>
i aint pulling for that twink
pray for me guys
ok time to swipe for another yelan
maybe ill try some more if his new skin is good
he can be, i just dont play him very well and dont care to learn
diluc actually still has very good dps in the right team, i just hate claymores
that is so pog
the 200 pull guarantee is for one piece or all pieces?
i would rather play all 3 of those
this anni<a:aPES2_SadGeCopium:903234074372632616>
you mean the most unfun
<:A_HuDisgust:805786818070970389>
i feel your pain tho
ew

<:yikes:877047689521532979>
2 more to go <:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561>

?
200 pull for expa as well
how did i miss this
cube pigtails <:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120>

nyx skin is one of my fave in the game tbh

<@148145559897636865>
<:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>

let me check
i dont think ill be in nirv this time on aka anyway
i tried and it was so bad
dont ask me how
yes the top myriad uses RC
i dont have the skill to time mei with rc or to do effecient AE rots
its not that i cant kill her, its that i cant kill her as fast as dalao's
lmao same
i do too
oh yeah good point
heki if you want to use hfs on aka, you ignite with ae. just use spa or use hfs, dont use them both. then again its ag3, idek if it matters at that point.
<:crycat:921897686477725716>
heki is gonna have to pull the biggest lucsacc ever on hos
heki in 3 weeks: guys what ShoULD I DO?! IM AT 45 PITY HOS AND NO CRYSTSAL
yeah i think heki will retain ag3
yeah i dont think he's retained since he started has he? trophy loss every week, working his way down to ag
not for long lol
<a:aPES_HappyClap:622096721408950295>
holy moly congrats heki!
<a:aPES_HappyClap:622096721408950295>

<:monkaS:814357658698121277>
one of your many random spending pulls
im working on that 8 atk now
<:MonkaGIGA:638533425988370462> .
affixes + dk + dorm
all your dks are done though arent they
wait really keilao
i got my first 1500 atk valk today <:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561>
how do you skip clone
no ranks on GD/fish + no pri + no elf + skill issue maybe
VG <:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930>
and i heard we're fighting her next patch so
if you think about it, all the fcs that we've had to fight were released as s ranks
vill-v s rank confirmed
i might just 50 her then and max senpri+dk
oh yeah her pri is not as important right
to max dk definitely.. to max both senpri and gris? idk
alright im gonna start farming her this week
BN is the one that gives tdm right?
torus isnt the problem, its metal <a:aPES2_SadGeCopium:903234074372632616>
<:PES2_Hide:528554354341576714>
but hot is my baby and i cant stand just watching her sit there at ss2 and not be able to use her for 5 more weeks
if dk was first week i would've waited
<:HoSDerp:956555543378538596>
but
i really was
i was going to just wait for the dk
domain of sanction
but i pulled a heki and did it for hot instead <:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>
i finally saved up enough mats to take senpri from 0 to 65
stop doing fake spoiler while im waiting for herrscher reveal <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
yes
<:C_KEKTaoWait:841148745383149609>
we saw it
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
<:A_HuLickL:832066165869903883>
raven is pretty
dont be so hard on heki, they have an addiction <a:BellaPat:832237053370564609>
no, i just always misgender her because there was original text that called her he and i can't unsee it <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
heki: pulls klein, bella, and dudu elfs. still no hos.
but he was in the gold orb shop
klein wasn't there last patch
thers no way heki doesnt break before this foca select ends
omg THE carv is here?
heki has been quiet too long, they must be swiping
add some da lao emotes here
<:huh:966619839307321394>
maybe heki will pull another b, and then they can use their only other b and wishing well it for m <:A_BigBrainTao:793917214427185163>
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
you really are hopeless
most of the character quests are awful, like im pretty sure ganyu was knocking on doors reminding people to file their taxes
just imagining you hiding in a hole but you've got your phone so you can keep malding MA while you're at it
the only quests worht reading in genshin are the archon ones
tbh thats fine candy and newt b
better to have hos and no pe than pe and no hos <:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>
i only skip when teri's talking <:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>
me every time i go to nirv
hacker gonna take one look at that account and give it back
joins random room 1 link and gets hacked
what a great end to heki's honkai arc
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
<a:aPES2_SadGeCopium:903234074372632616> 6 more days of coping
next monday as in 6/13?
istg this is the longest wait ever just tell us
<:E_pepelol:792804369749377024>
bruh with all that it does sound likely we're gettin 2 herrscher or herrscher delay
ugh can we please just skip vill-v
x
its the opposite in e
i had the same issue in masters idk why
yeah the willpower
yeah legacy is plentiful after EX, i buy fr/ely/ve frags every week
i cant remember when i started tbh.. i want to say maybe 1.5 months ago?
i got ve ss this week but i havent even started aug cores nor can i start now with all my asterite priorities <:deadge:975652771082698782>
you can definitely do it! <a:PeepoCheer:679226223658008577>
damn heki get called out
dirac sea did a better job of preparing masters for ex imo
qm is garbage, everyone just runs PE and MA strats
no problems here with SW<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
are you in a3 yet heki
that'd be nice
no just sounds like something heki would do
heki moment

<:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120>
heki moment
i just did the whole abyss with sw in bastet and cat in nex <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>

holy
why am i not surprised
10/10

its her herrscher form 
<:huh:966619839307321394>
i need to get mobius <:hmmmmmm:860641150587240468>

<:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561> congrats heki
that'd be awesome lmao
omg
i think the thorny crown from ER will be part of her herrscher design
yes we know
yeah whatever her herrscher form design ends up looking like
either herrscher suit or herrscher skin
thers no way ely doesn't get something
PE or ely
who will it be
who will it be this year
<:E_worry:792812046563016704>
im seriously gonna die if heki goes to like 99 pity on hos and runs out of funds
<:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120>
doesnt it give you like 10 metal and 10 torus?
i want the hb one still though
i got cat and FR outfit <:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561>
ae in er when

you really pulled an outfit before hos?
same
still waiting for another AE adv, i regret not pulling on her first one when shes only 60 frags from SS <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
ss or sss hos is like the best cheat code in ma
cuts down sp farming
hell yeah it is
hos going to adv supply will be the best adv supply ever
ae going to bp was the best bp ever
why wouldn't they? its been everywhere lately
hasnt irene been in bp twice?
true <:Copium:875793728055418942>
i could but why.. i guess i might unlock DA but BKE doesn't even give me a good dorm buff and there's no point in using her when everyone else would have ranks.. we'll see i'll prob just get them both sicne theres nothing else
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
i'm gonna be sitting with 64 balls at the end of that season
thats so garbo man
in like 6 months? <:E_KEKpat:849972793314902057>
teri herrscher will come in january cny to powercreep hos and she'll go in bp
hos
ommg really i dont want either of those
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
dont we get 4 valks total though?
i cope fr
i know bke is the one after but they usually put in another s rank
what valk do yall think we'll get after DA in bp
<a:aPES4_PJDance:827518463106875412>
<:E_pepelol:792804369749377024>
i cant wait for kazuha rerun
yeah its like 1 frame per minute
yeah im down
i havent got a crystal task in like a month
yess we need yao yao
broken teapot was so pog, i wish it would stay broken
im 2 unusual hilichurl away from that achievement <:PES_PoggerSip:585724569197871105>
i'd rather just stand in mondstadt than do hangouts
oh god no those are the worst
its already dead patch now
yeah that
i stopped playing for a couple months and just came back with this new one
ive been playing a lot with the new patch, the archon quest was awesome, event good, and yelan SSS tier
<:A_HuLickL:832066165869903883>
the day kevin is added to genshin in a slutty outfit <a:aPES2_SadGeCopium:903234074372632616>
omg <:A_HuLickL:832066165869903883>
i think most people did, she was the disappointment of the year
i have 650 torus and 200 metal <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
jizo and then sushang, i heckin love suffering!
<:huh:966619839307321394>
genshin is good again now that yelan is there <:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>
ive noticed a lot of honkai players that prefer the kid type hate dudu <:deadge:975652771082698782>
... heki2
ohhhh
what does con mean in lolicon?
yeah i like ship arts
ive been through so much fandom drama at my age, nothing can phase me anymore. like taking a morality stance on your fave ship/character is completely pointless. who cares if you like the worst person ever in a work of fiction?
i remember when tectone had like this tectone jr called goose egg on his stream all the time, and this guy wouuld literally just parrot everything he said.. then atsu called him his yes man and pathetic on live and goose literally disappeared lmao it was so harsh but so damn true at the same time
i cant stand him but the thing that drove me nuts is how genshintwt would always try to cancel him for the most inane shit when there is actual real shit to cry about lol
genshintwt is just 13 year olds.. remember the tectone/envi and tectone/atsu drama? omg talk about a community meltdown
<:huh:966619839307321394>
i cant remember if 4chan was involved at any point, its this one girl who started copying and stalking this other art streamer for YEARS. its way too in depth to cover in a few sentences, but some of the stuff she did was like actually psychotic.
it is, i get stoned and watch him all the time. hes fucking hilarious
i watch anything with drama
that shit was WILD
omg i remember that lmao
xqc is so entertaining, he can literally just sit there nad play nothing and get 100k viewers
cancel culture
turg is on so many off rates and special buys, i have no doubt it will be replaced by january
no , no the qua stage again <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
<:E_pepelol:792804369749377024>
ugh i hope its not sakura
if its sp istg
same, im starting to think so too ruby
what if
what if theres no herrscher
do you guys think we will get a herrscher reveal
<a:aPES2_SadGeCopium:903234074372632616>
herrscher reveal next week? cope
thats not pizza, its bread with seafood and broccoli on it
broccolli makes nice pizza sauce? <:huh:966619839307321394>
recommended for vke and mc <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
people are calling it powercreep because paga was just released 6 months ago, cezanne might not be a replacement but all its doing is creating another niche set within the meta to further push players into spending more for more and more coverage
zhenyi? turg?
i mean tbf if you dont have paga now its gonna be considered hella luxury going forward
spend <:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>
i really dont know how they avoid spoilers when playing thru story, i would never even risk looking at my chat lmao
i only need at-tu and xy sword now
yeah i only got it for that attack
i got af im not pulling more <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
i already pulled on af banner
<:A_HuKek:803544603751612436>
and yes i bought out every pack from felis shop
there was only one after breakthrough
i bought that months ago
whels cant help mat poverty
i'll just keep taking L's until next patch
yeah
im just trying to decide whether i should pri hekate or keep stacking my mats for senpri, dk, and griseo
yeah i mean for ma, i should have gris by the time jizo is in aabyss
<@148145559897636865> does ss tp with hekate pri lvl 50 work on jizo <:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
i tried to get onyx on the last bingo and i did not understand how to do it, so i just wasted all my keys

the hottest superhero
same, none of them have impressed me and idk why but im not a huge batman person in general. you seen one, you seen 'em all.
including ledger
i dont like any jokers
i have a controversial opinion on that too
<:yikes:877047689521532979>
<:E_KEKpat:849972793314902057>
and then when they came back to town a year later, their publicist CALLED me and asked me if i wanted to meet up with them again
their publicist let me backstage and let me interview them
so i pretended to be with my high school newspaper and contacted their publicist
i was obsessed with it
you know his band 30 seconds to mars?
did you know i met jared leto when i was in high school?
guys
nah this is like.. skill issue for real. i've always been bad with hfs/ae. like 171 points on first run with 4 star sirin is just embarassing.
i hate it here
every time i go to nirv im reminded what a shit player i am
i dont have mobius or dos <:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>
i already locked hfs to benares
<:PES4_CuteKnit:751431847954743306>

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
ah i see
oh i thought mariso said you could start up to 5.6 to get them
new honkai players can start now and still receive the new 5.8 rewards right
why wont this fucking FUCK leave me aLONE
keilao you're a beast
sorry to hear that reboot <:sadge:814362586631503953>
damn im trash
<:E_KEKpat:849972793314902057>
taking 20 minutes to swing their weapon
but god claymore users in general are just the worst
like i see vids in abyss occassionally where he still wrecks everything
there are some people who will use him forever
he's ass
i tried using diluc again since his new skin is coming
yea thats a good way of looking at it
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
i dont see her getting aug or dk either for several reasons but i do hope shes fun to play in ER
you think its so out of the realm of possibility?
<:PES_Blush:661970504667758614>
wtf
yes
so idrc
its 30 pull guarantee
yeah gonna be shit for me too, esp with zhenyi supply right before it.. coping i'll already have the full set
linneaus is so random lol
paganini copers in shambles
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
its total memes, shes in nex gear lol
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>

whatever
i keep getting like 845
whats considered good score for rl hodom with full pe <:Suspiciouspepe:920083771217285130>
100000000% i wish they would re-do honkai's ui
<:A_HuKek:803544603751612436>
see? heki is aiming for the usual 80 pull not guarantee
if nothing else to than to see diavoros mald
a pe skin would be great though
ely summer skin
but imma need ely herrscher outfit
that would be pog
heki could learn
dalao rebooting has a plan
so pretty
<:PES_PoggerSip:585724569197871105>
im not taking the advice of someone in EX without hos
i cant skip stupid child meta, honkai forcing me to roll on it
yooooo congrats rebooting
<:PES4_CuteKnit:751431847954743306>
oh right i thought you meant for pe
what about s2? can i pass in that case?
no idea, it was shared in the cn channel in maincord

<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
how can it open at 9 if it's currently 10 and its still not open
wdym carv its 10 though
its 10 though <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
ER open in 1 minute
<:PES_PoggerSip:585724569197871105>
every time i see griseo i wana punch her in the face
<:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
<a:PU_pepeHmmMath:850331115637833728>
like what g2 i should worry about
do we have any idea what shitty craftable weapon we will need to sync the new key with?
its true
you will be just fine
honestly your account looks good for your goals
bruh dont sweat that.. you dont need to have everything to retain a3
elysia? that's one boss! you dont have to worry about that lol she rarely apears anyway
theres not a single ice boss the rest of this patch so who cares.. hor is plenty in a3
if gris gear has same guarantee cat does and you have the crystal, i think you definitely should
yea but the thing with a3 is everyone will be in that situation too, probably worse. i can tell just by looking how your teams are geared you at least you know what you're doing, that already puts you ahead. if you're comfortable retaining agony/rl every week in masters, thats not gonna change in EX
<:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
im getting to the point where its rare i get anything in off rates i want
you guys think they'll put paga in gris off rates
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<a:Yaeslap:966597937696223232>
if i catch you spending those cards i'm gona
dont go buying that shit yet if you know you dont have the willpower to save it
heki
skip hot key, get hos, if you get her early either go for her gear or for gris gear
lmao
i'm sure its enough to retain a3
cant believe no cat gear athough
yea you'll be fine
hos is more valuable than himeko t sry 2 say.. you will not even be able to function without hos in EX RL
^
we've talked about this
your free pulls can be saved too heki
fr just stop whatever plans you have of pulling and start saving for hos
6
ss2-sss is the most painful
yep
they really be putting turg on every supply these days
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<a:PU_pepeHmmMath:850331115637833728>
i gotta decide what i want too
pog
just 5 more for your usual 80
shes only there 7 days
yea just make sure you have enough this time to get her
senti more important
yeah its week 1
BETTER START SAVING UP YOUR 80 PULLS NOW
<@781539392039682058>
5.8
SENTIENCE
HEKI
HKEI
whats the team for type counter kasumi in abyss? is hfs the best for that?
<@148145559897636865> hey what is kiana beach party used for again? sss hod?
<:PES4_BlushHug:797579203456532552>
same
vill-v will be s rank so i dont have to worry about that
i'm doing fischl > gris > carole next
january nyx+hos bp <:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561>
i'd be afraid the minute i got her all good to go i'd hear about a new mech that dominates
yeah its point 1 & 3 that deter to me from investing at this point, and also she's too old
i never hurt for bke back in mastesr but now that im in ex i've constantly found myself thinking 'damn wish i had a bke'.. but thats not gonna push me to invest in her either lol i'd rather cope until she's crept at this point
yeah perfectly said
shes still really good, its just that a) most people have her ranks and b) jizo hadn't appeared in awhile
trashed?
i think bke
ss2 hot and lvl 50 pri i may as well use my a rank dbj <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
same finnix
she has some fun strats in ma even if theyre old they still work
i just want sss kmb coz i love her
i havent even unlocked kmb yet :(
i really want sss kmb too
i want to do sk and meme next
ive also given up ft and am farming fr/ely
same lol
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
14?
7t doesnt sound that situational.. koc does. 7t will be the bis weapon, koc will be cope but still useable on ss bosses.
pog for me coz my fr only s2 <:E_KEKpat:849972793314902057>
so basically the only time dos will be used is on ss ma lol any other time it looks like 7tr blows it out of the water
<:E_pepelol:792804369749377024>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
PX
she looks img as hell
no one, thats why i said until we know herrscher is 5.9 <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
looking at akalao's video it doesn't seem like it lol
anything but teri herrscher
<:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
i have no problem with that
<:FuHuaSmug:857524710223904768>
but wont we get to see ely's reveal before the beta?
thats so fucking far away
senti will get adv supply in 5.8<a:aPES2_SadGeCopium:903234074372632616>
<:E_worry:792812046563016704>
how much lonnger until we know herrscher is 5.9
raiden def had the easiest plant farm
but of course everyone was pulling ayaka
i was entering everyone's world trying to take their flowers
never forget sakura blooms on ayaka release
the worst is when they release a new region with a new character
always pre-farm, nothing more ass than pulling a character and not being able to use them for another week
aster is probably
lets go
hot's time to shine
<:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930>
smh
that 621
the other top 2 have ss too <:A_HuKek:803544603751612436>
760 highest in mine with SS
did you get a lot of SS in your bracket? i had 3 fucking ss in my nirv lol
did you pull aponia for sushang ruby
actually i htink i wouldn't mind sushang either if i had my hot team
i dont mind if husk stays, hes ez mode with sw.. its sushang and jizo and tona that worry me lol
i still need to skip the qua and bke shills too lmao i aint got shit for this patch
how to skip this aponia shill patch to get to 5.8 faster <a:aPES_RunningCrying:666320715162583060>
<:A_HuDisgust:805786818070970389>
no aponia demoted to agony
cannot wait
me too i love that vid
literally same <:E_pepelol:792804369749377024>
and she's perfect <:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120>
<:SeeleSweat:843946435271852103>
what the fuck.. is this level 10
still a surprise
<:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561>
heki making more bad decisions, gonna pull 0/4 aponia
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
fragile got like 730+ using hot i think
naisu
and that
use hot keilao
discord strim sucks
its lag city for me too
<:huh:966619839307321394>
guys when new herrscher comes we should all strim our pulls
<:monkaS:814357658698121277>
da heq keilao just plays in silence?
you mean forbidden?
<@148145559897636865> something else i should i use on FR? i dont have irene <a:PU_pepeHmmMath:850331115637833728>
whels will find a way
<:E_pepelol:792804369749377024>
heki the choices you make istg
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
when can i get the xy sword there too
so they add marg+neb to exchange shop
ofc keilao immediately weighs the pros and cons based on MA
you dont have a physical team either
you dont even have hos dude
stop the madness
you're so desperate
a rank dbj no less
aponia good but am poor
nothing lol
its appearing with marg in someone's beta exchange shop but according to mariso there isn't anything patch notes so <:shrug:682697895769800777>
i did do that already <:sadge:814362586631503953>
oh just looking at dps windows
this isnt sw
wait
thank you!!
i cant find nirv refs
the meter doesnt have enough up time the way im doing it
yeah idk how people are scoring with sw in nirv then
<@148145559897636865> do you know how the paralyze trauma meter works? like if i'm using fr/sw, do i need to make sure the trauama is full purple to go dmg on sw? or can it work if the bars are still half way para?
fragile is prob just salty eden is looking better than fr on her team now
me too, i know its just drive up genshin whale transfers but i'm happy for it anyway since all the characters have been super interesting to me so far
i do hope they keep updating with altered dialogue/lore but if the arc ends with the realm disentegrating, we'll prob never get anything like that as far as ER updates
its crazy looking at scores comparative to other servers.. the highest in my nirv bracket is a 13/13 SS aponia with 731 <:huh:966619839307321394>
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
PE one of the best investments i made on my account, shes so good
who did they use on tank then? ely?
holy shit the amount of sw in that lobby lol i never see that many
<:E_pepelol:792804369749377024>
of course i have thunder queen
exactly.. when we all know they will anyway
i love how fragile keeps doomposting like they're aren't immediately gonna pull that weapon and max it out
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
pack it up bois 7tr is ass
seen a lot of pics
free pulls can be saved too you know
<:PU_ppCatGun:679402542546812972>
make up your mind
now you're pulling hfs gear
prob have more luck with hfs than that team
did you try hfs on that stage?
yeah give marg eden a shot with dbj handel + fischl
unless you have fr irene
djb in handel, fischl in turg tesla maybe? but you'd need eden too
you could use that
oh yeah
i believe in you
make it work
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
do you have zhenyi
yes
from killing sushang
<:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930> LES GOOO
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
but you need hos to use her :/
i havent seen any second options apart from hos fr and sw.. you have to look at your options: do you have a ranged? do you have a bio dps? do you have a lightening dps? if you have one of those three, you can start coping there. if you don't.. time to commit.
only suffering since abyss opened to be had here
gm aster
eeesh
hos seems pretty good too
yea thats what i would do lol
ty ty
i did it <:Derple:646956861861658624>
sw rc hb
yea the weather lol
<a:W_HuHyperYAY:855390254559002624>
yayyy i was able to clear my side stages without para
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
where <a:modcheck:848583401728507931>
so cn only testing with SSS hot now or <:E_pepelol:792804369749377024>
ig that or mei m
you're already p much guaranteed retain since you've got turg and cat lol
but i doubt you need any ranks to retain rl
s2 is good though
no
70 frags for SSS circus tits too
30k from the outfit supply
<:HoSDerp:956555543378538596>
my asterite situation looking better
i aint got time to farm fucking anan
maybe i get lucky and snipe some welt from zhenyi
i have hor but no hor stigs
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
i'm fucked
is hodou type counter this patch
you mean torus
CONGRATS
if youre not charge attacking youre not doing dmg anyway
its better than nothing
welt being in off rates is actually pog for me.. i have no welt and no ana
try singles
who the fuck knows when you'll see zhenyi again
its a no brainer
i would do it dude
full zhenyi is worth the risk imo
<:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
where is the zhenyi banner
who the hell told you to make ss phx a prio <:huh:966619839307321394>
yeah same
heki what are you laughing about? you pulled 160x on hos and still don't have her, and you're coping if you think you're not gonna spend another 10 pull before you save up 8k crystal
why would you think that lol
$100
<:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120>
... heki2
as always
i'm just making fun of heki
<a:X_ZhongliSwipe:854921178031194122>
not in 1 more minute
yes
<a:hypernodding:495458528832520192>
its time
<:FuHuaSmug:857524710223904768>
oh wait
gl pulling hos expa today heki!
she give team sp? i thought it was just her own i can reemmeber
couldnt wait to say told yall mihoyo hates mei
hes been waiting for it
idk why im not really feeling seele's look tho
her and himeko look great in hsr
bronya so pretty in every mihoyo game
he wishes
so bothered
<a:hypernodding:495458528832520192>
she rose from the dead this patch just to get people to pull before new qua herrscher
badly
idc the element just fucking give qua or mech pls
let me just retain nirv sushang with SW
i like the way they release eden because i still havent struggle buss'd FR's ranks so it at least allows me to compete
i-
wow maincord actually tellig people not to pull DK even if you have hot already full gear
is that saying her weapon is 20% less than dos on non-counter
against countered
but im pretty sure it works
abyss not open for NA yet
this girl seriously lives rent free in his head every single day
yeah lol
you need rehab at that point
like jesus
whales that t100 and nirv retain and make multiple accounts to top different servers.....
akayuki is sea?
i saw marbles score and their placement and was like wtf lol
MA is where vet players go to die
its funny you never see seele fans saying 'mihole hates seele' when they're life support battlesuits every time one is released every 10 years
mihoyo hates mei so much they make 2 meis in honkai alone <:CryingMan:861897710595735562>
maybe they just hate her that much
she's in every game they ever make but i'm not sure
do you guys think mihoyo hates mei?
what did they nerf on hfs in v3?
yep
well for me its worth regardless coz simp but yeah the f2ps shouldnt have been pulling any way
i think most were expecting a nerf, but not like this
they couldnt wait til v3, adv would be gone by then
yeah most people got ss hot without adv and then even more saw 7t and pulled that adv
well i thought her ss2 would be big since she could force evasion in ult with 7t but idek if thats there anymore now
yeah i think all mariso testing using ss1+
but def a lot of people with ss+
idk about sss
its simp purposes, i really want my dead hot to be sss
i might be able to get ss3 hot after all
even with hos havers
gustav is used all the time in ma
fen said that hekate pri works on rime too
pog
they added gustav to craft
wait
ty keilao
ok i done strim for now
i mean i want to be able to do this but its gonna take time for me to build up to it
i dont have that much xp chips
nah its not worth man
915 attack lmao
yep
keep 2 pc sword tho?
can i stream rq
and hos takes too long to gain sp that way
i tried doing the pe > sr drop, the shield doesnt move
rangers literally does nothing to that shield
halp 
if i had senti pri i'd just run senti dps on this tbh
one dayyy
i just dont have the infrastructure to compete in ma yet without some serious malding and its just not worth me
ive tried without sirin and its 100x worse
ranger isnt doing anything
yeah to break her shield
i still need sirin lol
it aint doin shit
yay i got it, tysm for the tip <@148145559897636865> <:E_RaidenHeart:882522145048133643>
omg i hope so
yeah key cope sounds mass cope now lol
next thursday
oh wow
cn 5.8 starts 6/6 right
well i will ask for your help again when the time comes
i redid it a lot and i never saw skin as prize
but i got the gold bingo and it was reso?
i tried to do it on hua's skin and i never got it
IDK HOW TO DO THAT STUPID BINGO
IS IT REALLY
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
thanks for nothing
owo 8ball will the new dk get another buff
whats blacktea
lets play teh word game
2 sp release + 1 s rank per patch
his head looks like an ant
dont you guys think this looks like kosma
i dont want gris to be good
sss fgo or she's garbage
lmao
i just hope my ss2 hot will be able to survive this <:PES2_FloorCry:888440872990027838>
ask him
he knows
diavoros
fuck you then <a:aPES_AngeryDoorLeave:666320713652764672>
yes ruby lets cope
cat skin so poggers
not terrible, at least you got everything!
CONGRATS
CARVVVV
<:PES_PoggerSip:585724569197871105>
<:PES_PoggerSip:585724569197871105>
omg theyre adding more cat bundles
did you get her gear then?
carv how are you pulling for hfs gear with that crystal income
no
idc hot deserves more time to shine
so is hots
of course lol
hell yeah i heckin love investing in 3rd option valks!
yea very cool carv congrats
<:E_pepelol:792804369749377024>
i dont undrestand how anyone can hate hfs, she has some of the coolest combat in the game
she'll get one patch and back to ma slaving
people are coping hard that hot is stealing anything
thats what im saying
oh no the foca select is getting you
isn't she complete doggy without her gear?
mobius f2p friendly pick one
i hope he's okay
i wonder what ed is going through right now
pog i'll take it
lmao which one
maybe cope idk
i think mobius will get a skin too tbh i'm starting to think she hasn't got one because they're saving a big skin for her story in this arc
i want ely herrschey + ely elf or mei herrschey + ely elf + ely herrscher skin
either way we get an ely elf though
i'll be happy with ely or mei
maybe they just give mei average key because shes also this years herrscher <a:aPES2_SadGeCopium:903234074372632616> <a:aPES2_SadGeCopium:903234074372632616> <a:aPES2_SadGeCopium:903234074372632616> <a:aPES2_SadGeCopium:903234074372632616> <a:aPES2_SadGeCopium:903234074372632616>
and people will pull dk regardless of how shit it is for the atk
they should've thought of this before the release, shit planning and they expected everyone to just be fine with this shit and happy to spend more money every patch for constant creep
i'll wait for testing
kind of amazed people are defending the nerf like this game doesn't powercreep every patch, she should have an op weapon on release because if it's just average, she'll be dead by 5.9 but whatever
<a:aPES2_SadGeCopium:903234074372632616>
yeah hot is still viable guys dw
<a:aPES2_SadGeCopium:903234074372632616>
what a legend
80 pulls twice and gave up
i just have to keep doing random stages until i get 20
wow what a fun excersize
<@148145559897636865> why does it still say i need to clear shit when ive cleared everything
oh i have to complete this and i get it?
to craft it
yes im gonna fuck myself soon
fuck aponia pullers
not fair
for the +10 atk
the problem is whales will get the new key regardless
<a:aPES_RunningCrying:666320715162583060>
but i have no lightning team currently
well im definitely gettign that
do i get aponia
ruby
im just gonna become a retired whale
i disgust myself
damn how embarrassing i score same as heki
idk the quickest way, i go all the way back to my profile and view lineup for ma lmao
how did you use the same team without hos
who did you use
i dont have ae for ranger
gn aster
ty eli
someone help me cope.. is it possible they buff again?
i dont have mobi :(
if hot is garbage again, im back to having no lightning dps
im seriously debating just getting aponia now
<a:aPES2_SadGeCopium:903234074372632616>
do you think they did this because cn was pissed about aponia?
hi <@964806731471405086> <:PU_PeepoSadHug:585916633692897283>

dw im sure your falcon pri lvl 55 will do wonders on that
pri-ing falcon without sw is like ... why
i think you should slow down on the pris.. focus on maxing one dps first

heki joining us soon <:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561>
im fucked on the lineup because rc and hb are on husk <:CryingMan:861897710595735562>
gather + switch cd + sp regen <:FuHuaSmug:857524710223904768>
and i def want the 4 star ely elf
thats my plan as well
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
ruby if its ely will you SSS
lmao
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
but idk i feel like it has the better support avenue
yeah and i also feel like the gap between S0 and SS SW is quite large
i think of it like.. ice has the most well rounded support though. you'll get turg which can act out on other teams + rc which is highly, highly valued as a general elemental support as well. the only reason not to invest in an ice dps right now would be herrscher could be ice.
is there a reason main cord always tells beginners not to start by investing in ice of all elements? i feel like they're living in the past with it doesn't have as much coverage and can't brute force like lightening/fire can <a:PU_pepeHmmMath:850331115637833728>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>

my friends gear after trying to pull aponia
yeah i see irene b but not full bastet, but myriad has top scores in full bastet too
idk their channel <:SeeleSweat:843946435271852103> i looked on ref in blustorm channel but there isnt a ref for ss0 sw with rc in full bastet
i dont understand how people are scoring 760+ with SS SW in nirv <:SeeleSweat:843946435271852103>
what the actual fuck
also the banner rollovers

i just was looking at my paimon.moe.. <a:HUH:960281654046375986>
it wouldnt be so bad if the weapon system wasnt the way it is.. like the pity system is so ugly on weapon anyone who even tries prob has plenty of standard weapons by now
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
no thank u

im sure this is fake but what does that last bullet mean? how does r99 work?
<:PES2_SusSmirk:838743169645543424>
maybe he can adjust his shit attitude toward all his ex friends a bit <:ReallyMad:930908505890770954>
i allow it only if there's more hcq lore when we return
yeah okay thanks i thought i saw him say something like that but i wasnt sure
i keep seeing people say dan heng is not coming to penacony.. did he already tell us this and i forgot? lol
not before i get a blade skin

<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
right? ill just never understand lol
ak i dont like the aesthetic personally
im gonna look into it
but the quality just aint it
im fr about to give up and just go find a degen gacha
w <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961> w looks like ganyu and shenhe are getting their default skin in 4 star version <:Pog:816798522275004466>
i will be at work then so depends on how busy i am, just ping me <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>

both genshin/hsr have such long patch this time it sucks
yeah <:Sadge:790930438733955092>
does next patch drop 19th?
i havent evne seen her do dmg
why they have to go about this so roundabout in description just say ruan mei gets 100% break dmg
what is ice break dmg? break effect but for ice only? lol
with 2% cr she will bring that damage once every month to a fight
i mean its gonna be there im js her dmg gonna be like sw for me more than likely
literally useless for anyone who isnt me coz i cant build her dmg
is it only for herself
literally useless for anyone who doesnt have jl
we have a lot o those her
oh i was thinking of like the individual housing resorts
yeah a lot of them around me are
<a:cozyWave:1049152310569340958>
its probably cozy there
its fine, take me to the pines

His real name is not explicitly revealed in the game, as he prefers to be called by his title or simply as the Old Man.
barry keoghan is a genshin leaker now <a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
<@1053015370115588147> is alhaitham a top or bottom?
<@1053015370115588147> who is hotter: wriothesley or alhaitham?
um
<@1053015370115588147> who is the hottest genshin impact  character?
mediocre healing my ass
yea its the only viable way to play diluc these days <a:OMEGADANCEBUTFAST:952287130812571758>
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
oh she's hydro
<@1053015370115588147> is cloud retainer and plunge dps?
we literally have one plunger and they were released in 1.x üò≠
if anything she will allow for your team to plunge
she cant possibly just be for plungers
idk who this leaker is so i hope its fake but if its not, surely she just offers a plunge buff among others <:C_HuJerry:807167698626281492>
supposedly after navia patch (lantern rite)
i quite literally have nothing to do with her if i cant get an anemo healer
if this is true furina is gonna be the biggest waste of primos ive spent all year
<:KEKShook:1131355161298743396> im not alone
dont tell anyone <a:aPES_Hide:651094730544775190>
fr once i started i couldn't stop.
shes funny tho
hot take.. i dont like her animations...
<:HmmCall:1029615650815082557> im on the phone with da wei rn and he promised me
i will look forward to yixing nihility release
i'd love to run a dot team but i dontd like any dot chars outside kafka
right? jy/topaz work suprisingly well together <:bladegasp:1136513716788133948>
ayo!
<a:mhm:1046326820389273600> i really just cant wait to see proper gameplay
lmao
yeah def not for clara lol
and soon to be trailblazer <:Peepo_King:832532175613198336>
i think people are understimating how good she will be in hypercarry too <:DK:861368415717818369> like unless you lucksacc'd bronya she'll be premiere for everyone i  bet
<a:flushedstrip:1160922074190204968>
im sure ill have something useable by the time she gets here
aight
is yours on atk or spd boots
just build atk spd?
idk what good stats look like for them
is blade first or kafka
ill prob get her on rereun
stand still
gresham is secretly a renhenger
blade and dhil on same team <:bladegasp:1136513716788133948>
how is she?
oh you're finally bringing out your kafka
but i think her kit is probably more for future chars
yea surpsingly i dont think she looks that bad
overload dps take it or leave it
we'll talk about it later <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
insane genshin leak
its not about his dmg, its the same thing im kind of getting at with rm here
also the turn extension compensates for my skill issue
the dual dps with topaz is just crazy already
the more i play this game the more i find myself looking for team synergies that feel good to play instead of just big dmg
the turn extension sucks tho id still have taken that over def shred
how much does she give now
you'll be doing much bigger numbers but.
theres no turn extension either in her eidolons
i dont have that one üò≠
removed from skill, lc, and eidolon
oh... ruan mei does not give spd anymore
thats disappointing
<:bladegasp:1136513716788133948>
<:HmmCall:1029615650815082557>
oh no its pokke
actually you know what im lik 90% sure gouba has a vid commenting on this
hh+rm seem to work really well together
well hes pulling rm regardless, im moreso asking for hh
my friend is jl main and wants to know before hh leaves if both of them together are an upgrade
<@370438895965306882> do you know what jl's best team is looking like with hh+rm? are they an upgrade for her?
jeez i didnt know she gave that much
<:PES2_HmmmmNoted:849698641412096030>
will make my goal in the 120+ zone
ok good to know
cant wait to actually see this in action because im seeing the bar high for my follow upers at this point <:derp:960359265032339496>
awesome
<a:mhm:1046326820389273600>
i suppose i should consider rm keeping them down longer too.. it may be viable <:HMM:966625453194485760>
if i do rm+hh+jy+topaz, can i get away witout having to run any spd boots on jy
<:ICANT:1091897440220745848>

im we
looking forward to sunday's model
thanks tai
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
thats just my opinion, idk what acheron even does i just know shes also lightning nihility
my logic is that there are 2 nihility 5 stars coming right after next patch. unless you just want to go for kafka and build her as your dot team, i would take the support rm offers to your account first and see what these other nihility offer. maybe they would offer something you like more over kafka and you'll already have rm whatever you choose
for huohuo ive seen most whales going e1 over lc and using shared feeling s5 for excessive er
thats why i said pull rm over kafka lol
idk what acheron does but kits can change a lot in beta too
i would pull rm over kafka rn, we have 2 more nihility 5 stars coming straight after
i might needa get two copies of the lc so i can put one on her and one on ty in jy comp <a:HEHEHEHE:1040015176130367491>
i agree ruan mei is gonna be a good pull for anyone as she is rn
<a:mhm:1046326820389273600>
its certainly better than genshin who hasnt seen an on field 5 star tall female since inazuma with an evergrowing inflation of twinks <:PES_NotStonks:800129909439725608>
honestly though, so many men in this game
lunae ruining everyone's fun <:ReallyMad:930908505890770954>
<:PES2_Broke:849698641388109885>
im definitely pulling.. i think im gonna skip ratio after all lol
what tai said.. i think if you've an invested dot team and skip her, you will be feeling the pain of it the same way people wish they didnt skip luocha
her kit definitely provides a lot
everyone ive seen talk about her says shes very good
rm is good
kafka and blade are rerunning
<:KusaHehe_Axiliyah:992975299446845460>

why is she a 4 star
then i remembered blade is getting a rerun before he even get his own sq <:ReallyMad:930908505890770954>
i thought maybe they're saving him for an upcoming important storyline or something
where is jingyuan
wow they actually use bosses currently in the game <a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
tbh his basic anims kinda boring and why i gotta stare atthe clothed side in battle <:Really:1141123215117262908>

im pulling clorinde because she fights for freedom
cloud retainer, arle, unknown 5 star, and clorinde
but yeah, it looks like they're gearing up to have a lot more 5 stars coming at the tail end of the region this time instead of frontloading it
arle prob not for another 4-5 months
put raiden on a weapon banner i could use challenge mission impossible

skirk is probably not until khanriah lol
<:Deadge:966011458691416124>
shes' not even tall
oh youre asking for the reverse actually, it might work but his weapon doesn't give much base attack since he scales with hp
you're asking if a weapon that scales on attack and buffs normal attacks will work on a hp scaling character that charge attacks <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>

yes
<@309634550273933314>
must have her 
yeah i dont see how they could put enw follow up out and not benefit topaz tbh lol and if it were for jy, why do sw rerun now?
oh nvm he doenst follow up
the new set is probably for argenti if it aint benefit topaz
put new set out for jy, skip his rerun in same patch <a:mhm:1046326820389273600>
its so hard to get that thing to drop
im telling you bro
ccan never have nough messenger
ape domain
that set will probably be useful for support and the other one a total dead weight <:Really:1141123215117262908>
this increases damage for allies with similiar stats to the wearer uh wot lol
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>

jl has
kinda sucks now they skip midyuan coz id just pull on his for her lol
u get her and hanya
imagine being a sw waiter rn
it looks like 1.5 banner schedule is houhou first half and hanya ft. argenti second
she reads like a 5star
what the hell is the catch here
<a:NOSHOT:1137423060153143306>
yea not anything, but u heal on turn start + whenever u use ultimate
u heal urself too when u do anything right?
put her on houhou banner <a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
before jy? <:bladegasp:1136513716788133948>
yea exactly.. i gotta skip some people coz i know i want these two and ratio <a:NOSHOT:1137423060153143306>
argenti is so pretty and has hanya but if houhou good ill prob get her instead üò≠
will wait to see houhou kit
idk yet
its whoever was dripped first innut
tet r u getting argenti
omg blade naked eidolon will come with voiceline now what will it be
grandpa in jl quest <:Peko_lick:901185321113374772>
lmao stfu
imo she nowhere near as good as luocha (for my account) and i only got her for second sustain. i just shoot myself in the foot if houhou has cleanse heal sp and energy <a:NOSHOT:1137423060153143306>
shes defensive sustain is what i mean
ima fr off myself if shes better than fx for me and i wasted all that jade on her <a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
<a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>

lol why does he gotta say it like that
when are they releasing clorinde <:Really:1141123215117262908>
not charlotte having better anims than the archon 
i wish they give her summer skin or something <:Smilechamp:970181655576846376>
its kinda opposite for me, i dun like her base design but her combat animations are cool and i like the playstyle
<:bladegasp:1136513716788133948>
tbf tho if we count from hoh release she has had less boss than her
<:Sadge:790930438733955092>
im sorry david i will not doubt you again
omg
<:C_HuJerry:807167698626281492>
what does he keep getting muted for
im not talking about boss count, i want to see how many times hoh boss gets put in abyss vs sw
<:DK:861368415717818369>
show me the numbers
will i?
come on david you're coping if you think sw gets more use than hoh

i even see waifu enjoyers pulling him
its actually crazy how popular neuvillette is lol
<:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
my fontaine roster is looking like.. wrio, clorinde, furina and arle
i didnt spend all my resources investing into layla just to not use her <a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
im actually annoyed because her kit looks good
maybe i had set my expectations too high
same man she look basic as hell to me
not loving these animations.. especially vignette bubbles lol
<:haroldcringe:854639707958673408>
maybe hoho doesnt have cleanse coz one of the 10 upcoming harmony units does <a:Cocking:1009511504405606481>

i think she's dull
<:E_RaidenSip:882522778769711134>
sam 23-23
oh well
yea that is really unfortuante lol
one of the cringest things genshin does is when you enter a new region all the new characters like oh mygodd?!?! is that THE traveller?? the legend himself? i've heard so much about you!
aether is such a little bitch boy
like if they have to do self insert, i wish they just honkai formula.. we have kiana independent mc and then we have trashcan captain for weirdos
omg
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
pretender
cherry got the fake smile
also i dont think all the hsr chars are up caelus ass like they are the traveller
i think caelus/stella don't bother me so much because of the jargon they use, it's often how i feel if i'm responding because my interest when i'm self inserting goes to zero and caelus always responds in that exact fashion. like he knows idgaf unless it's pertaining to his character, which often it isn't when you get a sarcastic response option.
fr i hate reading a story like its myself playing, i like to read/watch other people pls
every character in genshin is more interesting than traveller, like unless mc is kiana style who fucking caressssssssss
half the time its self insert and half the time traveller is their own char
i just  cant with self insert stories and genshin can't decide what it wants to do
omg my dream
in 4.2 we're going back to sumeru and the storyline will be focusing on the various ways haitham and kaveh are fucking
ryan beater or whatever his name that posts hi3 stuff is sharing them so be careful
fyi there are really big spoilers going on rn re genshin story so avoid twitter
its joever
<:KEKShook:1131355161298743396>
thank you!
don't be sorry! thanks for taking the time, it makes more sense than google!

neuv has beef with zhongli and other archons!
omg i cant believe you went to bed as soon as this leak <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
omg <@309634550273933314> did u see neuv lines?
<a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
where is alhaitham
bro cyno is in literally every single event
help i cant stop collecting men
both are pretty
im not building lynx, does bailu or fx herself work
hoho is hsr yea
like it dont even feel like a patch rollover
has to be the deadest patch in a long time for me
<a:PepeLaugh:946799559969996850>
but anyway topaz/clara if that works i will pull then
idk we'll see hopefuly she get buff for jy
if she's sp sufficient could run double sustain with fx i guess
oof idk man huohuo has no means of cleanse/protection
she's good with clara then like for sure?
idk what to do with her if i pull her tbh <:Sadge:790930438733955092>
<@370438895965306882> does topaz not work with jy? on a fundamental level?
is this gonna be an upgrade of blade? <:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>

one more refine for midbibitor <a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
ok time to some gamba wish me luck <a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
<a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
its not fair
yea fr you can tell just from the trailers
i bet that new zzz game will get all the sexy stuff <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
unlucky
<:dead:808739535419998239>
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
someone with rizz always knows what you want to hear
for zoomers
suave
its like
can i cope for slutty outfits or is this fr genshin 2.0 <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
what is the age range for this game vs hi3?
yeah im hard coping they will give more skins
as much as i would love more blade
yeah i dont really have any hope for anyone aside from march and dh rn unfortunately
but we have midbibitor now hopefully they will not do this in hsr
its literally the dumbest decision they could make
we need summer midyuan and summer blade first
no
but would it be better to ignore def and go effect res?
what does defense do for her? heals are hp based im assuming
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
whats her ult do
so fx ult wil only protect imprison from one of them on their turn?
so like the imprison duo on 10-1, they get to hit you twice during their turn
her cc immunity, does that protect the team for a full turn or just for one hit?
she look pretty sustainable
she just did <a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
ty
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
are there any vids of fuxian vs kafka in moc?
<a:Modcheck:1033094910712230119>
heki about to drop a tiktok edit by ufotable
where is midyuan
we dont care
<a:Cocking:1009511504405606481> maybe
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
but i still can't figure out how blade got shu shu's gift
he didn't want to lose himself and he enlisted blade's help
maybe he was having an identity crisis that now parallels dan heng's since his trailer talks about the high elders becoming more and more like the last one
like he didn't want to be the high elder, so he tried to reincarnate her as the one
i have a new theory that dan feng attempting to resurrect baifeng was a kill two birds with one stone thing
im sure even neuv himself will want her
she'll have some supportive capability that's hard to ignore
i guess they do actually want to make him special <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
yeah kinda wild he's surviving the beta as is
<:fobEEE:803093116616835142>
<:PES2_Pray:513342216287027220>
but are you prepared to feel my wraith if you pull 3 yanqing
actually true
sureLY
maybe ill win a 50/50 on dev mode
i think im going to sign up to fob's viewer pulls this time
üò≠
you make me sick
im sick of you winning thats why im asking
did you win 50/50 on kafkek btw
let me know how your dhil pulls go <:DK:861368415717818369>

how can we fill luocha's hole? drop the responses below
average male <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
who wouldn't but really yeah ofc he be upset but lets burn her at the stake escalated quickly
also jl's line about blade, idk if shes asking him to kill her or she intends on blade killing dh to repay her? since jl already beat df she has the skills to train for it. i dont think so tho coz idk why she wouldnt just go after him herself. they better explain this shit and not leave it to the void for the next 10 years
wtfff i dont remember arthur being that big of an asshole <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
yeah she turned into a monster and jl kill her
idk who the third person could be tho
from jingliu's story it osunds like she heavily blames dh/yx for baiheng so whatever price blade is talking about im not sure shes involved
yeah bailu is baiheng, baiheng died, df/yx tried to revive her, flopped
right but what end up happening at the end? i just remember guin and lancelot boning behind arthur's back
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
who tops when jy is involved
anyway i have a better question
idk he doesnt scream power bottom to me either
df could top but dh is such a wuss
wow i was jut typing the opposite
uh no because danheng is a clear bottom bitch
let them be they are in their ao3 era
yeah because they were lovers
LMAO
i dont remember that from the legends lol
seriously i thought i was going crazy
who was arthur's gf? wasn't that guinevere?
i also didnt know she was evil
i thought they had an affair or something lol
guinevere was killed by lancelot?
interesting
lancelot huh
you pull a lot of characters, vertical is more like you're pulling heavy on one character and whatever their team needs
apparently friendly units = team
The wearer's Crit Rate increased by 18%, follow-up attack Crit Damage increased by 30%. after equipper does a follow-up attack, Target receives Tamed debuff, which can be stacked twice. When friendly units attack tamed enemies, every stack of tamed increases the Crit Damage of that attack by 12%.

ill be honest, they both just look okay to me rn ill probably like them more once i meet them though <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
here he is
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
improving model is expensive
pls understand they are a smol indie company that have only cornered 70% of the gacha market
i hope they adjust him in beta <:haroldcringe:854639707958673408>
ugh ikr
yeah likes hes going mountain climbing
or lackthereof
his outfit reminds me of snezhaya, like childe colors

not cherry posting story spoilers with no tag <:PES5_DankGun:827518509373456404>
big plot twist
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
skipping dhil for made up fankit
why
someone please explain it to me
4 star skins every 6 months
never seen this type of char before <a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>
and dan heng wants nothing to do with his ass üò≠
that scene in the latest quest where blade and dhil were there and he showed up and there's just lots of silence said a lot
i feel so bad for jy.. hes like thousands of centuries old and has had to watch all his friends turn from him üò≠
yeah ive seen the theory they're one in the same
the theory with that is that baifeng is the monstrosity she killed but i dont now much about her lore in game yet
so how does it all tie together? what happened to the dragon heart? why is blade immortal? a\
im not sure if dhil is the cause of her death here or if she did a kamikaze
something happens here and baifeng rams the starskiff and disentegrates
dhil is fighting a god > yingxing is yelling and losing the battle while protecting him > dhil has to make a choice > he blacks out and turns into a dragon
char story 3 seems to go like
it seems she also died before blade did
yeah i just don't understand how it all ties together
still no idea how blade became immortal
the fuck did he do with the dragon heart
more confused than ever <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
reading dhil character stories
like why go through all the detail of those thigh high belt boots and skin tight top just to balloon his face out and throw a curtain over him
such a wasted design
rip neuvie 2023-2023
they babyface-ified neuvie

it would make no sense arle coming in 4.6
shame the covered it all up with a big curtain
<a:KEKsip:961615405464563752>
its this part that interests me
A1: Not quite so, Neuvillette's C4 and C6 both increase his personal damage, quite generously too. I reckon his C6 should have no issue making it into the tierlist of C6s with the highest RoI, folks who like Neuvillette should be pretty satisfied
its not lookin good for my wallet

disappointing those are the only 2 collab skins<a:Dies:1008341585085337711>
sw is pretty but as i said.. nothing will ever top her other skin so whats the point
hfs looks good
i did but for some reason i thought it could proc when you get to fb

yes
wheres my shirtless jy selfie
flop ass game
are they really just not gonna give us a quest for blade
nvm its for luka
<:bladeisee:1122163836259160194>
who will that be for
i jsut saw one of the names of the new companion quest is basically my pulse/my love/my dear
<:haroldcringe:854639707958673408>
i hope we will get a cinematic flashback at some point of all of them together
more content pls
i freaking love those two
yes they are
i really like blade/kafka, they have a unique relationship
thats so cute <a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
so without kafka blade would go crazy?
<:Evilge:960548412271505418>
and ill eat each one up
exactly
and yeah fr blade is walking ship material
yeah idk either im so confused lol
<:thinking:823956695469654017>
quest questions: 

1. blade's problem with dhil is that dhil is responsible for making him immortal right? but we still don't know how/why?
2. what was the whole point of that scene with dhil/yanqing/jy/kafka/blade? it was so strange to me kafka is asking blade if he's satisfied.. with what? he still didn't kill dhil. also, why does jy thank him for completing the task? what task? lol
3. is it confirmed kafka has mind control powers? if so, during the fight with yanqing blade calls upon kafka like she's meant to activate his powers. if she possesses mind control, what is the point of that? he simply could've just activated his mara himself no?
but i guess im crazy
i thought there was one that the camera pulled out enough to see his mouth too
yeah
i cant find it lol
am i going crazy
the other one has a more panic expression
this is how it looks now
i preferred the other face
idk why they change his sword expression tho
yeah i love blade's
ill wait for huohuo beta before i decide on fx
im only 100% on dhil and jingliu right now
theres just a lot of cuts
and i agree, i think its the lack of flow in his ult animation
but her general animations are very detailed and nice
like its so long
fu xuan is too extra for me
his animation on the boss fight looks better than his ult imo lol
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122> gdi ruby
<:Sadge:816798647760584757>
i hope jy's is him taking a shirtless bathroom selfie

shenhe was only 12 months, eula was like what? 16?
neuvie is some other race idk what it is but considering genshin's track record with regional characters outside archons, he'll be a nobody by natlan <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
npc #2
hxg just assume they knew each other because one time zhongli said i know an academic from suemeru <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>

look at this
you guys
ill be happy to show you his account if yall dont believe me <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
gratned he doesnt play every day but at lest maybe 2-3x a week
he still hasn't
my bf plays for 2 years and doesnt have a single good set coz he refuses to do anything but farm character ascension stuff
casuals can play since day 1 and still have shitty artifacts
hold on let me get da wei on the phone <:HmmCall:1029615650815082557>
maybe its just training wheels for casuals trying to clear abyss
i just know you can counter the enemy
i dont know if the enemy can even counter you <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
nothing matters
its genshin
<a:NOPERS:882201438741229568>
if you have an oneuma character fighting a pneuma one, it will paralyze the enemy for some amount of seconds and vice versa
they're adding a counter type mechanic to new fontaine chars
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
hey guys hoyo security is getting better, anyone out there wanna help me get around it again?
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
i will get exactly 30 <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
where are the loadouts
crystalfly trap?!
<a:duckass:1121931766597435443>
hopefully navia kit is using skill/burst convert to pyro dmg
<a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>
AINT. NO. WAY.
aint no fuckin way they give wrio, the only other phys 5 star, ANOTHER phys dmg bonus scaling
mero never post gameplay, gotta wait for the casuals
put it in the store mibobo!
i need hunters path <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
üòÆ‚Äçüí®
hunters path
lyney/yelan gettign elegy or vortex vanquisher what will it be what will it b
venti due for a rerun
nilou just had a reran and you flopped hak start saving <:DK:861368415717818369>
all that hydro dmg.. maybe yelan rerun
i thought lyney was a mono pyro unit <a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
<:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
its something to do with counters. if you have an oneuma character fighting a pneuma one, it will paralyze the enemy for some amount of seconds and vice versa
what incentive can we give these people to pull on fontaine characters when yelan exist? i know lets make a new game mechanic
the ousia/pneuma mechanic sound dumb af
very cool boss design
i think only the client can be downloaded rn
but we should see qol once beta is actually out
they will never do that lol
yeah and we'll have loadouts
6 months from now my baizhu might actually be useful
archon will def have hp mechanic
the dehya mains were right
lyney also has hp mechanic
i think because snezhaya is supposed to be next to mond
theyll save her for february flop kit
thers no way chlorine is soon
<:SKIP:1050634779386708018>
still ugly so we gotta skip
c3 applying to normals <:Thumb:961498460585078814>
thats all i see anyone talking about
youll all see
you'll see
its gonna happen ruby
if haitham and kaveh unique animation is making out when in the same party i'll allow it
SHUT IT RUBY
please loadouts or ill unalive <:COPIUM:882201338996465684>
but im guessing the only way they even know of party ui is because of unique character animations from beta client mine
dont know about the rest yet
only as far as party ui confirmed rn
SHOW IT COWARDS
WHERE IS THE NEW UI
please god update the store and add loadouts please please please please
i never thought i'd live to see this day
i seriously cannot believe they gave new bp weapons
really needed a ping for this one thanks!
exactly
yeah
maybe its just an old march model <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
eileen model doesnt look very exciting tho
welt talking about other universes having evil personalities was foreshadowing <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
is this just a march skin or..?
<a:duckass:1121931766597435443>
ugh need to waste 6 power on ascension alone
owo math 220/40
owo math 520-300
owo math 120+180
owo math 3*40
owo math 13*40
owo math 65/5
what about the normal talents, thats the same as all destruction chars right?
fml
its ascension as well?
i thought he just had new weekly talent mats
In case of an investigation by any federal entity or similar, I do not have any involvement with this server or with the people in it, I do not know how I am here, probably added by a third party, I do not support any actions by the member of this server.
hmm im not sure.. it just seems to be an entirely separate moc and fh being added for new enemies
every 14d
fh does not
moc does reset
they're adding another abyss in hsr
meant to post this
oops
<a:duckass:1121931766597435443>
i will be pinging the entire server on that day
well we know 4.0 will not have any archons so maybe <:shrug:682697895769800777> but i doubt it, they will likely gatekeep her with lantern rite
im way too deep in genshin leaks <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
exactly, we're lucky if we get the info one patch ahead. randialos and merlin are the only ones that are reliable in that aspect. even leakers like plusle and hutaolover, team china have repeatedly said someone would re-run next patch and randialos would say its someone else. everyone would spread team china leaks like gospel and randialos has always been right.
im not saying we dont have insider info, i'm saying when it comes to reruns - we definitely 10000% do not have those. art can be mined/stolen/whatever and shown to everyone, but the order in which a banner appears has never. not even from the most reliable leakers.
also this was already debunked by randialos who is actually relieable leaker <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
its impossible to say what is rerunning, mihoyo doesn't let that shit out. leakers only can guess based on beta, it has always been that way since they started the reruns
any leaker that knows the run schedule for an entire year is a big fat fucking liar
leakers dont know what strong means <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
it will be hard for me to skip her because shes so cool but damn.. with that kit id never use her <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>

the planar updates are good tho
idk
seems kafka got it worse?
kafka nerf'd too
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
this is unacceptable
just woke up to blade nerfs
ngl capitano putting every harbinger to shame rn
yes
yes tbh
omg<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
what is that chibi from
omg hes so beautiufl
kei ur supposed to be looking for haitham stop getting distracted byy the furries
i just noitced the elf ears with legolas as reference <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
omg its nahida of the void
kei share the naked haitham concepts
does genshin have big name leakers anymore? dim only does honkai now and uba does hsr.. merlin does genshin still but stays in his lane. new gen leakers are only interested in gaining followers. a lot of these concept arts were already leaked as blurry as fuck images you could barely see by these people, they basicallyy had the files and were just dripping what they thought was their prerogative to do
the leak itself is definitely real, i just dont know about the leaker's message
<a:W_HuPopcorn:812570589205495808>
massive genshin leak (again) - all concept art for fontaine, alternative concept art for different characters, concept art for unreleased characters, all of fontaine chars/weapons/region art
reference pics and everything, its like someone just went around to all the designers desks, download everything on usb, and walk out <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
for the book itself or your lawyer <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
like any old person off the street can just publish mihoyo artwork <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
mihoyo you better make an art book for genshin like you did with honkai before someone else does and gets your profits!!
the last line kills me
disregarding the leaker clout drama
but this message was shared from the person who leaked it
im not on 4chan
maybe tet can clarify if its real
wait til you see the message that came with it <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
tons of new char concepts, fontaine chars, fontaine region art.. everything
you can see it all on the subreddit, massive leak dump
im not gonna post everything
childe vs new body type 
these are like.. straight from inside concepts no? <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
oh my GOD why does everything have to be a discourse
<:PES_KindaCringe:644479445045870612>

blade first then kafka
its literally the opposite
<a:modcheck:870823155344756746>

my pull priority <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153> 
must have - blade, dan, jingliu, luocha

yeah
idk what the design team is on lately
wriosthsley or something
<a:emogif:855514680372887592>
are they running out of ideas<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
that better not he a claymore
yanqing is legit ruining this scene pls leave
is sw tuesday or wednesday
how does it decide what element gets weakness
for the weakness
what takes priority
for sw weakness tho what is the gimmick on that
also i just checked and bonya skill is dmg bonus not atk so prob is a good option for him still
ig depend if blade does too
yukong eat so much sp tho

what a year for seele fans
is there anything tet wont simp for
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
nvm gresham i math'd wrong, it run 52k jades
its not cheap, i'm just thinking in the context of genshin where an r5 weapon can run you over $500 with GOOD luck
theres 75/25, lets assume you win all of them. you're still pulling to 60-70 pity (assuming you're -10 like genshin has weapon vs character).. that's 10,400 jades if you're hitting 65 every time 1.5x top up wtf that is so cheap
it has to be more than that
what is the soft pity
damn i didnt think that cheap
in genshin i prefer whaling on support cons more than anything.. make my c0 dps feel like they're c6
refines so much chepaer
i'd like to know what the value is going on refines over cons with this game
<a:gunplss:863108840885977178>
die whale
oh i thought you meant jingliu.. you're getting cons on jingyuan? <a:HUH:960281654046375986>

his story 5 line is an entire book about his history with haitham
this literally screams i have a crush on the hot nerd at school but he hates everyone
At that time, Kaveh had just parted ways with his mother and was living alone. He would meet this junior student in the library at times, and would speak to him out of curiosity, and thus did he meet the Haravatat genius Alhaitham. But time would go on to prove that wishful thinking alone does not friends make. For Kaveh quickly realized that Alhaitham, though two years his junior and admittedly both extrem
fr
<a:PepeLaugh:946799559969996850>
mfer is literally <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153> essaying alhaitham
I guarantee you'll never meet anyone else who's as infuriating as him! And for the record, yes, I would say that to his face. Sure, he's smart, and sure, geniuses often come with a bad temper, but that's only half the story with him... He knows perfectly well how to appear friendly and likable to others, he just doesn't want to.
If he ever gives you the impression that he doens't really have a temper, or that he's rigidly logical like a machine, then you just don't know him well enough yet. He definitely has a personality, it's just... too big a personality. Most people wouldn't get it. Alhaitham helped me out a fair amount recently. If we were still as close as we were during our student days, then I'd be thanking him every chance I got. Now, though... I can't seem get a word of appreciation out of my mouth. Even if I could, I wouldn't want to give him the satisfaction. I guess you could say our relationship is something of a mixed bag these days? Honestly, with everything that's happened, it almost feels like the universe has been playing pranks on us... It's hard to make sense of it all... too much to process for one lifetime. I will say that it's not every day that you get to know someone like him ‚Äî I just wish he could rein in some of the worst excesses of his personality. Okay, yeah, that's never gonna happen.
are his voicelines out yet
sure but he isn't, he's a tortured alcoholic artist
signora confirmed nerd <:Smilechamp:970181655576846376>

combine it with his flimsy shield that is there for interrupt resist and you're golden
his healing is very good
but good for people who are interested in investing in qol cons/weapon
irrelevant changes
yeah he was excessively overhealing in the first place
yeah.. all the changes are for whales it seems
they bufffed his weapon too
pretty much meaningless changes

also baizhu is a healer. everyone downplays their role in the game because everyone thinks they're a god that doesn't need a healer.
tcers have a history of downplaying 5 star supports. kazuha, kokomi, and shenhe were all labeled either replaceable or mid. it's hard to gauge how valuable a support is without actually playing them on live.
her eyebrows look like this \ /

his application is ass so idek if that matter

his calc make sense, it require you to make sure your dps meet the EM requirements

<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
but maybe he contributes more personal dmg to elevate the team to the same dmg variance
i can't imagine he is going to buff more than c2 nahida
the question is how much <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
hate it when theres no cr ascension <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
dendro dmg
hp or cr
no i mean his ascension stat
we dont know his ascension right?
man i hope his shield is good
so could be credible then
ok ty
<:waiting:1027534309298544640>
name me one character that uses a talent material that isn't their own region <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
wenut isn't a weekly boss
baizhu use new weekly boss but its not liyue? <a:HUH:960281654046375986>
if not <:PES2_ScamFuckYou:838743169738211348>
if his sheild give poise
but uh.. looks broken if true
its so copy paste
i will be really surprised if his cons look like that
wfp is saying this leaker is credible tho <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
<:terifrownarms:959782410843742228> yes i c6'd her on her first run, she's one of only 3 i have c6
well if they're one of my favorite units yeah <:A_BaldTaoFrown:861373722405109761>
these are literally copy paste yelan constellations lol <:PES2_ScamFuckYou:838743169738211348>

is it even shipworthy if they're not tryign to kill each other at some point <:DK:861368415717818369>
yeah that makes it even better
mfw i know we'll never see something as beautiful as this in the cinematic
they can just clone kiameibronya in FC era and bring the mback
tet imagination still more likely to happen than mine <:DK:861368415717818369>
i wish
finale part 1 should end with everyone dying and time resets back to FC era <:DK:861368415717818369>
villainous herrschers dont exist anymore <:DK:861368415717818369>
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
if i join WS can i experiment with mei
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
who knows
truly adorable so i allow it
my fave retcon is how kevin was soliciting herrschers this whole time so ely could meet one
<:HaiSwipeAbs:1063118747210092594>
but i like where they're going with it
idk what that is exactly
oh you mean the fragment thing
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
think the money they'd earn, c7 unlock sex scene
id be happy if genshin just ended with kaveh and haitham fucking
<a:broke_hh:891735085303345252>
idk who GW or XW is but merlin is a beta leaker so fat F for that one
<:PepeLaugh:696051469337493534>
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
did you guys hear there is a new character in 3.7 coming?
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>

could be a 5 star, possibly 4
new event

oh ew
pela?
is it mei second row, 5th from the left?
true eli <a:nod:774308559487369237>
the seele one look so pretty
you just unlock only 4 at the start and you have to clear a quest or soemthing to get the additional 2
from streams i've been watching it's still 6
<:DK:861368415717818369>
5 stars before 4.0 are only baizhu, dehya, yaoguang
dehya 3.5
baizhu 3.6
yaoguang 3.7
so rerun patch will be 3.8 --> fontaine 4.0
i just really dont want nahida with him, her weapon is mid af
i'd be happy to see hunters path there too
its really good
if you don't have nilou just put it on layla or kuki
the sword is pog
they're pretty relentless with these new characters though if that's true <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
baizhu/nilou
nahida/shenhe
<:PES2_Pray:513342216287027220>
3.7 <:beyonce:820846343466909736>
what the hell kind of response is this <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<a:Streaming:1039019999811088414>
i dont think its much difference here in the US <:KKona:932813351581540422>
yeah i heard about cn kaveh being in a scandal that he cheated on his SO but i haven't heard anythign about grooming/minors (yet) with him. gross regardless. <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
i honestly thought en tigh was voiced by a girl
<:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
Ableism is the discrimination of and social prejudice against people with disabilities based on the belief that typical abilities are superior. At its heart, ableism is rooted in the assumption that disabled people require 'fixing' and defines people by their disability.
someone who makes fun of or disregards those with disabilities
stop being a creep
it's just fucking weird
haitham main discord actually got haitham en va in their server as well for an interview where half the server join voice chat.. that server is 90% 13 year old fangirls
isn't that what Oz VA got fired for too?
whats up with these VAs and grooming their fans
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
still 3 weeks until beta even start
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
cant wait for kevin to show up in aq next patch
<a:PU_PepeLickDonut:762442155901321256>
awwww

i mean
she looks so different with bangs
i like ayatos otto haircut tho
get grandma to bed
i dont like them
big dehya buff <:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
yeah tahts what i mean, will streamers be able to stream the final beta or its one of those nda ones
i mean like is it a closed beta or open beta?
is the final star rail beta closed?
sounds too good to be true but x.6 character (kazuha, yelan) are notorious for being broken and he's from liyue so <:wot:998941267041996862>
supposedly baizhu is shield e and coordinated attack q
her animations look really cool too
im just waiting for live to try her myself, these tcers have no idea what to do with her
yeah im ngl i really want that, i love not having to do dodge or think <:wot:998941267041996862> but she's pyro and i dont utilize any pyro reactions right now
does she give team poise or only herself?
lmao fuck u tet <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
praying baizhu gets a redesign üôè
if baizhu gets a dendro shield it means he's made for* a lot* of units, especially if his off field coordinated attacks are true
i'm way more excited for what baizhu is gonna do, no doubt he's gonna be cracked. but with all the dmg mitigation dehya is providing + just being pyro right before fontaine.. i do want a copy of her <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
ah they switched to her to hp scaling as well
whats even left to nerf at this point
thats a leak account.. theyre implying KK is actually going to be discussed in the upcoming archon quest <:mfw:840549220406263859>
just hope kaveh + kuki üßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
she'll only get runs on wanderer, same as gorou with itto
delusional
<:COPIUM:996309513328140319>
really hope kaveh comes with baizhu though
what is even the source on this nothing information
STC
Kaveh
big if true
please be dendro layla üôè
but dehya not far behind <:yikes:877047689521532979>
yeah i def agree with ruby, kokomi was the first. she had so much doom it was insane.
oh no i wanna playy star rail <:Woke:759887282042830889>
blade and the otto lookalike are so hot

LMAO
all S tier
so many women
i think i get what eli is saying maybe? for me there are some women that are just built sexually attractive like megan is, then there are women like natalie portman - not as voluptuous and obvious - but a more reserved beauty? <:hmm_hh:710693619677528065>
she is so stunning
jlo doesnt age
ok but we're talking about human celebrities
dont leave us in suspense tet
my biggest girlcrush growing up was natalie portman... i was totally in love with her and i still watch anything she's in <:hmm_hh:710693619677528065>

i even watch her recent d tier horror flick
i will watch anything with megan
i canteven watch michael's transformers garbage after the first one
guilty pleasure is still a plus and i'd push more of his bad movies into that territory than michael's
but roland at least has some variety
idk they both got a lot of shitters
i just saw his next film he's working with joaquin again <a:DIESOFCRINGE2:993217039453917244>
you get it <a:mhm:1046326820389273600>
roland emmerich
what about
c'mon who doesn't like the rock and armageddon <:DK:861368415717818369>
exactly, surface level movies but entertaining nonetheless
he used to be before he ruined his rep and fell down a transformers hole
but michael has a bad rep
michael bay
we're looking for someone who is extremely popular, mediocre talent, but you've seen all their movies and of them you have one fave you watch over and over again
but her lyrics resonate
her vocals aren't amazing
shes popular and everyone loves her
im interested tho.. who would be the tswift of cinema?

isnt that stephen king
lmfao
its a great show to pass the time if you're ever bored

mihoyo be like 'you spent 5k in our game this year? thanks
yea fr they will never do that again lol
how long have yo uplayed tai
i'd love to know how much iv'e spent in genshin too
i really wish they did that for all their games
people cope spending in hi3 like their total balance isn't there in huge numbers at teh top of the screen as a reminder
i was gonna say
oh lmao
thats fucking annoying
<:C_HuJerry:807167698626281492> oh my god

<a:screaming:999847278439309363>

this clip cracks me up
did any of yall play this? lol it was like my first try hard game when i was a kid
is he someone or just a npc
not this dude's rectangle lookin ass face again üò≠
no they are not
<a:PepeCringeEffect:1033095968259846236>
they never had it.. i watched a short disney doc recently on yt i think? it was eye opening.. did you know they've always been a broke bitch and the only way they survive is by absorbing their competitors? pixar, marvel, star wars, etc. they have been doing this since the beginning of time. they buy up a franchise to cover their first debts, and once they run that into the ground, they buy out hte next competitor to cover that debt.
dw cher i never do either
why she gotta look 10 <:Really:1141123215117262908>
can nikke fuck eachother
i would hope so..
6/10
what.. ive seen the combat jiggling ass
kinda bland ruby ngl <:reallyy:823957003721768972>
damn shame that game is just assplay i would play it <:ReallyMad:930908505890770954>
whos ur fave design from nikke
let me google
<:Sus:961612747408289842>
this one is cool
yea this one corny as hell
very pretty
like give this girl some bottoms and i think she still look great
yeah i mean not even taking into acocunt the shortness of the skirts/dresses/shorts, their design in itself looks pretty unique and beautiful for some chars
mihoyo could learn a thing or two
nikke has some really nice designs
ok buddy
but they're more cutesy to me
both of those are really good
skin tight black suits = w
same
actually tame compared to some other stuff i've seen from AL lol
their old bronya designs are grossly lewd, i think aponia is the most extra tho
stelle got a glow up <a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>

<@309634550273933314> u see the creator yet
<:ICANT:1091897440220745848>
im trying to think of a way to describe this but every time i type it out it sounds way too raunchy <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
a lot of the dynamics between the main characters are shared in the new YA novel but it just feels awkward sometimes because the themes are so adult it's just hard for me to imagine 18 yr olds dealing with such things
would recommend if you can
captive prince blew my mind the first time i read it
cant you just download on kindle?
but it was adult series, her new YA series is basically like gay harry potter but there's just so many times a plot is happening and im thinking this shit makes no sense
the book i jsut read was the same author that penned captive prince trilogy lol i was completely obsessed with that series, i even have a first edition book from when the charactesr had different names sand shit before she hit the big publishing house
oh yeah if you like trashy tv its phenom
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
im like bitch could you BE ANY MORE messy
i remember the last ep with the finale when whats her face fuckedd the husband on the wedding night
omg i love industry lmao
yeah
they just start being together
not time really given to their relationship or characters
im sure they're well written in the books but in the show they're just so awkward and forced
yeah it was pretty awful though
i only liked like 2 characters lol
i did watch the show though
i tried, too YA for me as well
then ive lost interest
does it have gays
no.. ive not heard of that
the captive prince trilogy?
<:bladegasp:1136513716788133948>
<:madge:955440575916691466>

genshin also doesn't have powercreep in the same sense these others do, they know if you dont want to pull a char after you pull your fave you'll never have to

started 3 weeks ago i think
its the current patch
üíÄ
so im just curious lmao
my friend is telling me he brought up neuv sales discussion in neuv mains and they jumped him
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
but idk how true it is
<@180679257851166721> do you know if it's true that cn gets an idea of sales by watching some chart with tiktok on it? lol after neuv sales were reported so low from that one site, i saw quite a few people say this
omg ur genius
when i turn the crystal blue, the current coming from the left stops.. but the problem is the current on the right i think? idk if im supposed to turn that one off
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
i dont see a switch
idk what to do tho, i change the color to blue and then i get stuck
<@309634550273933314> do you know what im supposed to do here <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>

noooooooo my adblock on yt not working this morning
KNOW YOUR PLACE
i remember that too lol
its just chatgpt
i heard they dont actually exist
i bet with the ui upgrade they will do that
<:Hmm:889032126622728192>
a lot of american banks dont like sending money to china
its probably a bank issue
my bank card wdorks fine tho
i get declined a lot on my chase card, it only let me top up once a day before declining it
yeah exactly
i think you literally just turn it on and open the game and the prices are in a new currency?
i definitely have to figure it out next time
ok not double but quite a bit more
i saw genshin whale saying he didn't use the vpn for neuv but he did for wrio and even those wrio cost nearly double the rolls it was less than his neuv <:HUH:1009112689487908944>
did it work
going on two weeks
i cant stop spending so i must stop playing
i uinstalled hi3 <:A_GaspTao:1098266330001572041> 
hsr

im doing that next top up
or have yo utried it
also did you figure out how to get vpn top up working
really.. how much
<:bladegasp:1136513716788133948>

ty
can i see
is there gameplay for that
what the hell is this üò≠
that is crazy lol
wow
i still havent tried it yet
i was so shocked how mainstream this is now
i was like whaaat
<:bladegasp:1136513716788133948>
and she was like 'idk i use chatgpt to compose my emails now'
idk how to compose this e-mail, how should i say this
i was talking to my boss yesterday (who is jewish) and i was like
and they don't use technology
and so the majority of my co-workers are jewish
i basically manage funding for private jewish schools
i work with a lot of jewish people

if you never got a double you're just not pulling enough <:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
üôè
we will all get lucky today
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
and guess what it was.. c7
the first time i ever got a limited double was on raiden's banner
kinda feel bad for them tbh
yeah lol
gj hoyo
yea fr im watching people play him rn and its always n your face
but furina will buff him quite a lot
especially if no shenhe
his dmg is pretty mediocre rn so yeah i expect a lot will be running melt
you can use him freeze, melt, or mono cryo
hes so ugly he could make wrio hit 40824m and i wont build his ass
i dont even know what he does
i really dont know but thats what people are saying
i have no idea
guys i heard mika is wrio's best support <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
<:waiting:1027534309298544640>
na not for like 10 hours
but you mean eu
i believe
for some reason i have like 5 useable sands/goblets but zero flower/feathers like wut <:Really:1141123215117262908>
same tet
yeah i havent been lucky in there either
i enjoy character progression.. so actually i enjoy farming artifacts until the end of time.. thats what i do. i just burn my resin, gamba artis, explore when i feel like it, logout
what you think i just login to pull and logout <:Really:1141123215117262908>
they 100% did this to incentivize players not 100%ing zones on release.. ngl it worked for me, i take my time exploring now <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
can i interest you in a new card instead <:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
my dream.. imagine we get to read and see so many cool chars/lore through something like that
in terms of keeping it hugely casual qol, yes.. they will never qol the players that are long term tho
ikr <:tiredge:1147515880834613349> idk if they ever will do that, i think they want to keep every char playable and exclusive because they want people to always pull for their faves
he shouldve been standard
its really a gamble but when hes so underperforming at c0 its not really fair
yeah it took me 2 years before i got my first qiqi and im a whale.. i had c6 diluc keqing and mona before i got her
i really wish he was standard lol oh well
yoimiya treatment
yea i think most peopleare skipping lol
did you pull?
im still NA <:Really:1141123215117262908>
i need 100 more bugs
theres no end in sight with those slots
gacha its like 'can they get it in this amount of pulls, will they win 50/50, etc'
when i watch slots it just feels like watching a bank drain
yeah thats true
i just notice trains quote in this tweet lmfaooo the irony
it makes me feel better about my own losses
so maybe its the same for gambling watchers
but im sitting there hoping they flop hard
i do like watching some gacha streams
maybe its just me
yeah it probably is something similar but that feeling
lmfao
i cant watch his gamble streams it make me sick seeing how much money he has go up and down like its nothing
for him tho i think its 100% about being at the right place at the right time
you can be smart in some ways and dumb ni others
i dont donate to charity coz im dumb and i dont wanna learn my money is for slots charities are not entitled to that
the way lil bro always says the worst thing
c1r1 should be fine for now
coz i have topaz to worry about and then furina and then cloud retainer and then shenhe rerun.. too many other banners to pull on
hpefully enough for c1r1
i think i have like 350 saved up rn
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
whale
is topaz next week?
i dont have any char that finds resources tho and i dont have dual monitor so im constantly flipping back and forth for browser map <a:Y_dies:818190915096281089>
i usually just go down the list of randoms until someone lets me in
yea i think so
i dont think tet let me have hers anyway isnt she pulling
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
last minute tho
i will
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
theres only 70 on the map <:Really:1141123215117262908>
i hate farming mats like this
these little shits are way too sparse tho
bro is coming out way too fast its joever for me
<:yikes:877047689521532979>
and then i can finally sit in my hole all weekend and binge a new hsow

yeah the concert was outside wet cold and rainy but i really couldnt cancel on my friend, i felt so bad for her coz literally everyone else cancelled on her last minute
i think that concert made it worse, i dont wanna go to the doc coz i know they just gonna say its a cold <:Really:1141123215117262908> ill give it today and tmr and if not better ill have to go
im sick bro ive been sick for more than a week now <:sobbing:824279352552194134>

yes
ill check it out after the trigun one then
im not much fo a manga reader i really like animated visuals <:sajj:1067071714518892584>
<:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561> ur so right
i keep seeing art on my timeline which is why i asked if its gay
yea they do look good
i havent watched a single ep and that is exactly the vibe i get lol like from the reactions it sound like anime power up happen every minute
<:KEKShook:1131355161298743396> saved me 20 hours
so many good summer skins on the chopping block <a:Y_Smh:977594042995068998>
but is the story good
is it actually worth watching? the art does look pretty
is jjk gay? whys everyone so obsessed with this anime
if i had done that and then saw the reveal i'd uninstall
maybe only survive off sp supports for a year
i could not play a game for a year without pulling ngl id lose interest <:Smilechamp:970181655576846376> but it is probably still good advice
wow someone actually did this? how did it work out for them? lol
best f2p advice:
>dont pull for a whole year
>pull new s rank support to ss+full gear
>pull elf
>pull dps
>profit for 4 months
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<a:aworryWhatDidIJustRead:1047442955780235385>

how many more days til wrio üò≠
oh i just noticed the response <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
if they just used the game to open bridge and stare at tits (which a lot of them probably do anyway) does that make a difference
and he actually has the nerve to follow all that up with i bet they arent even competitive
exactly
i just love how he said it like They're making fun of us for for staring at their boobies <:sajj:1067071714518892584> 
it was def created for the male gaze but the writers actually give a shit about them as characters, of course naturally people will gravitate toward that
can you @ him and ask his trophy count
yuri is a mockery of the orientation for the male gaze <a:NOSHOT:1137423060153143306> <a:NOSHOT:1137423060153143306> <a:NOSHOT:1137423060153143306> <a:NOSHOT:1137423060153143306> <a:NOSHOT:1137423060153143306> <a:NOSHOT:1137423060153143306> <a:NOSHOT:1137423060153143306>

did gresham report you for doing his events

i dont think its illegal, its just warned against since anything that person does in your account would be considered your own actions
!
yes lumi exactly
chace crawford
he reminds me of that other guy
that is just like.. boring

if disney had a set of streamers, ludwig would be their #1

this is the type of player genshin caters too
lmao cant say that i have
youre welcome!
ty!
its squirtle doing neuvie blast
someone help me find a shitpost genshin video
i talk to yall all day <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
i think x is literally just being himself and talking to his friends (chat)
tectone is an entertainer, he puts on a personality every stream
like by contrast for instance
i dont think he's outgoing irl, internet just makes him comfortable.. and like i dont think he has an entertainer personality, i think he just does what he wants to do and people like to watch him do that
for him tho i dont think he tries, he just like that.. like i could never do it because i dont have hte personality for it
idk im on the pc that often anyway <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
absolutely not.. if i could do what xqc does, just sit there and entertain all day, i would.. but  i would never show my ass and flirt with a bunch of neckbeard strangers <a:NOSHOT:1137423060153143306>
im hungry
i have an announcement to make
in the last quest, lynette mentions she was sold to some nobles when she was a kid.. like implying some some shit. i was surprised to see such dark story from hoyo recently but they kind of just mention it and go on without going into too much detail<:HUH:1009112689487908944>
they tip toe around it
i cant remember the nature of the crime, but humans did it because they wanted neuvie to lose power and the melusines to go away.. the melusine (carole) knew this and instead of playing into it and denying the allegations, she basically says yeah its true ti save neuvillette's position and they killed her <a:gunpull:1145875569179906079> 
but it has a bittersweet ending
it is really sad
neuvillette's quest was about them and it made me cry it was so sad, you follow one around who is desperate to be accepted by humans and they frame her for some crime and she kills herself <:HUH:1009112689487908944> 
they treat humans like pets
aren't they too baby to be furry? they look more like pets
ohh
isnt that a daily comm?
<a:NOSHOT:1137423060153143306>
like 6 hours or something
ive heard its the world quest that is super long
its not that bad i promise, it is disappointing tehre was so much errand filler but its still enjoyable for the good parts we get
i dont even wanna look at it
bro my genshin quest log is out of control
oh god i can hear it
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>

um guys
i think 840 something
too much money to care
dude got sued on the regular for sexual harassment
sounds like a job i had once
not even just to protect her but to protect the company
i would think that would be against some kind of hr policy
yeah that's bizarre
wow.. that's disgusting. i feel so bad for that girl and anyone else who came forward. i hope they're just doing an internal investigation and not just brushing it under the rug <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
<a:aPES_SadDance:849698896031776768>
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
i would literally just stand there and freezze <a:Y_Smh:977594042995068998>

yep

yikes <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
best t1 moment 
omg look who's in fen's bracket <:Smilechamp:970181655576846376>
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
i watched in english tho <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
but his va definitely sounded 10
idk how old he is
not really the boy is is like 10 it seemed when i watched lol
enka finally added hsr but to bind it to my account i had to change my name to that random number and now its stuck there for 72 hours <:dead:808739535419998239>
lmao
sr
it just looks like it would be hard to max score on frm that ref
yeah i will try her too
wow.. this looks rough to me lol
omgg so cute
theres a heki in my bracket and they're in loli armada <:Sus:961612747408289842>
will skip luna and just save xtal for hua <a:mhm:1046326820389273600>
def getting senti upgrade
<a:patlao2:1027877178387468308>
you have to start with burst
to proc the passive
just at c6
i guess it doesn't matter what order you do it in
yeya its been awhile since i played him like that but i think without c6 you e > burst > ca
burst > e > go
yep
to activate his c6 you have to burst to gain extra mirror to proc it
but by then, if you have artifacts, it doesn't matter he will do a lot of dmg with or without it
i forgot to answer this lol but yeah, to even take advantage of his c6 you have to burst first
üò≠
but i doubt it im sure itll be lantern rite with someone cool and new <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
yeah hopefully she comes with dead patch
ya i have like 25k saved rn but thats going to wrio <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
but im planning to c6 her, i got c0 on her first, c3 on her second, and will finish on her next <:DK:861368415717818369>
yeah i think c4 kinda useless
i like his street fighter type anims
wrizz looks just like an auto attacker so i can see why people thnk the same of him but im getting cons and have a c3 shenhe so im sure he'll be fun
but everyone else i know thinks he looks like a blast lol
yeah idk neuv looks omega boring to play to me
yeah idk its a real problem <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961> but neuv and wrizz seem to have very good ones
its not bad its just boring in comparison to other c6 but that also depend on what kinda enjoyment you get out of the game
yeah i mean if you like him and you got nothing else you want why not
and hes one of those that benefits more from his supports having cons than he does his own
i played him c0 for a month and feels the same at c6 except more dmg obviously
if you want to boost his dmg id just go c2 nahida if you havent already
awful value
<:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
<a:gunpull:1145875569179906079>
stfu and tell it to my credit card bitch
not enough men in star rail
it not about that, its just annoying people looking to create issues where there are none <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
but this person says 4 stars ccount too
if you're comparing characters that matter yes
<a:Modcheck:1033094910712230119>
i just saw someone complain that hsr have too many women over men
learning english must be so ass
freminet hyperbloom what is bro on about
theres nothing to hate regarding genshin combat, its very good.. its that you can't utilize it but once a month
is it possible?
a good opinion
its kid game, no degen design <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
<:haroldcringe:854639707958673408>
lmfao
idk how to play hofi
can i just use hfs
hofi without trio?
what i use on aka ma without sirin
hey
ag?
hold on i gotta type an essay on this woman's racist misognistic sexist outfit #4208 so i can get that twitter karma <:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
i was thinking more sp with that response
yeah definitely not as boomer sp
zoomers got what idk
no we grew up with that
it just so happens they ahve some talented artists/writers at hoyo that incidentally drew women in (more and more as they got more popular)
hi3 is definitely for men
the sooner zoomer players stop trying to make misogyny discourse out of game developed by men for men, the better off they will be
<:haroldcringe:854639707958673408>
not gay enough
the important question
which ones are the kiana/mei relationship <:looking:1144614223041810453>

i hope that mc is playable tho shes gorgeous
idk but im looking forward to the food <a:Cocking:1009511504405606481>

<:Really:1141123215117262908>
yeah shes my fave want want want
they're just so cute
üò≠
omgg kianaaa and ely

spa ignite
does sirin take spa this week? or it still DA's?
i think the coin issue is more mind boggling
even whaling on torus has its limits, they're still new which means catch up on many pris
her aerial mechanic is garbage
<a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>

.... right?
but you're paying that back by december, right?
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
they got all their players doing it for them
they actually are
it smply isnt
no
exactly
but here's finale hofi
could they have made one even better? probably
its so awkward coz hfs is just the final battlesuit for me
you guys ever sit and think about how hfs legacy was reduced to hofi <:life:1001518241610485781>
lmao they're calling me

new mei stig <:pog_hh:808435351617142845>
wheres the bp info
idrc from competitive aspect, i just want to suffer in her weather like qua
ah yeah okay that works then
i should be fine with misty right
how much will i suffer not pulling sirin
3 expensive af valks instead of 1 that last 2 months
trio was the biggest scam of the century
i kinda feel like ruby was right
yeah
need the ingredients to cook
<a:Cocking:1009511504405606481>
ruby is always os up in everyone's business its hilarious
maybe he is secretly fragile
if i had aqua's account i'd top score all of you
i did too and i still felt like i barely had enough every patch
anyone know what his dk look like
beast
i noticed his pardo is only s.. that's how young this legend is
<:EZ:953617687735566356>
dw looks way cooler than hn
hes not
she is
i remember when i just began hi3 <:life:1001518241610485781>
idk its probably my anxiety, i dont like doing what i have to do and then wondering where my partners are at with it and god forbid i have to actually pick up the phone and call them <:tiredge:1147515880834613349>
i dont like having to rely on people for my work, like even when i have to do group i'd rather do it all myself than share the load <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
i always loathed working in groups, just let me do it myself
idk mihoyo is telling me this is a deal of a lifetime <a:PaimonCookie:769642958517305374>
my chance to bag vv?!

giving more informatoin just incites arguments in that channel, i used to see it all the time. everyone's got an opinion on what your account could use/focus on, it really is easier to just answer the question and move on, if they're not going to lock advice to profs
fund me my 9s gresham
someone need to link that to nickynoel in sols right now
not cherry tryna start shit in gameplay help <a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>

is it pe lead?
<:PES_CoolNerd:661971911466549248>
lmao i get that f2ps struggle hard but its more about the poeple who dont recognize it and immediately blame the character. like if im pulling a dps that means im high investing in the team, im not gonna do the relic domain twice and call it a day
ive seen some f2ps in jy sub doing just fine without his lc but those that pull him and complain about him and then say 'i dont have his lc' its like???? first of all, invest more. second of all??? everyone told you his lc was better than even he was. thats not really one you want to skip. and if you do, dont complain about it later.
nah its always goes back to jy
every time
everyone got a death wish today
and now its aimed at lumi
my gun is aimed at ruby
<:PES5_DankGun:827518509373456404>

<:pog_hh:808435351617142845>
<a:classic:1106936806756319344>
did he get banned from nopixel?
idk how people play games with him
because they know it wasnt who they thought he was, it was like train was talking through him and he 100% believe it and would die on this hill
its just like the way he talks about kick, everyone lost respect for him
he started receiving backlash when he started gambling but peole still enjoyed him.. i think his contract with kick was the start of hte downfall. he and his ex broke up around this time too.
yep
i think its a combination of things between a) living situation b) ex and c) the company he enjoys
even tho x has never been good with debate as its hard for him to form a coherent sentence, this is the first time i saw him engage with someone who seriously wants to discuss the issue and instead of it ending in a mutual understanding, you can tell he was very very bothered by it and resorted to personal insults. he usually lets stuff like this roll off his back but for whatever reason, you can tell hes bothered by everything going around him currently
ethan had him on the podcast to debate the issue of react content > xqc went to destiny (a very well known person that does debate, hes' very good at it) to get his help > on ethan podcast, it was just him debating > ethan could not get him to talk directly about the topic > x kept resorting to personal insults > ethan tried to keep discussoin on course > x drops to the floor and does the worm as a way of showing ethan who is really boss > ethan ends the debate and x continues to insult him via dm
so its not like he was even reacting, he was just broadcasting other people's work on this stream
yeah i think this started because lately he would turn on a vid, leave the room for 15 mins, come back and be like 'yo that was pog'
ethan is a well known podcaster that broadcasts on yt
hes a multi-million dollar twitch streamer, not much else to say
yeah just pathetic
<a:sentiflap:1002466955770462298>
wow so lucky tet isnt even my friend
ME
there are definitely cool wealthy people, we jsut don't know them because they're out there doin good things
i hate thinking about it tbh its so annoying hes one of the wealthiest people in the world
yeah i do really think so lol he operates with the emotional intelligence of a 12 year old that never leaves the interent
nah i think he's really just that petty
i honestly think he's doing this just to spite the creator because he was essentially forced to take it over after losing a bet
<:pog_hh:808435351617142845>
yeah i think they never actually got married but she can still take him to court because in texas if you live together for a certain period of time, you can still take your SO to court for asset division
idek if they were actually married or they were together so long she took him to court
most people didn't until she left him lol
she also did a live where she was just acting crazy and making fun of him <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
yeah i saw that
he can't stop himself from acting out online its all he know how to od
i really think dude is just in a massive blackhole of depression right now between the divorce and his personal life
yea fr its kinda obvious
yes hes a person lol people say train trainwashed x because he started falling off around the time train started becoming his mouthpiece
i totally believe all those rumors that he leaves stream to go to the bathroom so often coz hes doing coke
train is like the posterboy for kick.com and gamba streamer
trainwash complete
im a normie now <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
thats all i need
yeah ill use whatever i have by then and see what i get
me and tet waiting on that misty gear <:DK:861368415717818369>

everything ethan said was true but i think just the whole way theyre going back and forth was so <:haroldcringe:854639707958673408>
x really fell off after this whole kick thing

its like asking is 300cv worth it in genshin. to most people its not, its just a flex. you're still gonna clear if you're properly geared
theres nothing you cant clear in the game with decent relics alrd
its subjective really
imo its the worst to min/max because of speed tuning, you're off 1 spd somewhere and it can throw an entire optimal rotation
<a:emmalaugh:871069715299188807>

pre-alucard
it looks like this is a prequel üò≠
i could never find any i liked it <:dead:808739535419998239>
yeah really
its actually sad because alucard really like them
they try to murder him while they're fucking

<a:collapse:1063550316332720148>
but no, i have to go make up this whole side story and then be a complete moron making a private convo public
i shouldve just told them 'we dont know each other that well yet, im not comfortable with it'
im not wrong in how im feeling, but i am wrong for acting a fake bitch to their face and being so judgemental
i dont think so, they wont even look my way now
lmao
identical twin thats in a stage play
ill try to meld them into one
good ideas guys thanks
im considering that
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
im looking for a new house now
so now i have to work up the balls to apology or move
i left my door open while i was ranting without realizing and i think they heard everything.
then i went into my house and bitched at my bf for half an hour about how i just had a freak out coz all i know about them is that they sit outside and drink all day so i wasnt comfortable with it.
i have new neighbors and theyre very nice and wanting to hang out and take care of my dog. i dont know them very well yet so they asked me when i was leaving for a doc apt friday if they could watch layla while i was gone. my socially retarded brain shut off and just said yes without thinking. then i left and freaked out, rescheduled the doc appt, came back and was like i got the date wrong.
guys i had this situation this week
maybe its just me but i think they care about all the games
the favorite shit post? why is that making everyone so butthurt? lol
actually baskin does
i dont think any of those have sex voilence
some other ones i can rec if you're looking for some pretty/deep horror..
bliss, gonjiam: haunted asylum (this ones more just straight up horror but its good),  what keeps you alive, revenge, the silenced, baskin, as above so below, the guest, all cheerleaders die, kiss of the damned, the loved ones, eden lake, thirst, chaser, inside
ive never watched it in full, i kind of remember it being just very.. depressing lol
hmm maybe i will give it a rewatch today then <a:Nod:961616084014862366> i really cant remember much about it
yes i think i watched that one years ago. maybe i should rewatch i dont remember much but i do remember liking it
they kept a couple of the original chars like juno and the main girl, and in the end they find juno, she dies, then the main girl dies. in like the exact same ending as the first one <a:jerry:864556009874522152> so fucking dumb
yes, i had the unfortunate experience of watching the 2nd one. one of the worst sequels ive ever seen lol
yay im so glad you liked it! sucks about the buffering shit
what im supposed to do <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580> <@309634550273933314>
which i never watched <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>

<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<a:diesofcringe:972420698654003210>
im not going the full adv, i will get the tickets which is probably like 30 pulls? so i have to get lucky
i think i have like 1 zeno piece
she has no gear <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
but if my hand slips, that's not my fault
absolutely not
yesh
yeah that one was alright, i thought it had kinda weak predictable ending tho imo
im excited for the new silent hill because it looks more like a horror game where you just walk through a disturbing story without all the jump scare
i hate when things jump out at you
idk man i can watch horror movies all day long and be just fine but the second i play a game i have to turn on all the lights, open every window, and still last about 10 seconds
you're like out on a street and my bf is like watch out for that crackhead on the corner, he can kill you and so i just follow him and i dont even see the crackhead and die to him immediately
outlast is really gory, the tutorial was disturbing it took like half an hour to get thru and then we finally start the game
lmfao smart girl <a:classic:1106936806756319344>
lmao
tbf my bf is probably better off fending them off for themselves, i just shoot in every direction in panic mode
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
it was too scary for me, i'd just leave him to die everytime we ran into a monster <a:classic:1106936806756319344>
my bf and i tried outlast trials
ah hell naw this look liek a nightmare to do <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>

next month: we are releasing a new twitter package! you will receive a blue checkmark and a special ü§° identifier next to your username with boosted visibility. this package is available for $5 and has a .02% drop rate!
if only
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
not just that, it's become the top source for getting news as it happens from civilians or otherwise. it's not like that anymore, there's so much fake news, bots, and right wing propaganda being shoved down your throat its near impossible to discern whats real or not. and it will only get worse.
have you tried doing more dmg
ive done enough nirv benarese, im retired now
can we add this as sticker 
600 posts a day and 599 of them are blue check marks with the worst takes you've ever read
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>

<:HMM:966625453194485760> ask your neighbors if they recognize him and maybe posters? i think theres a website for lost animals too
i couldn't afford to level up all 9 so i just put them on hoh lol
we did it
alright boys
i havent missed this fight and its fucking sp pack
true elysia simp
just get 3s
kira runs out first with sushang a second behidn
kira only weapon active at the very start of the fight
sushang ult > kira ult > hoh weapon active > ca > ult > wa > dive > and the buff runs out
it takes 84 years
also do i need to weapon active with kira
like im playing with cezz b <:Really:988350458659762186>
i mean like she only dives once <:Really:988350458659762186>
is that right
the buffs run out after a single ult roto on hoh
does kira or sushang go first
kk ty
yeah i tried but nothing happened
what do i do with these things again
that is the beauty of genshin, come back whenever you want <:FeelsCozyMan_lum:492488572146941982>

bruh twitter wont even let me view it without logging in now? god i fucking HATE elon
maybe not in the desert but the green areas you're free
cant you explor without questing though
but sumeru best char/story for me
enkanomiya and watatsumi are still probably my favorite regions to date
i agree most of the areas didn't wow me like inazuma did
i do think the terrain/exploration isnt that great though
its my fave region as far as story/characters so far
thats sad
wow
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
i dont think ill ever get that sumeru chest loot from the aranara quest
lmao
you mean level farming or primo farming
there are so much hidden shit
how the fuck do people find these things in genshin
thats a lie and you knwo it
who the fuck runs around with razor/albedo/venti/zl team
lmao
thank you!
ill try to yt it <:Sadge:816798647760584757>
im on the last level and when it finds these things it wants me to get this one behind the gate

who's the skanque in your profile banner tet
it was a 2023 message btw
yesterday i saw someone in another server saying genshin better add new endgame content in 4.0
sometimes when im watching content creators i wish i was one just so i could look at other people's accounts roasting them all day and get paid for it
im sure the bts ones can sell
i got baekhyuns on twitter had several dms asking for it but i gave it to a friend
i shouldve taken a bts name so someone would pay me for it

i definitely have 9 mei stigs

i wish they let me spend this currency on something else.. i have so much of it + another 10 dead stigs in my inventory <:Really:988350458659762186>
i dont think i ever tried hoh on ice ely
kalpas and ely its been like years
would be nice if they add her to golden orb or supply shop
nope
unfort these stamps kinda useless for me since im already getting hfs thru bp and my sw is ss so this wouldnt even get her another rank <:Really:988350458659762186>
im pretty sure it includes any money spent
thats jsut some of it i had to stop reading <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
theres one comment that links to a separate post that gives a breakdown in context.. the father has had his daughter on stream and just openly manipulating/emotionally abusing her. telling her to wear lingerie, press her tits to the camera, she needs to show off what she's got because pretty soon she'll be ugly like her mother, wants her to date milo yilano-whatever (disgusting conservative propagandist), etc.
yikes i thought it was a troll trolling but then i read the thread, disgusting <:yikes:877047689521532979>

coz of the titantic thing and now the coup in russia, everyone on twitter is experts in these fields
twitter this week 
im kind of over it now <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
at least he used to be
lol i used to feel the same way, then i started watching a couple streams about a year ago and sucked into the x dialect.. he's actually really funny and occassionally smart
the sad reality <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
i cant remember hte last time he had an entertaining stream
totally agree its sad <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
<:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
i dont think the 100m is real, i'd be willing to bet half of it free money to gamble and crypto -- if the 100m is even true
ofc
amouranth was streaming on there yesterday with less than 2k viewers <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
kick is not making any profit, handing out 100m contracts
xqc was paid 100m to join
a new streaming platform
amazon owns twitch
any company that has to tell you they're the greatest thing ever is a red flag. talk all the talk you want, you're nothing until you walk the walk
as i understand it, amazon holds the codes and sells it
it is very shady
and operating on crypto
yes
all these big streamers are so supportive of kick, ones that i wouldn't expect like charlie and asmon. if it had been literally anyone else supporting kick, they wouldn't have near as many positive things to say about it. it feels so hyprocritical
overall i like asmon, i watch his streams a lot but he's kinda insufferable when it comes to tectone and this kick drama lately
for good reason, dude's just a bad person
but i can't deal with having one roommate, i like my privacy lol
there are a couple that i like, i just cant imagine living in the same house as a bunch of performers
what an insufferable house that must be <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
i cant imagine
surely not
like they actually all live together? <a:HUH:960281654046375986>
its like.. Faze clique but not professional gaming, just kind of shooting the shit. asmongold and esfand are like the leaders.
the other dudes in the clip are big streamers who are also part of the OTK clique
you can tell she wasnt happy with his outburst when she was trying to make an announcement
hes in this little org OTK which is emiru is a part of
no they dont live together
omg the lsf comments on this post are just obliterating tectone <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
omg i love this one lmao
<a:WHAT:1108876595546050610>
what about without the santa fit
whats the name of the emote with the duck shakin its ass
theres no hope for him he's lost the thread 
<a:jerry:864556009874522152>
like im not doing yall a favor by burning this place down
damn i forgot to turn off my feet heater at work yesterday and i got in trouble <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
not like it matter for glb <:hmmge:965945442561044490>
cutting your runs down from 600 to 200 = not crack at all
when im just tryna do my dailies
but i dont like logging in and getting spammed with msgs the second i do
yeah i dont mind meeting people and helping them out when im bored
how long does it take to get a good artifact? like roughly? how many runs will i need to do? mfer it will take forever idfk
i carried this newb in domains for like half an hour yesterday and now they wont stop messaging me
istg every time i help someone in genshin it backfires on me
<a:rabbitJAM:988563845410852934>
mfer got charged with assault.. talk about life ruining embarrassment<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
the fuck is going on in someones head to throw their phone on stage
have u guys seen this <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722> 
<@309634550273933314> 
<:Thumb:961498460585078814>
sure, i'll check it out!
also i dont care too much for finding particular ships anymore, if its well written i shouldn't have to watch the content the ship is from to enjoy it
yeah my fave ship is grantaire/enjolras from les mis.. you can imagine how much content i get <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961> but the writers for that are really nice
i dont read as much as i used to but i get in the mood every now and then, i usually just re-read a bookmark because its so hard to sift through all the garbo on ao3 im really picky
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
wrightworth?
my fave fic ever on ao3 is a marriage trope one, its so ridiculous but idgaf whatever excuse you need to get them to interact lol
i love this trope <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
i physically cringed when i read that
yeah me too
but im sory i have to watch this for byung hun and gong yoo <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
yeah unfortunately he did
<a:oprahomg:826656660264452107>
<a:collapse:859859231503417344>
being geo he can go in any team
no one will ever be better than zl i agree
the caveat being is the duration is super short, although still full up time. you just have to be able to utilize a dps that doesnt need to stay on field too long
probably not stronger than zl, i realy cant remember if it trumped even his
i use her with my ayaka team and her shit never breaks
layla has the strongest sheild in the game iirc
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
good ole turg still wont die
the event u have to hit it 4x
<:Really:988350458659762186>
fuck it im getting hare <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
anyway now that im back in RL i get to use all my senti supports again <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>

3k crystal for seele <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
imf2p now
no top up
i didnt get her <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
i pulled for hare
imo 
ep 1 - below average
ep 2 - average
ep 3 - above average
ep 4 - below average
ep 5 - average
<a:KEKsip:961615405464563752>
i liked it as a standalone, average ep
honestly teh only episode that feels black mirror is 3
honestly a lot of that episode just made no sense to me <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
not a lof of that this season
yeah still societal commentary, what/who is actually evil and is it in our nature
i kind of feel thats what they attempted here but very poorly, it doesn't carry the original intention of the show
half of the episodes didnt even have anything to do with tech <a:HUH:960281654046375986>
makes sense if they did
did they ditch the writers?
im not surprised
i havent checked response yet
oh fr?
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
yeah
aight let me know.. i wasnt impressed overall<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
<@309634550273933314> ep 3 is fucking insaneee lmfaooo <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722> <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722> <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722> <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722> <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>

tumblr still alive?
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
idk i dont use it
the whole point of twitter was just free reign pure free speech, its completely change since instituting this garbage. i wish someone make a new one<:thiccpensive:1114520250327781448>
yea this is whats really pissing me off
yeah u right
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
scary world
yeah ur prob right i dont follow cod too closely, im just surprised how bad it is
its crazy man.. every since this paid twitter went into effect istg hate orgs been buying them up and botting the shit out of reponses
cod twitter is full of homophobes rn
some of the reponses to this are unbelievable i feel like im living in 1987
like wow this is the hill u wanna die on ok<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
then drdisrespect uninstalled (like he does on a weekly basis) and timthetatman sent this 
and cod immediately responded with removing his skin from the game
nickmercs made some tweet in response to a school board ruling recognition of pride month in schools, some protestors showed up and got violent.. he replied ‚Äúleave children alone‚Äù - kind of implying ‚Äòkeep the gay away from the children!!‚Äô
have u guys been seeing whats going on with cod rn
but the day <:life:1001518241610485781>
i bet they didnt get a single good one either

her design is very good, i love her white leggings
you know what was peak design in genshin that i wouldn't mind seeing in honkai?
this much i agree with, miko still the only pink one <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
we're there.. it's too many
i dont have to take it, they will never top elysia outfit so everything else just looks worse than the last
it's elysia's color, they should keep it that way. every time they use the same pallette on a different character it just take away from their unique identity. it's elysia's color get over it <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
seele elysia-fied? surely not <:clueless:973756617109676032>

is hsr this week or next week
i'm not overthinking im bored
no shit
i lucksac'd ala m anyway so if it turn out to be a beet m its just a nice plus
actually i'll make the argument they did this on purpose to milk the fools like gresham into spending more on their affordable valk <:DK:861368415717818369>
idc if its good on hos because she'll be dead in 2 months <:DK:861368415717818369>
yeah very true
THATS WHAT I MEANT
fr i am a hater but i'm trying to be obbjective on this
ok then i will agree with you DJ can't be a precedent.. i will just have a to rely on my intuition that susannah isn't a great long term investment
thanks for coming to my ted talk
the only precedent we have for a sp dps is (NO supportive capabilities) is DJ, right? i think it's fair to skip susannah on the thought that she too would want ranks that take forever to farm and we're getting a sp support next patch. can we even say sp support has longer shelf life at this point? it seem more like they release a support and then release another support 2 months later that is shilled for a new boss, it doesn't make your support useless (carole vs griseo) but the idea that supports last longer has definitely evolved. picking the right support for your dps becomes more important. my thought process is that i don't want to waste the asterite on susannah (even though i'm definitely a position where i should be without a qua dps) becuase i'd rather use the asterite for prome and the crybbal on prome's gear. i don't think there's a right or wrong answer for this valk. pulling is just as much of a good idea as skipping is.
lol jamie commenting on keeby vids now
am i crazy or sakura look broken now
rework?
oh yeah <:cringe:610393728087228440>
i have like 5.5 rn <a:HUH:960281654046375986>
you think i can get 20k this patch
i like lilah too <a:Nod:961616084014862366>
true
how much crybbal im gonna end the patch with ü§ì
<:Smilechamp:970181655576846376> i like duchess too im just worried it sound a little uppity
i still haven't decided to get her yet but thats also why im not spending more this patch lol i dont want to spend anymore <:dejj:1067071941367824474> hoping i can at least nab prome gear for free and maybe the mobi skin if im ridiculously lucky.. even if i can manage all that without topping up hare + gear still cost a fortune
<:C_HuJerry:807167698626281492>
you're skipping hare or getting s0
<a:adorilao:1026206475514822693>
you just got it like that i guess <:DK:861368415717818369>
seriously though that is amazing lol i peaked T2 and it was only coz everyone was playing OW2 <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
did styx ever top you?
i was gonna ask you how hard you worked for that score
ig thats kind of what i did with elysia.. then i realised if i want to keep competing same bracket i'd have to surrender not only my wallet to keep up but my life too <:DK:861368415717818369>
which is what
<a:Peepo_WallTalk:839865180020277270>
i will believe it when i see it
surely
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
gresh you're literally turning into kraken
YOU'RE JOKING
<:DK:861368415717818369>
you pull on hoh ranks?
what sin was that
<:WorryCaprisun_lum:534062662666027011>
gizmo, olive, layla, lilah, or duchess?
which one do you like the most
guys look at these names
reward?
<@370438895965306882> i just saw you kept your T1 last week, holy shit congrats! <a:bloodlao:959706412685099038>
thanks guys <:HeartHug:774300073642557470>
hospitals suck
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
oh yea makes sense
needle? i thought it was just like a xry
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
older than aster has been alive
and thanks it's been hard, i had him 16 years üò≠
i've never had one but yeah i just want to get it over with so i know whats going on
thanks me too
tbh i have had a really hard couple of weeks and i just dont have it me to do anything lol i had to put my dog down this weekend and i'm goin to hospital for mri tonight <:PES_SadRain:513332570797113359>
no
hoh of course
we can find out next year when i have vv <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
whatever
couatl
im ready for him in abyss now
24 tona
it depends on the valk i bring
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
well i guess husk also has stall mechanic
so i gotta choose between drag out mechanic on cow or drag out mechanic on tona
yeah but now the default boss is the cow <:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
i wish they kept nihilus as the default boss at the end instead of adding that to the shill
yeah probably
its hard for me to tell what its like now for people since my account is so high invested now, i can feel hoh already lost some of her power compared to her debut but idk what it's like for s0 players. i think your dorm makes a big difference in there too
ER was defnitely hard for me for a long time.. i dont think i clear finality until i got PE.. like 6-7 months into the game
well imo she does suck <:Smilechamp:970181655576846376>
as far to the cringe/introvert as possible
a phagguette? i cannot <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>

yeah for me it was just good vibes all around, the mood and scenery like you said was great and the vibe was just chill
enka was great for that, it had its puzzles but it wasnt cockblocking everything you did
fr and the area is already small.. like why? just give us a break on these puzzles and let us enjoy ourselves
why do i feel like every region has less and less explore and more and more puzzle/roadblock
highkey
everyone point and laugh at the vv pullers retaining nirv with no issues

i got 400 with sns
what does sns score on hos
<:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
if its soley for hn why get a dupe
$1500 to upgrade a valk on their beathbed is a steep price
seriously though what makes it that good? is it really just that good on senti?
are people just getting that for senti? a valk on the deathbed?
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>

<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
lol i found it, heres the thread and vid 
lmao okay thanks
OH
do you have the link to the artist for that haitham art where hes naked in the pool
<@309634550273933314>
the subreddit was ripping him apart
him and his wife got divorced, i remember a couple months ago LSF dug up a clip of them where he was just gaslighting and berating her like a personal assistant
seriously amazes me the loser finds so much work, i swear he just manipulates his way in with bigger streamers everywhere he goes to profit
you speak viet?
<:dead:808739535419998239>
i dont like to say these things because shes adorable tet
fr we is just so much nicer to use
i couldnt even finish it
i tried to switch out we for ely elf
ive been using 6s a lot in er lately
fr
shes the cutest but she sucks ass
i really fucking hate ely elf
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
<:PES2_Derp:513345720007393280>
also d in server difference
have you tried swiping harder
also thats a 4s dudu elf
have you tried doing more dmg?
<a:Y_dies:818190915096281089>
i cant get it
i just need an on set sands or circlet.. ive been farming 4 months every day maxxing out resin
<a:mhpeepoclap:998941254027051028>
i just got this one
that is a nice piece
wooooow
awww look so cute someone randomly friended me coz they like my alhaitham <:kokomisad:874368234202230834>
<a:PU_PepeRage:593498062782070784>
when will my suffering end
no and yes <:wot:998941267041996862>
yeah i hope that changes it would be nice to have a mech phys
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
depends on whats next and how im feeling by then
i might pull hare
nope im stayin strong <:TeriSmoke:1061942220409810996>
actually i dont think ive done it with pardo
oh yeah true
i remember back in the day it was so maldy for me every time i try hfs
i guess im bad
what a fucking sweatlord
why
<a:aPES_HappyClap:622096721408950295>
<:PES5_Noted:804692177249894430>
ok im trusting you on this
how to guarantee i lose my next 50/50 to another tighnari <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
i knew i was justified in skipping <a:Cocking:1009511504405606481>
<a:Cocking:1009511504405606481>
<:HaiBedge:1062167336855027763>
and then you build her with a ton of crit coz she crit shares or something
uh i never played her so i dont know, i think you would noblesse if there isnt already one in team
yea that sounds ideal
i am an expert at this children's game, dont worry
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
if you dont have noblesse, 2pc 2pc atk
ideally 4pc noblesse with as much attack as you can get, dont worry about crit unless you're trying to main her
no
i hope haitham is in kaveh's
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
very pretty <:KOKOMICRYING:869613202290389063>
shenhe would pop the f off
like imagine this 5* cryo is an infused normal attacker or cryo catalyst
my crack theory is that this new cryo dps will want shenhe a lot which is why they waited so long to rerun right before fontaine <:PES2_Derp:513345720007393280>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
you're always playing melee with those two anyway
<a:OMEGADANCE1:931653026517778484>
i mean thats essentially kaeya tho
yea
a new 5 star cryo off field dps surely <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
or just good ole benny/xl/kaeya/ros
rosaria with shenhe and kaeya is really good
the mouse has successfully sucked the life out of both marvel and sw at this point
disney has doen everything they can possibly do to kill this franchise
you can have mine i never use her <:KOKOMICRYING:869613202290389063>
thats the beauty about genshin aster you can do whatever you want <:kokomisad:874368234202230834>

I know you've been working really hard (abyss is harder on NA) at it, and I'm happy that you've (abyss is harder on NA) achieved your goal of completion. I know your journey through (abyss is harder on NA) the content was filled with ups and downs, but you (disturbance is higher on NA btw) stuck t(abyss is harder on NA)hrough them all, and you were rewarded for your patience and (abyss is harder on NA) tenacity. Congratulations (abyss is harder on NA) once again, and here's to more success in your future (abyss is harder on NA) endeavors!!!

?
carv left here
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>

that was a lot of nonsense to backread

yeah im playing him with haitham/tigh for surse
im sure you can make it work
its genshin
what am i saying
coz hes so weak before that
i think you need c6 to do it effectively <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
and its a close second
lots of dendro app, second only to nahida
and literally unkillable
at c6 you can play him on field too though if you choose to
c6 baizhu looks so nut
when are we getting kiana pyramid skin? after hare you think?

yeah weird <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
<@180679257851166721> does eden pri have different qte conditions or something? i didn't realise i was still using old eden guns when i asked about the qte earlier and when i switched her to pri i had literally no issue getting qte <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>

why isn't there a trio boss for the next 4 weeks
üî¨
but i can def understand why if she doesn't have poise
i don't think people use him with her anymore either
i literally thought this whole time she needed zhongli or she would easily get interrupted/die
tao doesn't even need zhongli <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246> she never get interrupted or die without him anyway
guess what i realised yesterday ruby
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
that not sound like a good deal <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
<@309634550273933314> do i get something for completing all this stuff

this place
i really like dreamy areas like enka and the oasis in the new region, watatsumi is really pretty but kinda annoying to explore
i hated it too, the story parts were very creative and fun at times. i preferred mona's just for the visuals but my god they were SO long and i had no desire to re-explore such a boring looking area.
that's why you record every run and import the video to frames to find the exact frame you got the score with <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
lmao thats actually what it is
signore was so pretty f

cyno and tigh are attached at the hip in every quest
yeah im actually shocked hoyo given so much bl fan service with sumeru

speaking of, sorry i had to leave so abruptly last night guys, my bf surprised me and came home early so i wanted to spend some time with him
haitham friendship 4? wyd <:A_BaldTaoFrown:861373722405109761>
yeah damn this is really good
it's really weird with haitham, every tiem i use optimizer it prefers the em subs to more crit
subs on artis
you could use more EM subs too but thats nitpicking, and probably hell to farm for while maintaining the ER/CR ratio
that's still good then
88
no actually lol aside from maybe upgrading his weapon to foliar in the future but you lose the cr <a:Y_dies:818190915096281089>
<:PES_TuxedoToast:585724570082738178>
very nice
damnnnn
yea actually she'd fit right in
<:DK:861368415717818369>
im pretty sure lacola is a massive waifu whale
exit

<:PES5_HmmmmYes:815524042047750174>

im not a big fan of cat girls
i like her but shes not really my type
hell no
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
so lets say you get frozen or you get caught in a bubble and have to jump.. it's over
and if you jump in her burst it completely cancels out the burst
her burst is 4s and cost 70, with medicore damage
not sure <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
she does like no damage, cant vape with xq/yelan, and her attack animations are sooo slow and clunk
yeah i cant actually believe it myself
damn i cant believe how bad dehya is <:yikes:877047689521532979>

yup lol
<:life:1001518241610485781>
makes sense
i wonder how they're doing now
this was posted 2 weeks ago, sitting on 1800xtal with ungeared htr
i was just going to say
check myriad and see if theyre there
its been open like an hour lumi <:DK:861368415717818369>
i dont believe it either, his next film will prob have horror elements he cant help himself
ari said hes done with horror its over <a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>
havent heard of that one
everything everywhere is dealing multiple universes and family dynamics
infinity pool
this couple goes on vacation and the guy gets into an accident and sent to jail, in this made up country they have the death penalty for anything basically. i odnt want to say more because i'll be spoiling the plot and thats kind of part of the movie
infinity pool is.. scifi? dystopia
everything everywhere is scifi
everything everywhere all at once is a movie yeah
i watched infinity pool too tet idk if you saw that one yet
lmao it reminded me of inception
it was okay
yes <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<@309634550273933314> <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
diluc has the most basic ass model face too
ayaka in general does
kazuha/ayaka has a lot of pretty ship art
idk there are some really pretty kaeya arts.. but i dont see art of him that often
good question
hmmmm
if you copy+paste the youtube link, it will work for them
tartali shippers are something else
you know tehy haev youtube for that right lumi
<@416445660443967491>
cyno gets a solid amount of grown up art thank god
<a:Nod:961616084014862366>
<:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
i mean least worst offender?
yeah i think he's the worst offender from the shorties
there's a lot of that in xiao/zhongli art too
everyone that ships aether draws him like a 10 year old
terrible, i'd be so old and out of place and id have to pay for everything
lmfao
<:deadfromdrugs:850811543037411349>
the fact that im starving
yea
preview for tomorrow: GUYS JUST ONE TOP UP IM THIS CLOSE
lmfao lumi
oooof
it depends on how bad it is, jersey gets up early and plows the roads. they only close school if its a looot of snow.. in oklahoma though, literally one flake on the ground and its closed for aw eek
<:life:1001518241610485781>

another victim of heki <:life:1001518241610485781>
its not as common as chicken here
not unless its soem expensive upscale restaraunt
theres not a lot of lamb here in my area, i dont think im gonna risk it <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
why cant i just use chicken
i'll see if i can find it on doordash tho <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
im not cooking anything <:reallyy:823957003721768972>

rn it just look like melt ganyu and mona/bennett for her
yeah i heard the dehya mains donated to charity or something after her demo
im so glad the 4 stars are garbage on dehya, more likely kuki layla and/or candace on baizhu <:DK:861368415717818369>
baizhu kit leak by wednesday üôè
<:PES2_HmmmmThumbsUp:849698641388109886>
balloon escort is the worst
i wish they had an option to always make comms combat
the sumeru ones arent' great either its always mushroom jumping or catch the light <:A_BaldTaoFrown:861373722405109761> but thats commissions for u
average myriad player
its not that the basic rotations/mechanics are hard to learn, it's that every fight is different thanks to temp, nothing stays the same so the roto is constantly evolving and changing, and idk if it just me but like scoring cap is really fucking hard because i dont have turbo hands
lmao
honkai is harder than genshin but thats because theres no competition in genshin
he is so sweaty its absurd
like.. wyd <a:HUH:960281654046375986>
there are some people who still open the book in abyss so they can save .05s gaining a particle
using tricks like this in genshin  blows my mind
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>

i was going to say..
this happens in ohio? <a:HUH:960281654046375986>
anesthesia is the most fucking bizarre experience.. it's like you're for real dead <a:HUH:960281654046375986>

2 star on imdb

it was trying so hard to be like.. tokyo gore police meet ichi the killer and missed the mark on both

it was too violent and that saying something coming from me
i had to stop that wolf hunt movie by the way
tet <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
lumi you think ruby haven't bought al lthat yet <a:OMEGADANCE1:931653026517778484>
imagine pulling cards early, i think this is the worst patch i ever had. it easily beat my PE patch <a:Y_dies:818190915096281089>
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
since lumi skip kiana they should def rank hoo but they dont even have htr gear <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>

f2p+ moment
<:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561>
kokomi, raiden, and kazuha all had TCers in their corner on release despite doomposting, dehya doesn't have a single one that isn't a massive whale
no not til tuesday i think
but she's also pyro and has literally like.. two working comps. its possible she just made for someone with fontaine in mind
hard to tell, ive never seen this many tcers in agreement she's garbage until c6
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>

why does my entire t5 in my bracket have 6s <:DK:861368415717818369>
lmao MOOD lumi
thats actually a loaded 4 star pull though, we got 3 characters in one and all charactesr are converted to stardusts who fucking cares <a:Streaming:1039019999811088414>
<a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>
i cant
sometimes when fen does his pulls he literally does singles
pull streams that sit through every pull kill me
<a:Streaming:1039019999811088414> okay guys today we're gonna be pulling for X lets start our ritual in this corner we're definitey getting an early tonight stick around after the stream for your chance at a welkin <a:Streaming:1039019999811088414>
awwwwwwwww so cute <:hug_hh:710968170814505031>
yeah thats basically waht fobmaster's streams have turned into but he and his audience are so entertaining i stick around.. i used to watch a lot of genshin streamers but i swear the more you watch the more unbearable they become <a:OMEGADANCE1:931653026517778484>
its so hard losing them when you've had them for so long <:PES4_Cry:743908892722856026>
yeah he's definitely had his fair share of issues but i've never had a dog that didn't, especially in old age.
my pug is 16+ now, we have to hold him up while he goes to the bathroom and sit him in our lap when we feed him. he is a full time job right now but we just can't let him go. <:PES_Cry:493359762432327691>
yeah i heard some birds bond to you like you're their mate and they typically outlive their owners <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
lmao no you're fine lumi
dont birds live like forever? that's a lot of bird responsibilities <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
how did your bird get pregnant anyway? you have both male and female birds?
no lol and we are not rich but we make good money. we're both adults with like no responsibilities so its more like we just have a lot of disposable income right now.
pic?
and there are no that many people lol
yeah only people that actually mald honkai will watch honkai streams like that
actually i think honkai streamers can stream more content than genshin ones can. genshin is literally just your dailies every day and then you have nothing to do. honkai was made for malding at least, you can mald content on stream for views. the problem is the honkai community just isn't near as big as genshin.
reaction honkai story vids bring in a shit ton of views
yeah what chrom said
doesn't even matter what it is
yeah of course, gacha = clicks
tet add that emote
omfg
tectone and murderofbirds did the same shit
every genshin nubhead does this
this is starter supply he's pulling on
omg you're right
xlice is like a huge genshin stan
what the hell..

im so disgusted
<@180679257851166721> do you think the cinematic is going to be a collection of memories or we're even gonna get to see kevin fight? my disappointment right now is off the charts
gimme that <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
and yeah ruby same like when i say they look hot its kind of abstract im not dreaming about fucking pixels how does that even work
i uh not sure how to respond heki

next game honkai impact 4th: back the beginning: the flamechasers: they didn't die in this bubble: coming soon
really hope kevin is imported somewhere else so i can actually play with him
the unfortunate reality <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
but yeah i liked the dialogue it was touching
idc about dr mei it should've been the fcs <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
i am im just asking for a friend <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
pog
blue or pink
can yo ushow me
<@180679257851166721> did you guys get new bundles today in sea?
i wish we could read something as good though
i still have hope the cinematic will give good pay off to the kevin fight
if they want views they be obsessed with ely
i dont see them doing that, they just obsessed with kevin
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
no i like their commentary
<:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
viero doesn't seem too impressed with whats going on either, its not just people who only read section of text
alright i mean i will wait for the cinematic obviously, its just what ive seen so far is nothing but fan service. like elysian realm whole story played out like a damn movie it was so good. not to have the same vibe from the finale is disappointing, that is what im getting at.
the story of that is stupid as hell, i don't like the captain, cn, or breaking the fourth wall. i dont like them being involved in a canonical way to the story. that said, if this is just them giving the captains/kiana a send off in the story but they're telling something different in the cinematic - it's fine. i dont want to see this shit as canonical in kevin's send off though.
listen.
well i just woke up to all this cherry <a:yellowseelieSussy:965943095533395978>
whats the difference though? captain still plays critical role in his defeat
i got mei this morning with my f2p pull <:deadfromdrugs:850811543037411349>
also
thats what you jsut said
i hope the cinematic is better
no thank you
kevin defeated by the power of captain and cn
yeah ruby i mean thats what i read.. it's pretty garbage
yea thats me on the right
no idea i barely play MA
<:derp:960359265032339496>
the whole story last night is just a fake ass send off right? like the cg is not going to have the captain powering up the girls, right? <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
<:waiting:1027534309298544640>
like these people have not even played the character and they're so convinced she's unplayable
this is absolute insanity 
yep its crazy how quick it can turn around if the other side know waht they're doing
im ball runner <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
in a proper gambit team you have an invader that takes care of it for you
lmao
<:PepeLaugh:696051469337493534>
-3.5k social credit <a:yikes:859858182889144331>
queeeen she is coming to kill them all i cant waitttttttttt
did they just share the new cinematic music in cn discuss? <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
any spend counts toward the top up bonus but i dont think it lasts the duration of the patch.. pretty sure you'd have to top up b-chips and for the next monthly bp early so you can keep telling yourself you're only a bp+welkin player
nvm the tree isn't even on the search üôÅ
whats the link for the bili search again
i hope this cinematic is satisfying
we'll see
<:Sus:961612747408289842>
thats who durandal is too
durandal would take it for herself
in what world durandal let kiana make that choice
someone have to stay on the moon
okay lets say its an ultimatum right
then why wouldn't mei get her out
not get stuck
then it would be kiana's choice to stay on the moon
so you think kiana is getting stuck on the moon and bronya and mei just go about living life without her <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
what about durandal?
kevin get sucked into a wormhole and imported to genshin <a:danceboi:837740326390464532>

nahida/koko/dmc
nahida/yaoyao/koko

<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
actually pog
how long would yall last in the zombie apocalypse anyway
tet would need a brain for that
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
the fungi that takes over the brain?
but some animals will die when they reproduce and they do this anyway
rule 1 of bp: always buy stamp
rule 2 of bp: never buy stig because you will off rate it in the next pull
because we're like.. intelligent or some shit. it's just weird how living things entire purpose is to reproduce and us humans consider it an option. what's that all about?
do you think there is an octopus that was like nah i'll skip on that
like how octopus will crawl in a hole for 8 months to reproduce and tehn die after
why do living things have a drive to reproduce
sorry tet you need to be more clear with your tl
yes i would take the dk over ss

kith doesnt have hfi
thank you
you'e the best
kk
he has it on
this is agony we're talking about
it has to be a rotation issue right
thanks im looking too but gd is it hard to find obscure shit like this lol
sound like sp issues on top of that
because i told him what i'm doing but idk if its gonna be the same for him
yeah thats why i was hoping for a ref
s0 full gear kiana, s0 full gear hoo, s0 no gear bronya, 2s kiana
right?
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
shouldn't be a problem
i just realise he in agony right now
wait
but he doesn't know if its wrong roto or because no bronya gear
my friend told me he can't do trio
oh
eli doesn't have bronya gear right
yeah give me some of that motivation too
havent heard of it
<:life:1001518241610485781>

<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
mg just pull another early hofi.. that's like 4 he pull early, one back to back too
fuck lucky people
can't relate
he has full gear mei + ss hofi without even starting to dip into his crybbal yet
man mg get so lucky
it take baby health off with slashes
mei sword ult is so underwhelming
htr still on cd
but now i ult and idk waht to do
like i ult and then i would usually swap to hofi
<:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
<@416445660443967491> when you play hoo without hofi do you do a different combo?
asking for a friend <:wot:998941267041996862>
<@180679257851166721> theyre gonna put more bundles in shop next friday for foca right
these words jsut came out of his mouth: i always wanted to triple s the last herrscher, i didn't think it would be kiana but here we are. mfer can't actually believe they're not gonna keep releasing herrscher <:kekL:939008918640787476>
mg is about to do his pulls for SSS hoo+hofi if anyone wanna watch
üî¨
she was one shotting those enemies in side stage
mei does a LOT of damage
yeah
i prob just stick with s0 and only invest mei/elf
i dont particularly want to learn these strats where mei further support kiana in trio though
yeah i was debating kiana s2
or mei
ruby are you getting ss
its scawy O_O
<:himekotrash_hh:879534583169822721>
SO. UGLY.
enka was one of hte most memorable releases, i just love the vibe of it. it's so calm and serene.
they really took care of small details
the new domain expansion is just beautiul
the other ones are garbo
the main one and watatsumi aren't bad, enka is the best
i wasnt a big fan of some of the inazuma islands either
ikr kei pyramid skins especially should come with skin weapons like come on
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
im not sure you need to do much questing to explore the green part of sumeru but there are A LOT of underground tunnels in the desert that you have to do the world quest to unlock
they're soooo good
its crazy
tet watch it
üò≠
man hoh looks so good its crazy
idk tbh it seem she give poise and dmg mitigation for the team.. that's about it
it doesn't look paid
is senti skin paid or what
nino is little one in spanish
i say nee-loo in my head
stop pointing the glock at each other and start pointing it at susannah
ikr its so fucking random
bro the officer uniform is as basic as you can get.. and i still prefer it <a:jerry:864556009874522152>
ruby what is cn community on her design? any chance mibobo will redo it?
so all they have to do is release hare mech phys dps to erase her from that niche as well
so she is also taking the spot for bleed phys weather, not just qua dps?
come on ruby you can't be serious, she's a sp dps. you think the newest HERRSCHER qua S rank is not going to steal her bosses?
look. on one hand i can see how this is a good thing, right? for new players that haven't a qua dps and don't want to spend too many crybbal, this is a good fill replacement. for someone like me who has been playing for so long, it just looks like a lifeboat until seele gets here - which looks more like instead of just releasing seele, lets put out this shiny bandaid for some extra cash before we release the real deal.
i haven't looked at scores yet but for people like me without vv this just means more suffering
i'm guessing susannah will be necessary for qua weather until seele is released where she will of course be rendered completely useless. a 2 month lifespan on a sp valk that wants gear/ranks. what a waste of resources.
im never taking her skin off. her default looks like a completely different character that's totally out of tune with the game.
yeah i cant see anything but a worse nilou
it's so lazy how are the devs not sick of it themselves
yeah and then they just kept doing it
seriously im so over this color
susannah's design is absolutely hideous
i have to say
are they serious..
wow i cant wait hoh outfit
i should watch a ref but idont wanna <a:Madgeclap:911017183478431764>

ay
tell your friend to stop investing in dead valks

unless mibobo has a stroke and decides to give us 20 free cards, that should be the one we have now
he literally just spent our savings on d2
wtf why would you do that
time to log out and forward me the funds <a:gunplss:863108840885977178>
<a:aPES_Clap:498482209020444673>
ok i mean in the actual game tho
did they actually expand the screen or is 50% of it blacked out
<a:mobiuslick_hh:913804603462664232>
then i get a mod mail half an hour later
so i said just in case i will delete it
and i deleted it immediately coz everyone was like gasp
yeah i post an art
god i hate that server
another day another warn wfp
lmfao
what is he cookin
i like the 7% one
<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
i did do this
<a:mhpeepoclap:998941254027051028>
who does that
its like someone pulling ss hos with 2 star dudu elf
lumi never gonna live that one down
nobody has ss1, s2 or 3s or take a hike lumi <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<a:PU_PeepoToxic:747841929475129456>
i wish i could give advice but i've been through a ton and never found one i liked <:Sadge:816798647760584757>

<:C_HuJerry:807167698626281492>
i just thought its been awhile since then but idk how these things work
saying they would look into it and are serious
i did see that tweet
yea im surprised mibobo haven't said he's over yet
now more people are posting screencaps of their convos with him
last week it came out that he was grooming minors in his server and a bunch of other shit.. the rest of the en cast publically disowned him on twitter
have mibobo fired en tighnari yet? some of these posts im seeing on twitter are so outrageous it's hard for me to believe people can behave that way <a:HUH:960281654046375986>
you mean your '24 resolution?
same difference
im pretty sure they f2p, wouldn't be surprise they got fed up
yeah i was wondering
maybe i missed them tho
havent seen them on myriad in awhile
what happened to cookiezi?
someone should tell them to uninstall before its too late
look at that little baby player in sols
<a:dogJAM:1000279425402814534>
<a:rabbitJAM:988563845410852934>

<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>

the odds were in their favor
ruby resorting to draftking income
i dont work directly for schools but i work in education so we get all the same benefit <a:PepeLaugh:946799559969996850>

idk theres liek a million at the tower in addition to that
i dont want to progress with no progress <:KusaDerp:992188994660081745>
should i do some of these quests first
lets do something gresham
<a:Walk:1025390261406285874>
probably
am i losing anything by doing that
if i make a new character it starts at 1350 light?
<:A_HuBruh:861227211624939550>
<:kokomisad:874368234202230834>
are bows garbage
does it have to be weakpoints
its delirium and sunshot
oh im not using witherlord
i like the weapons that give infinite ammo <:KusaDerp:992188994660081745>
oh i think i have this one
ok how about the primary weapon? any primary weapon i can look for? im fine with using sunshot/witherloard on my backbar for now but i have no primary
have they changed it so i can redo my character yet
bro my character looks like a heroin addict
so i guess pve/gambit
well im really bad at crucible
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
didnt yall say something that i should buy something to get all the exotics?
<@416445660443967491> <@370438895965306882> tell me at least the best sidearms i should be using <a:derp:564970547629260800>
i dont think so, in the last couple eps the good guy she delegated as her executioner is turning out to be a total psychopath. i think she's gonna get her revenge for sure.
yo <@309634550273933314> i just found out that show i watch yesterday ended the way it did because it was separated in 2 parts, not seasons. first part just dropped in december and second part is already comin in march and will have the fall out of her revenge. i will keep you posted because actually i can't stop thinkg about it <:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561>
oh i wanted you to check my gear and tell me what to use but it sounds like its gonna be the blind leading the blind <:KusaDerp:992188994660081745>
they gave him such a chad voice just for his model to be soft twink
i agree, his model is pretty bad
his dmg is actually really good, the only thing mid about him as a unit is how burst reliant he is. like why they have to give him that useless e? it's literally USELESS.
one and done it bro.. i havent done anything yet either. im just skipping chip space
yanfei is run in vape or pure pyro
to an extent, vape is still better. the difference is just investment, you don't have to farm artifacts for an eternity to get a cracked dendro team.
vape just got left behind right now in meta, it still clears but dendro is absolutely braindead investment/gameplay to reach the same - if not better - result
yanfei damage is not garbage literally do a yt search
i just got tao, she sucks
and who in their right mind wanna play a c0 tao
yanfei is pretty good
no s2 hoo, use px <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
i bought out xp and affix from coin shop this morning to prepare for nothing next week <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
its stuff like metal and cube that suck with dual release
if youre not f2p torus is unironically one of the easiest mats in the game to get
i think steam just adds you
that black outfit isn't bad tho <:PauseChamp:998262133336850554>
warlock still look so ugly all the time compared to hunter
i remember that lmoa
shaders
omg
they have a lot of new skins in the game
but things are dying so <:KusaDerp:992188994660081745>

i get zero resolution <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<@309634550273933314> just watched that entire first season to be left on a cliffhanger someone give me a refund for that time <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
not yet <:DK:861368415717818369> i swear i'll dl it this wknd
this guy is honestly such a flop, like i know he means well and he's a good guy but some of the stuff he says.. like her body is covered in scars and she shows him and she's like you can't even stand to look at them and he says they're injuries.. <a:HUH:960281654046375986> okay
idts she just confessed everything to him and he said but what will you do after the plan? revenge will ruin you. and she's like um it must be nice having a wonderful childhoold and family so you can walk around spouting cliches like this. <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561>
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
i just finish ep 6 and realise the awkward bully actually wasn't the same kid i thought he was and he never even knew these people <:kekL:939008918640787476>
ive made a huge mistake
oh no
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
lmao im still trying to figure that out too
<a:jerry:864556009874522152>
<@309634550273933314> awkward bystander bully just laid his heart bare to girlboss after 7 fucking years of waiting for her to be ready and she laughed in his face and said i'm not looking for a prince. i'm looking for an executioner to assist in my hunt.
everyone loves mei <:FeelsCozyMan_lum:492488572146941982>
she's not just killing wifebeaters and bullies, she's help people who never get help help <:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
actually this show is kinda sweet so far
lmao
hopefully they did <a:danceboi:837740326390464532>
less jail time that way
or just watch the show for cathartic therapy <:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561>
she was tortured by these kids in high school and literally no one helped her (abandoned by her parents, abused by the principle, and the nurse just gave up and left the school). none of hte kids were ever held responsible and of course they're all filthy rich so they grow up to be whatever they want in life. meanwhile, the girl drops out of school, gets a job, works her way up and plans for revenge on all of them.
mte <:kekL:939008918640787476>
the awkward kid in the bully club is obv in love with this girl ofc <:kekL:939008918640787476>
btw tet
imma just watch the first season for now and see how it ends
yeah thats the thing right lol surely they can tell this story in 8 eps
the second season is coming soon apparently, i'm on ep 3 now <:PopcornTime:749134519487037461>
8 eps
its gotten pretty great reviews and great cast
its a show
yeah she is, out here murdering wifebeaters and school bullies <a:smokeney:841099639871766558>
<a:animenod:814063051854446653>
a horny pokemon team? <:huh:966619839307321394>
also why is it that every revenge thriller involving a group of bullies always has that one dude in the group that makes awkward faces while the bullying is going on but does nothing to stop it? i'm supposed to feel sorry for that bitch when he gets his come uppance? i dont.
its a revenge thriller, this girl in high school was bullied and i guess she kills everyone
i'm watching it now <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>

<:C_HuJerry:807167698626281492>
it was fun
like build your units to work with 4 vs 4
and people can make whole teams just for gambit
yes
gambit is 4 vs 4 and you have to like.. collect stuff before the other team does or something? i cna't remember <:kekL:939008918640787476>
gambit was whta i liked most about the game when i played
outside gambit
and it was a lot of like do this and that and also this and pvp i dont do pvp
i really could not understand it lol
i logged in one day and found this new system, i gave up after a week
that shit IS ASS
of grinding weapons and shit
gresham did you play when they had that whole new system
i will when i get home
it was satisfying
<a:Chad:1015573221942251642>
im a warlock main
for such a huge game no one talk about it
me neither
have you guys ever tried star citizen
surely ashes of creation is coming soon to revive mmo <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
<:KKona:932813351581540422>
other than d2
fps game have raids? <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
what is clans
<:Sadge:816798647760584757>
when you have a good raiding group who all have the same goal, it is really fun to play. but eventually, people leave, others join with bad attitude, more join that are just not as good and it just becomes not worth it.
<:life:1001518241610485781>
ESO was my first MMO that i actually hardcore played. i knew nothing about raiding or rotations, i just enjoyed exploring/questing/acheivements until one day my friend convince me to raid and after that all i care about is raiding. i grind those achievements so hard it was like life and death on the weekends.
the one i played hardcore was ESO and it was like that for the dps but supports rarely had to grind again <:A_HuSmuggers:857751695966339103>
alts are way too much work
but after some years i'd rather die than continue grind
when i truly love an mmo and start one, i will grind all day long enjoying it
same
so true <:life:1001518241610485781>
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
and all i see him doing now is standing in one place shooting enemies for xp over and over again
my bf recently got back into it a couple weeks ago because he also wanted to raid
blizzard <a:OMEGADANCE1:931653026517778484>
why every mmo have to be elves and wizards in the old times and shit.. where my cyberpunk world mmo <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

<:whip:1024122299034632272>

pog
<a:aPES2_CrazyNopers:888440873308790794>
rule of thumb.. if you want to compete myriad, every sp rank is important
yes lol
<a:animenod:814063051854446653>
in a friendly way though its not mean
correct me if i'm wrong gresham but ryu's laughing at lumi for being rank gated on cat
ryuu shared it in sols <:Kek:752643961851609139>

aren't we supposed to get snow this weekend? <:PauseChamp:998262133336850554>
<:waiting:1027534309298544640>
20 minutes
that sounds amazing
i think i'd enjoy it to, it looks like a place where everyone drinks all day and doesn't care about anything <:life:1001518241610485781>
i really want to go to scotland and rent a car, just drive the coast
ive never been to london <:life:1001518241610485781>
i used to watch skins and misfits, so i'm practically british
i dont think ive had it
whoever did it was so lazy they couldn't even change the name, just kept it as tikka masala and call it british. if brits renamed it, it'd be something like orange chicken
<:KKona:932813351581540422>
or when you eat meat and you bite into a huge chunk of fat
that shit make me gag
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
its called tikka masala, i don't need to read a dissertation on who created that food
watch that new timothee chalamet movie, i think its all about seasoning the humans for consumption
lmao
yeah the brits tried to think of a single dish they could call their own and came up with fish and fries
thanks tet but i'll ask a man to be sure
chicken tiki is bomb
i just noticed chicken tiki masala is there.. is this another thing they stole from another nation and rebrand? <:DuduDerpNggt:996935323013619762>
but its good
its literally pig blood and oats
its probably because of whats in it
lmaoo
i went to ireland a few years ago and i tried black pudding for the first time, that shit is so good
a lot of it is actually, it's just astronomically unhealthy and fatty
and he think it normal
but since i move out with my bf and eat his mom's cooking, i have to salt everything so much because it taste like im not eating anything <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
i grew up with a white mom and my stepmum is from columbia, either way, both of them always gave me flavorful food and i never really understood the stereotype
you know that stereotype that white people don't season their food
i dont eat much fast food anymore but when i do its chic fil a, their homophobic chicken is delicious
yeah because they're full of kids
if thats the most pathetic you've ever done i gotta say, you still have a long life ahead of you <:wot:998941267041996862>
i used to eat it when i lived in oklahoma but i tried it once since i moved to jersey and it gave me the shits so im not going back <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
wendys sucks where i am
was that someone me? <:wot:998941267041996862>
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
just put one each on different bronyas
and its usually a 50/50 on if a 3k+ player is even gonna participate at this point <:wot:998941267041996862>
pretty much
yeah i dont recognize any of those names but im usually only concerned with t15 anyway <:wot:998941267041996862>
i figured
or i can ask maincord for you, theres lots of nirv players there
lumi you can also go to myriad and check yourself, last cycle ranking is there
i dont see anyone aside from ryu and idk if thats even the right ryu
whats teh question
hard choice
ohhh
i mix my wasabi with soy sauce
wdym i like both <:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
i will find a way
im a rat

well idk about nirv you prob fine.. but myriad yeah you need all the buffs to be competitive there
if you care about competing in nirv, its very important
yeah me too you got my paypal let me know when you send it
htf a f2p get a ss1 hoh
<a:Whale_luma:458386265776193536>
and buy 4 stamps
i'll just pull for a frag then
shes there
yep
those select banners give essentine?
is hfs on select?
if im not getting hofi i should probably just get the hfs rank
you really cant be any worse than the scores i settle for these days
or MA feel free i hate ma
you can play some abyss on mine whenever you want
<:A_HuSmuggers:857751695966339103>
idk its just collective purposes at this point i barely play
<a:Walk:1025390261406285874>
i'd ahve to buy 5 stamps
and of course
ss2
yeah i might both options sound pretty mid but one is accessible
its more than half spending currency for a rank on hfs/spa.. ridiculous <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
if i finish hov frags i would only have enough currency for 2 s rank stamps.. neither would get me another rank so idk <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
idk ive lost track
we do?
70

üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
idk but i want to use da, especially if she top score
isnt that what im supposed to use?
<@370438895965306882> can you start putting refs up for ely boss. specifically a 3s da and 2s htr ref <:DK:861368415717818369>
i've never wanted to be cartoon character's legs so badly
im so obsessed with this art
congrats gresham
usually you want her off field for this because you need to lay down more buffs
lightfall is when her ult sword explodes
yes eula
she has to be on field for the lightfall
if you want to take advantage of mika's buffs
<:Lmao:966624069363597362>
but she cant use him because she has to be on field for lightfall
next patch
they legit just give eula a phys support
theres no such thing as abusing superconduct, that reaction is ass
when the game revolves around elemental reactions
nobody cares about phys in genshin, the only reason its even there is because its a staple in every gacha game so hoyo thought hey we need that for sure
SHATTER <:C_HuJerry:807167698626281492>
lol because eula is not procing the blooms herself, em does nothing for her
as long as theres hydro+dendro+electro you will get some hb procs and hb procs are more powerful than eula's autos <:Peepo_Supreme:847376455625342999>
eula mains are just desperate to use her <a:collapse:859859231503417344>
wat teams
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
nilou really destroys that new abyss <:C_HuJerry:807167698626281492>
no thank torey

i get automodded there literally every day
demotion by NoLoliNoLife <a:yikes:859858182889144331>
oh i thought you said maincord
why they pull that much then
<a:yikes:859858182889144331>
i didnt know that but i cant say im surprised
won't someone think of the sexual abusers <a:aPES2_SadViolin:929006632858439731>
i heard mizkif redemption revealed stream didn't average his usual 40k viewer base and he complained and went offline abruptly
<:PepeLa:1058108502763126906>
that depend how much money he has
<:kekL:939008918640787476>
idk how i would feel tbh, i probably watch way worse porn than my bf but i draw the line at knowing the person <a:HUH:960281654046375986>
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
is she supporting him?
i cant watch teh vid
<:C_HuJerry:807167698626281492>
is that not his wife next to him?
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
imagine issuing an apology for something like this.. how are you not already dead of shame
literally what is wrong with trisha's boobs
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
god can you imagine? i'd never show my face again
omg lmaoo
lmfaooo
<a:yikes:859858182889144331>
ok we dont need to know your deep fake fantasies
<:kekL:939008918640787476>
i could never watch deep fake shit of people i know
yeah but she knows him, i'd be like wtf is wrong with you too lol
oh of course lol
yeah exactly, i totally get the girl feel uncomfortable though. i wouldn't associate with that person anymore.. but if you're a big streamer you are a public figure. thats how it work.
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
it was before bts exploded, i was an exo stan
i dont but i also was a kpop fan 10 years ago so i know its out there
just weird
obviously its awkward but some statements im seeing from the streamers im like idk
idk im so desensitized to this kinda stuff.. like there are celeb deep fake porn and ao3 is a treasure trove of real person fan fic
ohhhh
i dont really get it though, is a deep fake cgi?
plenty of boomers use reddit
livestream fails on reddit
i dont really understand it myself tbh i dont follow these streamers but i saw it on LSF.. some big name tabbed out of his game and he had a deep fake gallery of videos of pokimane doing sex or something
<:evilPatrick:959721545712934932>
yeah the pokimane drama
i only watch tiktok when xqc watch tiktok <:A_HuPopcorn:809062542822473758>
<:gunn:1059857569910366218>
dont you have to be 18 or under to sign up for tiktok <a:HUH:960281654046375986>
gresham is literally a myriad player and you guys are trying to tell me he's pulling bitches and playing football <a:HUH:960281654046375986>
yeah its inhumane, i dont think theres any state that allows those naymore
ive never looked into the ~resume~ of an executioner soi've no idea
lmao that is so fucked if thats true

um im from texas

nah i need to be reborn at the top of the food chain again.. if my option is like a worm or a shrimp next time i'd rather not <:HMM:966625453194485760>
i still want to be lazy
penguin life is hard though
the universe is too big
aint no way
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
i wanna try a new universe
i hope when we die we get reborn

<:DK:861368415717818369>
also at what point do you want cn as lead over hfs?
thats what i was doing too
ah so you start your opener with no htr ult?
so i should be ulting every rot?
does 3s have enough sp to ult every rot
i aint got sp
im not ulting every roto with htr tho right?
so if im going to use CN ult, i will use htr ult before.. and if i'm not using CN ult, i will use CN before htr
do you ult with htr before cn or after?
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>

<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
i cant fucking believed i only clicked that after kei said that
whatever he is thats my kinda bait
oh really? i dont know anything about the content of the game tbh
there are a lot of hot guys in hsr but theres a lot of girls too, very genshin
oh
what game are yall talkin about
the only thing worse than having no genshin content is having some genshin content
<:yikes:877047689521532979>
<:PeepoSitBASED:986284656586551366>
i dont like the style
zzz has too many ugly characters
my friend stacked his for so long and when i saw it i was like What are you doing this for? and they were like im saving up for someone i need.. bro.. you need everything here what are you talking about <a:HUH:960281654046375986>
the people who dont use al/aw every week make me so triggered
lmfao
:aint
<a:yikes:859858182889144331>
everyone told me holmes was worthless so i reso'd a full set. look how that worked out for me. <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
felt
what did this aatrox do
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
what is hanshinshin
everyone have that one friend that dies all the time and then says, omg i was totally out of that <a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005> this is the one i cnat deal with
like i had a lot of good times playing pubg but i always played with my friends back then and they didnt care how bad i was
yeah thats true
same, i get so mad at myself in fps i literally give up at first death which usually takes about 5 seconds
gresham toxic
wooow
<a:Walk:1025390261406285874>
coz people are mean
if i have to be in voice chat like overwatch or lol to do stuff, i wont play it
well it doesn't bother me in text form
i got max level after year of playing and im just minding my own business doing a dungeon and someone whisper me your dps is so bad, please uninstall and that's when i learn what a rotation is
i literally did not even know what a rotation was before i started playing eso
lmao exactly gresham
but when i switch to pc and start playing and find a new raid group for harder achievements, i found out that, unlike xbox, you can see everyone's dps in raid on pc. i thought i was a good player but it turns i was really bad. so i switch to healer role so i could pretend i was doin something. <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
i played on xbox for a long time and got a lot of achievements there
i used to raid in eso
im fucking dead because thats the exact type of shit you'd see in raid lmao
<a:AINTNOWAY:1061443977603186698>
when you need like 40 people
how do people even make that work in wow
i used to raid every single week.. progressing hm/no death with a group of 11 other fuckers. you know how hard it is to get these babies to school and perform.. every fuckin week? <a:SannahFaint:834261064903819296>
ok but moderating a raid guild is totally different from discord server.. raid leaders is another level of work, only masochist take that job
<:FeelsCozyMan_lum:492488572146941982>
back in my day, when i was like 13, i modded fanforum.com. i'm kind of an important person.
its so pathetic, especially when they're trying to have a conversation with someone in the server and they start complaining about how hard it is for them to moderate <a:aPES_Violin:585724572926607361>
no need, just send over 200k worth
doing the math for my funds?
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
owo math 22400*4
owo math 80*280
the one on the right looks really worried
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
omg toaster emoji lmao
gresham im here again to ask for my 9S Trio fund
this is my last request i promise
<a:HUH:960281654046375986>

so hopefully my mei carry
im fr skipping kiana
really looking forward to the ely boss this wknd <:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561>

villv is super mald but its fun, next time i will beat gresham by 40
quantom in general someone kick them
<a:broke_hh:891735085303345252>
<:FeelsCozyMan_lum:492488572146941982>
damn
what are you using gresham

i have been using her forever, shes too good not to
me? i use my xl all the time. shes my only pyro dps <:DK:861368415717818369>
yeah but there is no one like xl in the game unfortunately so she is invaluable
idk anything about burgeon tbh <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
only bloom and burning
bloom cores, with nilou, are about 20-35k each
oh those are hyperbloom cores
back when i ran hb using raiden at 730 em, with nahida in team, i could hit up to 30k. with c2 nahida, buffs depending, i've seen up to 75k.
yes she's insane with him, i just run 4pc guilded stack em. weapon can use xiphos or key if you have them.
it depends on how much em you have on your electro
kuki is nut but i want a 5 star mommy with a copy paste kit so i dont have to use mid lookin ass anymore sorry kuki ilu <:DK:861368415717818369>
actually lit for the defense shred <:DK:861368415717818369> but its not easy to play because the enemies move out of her ult so pass
and he gets shoved to lantern rite 4 stars that dont help him at all
most people don't, it fucking blows because its his best teammate
<a:collapse:859859231503417344>
because his hb team is so low investement and does so much off field dmg it carries his ass
you can legit leave him with 4 piece gladiator level 1 artifact and in a hyperbloom team it still clears abyss
NUT
its super nut
ill take death
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
that is so not even
you guys really
cute and funny
paimon is actually cute and funny, just don't play in eng <:DK:861368415717818369>

yep
wow half my bracket alredy playing lol
also heki here watch this 
HOLUP NEW KONIZELL VID JUST DROPPED <a:runleft:873280591301312563>
lmao
i guess? idk <a:derp:564970547629260800>
and you start over
after you hold attack to exit mecha form it throws it at the enemy
well i dont know anything about anything but how i understand she works with nuke in ER is that you grab a signet from ely at the start that allows you to throw her mech after ulting that does signifcant damage, and her ult cds are all cut so you basically just repeat the cycle over and over. weapon active > ult > hold attack > ult > hold attack
<:HigoThink:585629884630695948>
yeah thats what the citrus video suggested and they were right <a:pogfish_lum:859949076413153312> the sigil also does mega dmg
better signet luck at the start but it got shit again at the end <:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
<a:collapse:859859231503417344>
bro
idk why heim take 10 years still
can def do faster
oh yes much better now <:FeelsCozyMan_lum:492488572146941982>

WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS FIGHT üò≠
i swear if when we get our animated cinematic with everyone fighting kevin, senti comes in at some point to save everyone's ass - i'll die of happiness <a:pogfish_lum:859949076413153312>
who does that? its so annoying
why does teri model stand like this???
finally i get a mei/senti scene just for senti tell her to fuck off <:kekL:939008918640787476>

<:GriseoSob_lum:994026245069230161>
hades is 10/10 in that aspect
also i dont like exclusive boy or exclusive girl shit, i want hot boys and hot girls
theres no combat in themis <:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
oh my word <a:Suswankage:935413585235021845>
ofc not
love her hair
that's elysia <:huh:966619839307321394>
some of the designs are nice but like.. the actual game look ugly to me <a:Walk:1025390261406285874>
you can play villanious girls in nikke? <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
my fave honkai retcon is that kevin was soliciting herrschers the entire time just to meet elysia
i cant wait for the story to be over so they can go back to archon wars
waiting for an epic battle in genshin.. <:Copium:834822065231364156>
oh <:kekL:939008918640787476>
thats not we idiot
beach kiana
ei didn't commit genocide, she just stole everyone's hopes and dreams and left them lifeless shells <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<@180679257851166721> is this good score for andrius? 
i dont understand anything with inazuma story for the most part, convoluted bs that didn't live up to what it could have been. raiden first entrance was so ominous and epic.. then just turned to a fart in the wind <:life:1001518241610485781>
hahaha
lmaooo
i liked that cut scene too when nahida was like the first sage buer I FELT THE POWER <:E_ScaraChaos:977593985637941278> even if i feel it wasn't earned.. <:senkosmuggy:969401013930983444>
so true
<a:collapse:859859231503417344>
like the one with yelan/xiao i really loved
genshin still manage to make some of their cinematics meaningful though thanks in great part to the art/sound
they were thinking with the standard gacha game brain
they should've just not made the traveler self insert, give them an identity like you wish they had in the story <:mfw:840549220406263859>
pog love this
i hate on the power of friendship trope a lot but i wont lie it is a guilty pleasure, esp with hoyo games <:mfw:840549220406263859>
does it have gays? good music?
what about that jojo show? is that worth the watch?
so like every anime

literally excel does all my math for me, im surprised i can calc 2+2 at this poitn
guys its fine, its not like im the head financial analyst at my job or anything <a:derp:564970547629260800>
it take 1050 pulls to r5 with the worst luck possible.. it take 200 to gear a valk in honkai. case closed. <a:Walk:1025390261406285874>
owo math 15*70
owo math 3*5
of course they are, theyre not spending money and malding every week
no im cringing because 1000 wishes is a good starting point for c6r1.. i have 440 saved up and i would need to purchase another 80000+ primos to guarantee c6r1
and when you get unlucky in genshin, you're not set back like 100 pulls, you're set back 200
yeah
i think so too kei
i know but lets ignore that
you think they spend more in genshin
if someone is 3s+gear+4s elf every update in honkai vs c6r5 every update in genshin
what do you guys think
you know i used to think honkai was more expensive than genshin but now i realise its just that honkai forces me to spend more than genshin
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
owo math 555*160
owo math 445-1000
yeah actually tacky

<a:broke_hh:891735085303345252>
isnt the whole point of them forcing 3s bosses to force out old meta for the newer valks? i remember when tank took some time to kill in MA and now the scores i see are making it look like the new SS <:C_HuJerry:807167698626281492>
pretty

omfg there are so many ss vvs
591
keeby hasn't posted score yet but he's using fischl with fr
but no i dont think it's worth leveling just for this one fight
591
highest score on NA lbs using FR is using eden's pri right now

and then ice rpc/hos bleed?
like ruby said, its a hard stage
half our valks dont touc hthe floor anymore or can't dodge when i need them too
the stage mechanic is so dumb
reroll account tbh <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580> nows a good time to do it, grab bronya and stack all the crystal for anni
yea the more ranks she gets the better she is as dps lol <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
yea i was one bar off with hor, i think i could do it but it would've been sweaty

lmfao damn i missed it
<:DK:861368415717818369>
its what i always used here before
real?
i really don't know either.. either hardcore save until anni or pull until bronya and then save and skip hofi <:yikes:877047689521532979>
<:C_HuJerry:807167698626281492>

lol no
<a:PopcornMunch:751417674277322834>
so i can watch you suffer
so i choose gm
both dk or gm is good picks
no im serious
and then i think you should stream your first qua nirv using it for everyone
i think you should get the gaming mouse
you know what lumi
and it's not going to top score anything at these temps and with htr now giving vv more points
its viable, that doesn't mean it's easy
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
wow thats so nice of him
gresham is prepared to spend 100 pulls on bronya and 200 on her gear i see <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
the rich get richer <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>

yeah tbh you're already suffering in qua even with gaming mouse.. esp if you're nirv bouncer. just take the L on qua week until seele herrscher comes this summer <:DK:861368415717818369>
idk do you want to cope harder on qua or do you want more dorm buff? always rec dorm buff but suffering in qua sucks
idk if that's worth picking up over dk, it might be if you don't have any qua tbh
they put that in firepower?
oh
what the fuck is collapse cannon <:mfw:840549220406263859>
i legit use it my very first week in ex so i never even thought of ditching it <:mfw:840549220406263859>

im confused.. why are all these refs running shui over paga <:DK:861368415717818369>
carole is in shui+paga m
heki look at the ref gresham posted
honestly its coz of lack of phys options.. the last phys dps we got was pe a year ago. <a:Y_dies:818190915096281089>
senti on dos or cosmic?

i won't, i just need gresham to send them first <:DK:861368415717818369>

man i saw one at microcenter
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
a lot of people love the game, i get it. i just can't imagine it sells more than genshin. genshin appeals to EVERYONE.
please dont make me lose more faith in humanity than i already have <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<:dead:808739535419998239>
i'm just trying to understand because it sounds like typical publicity talk to me. i can't even fathom a game like nikke could appeal to a wider audience than genshin ever can
while not including cn sales?
i see, so nikke did actually outsell genshin but only on the mobile platform?
is that article saying that nikke made 100m on all platforms while comparing it to sales exclusive to mobile on glb <a:aPES_Think:493353113332219924>
now i wanna know
so
thank you carv
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
so what the heck is that article saying.. am i reading it wrong? <a:aPES_Think:493353113332219924>
idk i'll wait for <@180679257851166721> to explain it like im 5 <:DK:861368415717818369>
the report sounds misleading though? like what the hell does this even mean? estimated cn numbers in the negative so not incorporated here?
gib eli!
is that strictly japan rev?
that reddit post
also
this article is saying genshin made 14m on its first month and nikke made 100m?
what is the context? like surpassing a week's revenue? <:mfw:840549220406263859>
how is it even possible for a gacha to surpass genshin at this point without having massive popularity in the west
doubt
<:DK:861368415717818369>

yelan's entire animations feel like a complete thing though, she's very fluid/dancery so her ult is like striking a pose during the dance. kiana's hitting a bat, dancing on a stripper pole, and landing a kick. what makes sense here? <:huh:966619839307321394>
i like the boob jiggle in that one animation. - lumi, aint no way server (2023)

vv chosen at the end
well this is 6 min run with ss2 
yeah at that level it really shouldn't matter which fc boss you choose assuming full gear

i'll do a run with FR when i get home and see how it is <a:aPES_Think:493353113332219924>
but tbf i haven't played him against FR, now im curious <a:aPES_Think:493353113332219924>
when i fight him i never do mechanics i just kill him
aside from hit count at the beginning mechanics dont matter on him in ER, you should just be able to brute force even his layers

ye you should do that on my account carv
like you would tell your mom im going out with bronya but you wouldn't tell bronya that because she'd give you a lecture on honesty. but then mom calls bronya to ask where you are and bronya's like she's not here
idk she doesnt seem the type to be down for that
omg he just like you fr fr
it cant get more white than that
also his name is kevin
is kevin asian? he look white as hell
wants nothing to do with ely

i think food tastes different every country you go
i wanna go to asia someday to try all the food <:life:1001518241610485781>

i'm pulling her coz shes the future, does she have anything specific to her kit that says hoo/hofi must be in team? i think most of her stuff just specifies kiana/mei. so, i think she is going to be used for a very long time. hofi/hoo idk.
<a:aPES_Think:493353113332219924>

oh i thought her 3s was starting sp, i didnt know its restorative <:huh:966619839307321394>
starting sp like senti
yeah its definitely one of those ranks people should've been informed on
i dont think its bad though, it looks like htr is still effectively supporting in most elemental teams even outside trio
thats what aka was saying
so you can literally play the team like a cut scene
like... arent you skipping htr in 6.3 to pull hofi in 6.4... so you can pull htr in 6.4 too?
i love how theyre talking about htr might rerun in 6.4
<:PU_PepeDerp:750749850672431114>

i think ur just gonna feel better at s2 now tho lol
yeah lmk if you feel the difference
i think heph goes higher temps we may feel the need
thats just me though lol
i pulled extra for a dupe just to get a sp/s line and to this day have never found the need for it
i like it too
i thought this was like shooter game stuff lol
oh like overwatch skins
im gonna yt this
let me find out these are skins for guns and not boobs <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:A_HuPopcorn:809062542822473758>
idk anything about that
why
you would have a stopping point
thats more like having a guarantee though
depends on the person lol
they would buy multiple boxes at any price and keep buying them until they got the skin
A LOT
i should work at mibobo this plan actually would make millions <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
its over
imagine they put in the bikini skins
i'd like to see the solstice reciepts from the multiple boxes people get opening for like a random bke dress <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
they should actually do it and put the eva skins in
you konw what tho
yeah you can almost guarantee it with $100 <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
what skin
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>
seems people will really buy anything these days
that is actually wild, new levels of scam entering the shop. what's next? $100 pyramid box with random skin for 3 years ago? <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>

casino christmas parties are the best
its not like that lol i grew up dirt poor dude, like.. i remember i used to live on tuna cans and we'd refill the our shampoo bottles with water. my mom never even got a diploma. but she worked her ass off and found a connect in the oil field so that's how we both made it. the dubai is just a friend that met a shady dude who was from dubai and moved out there.
it was great lol
and my boss would rent a whole school bus to drive the drunks home
every year we'd have a christmas party at a) a casion or b) golf course
in the oil field so filthy rich
i worked at my last job for 5 years and it was a really good place
well my office is pretty tame too compared to my last job
lmaoo
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
so the only guy there was having a martini
my office is all girls btw
he ordered a martini and the rest of us shared hte pitchers
my boss didn't have any sangria
i just got home, we got 4 pitchers for 5 people at the restaraunt and they were all empty when we left <a:britneyeh:823957594615185481>

idk anything about gacha outside mibobo and pgr
that's it
play genshin
yeah its seeping into the culture one step at a time
all the kids play minecraft and fortnite
well luckily gacha isnt mainstream here yet so its not as hard to avoid
<a:emmalaugh:871069715299188807>
and then they can support my gacha
man if i ever have a kid its not the doctor or lawyer for them, they going to tech school for sure
sc nerd?
<:dojaomg:827883958721052682>

ah okay yea i never had that here
i thought you meant work from home friday
oh i didnt realise you meant you had fridays off
it was mostly the front office staff, they do like secretarial work i guess so there isn't much to do at home. really its just office politics bs.
it used to be 4 days 1 off for everyone in my office too but they changed it a few months ago because my boss thought some people were abusing it <a:britneyeh:823957594615185481>

newt b gaming <a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
i wonder why hoh is so much worse
i dont think sushang is even pri-d
also.. his sushang is s0 and neither her weapon nor cat's are maxxed
theyre not going to hod, i dont think he would be able to do the side stages for that
no sw yeah idk we'll see maybe they go up for kalpas then
theyre good player, they just dont care like we do. i dont think he sits down and malds for hours or researches anything
i rather they come back for a fight that dont need too much skill <:mfw:840549220406263859>
they will have to stall until bke at the earliest
lmao
they cant right.. you have to do 2 cycles in rl
when they -200 on this cycle, can they make it back for heph?
i dont think they anticipated ranking up on kosma lol
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
they have full aponia team
or husk
maybe they can level a freakin weapon
probably good thing they forgot to buy da card with their balls and now they have to buy out torus from shop
ill tell them, im pretty sure their purana is still 50 tho <:mfw:840549220406263859>
<a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
was it hod?
whats next?
nah im not playing chase the benares
lmao
boring
i tried her too
but the fight feels a lot beter to play
oh yeah its not a good score or anything
yea thats true too
lowkey da is a lot easier on this fight than hfs.. i didnt realise he jump around so much with hfs. i heard yall talking about it but i was playing with da and it didnt seem that bad. with hfs though it like he constantly teleport all over the map. no thanks
my friend is so slow with leveling their gear it drives me nuts
lao
oh what is it
i know i would
i think they just want the personal achievement of finally clearing all though
oh no they did clear those
i feel bad for them, this is the 3rd time going to nirv and not reach the boss.. and they been stalling RL cycles for this one <a:Y_dies:818190915096281089>
idk ill tell them to try at least
you think this person got sos <:HaiWeirdChamp:994269975051255868>
so theyre slow farming mpe gear currently
or rather no phys dps thats safe enough to invest in rn lol
they just got unlucky when they started really, no good phys dps rn
full aponia team, hot, full hoh team, hfs, ae, cn, hos (no gear), si, mpe (no gear)
they have
nope s0 spa with no gear <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:Deadge:966011458691416124>
ya
this is nirv and mfer has negative dorm buffs btw
they tried hoh and said rhey couldnt do it
they dont have hor either
f in chat they have everything for it except mpe stigs <a:DIESOFCRINGE:996352619935187005>
<:Deadge:966011458691416124>
no wonder my friend is having trouble clearing
for some reason i thought it was that annoying lightning bio stage
oh
whats the best f2p team for the bottom side stage
i swear it used to be something absurd like 200 gold orbs for one wafer
didnt they lower the cost of those wafers significantly <:kekwaitsit:969070975259934780>
ty!
3s da only gets 650? <:SakuraSad:866034161819451432>

<a:smadging:1034847088737005628>
i dont even have a 10 pull rn
i might just do that and then pull ac on the last day of her supply
i wonder how score holds up with raven/ae instad of ac
will be my first time fighting him weirdly enough
everyone says heim is a bitch too
cant relate i never do tank <:Peepo_Supreme:847376455625342999>
idk the bleed one looks equally annoying to get top score on
neko must be feeling good about this vv bleed abyss <:Evilge:960548412271505418>
<a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
i liked the idea they were going for incorporating fc stuff but its like a 12 year old put it all together
elysia stigs are so mid its sad
<@370438895965306882> makes no fucking sense
yeah but im asking about the blinker mine wont blink
1:02 when she qte in her weapon active is already blinking
nvm no i dont explain
nvm i see
<@370438895965306882> how does kyo proc that weapon active spin on pardo right before last phase?
my bf works in manhattan tho

<a:PU_pepeNOPERS:850330663415578654>

thanks asshole
he told me im lucky my car isn't bein towed
i said officer pls understand the new bronya suit is coming soon i cant afford to pay a ticket
yes actually
mfer really has nothing better to do than pull over a car that doesn't have a jersey plate
i just got pulled over by jersey's finest <:mfw:840549220406263859>
its clearly a squid running hak
free octopus fart?
<:Deadge:966011458691416124>
i should stop now .
damn i was like the opposite and now im stuck in this hellhole of making a downpayment to mihoyo every month
yeah like the last 2 months of my masters i started actually trying lol
i started but fell off a lot for like 6 months, i started playing hardcore on sw release
yeah i was really burned out by genshin by then too
hor and bn wwere my first
i started playing because i saw the mei summertime outfit somewhere, i wanted her so bad but everyone told me she was trash so i was good and pulled hfs. while pulling for hfs i off rated all of hot's gear. i watched as her banner passed me by time and time again. and then i saw the light at the end of the tunnel.. hot was being added to bp. not only was hot being added to bp but she was becoming meta again. so it was my time to shine. scooped her so quick. <:life:1001518241610485781>
thats lucky
now look at you
better times
my first gacha valk was hfs <:Peepo_Supreme:847376455625342999>
i hope glb spend event is sushang skin
<a:aPES_CoolClap:655414093045563392>
<:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
her stigs have like a fuckton of team tdm no?
necessary for support
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
wont
i want scold, you guys know what youre doing with your account better than i do
<:life:1001518241610485781>
not good
i think skipping bronya is gonna feel like skipping AE
refund banner
i still think mei will be free
yeah i would get bronya but leave at least 15k available going into 6.4
ac cheaper right? but bronya universal
well i think you should try for one of the supports, whether tis ac or bronya
impossible game
<:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
idk how much do you get a patch
cant you get both if you save everything until then
cherri are you saving for htr
<:angryderpmelon:959706345693675520>
<:A_HuTaoSalute:792062698481385492>
heki of course you should save everything for the trio but you wont so just spread your 10 across the 7 banners <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
now say this slower <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
for the giggle
pull on hfs advance
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
oh yes
<a:Walk:1025390261406285874>
hepha is week 3 and we still have a week to go before this patch, 2 of which are not using sushang
look at the schedule? you gonna get any use out of that sushang in the next 4 weeks? 
heki who fucking cares
oh the humanity
what? one week?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
heki im poor
yeah gresham forced 2 save
<a:kyaruSMH:887997949404127282>
gresham is so mad he cant pull on this adv that he's encouraging your downfall heki just stop
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>

we worked out that i can get hos 3s with bp even without hte top up event right? im debating just getting sn stamps even tho its a measly 30 <:mfw:840549220406263859>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>

they really dont give a shit anymore
tank too
i always like a bke week
<:mfw:840549220406263859>

<@370438895965306882> when does er open for us now? 930?
she look good on that wolf fight tho
of course
at ss?
oh that doesnt sound bad then
<:Deadge:966011458691416124>
like against ss ae?
do you have score comparison ruby?
idk im prob worry for nothing
itj ust make me worry for hfs, like either new kiana is going to entirely dominate fire or they need to continue to tweak her
with ss htr
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
this is worrying, like either bronya is introducing new meta which is why she's not working with other fire teams or the new trio is entirely a quick gimmick
i hope they give us a shitton for anni too
im still holding on to the box they gave us
sounds about right
then ill go back to ice before i worry about hov
im working vk next
<a:NODDERS:1018787916954218516>
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>

one day
ugh
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
not as long as bke is the only s rank mech phys
no its not
what the fuck this new hoc fight looks so mald but fun <:woggers:652740192653934633>
that's definitely a possiblity but stop lying to yourself like it apply to you <:mfw:840549220406263859>
hear me out
actually delusional you need a break from maincord <:mfw:840549220406263859>
mibobo never send me paycheck i work free for them <:mfw:840549220406263859>
idk wdym its a deal you only 50 away from ss1 but then at that point you only 150 away from sss dont you want that juicy 40 sp <:mfw:840549220406263859>
but you're only 50 away at that point <:mfw:840549220406263859>
also why she just stand there for half an hour when she qte in <:mfw:840549220406263859>
i thought the opposite, as support she hogging too much field time <:mfw:840549220406263859>
she look really awkward to use right now but her animations look clean and fun, i'm sure once people work out how to play her and new suits come she will be amazing <:mfw:840549220406263859>
s0 htr beat out fischl in aka's hot testing <:mfw:840549220406263859>
sp will turn into a daily special menu basically, creating further niches in support. bronya likely a staple and the sps will swap out depending on fight <:mfw:840549220406263859>
no ss htr demoted to fischl <:mfw:840549220406263859>
actually elemental hos <:mfw:840549220406263859>
it looks 40 here on aka stream
i thought it was 20 too kei
htr have same skill has hs at 3s <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
ruby took ur funds
yall fund me now
no im done funding this server
fund me
- ss1 htr
- ss0 kiana
- sss mei
- 4s elf
- hoh pyramid
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
ss1 htr
ruby only getting s0 kiana? <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
i heard pgr is harder than honkai
<:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
im never starting another gacha yall crazy
<:Deadge:966011458691416124>
idk what im gonna do if they put kiamei + elf + hoh pyramid in cny
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
and 3s give infinite sp?
so for htr you basically just come in ult and leave as support? <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
because cn is always china for me <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
but they seem to have caught on to never skiip sp method
esp with the 30 guarantee, i really dont wanna skip it
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
i want to skip ac
yeah really they didnt even try
ima go watch aka vod <a:Walk:1025390261406285874>
im pretty disappointed with bronya aesthetics, i don't like the cyans. i think i'd like it more with a different color scheme
that htr weapon is just a placeholder right? they're replacing that lego toy with an actual weapon soon
kiana will probably take everything except fgo
im not convinced any new boss is for PE
fire kiana will dominate all fire
da will probably take nothing
i want new hua suit
phys need some attention where my senti power up <a:aPES2_SadGeSmoke:929006632900370483>
you make a good pont about the weather system though, she'll need to increase dmg enough to compensate for that right <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
<a:aPES2_SadGeSmoke:929006632900370483>

<:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>

what da hale
certainly feels like it
<:Peepo_Supreme:847376455625342999>
but klein was a lucsacc today so it all evens out
dabber was mean to me
<:Prayge:968951880623484928> 4* klein in 2 pulls
the pull is strong but short radius and short time
yeah its pretty trash
but i'll let you know the next new elf <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
my elf ely already 4s
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>

paga
imo cezz tbb is better than cez tmb <:kekL:939008918640787476>
ohh i misunderstood i thought you were using tesla tm <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
if you have cezz t ideally you'd want to use it with b and beet m (if melee dps - if mpe then full cez better), the 2 piece effect from cezz is still super powerful for team dmg
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
but i keep fucking up the second half
that was like a no crit run
800 should def be possible
<:Peepo_Supreme:847376455625342999>
<@370438895965306882>

thats kind of what i mean
well yeah but he looks to go invuln for no reason <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>

how about a 700
you expect too much of me gresham
why am i one shotting sometimes with mkp and not others <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
when i use mkp though i tried 3 senti ult, looks like cutmeo just use spear impair for one roto
dos is fine on sp but not enough to one shot
neb is def not enough dmg
tried all 3
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

doesnt sea even still have books elft
but i still have to work today because america <:KKona:932813351581540422>
im off work today because america <:KKona:932813351581540422>
im 4.3 rn.. i think i only -200 one cycle on the first kosma
oh ew
4k if above ?
i go back down to 2k?
is there a trophy reset next patch?
i havent read a damn thing about her
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
nyx
<a:smadging:1034847088737005628>
whale behavior
<a:Whale_luma:458386265776193536>
yeah stack up on those sp cards for ac
think i will have to snipe those blues and sp cards <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
they put a lot of good bundles in the shop today <:Binoculars:1018789687478992966>
its more that people in maincord would give advice to people that spa was a better investment than hfs.. and anyone with a brain could see spa had ONE boss in abyss and they were basing her entire value off of that. she was a good f2p pull at the time but seeing people rec her over hfs was lunacy
lmao
they all just speak from their own f2p experience <:Peepo_Supreme:847376455625342999>
i think a lot of them forget because they likely HAVE her, it's easy to forget the value of her if you have her
and every week in maincord it was spa is better than hfs, hfs is dead, spa best fire valk <:PepegeSitSnack:909354353389879327>
he had skipped sw and spa so i think his suffering was just compounded <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
also, we would still get sw weather occasionally back then too didn't we?
he's talked aobut it before, he now regrets skipping spa gear but back then i just remember he'd be complaining every week coz of all the aka shilling
he was out there doing aka with io every cycle <:PogD:962229760484839424>
fragile used to be the #1 io supporter istg
there was a time when i super regret not pulling her but not anymore <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
f in chat for io she had a good run
i think hoh patch was torture coz not only 3 qua boss but also wolf, that's 4 cycles already i dont have the valk for.. this patch has been so nice for me
lmao exactly
3 qua cycles
and then it was kosma again last week wasnt it
look qua got a lot of options for scoring pretty well.. it doesn't mean i want to do it. that fight is fucking torture with hoh
fr hoh patch was torture for me not having vv
oh i was talking about vv lol
well yeah ranks are expected on special supply, may as well not even pull on those if you're not going ss
even if this patch didn't feel like it was a good investment, it certainly was on hoh patch and im betting it will feel like it in fire patch too <:Deadge:966011458691416124>
yeah <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
that'd be so  cool lol
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
yeah idk i think 463-4 is best case for qua whale <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
we dropped how much d for heph?
yeah im sure that'll happen <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
i feel the roto is never the same thanks to d but you're right once you've done it once its never as bad as the second go
yeah so you're learning 3 different rotos that wek <:dead:808739535419998239>
what is riku rank
thats a lot of work
<:huh:966619839307321394>
kinda bummed i wont be around for qua whale, i wanted try it with hoh <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
yeah my hfs is s0
im sure the moment i go out of town i'll get put in one of your brackets
<:KleekPoint:998911499315728404>
hopefully you dont have to try and i get another slack bracket.. last time i had such a slack i only did it once with hot and still +100
oh yeah ive never tried ot min max it <:kekL:939008918640787476>
sushang wont be bad, its not hard with my hot but it will depend on bracket ig
coz i will be out of town for sushang and qua whale
if you do my fire tank its 3 straight cycles <:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
<:peepoSitGamer:984923819619795034>
im jk i will ofc try my best
what do i look like a keeby <:Peepo_Supreme:847376455625342999>
im prob gonna have to top you up to so i can retain who the fuck retains with a s1 pe <:Peepo_Supreme:847376455625342999>
<:Peepo_Supreme:847376455625342999>
yeah i noticed
i just did the quick lite for now
<:peepoSitGamer:984923819619795034>
gresham you already did your open world tasks so i just need to clear your stages right
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
yeah should b equick
ill just wait for abyss
sounds terrible
ty
oh good
i cant do these 2 right <a:Aware1:962890472152526920> will i have enough?
<a:nsrun_hh:750121625629753415>
yeah i gave my stuff to lumi, it's all alhaitham now
<a:menheraDance:809322717890871386>
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
evn vs kei <:WICKED:897590154691248149>
they were available in the 5.7 mini though
we didnt get them last year
then sometimes i get someone who takes 30 years to ready up and just stands there on all stages
sometimes you get people who try to work with you
might just be easier to sell a kidney at that point
lmfao
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
well have you seen her gresham <:Peepo_Supreme:847376455625342999>

<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
havent heard anything about sn in wt
witch's corridor
no
its 1500 per stamp <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
do you currently have any gold orbs?
<:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
i wish holmes was in exchange
<a:aPES_HappyClap:622096721408950295>
omg lucky bitch
what happened to hua in the new chapter? kevin beat her?
oops <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
is last story chapter for this patch update in cn this week? when we gonna know new valk <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:dalao:959706460789567548>
pin it
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
it took me a full patch to level up klein skills
yea theyre very resource intensive
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
yea is good deal
<a:animenod:814063051854446653>
yeah its a stamp option if you already own her
to get her ss you can skip 3 stamps in bp (assuming you're getting top up)
if you aim for nirv imo ss hos is worth it if you're paladin buyer.. most people now in nirv will have ss+ hos
well i will see how the pulls go
idk for sure tho <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
probably since sn stamps are in supply shop
30 sn stamps is scam
<@148145559897636865> they put hot stamps back in witch corridor for the ones you still missing after the free card
OTHERS
- TOPUP EVENT: In 6.2, topup 648 yuan (~90 usd) and obtain one of the following: Herrscher of Sentience stamp x6 / Stygian Nymph stamp x3 / Ancient Legacy x240, plus Expansion card x1, Focused card x1, SP supply card x1, Ancient Willpower x50
- Added BK stamps, SN stamps and Bella elf to supply shop. Herrscher of Thunder added to Witch Corridor
isnt it sn
nyx is not in the top up box <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
pog i can snipe some sus stamps too then
my hos is 21/150 ss2 right now.. so i would have enough for 3s, right?
i swaer this is the last time i bring this up
so mpe then?
<:dead:808739535419998239>
for dudu elf 3 star is the big one and 4 star is impactful too because it cuts cd? is it worth? <@148145559897636865>
if theyre craftable just put an asterisk next to them or something
i'd want a list of all the stigs in exchange that are useful with an example of their use <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
is irene in exchange? or just craftable?
that'd be great kei
i was thinking sieg m but idk if its used anymore
idk what to get either
<:dead:808739535419998239>
lol

<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
im gonna be like 50 short <:pepehang:419856401310154752>
it must've not notified me yesterday
i did my daily tasks thursfrisat so i def logged in
thats so scam dude
thursday
did i miss a login day
how do you have yours alrady
good lets make it a one and done <:woggers:652740192653934633>
alright time to try this abyss <:dead:808739535419998239>
<a:dalao:959706460789567548>
not mine, my friend, going hard on this lmao
not like more than 5 people on the server are gonna have a 9s mpe team
if 9s mpe beats ss pe? ig? lol it makes no difference to me im jsut asking what the score ranking currently is
ohhhhhhh i get it now lmao
<:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
okie
whats that
look at this baby she's cuteeee
no im not im just curious <:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
are they serious with these mechanics? theres more bullshit than there is fight time
9s mpe over ss pe?
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
?
pe top for vv
thats why i was so pissed off when i saw the release schedule.. its ridiculous. even if by some godly luck you get soe+gear, you still need a ranked sushang and her gear.. and maxxed pris. nirvana speaking anyway. score is gonna suffer without a ranked sushang and geared up hor
very likely, i dont imagine many have the money to play it <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
im bored
yeys
i wish my boss give me the day off, instead he make me work an hour over yesterday <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
thats the only reason i pulled her <:Deadge:966011458691416124> so if shes not bis there ill be pissed
it actually hinders than fight more than helps 90% of the time
lmao
pretty sure even whales dont play this game
<:life:1001518241610485781>
s0 sus ?
i still havent done er this week someone save me <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
<:peepoSitGamer:984923819619795034>
oh i thought it was heph
its ice hov today?
<:Deadge:966011458691416124>
the one gresham shared yesterday?
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
i guess they mean can sss hov kill the boss
<:peepoSitGamer:984923819619795034>
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
just try your best heki <:life:1001518241610485781>
surely <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
theres been no kit leaks today, hoyo most have cracked down. im sure they'll find a way around it in the next 10 hours <:Deadge:966011458691416124>
<:Deadge:966011458691416124>
you can make a profit in card collecting, you can't do that in gacha.. at least not now, who knows what the future holds. i can definitely see a day where gacha becomes more profitable long term
yea
its another form of gambling but if you're into the hobby and know what you're doing it can be seen as an investment as well, i don't think thats the same for gacha
those degen jp cards have some expensive ones too
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
nvm <:kekL:939008918640787476>
yeah idk if its that expensive anymore tho <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
yeah some people will break their cards out of the case and send it in for re-grade and get a better one <:kekL:939008918640787476>
grading companies are just a pure sham honestly, its at the whim of the grader. i have psa 10s that look like shit and psa 8s that look amazing.
the vintage cards were printed by a different company (wotc) so those are the ones that will always be expensive. they can never be replicated and finding them in pristine condition is hard since back then nobody valued the cards, they were for kids.
i have a really big pokemon collection lol its just peak nostalgia, the vintage is always gonna hold value
pokemon does that if you win the tourney, i'd sell that shit for 50k the next day
good luck ruby you can send me some of your prize money
what have you chosen ruby
<a:animenod:814063051854446653>
mood
i know and ty for that <:PES_Hug:493359762042388480>
fr tho if anyone wants to pilot my account this week feel free but no pressure im just being lazy and dont wanna play its stressing me out <:life:1001518241610485781> so i just take a break regardless
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
lmao
<:life:1001518241610485781>
someone permanently pilot my account
im depressed
<:peepoSitGamer:984923819619795034>
i did too.. only one run and i cant be bothered to do anymore
hell yeah brother taxes <:KKona:932813351581540422>
every damn  year i still somehow owe them money
i wish
my dad actually works for the irs
yikes
did they actually pay them? there so many wealthy people in america that just launder their money and never pay taxes
its actualy crazy how much you can get away with if you're wealthy tho
unless of course you're rich then you have the freedom to buy the freedom of the irs' right to do that <:KKona:932813351581540422>
<:KKona:932813351581540422>
freedom for the irs to take everything you have whenever they feel like it
here in america we have a little thing called freedom
ok but thats nothing <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
im debt free <:FuHuaSmug:857524710223904768>
you know why

<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
true shes always sucked <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
damage doko
watching hor hold that weapon active is such a boner killer
just change hor model to sw model <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
you should try saving a full patch for once so you might have a chance at full geaering a support
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
no hak it isnt nice <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i got fucking phoenix from dorm pulls <:Deadge:966011458691416124>
but this says we get 4 per version <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
thats a whole rank per version?
we get 8 stamps for awakened?
yeah thats one version right? isnt that 40?
we get 80 stamps a version?
what is the 80+80+100 gresham
its enough for s0 to ss?
paladin = 60 frags
top up = 60 frags
stamps =
card =
is that 250 excluding buying her card?
i dont think hos is until 6.4 <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
ruby told me this the other day and i forgot already <:Cry:738282530515714079>
okay so how many can you buy
so paladin would get 60 frags for hos
i just checked
its 30 for awakened
like when its awakened we get 40 frags over 2 patches right? excluding the ball shop?
how many frags can we get from hos bp season again?
someone help me math pls
ty ill give it a try tmr!
<:Deadge:966011458691416124>

<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
and then she felt perfect
she was the first valk i said fuck it and pulled ranks on because i tried her at s0 once and was so unhappy i pull for s2

i hear lots of complaining about s0 pe too <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
~~7tr real herrscher of 2022~~
i agree, most blantant money grab
4 new ice valks in 9 months, 5 if you count dk <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>

i wish they timestamp that vid with every fight <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
the originals? i think they were ps
i never played the original games but the story has always been fascinating to me so im excited for this one
yea
right? i think it looks cool
like who thought it was a good idea for to release that news on teh same day? henry is gone, have some liam <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
just cancel that shit
can you believe that
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
the game
did you guys see the trailer for the new silent hill
<:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
<:PES5_Noted:804692177249894430>
i wasnt hanging out with anyone back then and i was still a beginner so i know my perspective is skewed <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329> thats kinda why im asking. i see so much negativity about s0 hoh and my worry is that its more than just the increase s+ players and psy typing, and that it is because she is just weak at s0 crafted with the intention that everyone is going to whale on her. it makes me worry for the future valks if that is the case. <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
yeah nowadays i def see it, but idk if it was that much of an issue back then
<:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
doesnt hfs have something similar in s1 though? but i dont remember people complaining as much about her at s0
is hoh shit at s0 or are there just too many s+
<:Deadge:966011458691416124>
but there is no fun in playing ae <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
give ae dk that makes her function like sus <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
one with a new dk and one thats got the best boobs
we already have 2 ice bronyas though
<:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
but also making a phys img with pe still out there <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
if they did that, i think the mei suit would be just like spa. okay for 3 months and then dead. kiana would be fire and bronya phys so they wouldtn compete with each other
how the fuck that gonna work
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<:PES_Cute:493359762243715074>
and never thought about it again
waht if i just unistalled this game
LMAO
reptar score -100 from cap and still +100 in their bracket <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<a:believer:1018349083800379482>
if they ever did that they'd be nice enough to give us 1 free affix for it
wdym
baaaaaaaaat
no way just like gENSHIN impact?!
too many whales that will just eat anything
ughhh
is pe outfit up
my bet is
bronya - mech phys
kiana - img fire
mei - psy lightening
coz double layer break with fr
i'll cope its mei qua lightning but thats literal cope they wont give me that <a:Madgeclap:911017183478431764>
if its not psy, psy, psy then idk
someone let me know in 5 mins if pe outfit is up or if its another hour
<:Deadge:966011458691416124>
next time we'll see rpc is in 6.3 with new phys mech bronya and it will be phys up and all elemental down
assuming we'll ever see ice rpc again <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
super big brain
it just makes it extra bad that she's psy honestly.. and then make her support s rank and psy as well
they really did hoh dirty
<:Deadge:966011458691416124>
i see
oh idk
did fragile actually get ss or is this someone else's account
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>

did you guys nkow that in honkai lore the elfs are taken to a factory where their feet are melted into their legs to look like breadsticks?
separating lovers = not okay
separating mom/baby = who cares
does nemesis count as mech style? her suit is pretty
im not a fan either
bronya suit gonna look like this
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
nothing new ruby just talking about the new suits
it would be hard to top sw, shes so pretty
the kiana and mei suits will be beautiful.. the bronya one though <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>

<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
oh yeah theres paladin too
cherri i just buy them every week in ER, they stack fast
yeah i bought them in mriage shop
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
dont even need to ult with hoh it just die with sushang <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
i just try g4 ice stage with sushang over hb for the first time
i feel like that would just increase their problems coz aint no way they wanna skip kiamei <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
poor dude struggle so hard when its phys
i hope for their sake we have a new phys dps coming soon
ok good
yea i think so
oh they also have hfs+ae but no raven
phys is only hos ungeared and griseo full gear.. no dps, not even mpe <:Cry:738282530515714079>
yeah they have full aponia team + hot team + hoh team
they already bought turg tb from the shop i think
its a gamble
he really wants her but i mean
and i dont know if they will ever get PE at this point
they wont have enough for that
yeah so it would just be for ER, easy MA clear if they want to, and possibility of a fire dorm buff
although i doubt she will see any gameplay really, they have s2 hfs i think
its really just a lack of options, they like DA but they still want to improve the account. since they can get her full gear + s2 i feel like its teh better option since its possible at least she could get a fire dorm buff and it would at least give another option (in RL) when fire comes back
i told them to full skip because they need to save for other stuff before worrying about dks
they dont have hor <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
even though they have no phys dps i still think she is not worth it without gear
i agree
should they get turg m or DA+full gear or BKE (no gear)
they have turg tb (not m) but their hb is ss anyway and they have full gear sushang
my friend is trying to decide what to do with their balls
is it just ranged or ice up
yea useable but sw top
dont worry its sw boss next cycle time to return to the real boss fight that is the targeting system <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
hoh is the most scam herrscher ever
yeah just take it easy
you mean on my account right
i think you deserve a break this week lol
you malded your ass of on two accounts last cycle
have you tried yet
successfully scammed <:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561>
ok you do my kosma and wolf then
im like 20 pts behind on my own team and you think i can manage a s0 score <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>

ok lets not get too crazy ruby
yeah fr i havent been playing really for 2 weeks lol
we will see how the pulls go
<:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
3* for sure
i am not sure yet
wdym she doesnt deserve it <:susgecoffee:925184722257182740>
culd get hor card from that
are you skipping pe skin?
hor not that bad, dont you get 20 per week? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
hor still prob the better investment rn over ch in ma <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
but that is where you thrive
she doesnt even look that important in THIS patch outside MA
idk how important hor is gonna be after this patch though
ruby swears by 2s1 hor
beware
so <:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
i was watching ziasis pulling on that banner this morning because he went the full 50 without gaining a single stig
its def not worth to speed her then, everyone in nirv will have ss. if you have ana you can just use that until you can craft
is your hor well invested? if you don't whale all the way i don't think spending crystal on the banner for her stigs worth. you can get really unlucky and not even get a stig. i'd at least put a limit to how far you're willing to spend on it if you do. hor boss is MA next week but not until 11/4 in abyss.
<a:NODDERS:1018787916954218516> that's a solid plan
personally i did the full 50 on SOE because i only have enough material to craft one piece. worked out for me. depends on how much you spend on the game though, i don't really recommend it. i guess a couple more pulls wont hurt if you're not going for much else this patch
damn, congrats!
did you already pull sus gear?
what the hell you still have so much xtal
omg nvm i forgot you can buy crystallite in the mirage store
oh well
i wont have hor ready for monday
teh absolute state of my resources now <:OMEGALUL:968951852957859850>
<@370438895965306882> <@148145559897636865> hos will be in bp 6.4-6.5 + 6.2 will have 60 frag top up bonus for her
omg lewd
did you guys know gresham has vv
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
lmao i do that too tet
sorry you've clicked enough - you need to actually play the game now <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
same cherry
actually i lied, i still like to login and click buttons
takes a lot of effor to login
im already there mentally
gresham gonna have to see a spinal surgeon soon he's soon tired from carrying half NA server on his back <a:aPES2_SadGeSmoke:929006632900370483>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<@370438895965306882> explain yourself
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
how come gresh hasnt t5'd my account yet
wait a minute
total fucking waste of time
and i didnt even have to snipe, i wouldve retained anyway
ive done that once before
in nirv some wait until the last 10 seconds <:kekL:939008918640787476>
this is the secret to every dalao strat
just repeat the run for 12 hours straight, at some point you will get a good score
<:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>

you only gonna feel it when you start competing on myriad or top ma score push
if reptar is rl player 2 star dab is fine
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
speaking as someone who has been stuck with 2 star dab for 6 months, i may as well not even have dudu elf <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>
our gresham is t2 AND t3 this week
so you can only do 1
are you able to 3 star 2 elfs with spend event alone <:paimonthink:945212327022702652>
i would prob get klein
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
i will have enough resource to max both pri right
oh my pity worse than i thought <:life:1001518241610485781>

whos streaming the mald monday
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
theyre super strict with their hiring process, like you have to be a certain and age and have a certain look
it is a great career but its hard work
apparently it is very hard dto work for them, you have to go through a ridiculous amount of hiring stuff and then once youre hired youre trained for several months
i have a friend that works for emirates, she moved to dubai and they literally pay for everything. they pay her housing, her flights, her travel money. she's been all over the world and makes bank. <:life:1001518241610485781>
it was a really nice job but it just didnt pay enough
yeah you could tell the guy wasnt thinking straight
i went to amsterdam for my 21st bday, that was fun. i also went all around the carribean, stayed every sandals in jamaica <:life:1001518241610485781>

one of the best jobs i ever had was a travel agent, basically get to travel free <:life:1001518241610485781>

yeah i havent gotten one in awhile
the problem with a lot of tcers is they do not know how to take criticism. they discard any kind of push against their sheets because this is all they have. a spreadsheet. it is their entire ego. poor little guys. <:life:1001518241610485781>
i have never been in kqm they place have such a bad rep
<:kekL:939008918640787476>
im sorry that sucks jsut remember if someone is mean about it they literally living their life on this game and thinking their cool.. for tcing genshin impact.. <:life:1001518241610485781>
ruby make me rotation challenge <:life:1001518241610485781>

<:life:1001518241610485781>
i have some people that can help me if i really take the time but the spreadsheets are intimidating, it look like a different language i have no idea what icd and shit mean
when i first started genshin i thought the only thing that matter is crit dmg.. i was running around with 170% cd and 30% cr thinking i was doing a good job <:life:1001518241610485781>
these mfers got spreadsheets where you can input any character and create one
i want to make my teams work but i never know how to create a rotation
i wish i understood it better
thank god for tcers coz otherwise i would never know what the fuck is going on, sinful gaming fr

skin gaming
heki has already entered retirement
he will have enough to guarantee it but he'll stop at the 9th pull and switch banners
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
surely
it will motivate me to play
pe skin is useful thoguh
heki spending on someting useful? <:Lmao:966624069363597362>
yeah heki will have enough
9.6
kiamei is comin to save us
its okay though
extra
shes exactly what gresham said
if you use weapon active in burst mode you have enough time to shower, go for coffee, and grab lunch before the staff land <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
because she literally moves slower than molasses in burst mode
it actually so triggering to me that you dont even use the full duration of her burst <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
i just suck altogether with hfs if im honest but idc i still enjoy playing with her
i like her but i wont lie.. i like hfs/hot a lot more in playstyle. problem with hfs is i have to use ae. for me rn hot is like the perfect valk, i always enjoy playing with her
i dont like to play her when im trying to brute force
i like to play her when its her boss
she is cute tho <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
i dont dislike playing with her but i find min/maxing her scores really hard
yeah mpe is always mald for me
the only cycle i've lost trophies in so far was kosma and thats because i didnt bother to min/max the score.. if i had i would've also +100 that bracket with hoh
most of it is enough to brute force retain regardless of the boss
plus the higher your investment in valks like hfs/hot/hoh the easier it is to have coverage for the valks you skip too
its better that way.. yeah i suffer on weeks without vv or aponia but i rather go as hard as i can with the valks i love and profit on those weeks <a:dancerumia3_hh:782760380799647745>
i will not have anything for it given cny sounds like it will break the bank
oh well its a pipe dream
i was looking at her ranks, everything after ss looks mid
i would as well
maybe mobi soon
we prob wont get hfs adv until next summer tho
8 patches
she is
hfs adv
i need a cezz rerun
bold of you gresham i assume we're getting nothign but shit spa/mpe banners again
ig will be the same for me but i buy eden skin instead of monthly
yeah you guys let me know your location so i can e-mail you some job opportunities
i havent done the math yet <:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>

klein is so valuable its crazy
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
if shes not run with pe skin ill lose it
thats only because dudu elf hasnt run since 1830
<:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
imagine pulling for ss vv and not klein or 3s dudu i uh <:durandalsmile:973569999757254666>
i thought you had 2 star
oh
i dont agree with your spending level in context
<:huh:966619839307321394>
or am i the whale mentality
kart saying no sounds like whale mentality, does he remember what its like without klein <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
you already have 2 star.. i would get him
we're not getting a lightning elf til cny at the earliest
?
kart said no kelin
just get klein <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
granted i didnt mald for a top score coz i didnt have to.. most of the mobius in my bracket was scoring less already
wolf with hot is really easy
yeah dude even i was surprised

i wish they'd give hfs and senti a new 5 star skin <a:Madgeclap:911017183478431764>
hoh is not that fun as a standalone valk imo i'm talking purely from a subjective standpoint ht and hfs are just really fun and smooth to play for me
hfs and ht are the best valks in the game end of story <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
yeah 100 sp to team on entry
but i need braindead support coz no skilll <:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
this would be the dumbest shit ever
pleasantly surprised <:WICKED:897590154691248149>
yeah me too
like he made for sw
oh wow kalpas even got a hit count shield
yeah
i'll prob just skip that again and continue to suffer in qua
im still deciding on that
oh yeah and nyx adv
sus gear+ss sus+ae ss+sk ss+pe skin+pe ss+4 dudu+hor dk+liu qui <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398> expensive patch
the plan rn is
hope so
im gonna pull on hfs again when she gets a supply
regardless ill be fine with ss0 i just wont be t20 myriad competitive most likley
ig it depends on how much they want to shill her
<a:Walk:1025390261406285874>
hor is like..
hot bosses like bke and rpc rarely appear but shes still very good because its hot
hor kinda seems like a one and done filler deal
its really annoying she's still alive in fire lol like i like hua as much as the next person but this kit like 100 years old
you really think they might give ae a dk? idk
so i'll just get her bundle and spend that currency on sn in 6.2 instead <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
i have like 9.5k
i dont have enough supply shards to get her there from that shop
i think its like 50 <a:aPES2_SadGeSmoke:929006632900370483>
so since ae is looking like she's gonna continue her grandma ass gaming into 2023 i'm gonna skip ss1 hor and get ss ae next patch instead <:Childpeepothink:920083702090969118>
<:peepoSitGamer:984923819619795034>
i know i meant as u find new ones<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
share vids u think r worth seeing
does s0 pe even exist in myriad <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:Prayge:968951880623484928>
ITS HAPPENING.. HOT/HFS DOUBLE DPS META <a:dancerumia3_hh:782760380799647745>

yeah it had been awhile for me too
<a:aPES_FatEat:625255082405134336>
mid <a:aPES2_SadGeSmoke:929006632900370483>

fr such a bully
<a:aPES2_SadGeSmoke:929006632900370483>
sorry cherri
i really want to but ruby told me i cant
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
and i think she'll be there in 6.4
are you in a rush
i would not waste the currency on nyx when chances are like 90% shell be in bp
it always does when you cant buy packs
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
so total currency we can get is 2820
why are you getting nyx over sus stamps
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
rip asterite and tickets but whatever
the estival one
<a:dancerumia3_hh:782760380799647745>
ITS OVER
I DID THE EVENT
it will be so awesome if hot/hof get to play same team for max score
i need to see an optimized setup coz this looks shit <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
ae <:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>

lmfao now this dude says he can T1 with right account so karto tell him to beat styx with his account <:Lmao:966624069363597362>
it settled with fragile being kind enough to tell him he's going to record a run in nirv this week just for him <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
ask gresham, he is the one the funds my pulls <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>

have to wait and see
in most situations
marg on eden is a joke
i havent seen him say this but im not surprised at all if he did, i have seen him say that he admits to doomposting it back then
he did doompost, he self admittedly says this himself though, he takes it back now
yeah he literally has such poor social skills but he knows this and doesn't care and yeah he is a really good player so idk why anyone thinks its good idea to get into the kind of argument with him <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>

<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
i cant even tell if hoh damage is just average or if its because everyone has ranks on her that it looks average
<a:Walk:1025390261406285874>

i just know i need a new mech
actually i dont care if kiana is fire
my ideal would be qua mei and fire kiana <:Prayge:968951880623484928>
need hfs adv
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
they're going to shill fire weather with dated valks in high temps <:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099> lots of vv and ranked hfs
but also if thats true
that's true.. maybe bronya will be the filler new dps like vv before mei/kiana comes
im guessing 6.2 is gonna be ai chan + fire elf and then we're going to start seeing the trio suits but like.. if they're releasing ai chan in 6.2, i dont know how 6.3 can be anything but kiana <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
someone like mobius
last gen ended with hoh
good riddance
dead valk let her die

klein
she dies so easy
yeah its a tough fight
i tried for hours myself and could not get anywhere near the score i saw on myriad i think i was like 75 or something off? idk but yeah im sure youre right its enough to just retain depending on bracket
when you get to nirv you can answer that yourself <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ty tet
exactly
dudu elf
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

dude they better give glb a dudu elf rerun next patch
<a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287> there werent any in my bracket and just one in myriad (The whale)
im sayin
new players arent in nirv unless theyre whale
everyone has hfs
idk about that one chief
3s hos 4s dudu elf
eris got a decent score with her but that was whale team investment
<a:Walk:1025390261406285874>

3 weeks in this game is like a death sentence <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>

we'll see about that <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
i said 6.1
heki gonna pull vv and then cny patch is gonna say new trio suits qua dead <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>

who cares about that shop anyway
it lasting forever
this patch is so ass
oh gosh gresham, i'm such a dummy player, i can't do anything well..... i really want this nirvana retain but i'm just so bad at the game! i saw your big and impressive score in myriad, you don't think you would..... pilot my account, would you?
gresham you got a really great score on myriad, you're so talented.. wow, i bet you can't do that on my account? or can you? you should try and find out!
gresham im only a rl player dw
anyway anyone wanna do my abyss
so true to real life swordswomanship

there are people in wfp tc that reset abyss for hours trying to get a speed run record <:Woke:759887282042830889>
genshin cons lean more and more toward opening new comps/playstyles for your favorite character, it's not as much about the dmg as it is being able to play your fave with more comps and playing them in a different way
c'mon keep it realistic
maybe if we can get 50000 mill we can get a cool skin genshin
guys we need to pump these numbers up
en dub haitham is ass
you wouldnt understand, youre not american <:KKona:932813351581540422>
what are the chances we get a new phys sp in the next 6 months lol
hodou nothing a yatta can't solve
what did you use on jk for that run? <:Childpeepothink:920083702090969118>
<a:gaylaof:959722007153483816> <a:gaylaof:959722007153483816> <a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>

<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
i didnt forget anything <:worrymad:987990517453303820> i'm just saying in THIS context it wasnt smart of me to advise that because i can't see into the future.. and if i could've seen into the future i'd known that MPE would get a bigger buff and my friend would be without a phys dps. i told them the same thing when the arena changed that shes always valuable to due to share skill
im so glad i didnt make this move when i started, people told me the same hting
no that's fine, i think they just want to be able to retain/promote in rl so they can compete with their good teams on the weeks they can in nirv <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122> like rn they want to be able to plan their nirv bouncing but they cant
its partly my fault, i told them to when they started back when we still had 2s arenas
they 3s'd le first <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
they started like 4 months ago <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
<:Childpeepothink:920083702090969118>
or swords
they dont have paga tho
idk maybe youre right
i think another problem is they dont give her much to fight.. theres too many better options when the bosses are jizo/img every time
i never see her used as dps anymore even rl
yes
we'll know whats coming in 6.2 before the banners but if its only a fire sp then thats 2 full patches theyre suffering without a phys dps
theyre in rl they just want a physical option
they're a dolphin but their currency conversion rate has not been kkind to them recently so theyre trying to avoid paying more at all costs
is it really worht it for them right now to invest in jk over a phys dps? when they probably can still retain their hoh weather with hb for now (assuming they're not fighting a ss jk), work on ranking their jk, pull pe+Gear now, pull jk gear on the next run
they dont have hor
thats another thing
so any phys weather sets them back
but they literally have no phys dps
yeah its still a big risk
and swords will be off rate on pe gear
they have hos they just dont have swords
they don't have a phys dps. they don't have hos gear. they have full hb/hoh/rc team. should they go for sushang gear or should they get pe+gear?
my dolphin friend is having trouble deciding:

since when SN is in wt??
what?
i dont think they will give anymore fire dorm buff <:Childpeepothink:920083702090969118> there's already a lot so DA will prob be elemental dmg taken or tdm hopium
who should be added to dorm next? DA/nyx?
i need to do GK too but im so fucking far off from that
i did bn first, shes done <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ice is dead next year, better invest in fire <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
same
then vk
i'll do her when im done with kmb
yea i noticed
this time next year i will have max dorm buff and probably not playing anymore pog <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
vk = 217 (25 per week - 225 al - 9 weeks)
br = 100 (15 per week - 210 al - 7 weeks)
meme = 250 (25 per week - 225 al - 10 weeks)
6s = 250 (25 per week - 225 al - 10 weeks)
36 weeks for max dorm buffs
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
let me do some math rq
vk, br, 6s, meme, and bn are the dorm buff valks that take disgustingly long to rank up right?
its not worth it tet
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
they perma changed it

so sad my 3s doesn't have any advantage over lesser ranks with better dorm <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
not worth the extra 5 pts i just really wanted to know if i was doing something wrong or it was down to dorm
your rotos look clean to me
thats crazy that my attack cant even compensate for lighting buffs
good to know
thanks for asking around and trying it out yourself last night though

he just talks about how the stuff said about neffr is misleading and fragile is abrasive but just being critical and why even bring up TRL at all when the beef they had was back in april and TRL apologised.. then he talks about plans for his future content

neffr the noob know your place
dont invest hoh, suffer for 2 patches and invest in new trio dps <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
and nobody cares about current patch anyway, with this game its constantly looking toward the future <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
so many variables and so many things constantly changing
yeah exactly
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
omg im so <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943> rn
it is so hard to break into that part of the community where you can actually *learn*, for a long time marisa was my only source of learning too (and keeby) - and it wasn't until i started becoming more active and meeting people like you who introduce me to more higher tier players that i really start learning how to play competitively. marisa is a good source (or rather one of the few sources of info that is easily accessible) for beginners. this really sucks too, i wish the community was not this way, but that's just down to being in such a relatively small gaming community. it's funny because fen himself goes on about this sometimes, how gated the knowledge is for most players, which is why his 3 hour vid is also good - but also not, because it would've been a lot more productive to actually edit this video if the intention was not just to shit all over it but provide good feedback for the community. i'm sure that was his intention, he just got lazy with the editing. it's just unfortunate.
okay but like also
yeaaaa
i love these chatting responses like, marisa you're the best you helpled me get out of a2 who the fuck are these people to even speak on things they dont know about <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943> 
neffr really doesn't give a shit, fragile is bothered understandbly so lol
its where at least half the community drama originates, with ccs (in genshin comm)
yes <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
in comparison to genshin community, honkai is absolutely drama free
know your place <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:BaalHug:883229376613855252>
thats fine, i use LE/AE just so i can ult when i enter the floor but its not a make or break thing, plenty of people prefer AE/BR for the dmg
are you ulting as soon as you start the floor?
i see
no vv core <:Tericross:1002795340304486471> you dont need 4 ely signets, 2 is enough, 3 is optimal
i like mariso and, just like we were having this discussion earlier this week, i think they get a undeserved hard time in the community but - you‚Äôre the biggest content creator in the community. criticism and  ‚Äúhaters‚Äù comes with the territory lol i uh.. yeah
<:kekL:939008918640787476>
<:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
you're a vv abuser

me trying to manage senti sp
no sp on senti for second rot zombie <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
at least my bracket is struggling too lol
klein.. the bane of greshams existence
lots of people in NA are on break too
ffff
also.. they're not spearing here, they're acctually doing a full rot. i will try that coz i've just been spearing myself
this is so weird coz i def see a lot of refs too where they dont have to do this
literally HOW their score is higher than mine. someone fucking explain it to me
ice has 3 star dudab right
the only one i saw with small rot on spear after is ss mpe and 2 star du dab
this fight is easy imo if you just have the dmg which i dont <:PU_PepeStare:754828598786916472>
fucking mibobo
they dont even have an elf supply rn
then where. is the. supply.
i really need trophies this cycle since i'll be losing 400 next week
its like the blind leading the fucking blind in here rn <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
gres cant even help himself rn tet
im missing 8% phys dmg from dorm <:Tericross:1002795340304486471> that cant possibly be the difference between 615 and 780+ though like wtf.. my elf is also only 2 stars
weirdly the dmg is better in my runs using griseo lead
i really dont understand how theyre doing so much more than me
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
t2 says everyone is playing ow2
im a pleb

tet let me know when you're done with gresham abyss so you can do mine
<a:believer:1018349083800379482>
should i save this currency from now until sushang? <a:aPES2_SadGeSmoke:929006632900370483>
had no idea that was a word
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
that would be nice <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
if its a herrscher augment it will be some form of gacha
did they just not spell this right or is it supposed to be estival lol
just cope one of them is free/farmable
<:WhalePat:607373633056407605>
she is part of the soon to be dead trio <a:Madgeclap:911017183478431764>
the question you wanna ask yourself is do i wanna suffer now or suffer later? suffer for 2 full patches to profit on trio or invest more into ice to have coverage for the next 2 patches and spin the wheel on your trio team <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
pog can brute force <:woggers:652740192653934633>
BRUH
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
how long did it take you
the tower one lol
<:Woke:759887282042830889>
i need to do the event
yall can unlock the bridge now?
WAIT
next patch way too expensive on resources goddd
i really need to be saving these affix mats for fucking hor and sushang <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
<a:believer:1018349083800379482>
good enough?
<a:believer:1018349083800379482>
is this trash should i keep going
ughgugh so sad
i imagine my s reduc on this one is better than the sps tho ?
should i take the first one and re-roll on this one instead?
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
kill me
seriously?
<a:believer:1018349083800379482>
i dont wanna reaffix
is it that important
it'll take 300 years for a f2p to get ss2 fr
i dont see the point in farming FR *over* mpe/sushang. gaming mouse does just as much as she does, if not more. <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
hot is like.. you can get very far with skill level at lower ranks. look at fucking fragile. they were destroying even 3s hots in nirvana. you need to know how to play her and most people, especially in RL, don't know
lmao
<:wtfisthis:961278268923859094>
why are you concerning me heki
s2 is plenty good enough for RL tho
s2 i think
yes everyone gets a paga m
<a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
if only
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
here tet you can have one of my m's <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
use carole first and then try sa i think.. or if you have at least s rank gris you can put 2/4 carole on her and try that
tet i would try your mpe first
you guys definitely will not be the only people in RL without paga or cezz
try every option
<:dead:808739535419998239>
not even carole?
seems a waste not to use your mpe though tet
worth a shot if its all yo ugot
d is like +10 now
paga m?
do you have griseo gear?
i mean not just as good but doable
isnt candy mei newt just as good
and i did it with a lvl 55 ss0 ely and was top of my bracket
it was one of my first
i did this fight in RL after i broke through
actually
mpe is just one fight and you have pe to cover img, next patch will be full of ice and considering your hoh is already on life support gear and you're skipping hor dk, i think you should max koe
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122> this is gonna be a mald fight for sure
my only advice for f2p is just hoard. hoard everything. only pull on supports. prepare for the new trio dps. idk what i can say besides that. pulling on a srank dps as soon as you start isn't going to kill your account, but its not the smartest thing to do when by the time you finish out their supports theres most likely gonna be a better dps to use that with.
lmao
<a:believer:1018349083800379482>
if you're new and f2p i cant say getting 2 dks i can't use is going to be my priority <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
can you even give f2p advice in this game beyond just suffer <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
assuming not f2p <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
and this assuming the new player actually has hor
unless you skip sus gear and just use turg from bp ig
is hor new dk that cost effecient though when you need her new set + dk + sushang + sushang gear?
invest pardo, eden, griseo, hos, pick up fire support in 6.2 > profit from new trio suits <:kekL:939008918640787476>
imo you skip ice completely and start investing in fire <:kekL:939008918640787476>
yeah she is so expensive for what i think is not worth the return *for a f2p*
im surprised too that nobody ever talks about the real reason to avoid investing aponia (in my eyes) is because a) hot is just the better choice between the two and b) if you have hot or you eventually pull surprise pull her from dorm - hot will want that handel set. so your affixes on eden or hot are gonna bungled unless you craft two sets and who in their right f2p mind is ever going to have the resources to do that
it will be back to MC meta for sure
tbh i expect all ER valks to be dead by this time next year (outside of some of the sps)
exactly
if you want to look to the future, only consider investing your supports. wait for the right valk for to complete the team.
yeah definitely, it's always a pull the latest valk at this point
and fen hates ER. every single time mobius viability comes up, he has to say how hard mobius carries from the start of ER until now. like there are not a plethora of other valks that can do it just as fast and easy now - even f2p valks like pardo. he just refuses to learn how to do ER. 90% of the time i'm watching him do ER with a different valk, he's still playing this valk like it's mobius, choosing the same signets every single time. <:kekL:939008918640787476>
oh he definitely does
anyway, nevermind, he goes further into it and concedes around a tier
i like discussions like this, especially if new people are taking the time to watch and learn, but so much of this commentary is coming from such a biased perspective to begin with. and the reaction to mobi getting an S-, i would say S is like..? why? mobi was a very solid valk for a year, but i'd hardly place her in S tier at this point. her coverage gets smaller with every patch.
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
just get sk from the box then <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
aren't you getting pe skin?
if they ever add her to er, sure
so weird
its been going around a lot lately
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
yeah me too <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
you fookin whale gresham
just a PSA for everyone here
isnt it like 20 im 6.2 and 20 in 6.3 <:deadge:975652771082698782>

if you end ult early you want to just weapon active until he dies but idk if you have enough dmg with your gear
i think you shold have weapon active if not, would've been faster than doing a whole nother roto
did you force early end the ult at the end?
i wish i could help
okkk im sry
but i cant help much coz i cant see much :(
you can save more time in execute

if you repeat the fight long enough you will earn what works better and what doesn't, and you'll start to go faster.. its just how long do you want to play the sim <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>

very fun
should i upgrade them? or just wait until i finish the story to upgrade a few
f i didnt know there was one
i dont want to ignore them but sometimes i just cant get into the mood to do it no matter how hard i try
ill just do enough to get the outfit crystals and bridge on this one
i only need to do like the story part of it to claim the bridge right?
surely i'll be able to finish it.. im gonna start it soon.. maybe <:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
the tower defense event
tyty <:BaalHug:883229376613855252>
well i have at least started it but.. im wayyyy behind
lmao glad im not the only one
thank you sooooo much keilao <:BaalHug:883229376613855252> <:BaalHug:883229376613855252>  <a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>

side stage is rough for some people i think <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
300 imaginary dollars <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
who can i pay to do this event for me
cat is invuln when shes in combo mode, so i just wait until i see it and start spinnning
the one that covers the room, the last one in transition
i just do it by memory now lol
great camera movement
me either
you wanna ult with hb as soon as you start spinning with cat.. hb will fill more than half the meter and cat will complete it when she drops ult
ye
you mean anyone can freeze and restores 10?
what team are you using
i kept getting so frustrated because when i would get a perfect freeze hoh wouldnt have ult but when i didnt she would have ult ready.. its because cat was the one freezing. bastet b gives that sp to her when she is the one freezing it <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<@370438895965306882> you know what i realised lol
its really just making sure you get hb off ult first so you freeze with megatron
i think i finally got the hang of it
im watchin people struggle in eu rn with s2 getting around 740 <:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
are you s2? i cant remember

just fire tank?
wait which one is this <:Childpeepothink:920083702090969118>
damn thank you! i'll send them this
they just have to get through sk rl
they want to compete on aponia boss in nirv
yes
they have full aponia team and clock is after sk so it would be better for them to slack this week
what about red lotus?
i'll just tell them doubt
helpful as always ruby <:Like:825753333104902174>
in nirv
can you do elemental and clear her?
my friend is trying to figure out if they should promote on SK cycle
hey
444d? lmaooooooooo
i laughed at this last time but then i ended up seeing some scores with it on myriad <:clown:682697993958326290>
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
managing spa/ae/raven sp in that fight makes me wanna commit
when bronya mech suit releases: andrius has been changed to lightning down -100% +50% phys up
type counter in that temp has to hurt a hell of a lot more than it does in MA
doubt
im not even touching it when it comes back this patch
if i malded that? i have ptsd from that
oh hell naw
how'd that go
does she cover anything outside qua?
i am not saying vv is a bad valk, shes at least ss+ tier rn but for me (this is JUST ME) a valk needs to be good at more than just her weather to be ex tier, wide coverage is important. thats why i think someone like PE is better than soemone like VV.
let me explain
mpe doesnt exist below 3s <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:kekL:939008918640787476>
including vv kosma
mpe can cover more than vv tho
kosma is hot boss
i have 10% phys dorm <:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
i'd consider it if she could do literally anything in ma
lms <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i have max tdm but idk what my phys is
3s and idk her attack but she has okay affixes, i dont think her attack is the problem
im still out here working with 6% dk <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
mine does no dmg and idk if its because i need more dorm buff or skill issue
<a:believer:1018349083800379482>
maybe im bias coz of skill issue, i never can seem to get her niche scores to work <:ReallyMad:971219475045154856>
true and basd
because she doesn't top score many but she can save your ass from demotion in *a lot* of different fights if you don't have the shill valk.. but.. the amount of investment needed is through the roof and the strats required are far from easy <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
for me its like.. idk its a weird one
<a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
do you guys agree with mariso rating of MPE on that vid <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
you guys affix your newts? <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
<a:Madgeclap:911017183478431764>
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
clearly
you know the last time andrius was here, i think i scored 200 something <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
10/10 is an uninstall week. i'll finally be free of this game. <a:PU_PeepoLeaveExit:855157057887535164>
the couple times i did it i hated it
yea
and its gonna be fucking mald with hfs or spa
my score is dependent on mald meter, i dont wanna mald
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
i'll be takin mass L on doom as always <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
speaking of, its pig this week
i really like her shes fun to play with on 3 times a year you get to <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
probably
i used to really hate the ganesha side stage and that other ignite one but since i got DA it feels like RL <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
and eden qte across the room and gather half the enemies in the wrong direction
the annoying part for me is how spread out they are
its rought for hfs even with full gear at these temps
oof <:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
is it full 12/12 team?
you using hfs?
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
ah yes
whats the stage?
same thing for the img cycle.. no PE for side stage? gl <:Copium:834822065231364156> i tried it without PE and i could clear but just barely
yeah i struggled with it myself
yeah its true
like dkeys/db can change an account in such a big way, i notice i don't struggle so much if i don't have the meta valk - like yeah, I DO STRUGGLE, but i can *clear* in nirv if i don't have the shill valk, but i take my friend's account who has little to no investment in account buffs and when they go nirv - they cannot even complete side stage if they don't have the meta valk. in some of those cycles its like you need one or the other, the shill valk, or enough account power to brute force it
yeah because in this game everyones account is at a different power level and experiences vary vastly
just a lot of the reactions im seeing are lol vv? im doing fine without her! like yeah, i'm sure you're doing fine without her in RL and below but nothing mariso said on her card wasn't true. she dominates qua weather atm and that's not really the point. if mariso had chosen better wording to something like current valks in the meta instead of tier list 6.0! it works a lot better as just a general education video insteado of trying to rank them
<:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
yeah i wish that there was better content for honkai like there is for genshin but its just impossible to structure it that way, the meta is too fast paced and literally any teir list can boil down to just pull for latest valk <:kekL:939008918640787476>
yeah exactly and they say in vid multiple times this is strictly for 6.0
they even reach out to other lao advice for this one
i dont either but people will ask anyway, mariso always seems to get so much shit for everything they post but they genuinely seem like they want to put out content people want to see while trying to do their best to provide general answers
it looks fine to me
idgi whats so shit about it?
did you guys see mariso's new vid?
yeah i get it
so stxy did get highest score with 842
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
840?
idc im just curious coz he crops off his fps on refs lol
<@180679257851166721> do you remember who topped myriad in sea on ice rpc?
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
i thought he was eu
is aka sea?
i know im js i dont think aka had top that week
in eu
i think someone topped aka too
but by the end of the day he got 842
841
tka topped his score on sunday
no
it was like 842
ice rpc
abyss
like further than cap i thought
really? he got the highest score on that last hoh cycle though
<:PES2_FrenchThink:929006658154299462>
<@148145559897636865> <@370438895965306882> do you guys know, is styx fps scammer? i notice on his refs he crops off his fps from the vid <:kekcry:973697358799978626>

dude my mpe do no dmg
honestly if vv looked fun to play i'd grief myself and spend more but she doesn't even look fun.. id just be spending for one stupid boss in this game
one day... bp <:life:1001518241610485781>
i cant honestly, i rather just suffer and invest in the new trio
do i have to make sure all 3 of those ads have paga on them? lol
idk man.. i feel like this always happens when theres a mpe strat like this.. she does no fucking dmg
yeah... no <:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
okay switchin teams <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
i didnt know that
ahh
how is that this team can score so much higher than hoh?
at least ss
nah
actually our highest now is 708
oh
472
same temp
but yeah
coz our highest right now with mpe is 701 i htink with keeby
mpe best score is like 699 on what temp was that again

go pull dorm
idk if the effect still goes out orn o
yeah i remember i had the same problem the few times i used her
isnt it just qte in and evade
yea they are the same so far, like exatly, and i expect hoh to get more next patch considering all the ice release
i dont think im gonna have time given this abyss cycle.. idek if i'll have time to do kosma <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
yes pay attention to him walking around the room for 30 mins while you wait for an attack that you miss by a mile anyway <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i honestly thinking same lol
fr tho i havent because i havent been able to successfully break all layers
not really
dude i cant even finish the boss
<:PES_CryComfy:643089269375762432>
i was doing it for hours yesterday even with the sound on and i just could not get the hang of it
thanks kei
what a whale
i noticed keeby on myriad with a ss senti today
;(
i still am not able to collapse all 3 layers
isnt everything kosma does qua
IT DOESNT WORK
and explain tona and kosma
an instructional on how to collapse
you know what video keebster should do
eu myriad 
I KNOW
its so bad
sry was afk for a sec <:Sadge:968951892598210600> <@370438895965306882>
and really im just jk i do wanna watch
that was before i knew you were suffering <:ReallyMad:971219475045154856>
where is the stream gresham <:ReallyMad:971219475045154856>
<:ReallyMad:971219475045154856>
only if its no vv tho <:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
yes
wtf is the purpose of that? what am i supposed to do?
where it creates the circle and there are like 4 little crabs around you throwing balls
that qua side stage
im at 3300 rn
how long would it take me to lose enough trophies to go back to RL <:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
<:worrypat_hh:770947099607957514>
i still dont like that team tho <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
god imagine replace ae and not raven <:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
im just gonna get hor and cope ae goes to wt soon
ae needs to go to wt already
i think so
or get 10 stamps iirc
you can buy ae, hor, fr, or mpe
those bchip packs
theyre getting ae for anni though assuming glb gets those packs.. after next patch they will be in good place
with no AE or aslaug <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
at least they have s1 hfs now though
i would've told them to reset the account but they pulled big brain move and spent on starter supply for 2 hfs thinking it was like genshin pity, the next gaurantee would be hos <:WICKED:897590154691248149>
pulled DB 3x for their first dorm pulls <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862> no i am not lying
hope they get lucky because they literally never do
its lucky for them swords is on off rates for sushang
and if their pulls go well they will get pe
so thats their plan
i told them their next pick up needs to be sushang gear + hos gear
tbh i hate to tell them to craft anything, they're dolphin, i rather them save resources for other better craftable gear and just suffer more the next few weeks <a:Thinktastic:479509259684413450>
pba?
i think at the time i just used hos as the dps
yeah there were some weeks i relegated in dirac sea when i didnt have hos but as soon as i got her i never had trouble with it again
i went fire > lightening > phys.. but back in my day i was living in dirac sea still and my candy mei newt hos and shui sa did plenty
only ice/lightening is built
its literally all they have, they just have nothing for phys right now
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
probably a
i dont even wanna ask
is that craftable
yeah no ely
if my friend wanted to do this start but has no gear, should i just tell them marco on hos, cezz on gris, and.. what you think for carole <:thinkmad:589955260391620618>
tyyyyyyyyy <:BaalHug:883229376613855252>
<:PES_Clown:619847304756592653>
that was easy
oh nvm
hos only got 100 sp when she goes in
how bro
lemme try this roto
ok
i have none of this gear lol
uuh
thanks
but i may have been doing something wrong coz i wasn't sure if i was doing something wrong so hos has enough sp to ult as soon as she comes back in
when i was doing it i was just having trouble going faster
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
im not fuckin doing that
do you need 3s hos for 946?
but im at 840 anyway
i forgot
you had 893
oh wait
no im doing same as you
i did mine like wednesday or sth and gave up on 840
i lost it tho
yeah
kk
<@370438895965306882> u still working? i need help on kallen too <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
im not sure really, i imagine most teams can do it if you have a fully geared team and do your research.. but if you have lack of options/gear i imagine its difficult
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
uh decent???? thats not decent? that's like t100!
and i was like im looking for like 733+
and like 3 people replied with 31kish scores

maybe i just need 1 more
you think so?
fuck
ill just do one
its just 1 10 pull
<a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
i just need 4 cards in 1 10 pull
it shouldn't be hard
pulling 3s hos rn will make me feel better
shut <a:Madgeclap:911017183478431764>
so i put hot on bke
im trying to go the easiest route
T1 <:kekL:939008918640787476>
it doesnt matter how many ranks i buy, i aint doing all that
what the fuck is this hoh strat on kosma give me a fucking break <:kekL:939008918640787476>
ossok ty
<@148145559897636865> halp with hot ma?
<a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
you guys are really making me excited for this boss <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
lmfao
are we surprised <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
is there a ref for that run gresham?
her adv still up for another hour <:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
i wish i had 3s senti
omggg
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
gresham when you do my account, you don't have to use mobious
not before you do everyone's kosma <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
seems like he does what he wants when he wants
kosma has attack patterns? news to me <:PU_PepeStare:754828598786916472>
if the fire support was qua, people would literally jsut run hfs <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
a new fire support at all will help her regardless
they're not gonna give vv 2 free layer breaks
thers no shot in hell the fire support is qua
i hope its easier with sushang than hb but doubt since the only hard part is the crabs <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
im annoyed benares is back
im curious to do sk but also worried, last time i fought her i did well but i was in RL <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
im kinda over this patch alrd its a struggle jsut to login.. im so behind on everything
its not even open yet <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<@370438895965306882> i know as a true honkai lao, you're curious to know what fighting kosma without vv is like. so, i send you this offer: you can try it on my account. i will let you mald until 750+ score. take your time and let me know when you're done. <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
daaamn lol imagine
<a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>

<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
<a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
oof that is rough
fr your lobby sounds ugly
i remember for couatl people used to use siegfried m instead iirc.. but that was a freeze strat for bastet <a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
im gonna wait to craft it to see if theres better option for our lower temp
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
for the mpe/hos/ss strat yeah
let me check my mats......
i just realise i need to craft tesla t for kosma cycle <a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
they waited too long for finisher in execute as well, could've saved a few points there
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
are you going to get her stamps from spend event?
watching the hoh run tho it still could be better <:nerdge:980201016853164144>
wow ss no less <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
the one cycle you dont have to try for <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
imagine gresham getting a slack bracket <:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
wow i placed second in my bracket.. im loving these sleep cycles <a:dancerumia3_hh:782760380799647745>
as long as you do your best with what you've got, you've done the job <a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
imy hasnt played yet either
idk if theres any snipers in mine
look slack enough
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
761 is good enough for +100 right <:WICKED:897590154691248149>
it means PE can just randomly target whatever she feels like perfect <:woggers:652740192653934633>
i love this
oh yeah
oh
<a:modcheck:848583401728507931>

my pe isnt oen shotting no matter what i do
<@370438895965306882> am i supposed to be put candy mei newt on hos in this fight
at least you're safe <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
yay! <a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>
copium delivery
<:PES2_SellCopium:903233568187248691>
look at this emote i just found
ruby said they would fund you
my best advice would be getting some more ranks and gear <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
i have nothing to contribute
im watching it now but what the hell is this aspect ratio tet <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
<@370438895965306882> does the character holding shui need to qte for the bonuses? or just any qte in team?
and its easy to retain weather usually
theres something about pe fights i just dont like to mald for score
i havent done it yet but just like every PE weather i will one and done it <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
hakcer out of metal and there's 2 new pris coming in 4 weeks <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
my friend couldn't even complete the nirv side stages without her <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
it blows my mind
some people swear that PE really is just decent at S0, like i'm pretty sure fragile believed that <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
ruby do you have ranks on your PE?
decent <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
i was referring to ruby's comment on hb vs sushang
what's the verdict then?
its just higher attack and more dmg
yeah i keep seeing people pose the question but no one answer lmao
^
honestly doesn't matter coz sushang gonna replace her soon and im sure the fights you're using hb you'll now want soe on her <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
its better but thats only if you're sweating for score, cb19 is still just fine
jk they will all be psy <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
kiana - fire img
mei - qua lightening

cant afford a new dk since im f2p, new kiana will use judgement of shamash, its practically the same thing <a:believer:1018349083800379482>
just candy mei newt its basically the same thing <a:believer:1018349083800379482>

do you only need the m piece
<:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
where is shro m used?
ah i see, as long as its for one specific fight and not the new meta <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
we wont know until you try <:WICKED:897590154691248149>
just do it tet <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
are you talking about sushang or hos? coz if its about the newt b that person responding to me assumed newt b was on sushang for no reason
<:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
<@370438895965306882> hows your bracket look this cycle? are you still bending over for the myriad players <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
wait am i losing my mind i dont see newt anywhere now <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
idk why
i noticed too in hieu's beta videos some fights had newt on as well
does anyone here know the real answer
idk why i ask this question here
i can already tell this is gonna be a bloody duel<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
i do some math.. so if sushang gear+hor dk releases same day. that is:
800x torus
1040x metal
300x nanos
3,500,000x2 coin for priarms
138x phase shifters
36x sakura wills

ofc her sss is good but thats a pipe dream without adv
she did say ss1 is good stop pointing, just want to make sure im in the clear <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
<@180679257851166721> i decided to do ss1 hor <:terifrownarms:959782410843742228> can i stop here or should i keep going?
<:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
my friend should be promoting to nirvana for the first time next cycle.. they don't have PE <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

<:ReallyMad:971219475045154856>
that doesnt stop a real malder
<:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
you could be 1
keep malding carv
omg lmao <a:Madgeclap:911017183478431764>
omg summer lite again <:woggers:652740192653934633>
not everyone in nirv gets ranks, pretty sure darius still does myriad
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
im too based for that, rather take the L 3/6 weeks and see a pretty profile
i mean thats how all truly competitve people should play
does darius ever go ranks?
yep, its just keilo, keilo, and keilo that has s0 in nirv
like 3 people have s0 hoh in nirv though, hor will be a great replacement for skippers
we were ahving this conversation yesterday in maincord, someone was saying that hor can beat hoh at her own boss but they were using 3s sushang and the score was not better than hoh but close iirc
can you link it?
is that the one with 3s sushang <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
and it depends on how bald the aponia user is
oh um uh um i htink hot needs ss1+ to match aponia scores <a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287> im not sure tho
2s aponia vs s0 hot?
which one
it depends on ranks
that is really funny gresham, good one
<a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
<@370438895965306882> riku has to be ss+ rght

<a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>
<a:wtf:479509240046682114>
the real point saver is ulting with pardo at the EXACT time you need to for ice pinions.. i got +3 just by hitting that one time
if you can consistently kill those ads quickly
that rpc
you know what
i havent malded a pe boss since 3 patches ago
cata wtf you doin hurry up <a:Madgeclap:911017183478431764>
my hos ss2 now <a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
ty
yeah
my heph score should be better but i cant be bothered
i havent watched any refs on it i just one and done it
its my tank score thats embarrassing
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
i really should just stop and go do ma
hurry i only have 12 hours left to mald abyss<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
sure
one of these days im gonna get all t10 in the same bracket
idk man ive been so lucky with brackets for like 4 weeks straight
<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
you always get the worst brackets
no such thing as no mald boss.. its either hard as hell or its too easy so everyone goes out of their way to make it hrd <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:Madgeclap:911017183478431764>
i really dont understand how people do these glitches like instant hb charge attack using controller <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
bruh like not even considering ely's ultimate animations, its so annoying how if you dont aim shot she does this little twirl.. and if i try to activate ult while she's doing her dumbass twirl it just ignores me <:huh:966619839307321394>
we dont know what heph is gonna need yet at our temps
im missing 4% ice dorm <a:Madgeclap:911017183478431764>
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
but how bad do they want it
840 def possible
<a:Madgeclap:911017183478431764>
yeah with ff
marg has 837 with cb19
but idk if hes fps scam
hes using ff
right now our top score is styx as always with 839
what is top score on myriad using in sea
but getting cezz on the mobs clears it much faster and consistently it outweighs the wait
i have to wait with ff because you need cezz on the ads, with cb19 you dont need to apply cezz on mob so you dont have to wait for cezz cd
isnt it the other way around
im finally getting consistent with 831-32 using ff <:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
i still dont understand kosma's ma fight at all
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
oh wow thank you!

TIME FRACTUREEEE <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
its so frustrating man like ugh whatever
it is.. like even putting aside this disgusting schedule, now we're gonna expect sushang+hor shill the very first week. WITH WHAT RESOURCES?
im so disgusted
silly me thinking we'd get A LITTLE break after elysia, surelyyyy elysia is enough income to get them by for a single patch
clearly
fucking ridiculous man what is their deal? they're really this money hungry?
2 weeks? wht about it?
theres no fucking way
DOR, Sushang, EXPA, and PE skin?
THE SAME WEEK
you're telling me
thers no way
this cant be right
what the hell is wrong with this company
are they for real releasing sushang banner and star of eden banner the same fucking week?
<a:dalaoexplode:959706477151551498>

<:huh:966619839307321394>
<a:aPES4_Noted:838744541497393152>
oh well ill just continue to sit on it, maybe i will roll my spare t for elemental when sk gets here and then roll it again after
but keilo says i need elemental on that one
gresham you think it better to use it on b? my skill cost is pretty good there tho <:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
<a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
its just been sitting there collecting dust for like 3 months
t
i have a spare
do you think i should use that sp affix thing we got last patch on T?
my affixes look like this right now
<@370438895965306882> whats the ideal skill cost rd for senti? and sp/s?
oh does it?
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
sim battle be like
the nature of gacha, you can take the first step of cutting time playing the game but quitting the gacha is worse lol
<:huh:966619839307321394>
everyone quitting or hate the game
<:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
did eris stop playing?
<:A_HuTaoStareIntense:899444164570267648>
and i just want to
my reasoning is simply that she will be in bp eventually
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
its not gonna do anything for me
i will buy the adv cards and use those, no crystals
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
anyone pulling on senti adv in 2 minutes <:WICKED:897590154691248149>
<a:Whale_luma:458386265776193536>
people are trying hard
yeah i was surprised how low my rank was after i finished lmao
i think every time i had to use her on heim i settled for 733 or 840
tbh idk if ive ever even 893 with her
i have honestly never been able to 946 with hfs, im so bad with her
i used this.. i didnt remember its supposed to be newt b not benares <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
i wanted to try hot on tank but im not doing hfs mald on heim lol
yeah i remember the set up im using being mald as shit for 946
im out of attempts today so i will do more tmr, haven't looked at any refs yet
i did
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
idk them tbh it has nothing to do with account share or whatever
<:PES_HandsUpAlt:643089267270221824>
i want to say something but i dont wanna get in trouble for it <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
have they been around for a long time?
what about their own account
what is clicky's acct?
its so gross
<a:Madgeclap:911017183478431764>
exactly
yeah they stop this shill shit, its annoying as hell because what they do is they put the new s-rank bosses in the first 3 weeks and stop.. like, imagine being f2p and having to sloth your way through pulling for 3 weeks and finally get her ready to play and then bosses poof <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
im not that worried about it tbh im sure there will be plenty more on sushang patch
why every hor ref using 3s sus 
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
maybe glb doesnt even get expa and they make the decision for me
im sure someone like neffr would <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
do you have some examples of this? jk/hb/nyx?
how in the world would she not use RC?? doesn't that help with her sp issues?
um what
is nyx acctually be able to use jk?
nyx aint
vv might be getting an even better support soon
at least hot can cope on aponia
thats why i think vv is better option
i agree
i reso'd it <:MeiStare_lum:457797968851107861>
but vv would be a lot more expensive
yea thats my worry that i will just invest in nyx for the same amount of mald and mediocre scores
idk.. i can get her gear free but is it worth spending on her adv to actually get her and rank her up when i could be spending on a vv supply instead
thats the thing i want a qua solution that would cause me less mald
<:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
at s0?
im still trying to decide what to do with 6.0 event currency.. i ahve 2/4 nyx so i could get a verne piece and then use firepower supply for my final verne piece for 4/4.. then pull nyx adv. or i could get a holmes piece and another holmes in firepower. those are my only options really. what you think? <:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
<@180679257851166721>
<a:Aware1:962890472152526920>

<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>

im sorry to be the one to tell you
<:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>

coz they dont let you get two pieces of same set do they
it would have to be one piece
i cant get two pieces can i
oh
is it MA or is it used in abyss? i heard somewhere its only for 3s hos <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
for which fight?
i've no idea what pieces are used on that and where
or is it not worth without the 3 set?
should i get 2 pieces of holmes?
<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
literally just sw off rates <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
gresham just swipe, you have ss vv <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
why would you think i have even a dollar to my name after this patch <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
better than no hohe <:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
ugh yeah im not looking forwar to affixing
<:nerdge:980201016853164144>
what did you end with?
theres not a single name in my nirv bracket that i recognize lol
no this is my first 3s gacha valk that isn't from bp or adv or something
thanks guys <:BaalHug:883229376613855252>
<:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
full gear + 4 s elf + sss and still 50k to spare
i dont have everyone priviledges lol
is it working?
bruhhhh

i still have 45 + 50 cards to pick up in chips
<:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
okay vv abuser
probably <a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
elf ely's gather <:OMEGALUL:968951852957859850>
now thati think about it though, you're right, dendro with it's op reactions and kusanali hitting every single one with an attack sounds p good
she can't be because she's dendro <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
<:blacktophwithfingertoforehead:959706411179343882>

if i see clock on schedule one more time im uninstalling
<:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
im on high copium this is gonna be enough because i cant stand to swipe again, it makes me cringe lol
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
oh i just realize this is No Live, i see them in na myriad <:happypeepo:696051469186498581>
lmao watching this person trying to level their stuff and they're so broke
since i will be getting 3s in less than 50k crystal surely <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
idk let me watch and see how good their pulls are
i'm free <a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
is just being greedy for obvious reason <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
my friend is ignoring dk completely and just going all in on hoh/sushang
actually true though, esp since hor dk seems to be just a literal shill for no fucking reason. we have plenty of shill we're trying to live through right now, why not add in another type counter ice fight after you've invested literally everything you have into your new ice dps <:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
hoh is definitely an expensive valk, the pressure to get her full gear + elf + ss sushang + sushang' gacha gear.. if you're in nirv <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
for smart players, i think it does. personally, idk i think suffering through 6.0 without hohe and getting SS sushang on release while taking advantage of other 6.1 spending goodies and then getting hohe in 6.1 could be a good deal for low spenders
that could be the deciding factor for a lot of people
we will get spending event info tonight
is the play
just get lucky
i see
whats your plan if not
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
anybody with trophies knows not to take maincord advice <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
lmao thats toxic
<:PES2_Apathy:888440873094873099>
embrace mediocrity, game becomes eazy <:WICKED:897590154691248149>
not familiar with them
<a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
show
just use ss sushang <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
yea they are
coookie in my nirv bracket is running beet tm and they outscored my swords <a:aPES4_WickedDash:838744542445830154>
fragile is a freak of nature tho not a real score <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
wth another mihoyo game? they're working over time
soe looks like a total and complete money grab rn <:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
yes, and they would be using sw
who in the actual fuck is going to have a max pri ff for rc dps
stop spreading misinfo <@180679257851166721> <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
that's over -100 from sss sw
i run her with next tb and welt m in er
so stupid
rc dps still uses bastet?
well i have no doubt then triple support team will do fine for hohe skippers
interesting <a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
its rng
doesnt even matte who u use
that fight is always rng its annoying af
<@370438895965306882> what you score with rc on hellmaru
um what? i didnt see any of that in nirv myriad <:huh:966619839307321394>
i have no idea what rc dps is like in comparison
am i crazy or everyone has to start somewhere? now the bar is don't pull hoh until you have full turg and bastet? <:huh:966619839307321394>
someone in beginner help asking if they can pull hoh with 17k crystal and being advised no because no support
paga priviledge + herrscher tmr = no1 cares
<a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>
basic subtraction <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
math <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
hak why you think 75 pity is a good thing <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
telling a gacha gamer to wait <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
did you guys knwo that 12k crystal is only 4 10 pulls <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
you better at least get her weapon hak <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
not worth imo but that obv depends on your account state <a:PU_PepeThinkGe:855158170363232287>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
this fight is just pissing me off
im not doing proper rotations
runs out too quick
when its there
yeah
why is PE's qte so garbage
holy shit i forgot how fucking annoying carole is to play with
how can that half my dmg
that dont make no sense
yes
<:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
i think its time i learn what that even means
how to build stacks <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
<:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
explain
<:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
do i need 4 star durandal or sth
htf i do half dmg?
its like 284 or somethign
i have numbers turned off i forgot
mines not <:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
<@370438895965306882> can s2 pe one shot first ads
the bait isnot out until thursday hak that is still 2 days <:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
this could not look more painful if it tried
yeah i dont think ive ever fought normal otto since ive been in ex tbh
<@370438895965306882> is using VV on husk in ma a thing?
so their solution is to pull ss senti in adv next patch <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
with 4/4 carole+senti but they don't have a dps
this person in maincord right now talking about how they're struggling this cycle
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
the count is for her ammo?
oohhhh
ive fought her in ER several times but i still have no idea what her mechanics are <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
does she have a hit count mechanic?
i'd assume pe will score that
these old bosses are just made for reskins for whatever new suit they're selling
it'll become fire boss again when they start shilling fire
638 with 3S DA lmaoo no thanks
or phys
ice shill for 6 months and then back to lightning

roza is next to himeko
fr the fu hua/senti pose is my fave
my new wallpaper btw <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
is that supposed to be raven on the far left
it would be so nice to have a kiamei team
oh
mc and bb are sisters <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
call it cope but i refuse to believe shes gonna be as good as 7tr
<:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
i am not tryin to farm ss1+ hor
she would love ely and ely would endlessly compliment her, she would ask kiamei to go to gay pride with her <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
sure but mei isn't the jelly one in that relationship <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
:cooking
waiting for kevin to mention elysia in front of kiana so she has a jealous mental breakdown <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
they can surely make a better design that than if you combine the two best girls
way too mid <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
like side by side, not fighting eachother <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
damn if we get simultaneous kiamei suits that means they're gonna be fighting together again soon <:woggers:652740192653934633>
this is just what we come to expect from hoyo these days <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i could totally see them doing that with a kiamei suit though.. use one as bait and then the other for cny
i wouldnt exactly call mobius bait would you <:HoSHmm:979832783562231878>
they would not release kiamei suits right after anni right? right? <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
tbh it would be cool if they did a swap and mei got fire and kiana was img lightning, never gonna happen but purple kiana would be pretty <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
at teh start of the fight hb qte trigger is like 50/50 for no reason <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

paga m
turg cat
this is wiht your fave
oh btw
774
let me see
no wait
she is, ely was just obliterating those shields and it was def higher than 760 something
what is top score for hfs
he changed fights already, im sorry i cant remember what he got, it was high 700s <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
to burst down the mech mob as quick as possible
you know i was watching akayuki stream kasumi fight with hohe/sushang/cat and he was forced to take out ely elf and use wedge because ely elf gather is ass <:huh:966619839307321394>
seems we get enough spend event stamps for straight to ss though
same
6.0/1
gresham what is your plan btw
well im happy with 6.0/1 so far <:PES2_Hide:528554354341576714>
the people who have been playing for awhile, it seems that way.. but there is just a constant influx of new players still
right? how is their inbox not flooded?
mihoyo needs to get off their ass
bruh i cant believe the hacker situation rn
well yeah
v easy week
now that i do its gone a lot faster
i used to never claim my xp if i maxed out my daily crystal lol
because
<:PES2_BedGe:849698641169088533>
one more xp bar until retirement, its been fun <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
SIXTEEN HACKERS?!
<:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
thats what im saying that, in the context of a f2p you would choose between the two. in the context of nirvana and MA you would want both.
honestly just another avenue for more money making on hoyo's end, create niche bosses so people pull every valk, create niche supports so people are forced to pull and invest in more supports. so no, i wouldn't be surprised. they already did it with carole/griseo.
yeah maybe the hole in my wallet
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
its just me continuing to pamper my hohe <:durandalsmile:973569999757254666>
my plan..
- pe skin <:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060> 
- 2s sushang (depending on ranks)
- hor dk
- aponia if we get select
like i would rather have eden guns + full zhenyi before considering ranks on any elf
i think they're over thinking this, personally i would pull ely+gear+elf and see where i'm at before considering ranks on elf. yeah, it's great to have, but they clearly need more gear first.
is there zhenyi supply in 6.0?
you need to remind them they're a new player, it is going to feel like an enourmous amount of pressure the first year to have everything all at once. it doesn't work this way. they will have to go without luxuries.
yea fr if he has plenty for 6.0 he should have no problem in 6.1.. sushang farmable and 2 patches to farm more crystal for her gear
if he started 5.5 he should have no problem saving up for ely <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
is this person brand new?
honestly though theres no need to panic, just get hohe+gear and farm sushang <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
yea just tell cadet to wait for friday
just have to wait for kit tomorrow, i think she will be both a dps/support but the main intention would be to use her with hohe. i think with high ranks she'll be a suitable replacement for hohe in RL, less ranks for lower brackets. really just spitballing here.
i wonder if sushang will play like senti
big brain move
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943> incredible timing
when you skip the gacha dps for her farmable support <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
the entire channel is in uproar with doomposting rn
didnt mariso also say theres frags in ER
yeah kinda crazy how easily accessible her frags are
you've fallen off
<a:wtf:479509240046682114>

i did mine already <:grisob:975016058928914452>
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
was it patch before anni?
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
they started playing after that event <:worrystare:653847469830176779>
sadge i dont think my friend have cflare
yea
RL preferably

im done <a:PU_PeepoLeaveExit:855157057887535164>
finally
honestly the fight just takes awhile to get good at, at least for me. its literally just speed. over and over again until youre fast enough
and you have 3 star klein?
your gd is 3s right?
shit never works for me
idk how youre even getting 40% of the time
i see an ss2 ref in jialao server
oh f i forgot
her dmg is always all over the place <:deadge:975652771082698782>
what rank is your ht again
oh
it looks like he stands hehind the drop circles
im gonna try styx ref tonite
but that dont matter
the ones i have are 3s
no im just embarassed to show my score
do they have her weapon at least
maybe the sacrificed morb gear for zhenyi
oof
understandable
now i get it <:C_TaoCreepySmile:958713165196177419>
ohhhh
im confused danki
doesnt 18k mean you just did 2 side stages? i think they just need to do last stage and its 21337
what the score
yea
leaving this here for reference <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
 imy hohe ref
oh thats fucking cap surely theyre sniping <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
what does their team look like
lmao
<a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
:/ i was just teasing you <:sadturtlenoyeehawfuckbrandong:1006711468705722429>
agitated
keilo you been malding too many hours and starting to get testy, put the game down <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
im also 3 frags short from ss1 fr this week coz i have zero currency <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
im going to report them all rn <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
the same way it helps 3s ch <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
at lesat next is sw weaether <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i need my jades <:grisob:975016058928914452>
how in god's name do you have 200 shifters <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
if those constant rumors of hor getting new weapon are true then even more <:teristonks:959782789593595925>
the switch cd will be so nice to have now for qua bosses too
4s ely elf will be nutty for any ice team
i think they recently came back? i know fenrysk was piloting them for a bit
thats what enchidona does on their account and they cruise
tbf they gave me so much free hot stamps <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
fr fr im 4 starring elfs from now on
ig just more dmg, its only noticeable in the rots i see
<:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
even as a 3 star klein owner i feel the constant need for 4 star
no klein = no lightning team istg
yeah you qte on the first one and then just weapon active the second > qte eden
i wasnt looking for zhenyi buff
coz the bunny almost always applies
shit it might be the zhenyi then
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
ty i have to look later coz im at work now <:deadge:975652771082698782>
also for 9s team you're just so completely gated by cooldowns timing for every single thing has to be right
i watched yumi mald yesteerday and played the same way but i dont know what to look for its sf annoying
im only at 798 rn <:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
and it doesnt work 70% of the time
so i need to get the debuff right
last time was easy coz i could waste a klein ult there but i need klein ult for first ult now
yes i know
yeah on spawn so both mechs get debuffed right, i should be able to one rotation them but 70% of the time one is left with 1/3 bar left
well ask your lao friends how to time mob correctly <:deadge:975652771082698782>
i cant get the timing right on mobs and its basically just an hour of reset simulator <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
actually if you could help me with abyss later tonight that'd be great <@148145559897636865>
i havent even reached 800 in abyss yet <a:OMEGADANCE1:931653026517778484>
sure tbf i havent malded anything yet, its really hard for me to get motivation to play during the work week <:PES_CryComfy:643089269375762432>
<:PES_HmmSpecs:672161497413189680>
im just not sure if the way you farm is considered a basic atk or a charge atk
she is a burst mode dps but she does dmg outside her burst, most rots in higher temps you need to do a short rot to farm sp
so yes <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
it says each basic/combo atk, does hohe use those?
should i upgrade my fire key to 8% or my lightning key to 1.6 sp?
it will all be over soon <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
idiots <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
no one can because its a second SSS boss
what is vill v getting on pig anyway? i see some people using her <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
lmao
you didn't skip, that's on you <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
well keilo idk what to tell you, youve had all year to save <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
not when its this patch
yes and me with vill-v <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i will explain it to you. when someone cannot afford to pull, they will doompost that character, no matter what it is. it is a coping mechanism. <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
fragile's refs are still ss0
big number = buff applied, smoll number = reset <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i always watch icon <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i was looking for small icon
what the fuck
right but im not seeing it <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
how do you even tell if turg applies or not on mob?
idts it seems to be working for her <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
idk how it works but she has many laos in chat coaching her
yeah shes totally obsessed with her lmao
she is streaming rn, big whel
i just notice you're in yumi abyss <@370438895965306882> <:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
okay keilo you win <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
what the hell that rotation looks so unncessarily bald <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
I WILL BEAT YOU
KEILO

<a:dalaoexplode:959706477151551498> <a:dalaoexplode:959706477151551498> <a:dalaoexplode:959706477151551498>
do you have aslaug
oh lordt
this is what i was doing <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
oh <:deadge:975652771082698782>
she already has 100 sp for ult by p2 transition, you just want to do combos at start, apply marg, kill pig, then you ult with raven in p2
yes
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
BECAUSE ITS HARD
omg no you dont

bruh is in this looks like you're beating your head against the wall
mobius on bke in nirvana 
man this boss is not fair without 4 star klein <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
fgo means no pe hos gris on doom
but the other 3s boss is elemental weather
yes
oh boy this will be a fun week for some <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943> 
i meant yikes as in both ae and fr require more braincells to play than my brain is capable of producing <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
also i didnt mean yikes as in that was a bad score
fragile has 800+ with ss0 <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
yikes
<:grisob:975016058928914452>
someone please fucking explain to me how to time it so hot will do dmg <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i forgot how mald this boss is <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
its hellmaru after bke <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
i dont either
oh thats right
when will i get keilo or gresham in my bracket so i can beat them into submission <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
implying a nirv ref exists with io handel and fr ae <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

is that new?
btw <@180679257851166721> do you know anything about the ice heph side stages? i thought i saw parvati on side stage in cn discuss but maybe it was ganesh?
hfs scored on myriad last cycle but you need keeby hands <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
oh is that how it works?

it doesnt close for another like 8 hours, a lot of people will hide or post up like an hour before close
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

thank youuuu <@370438895965306882> <:BaalHug:883229376613855252>
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:WICKED:897590154691248149>
they should make each name a couple words that will form a story on myriad <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
13 more days <:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
im watching a stream for 3s elysia doing ER and she's just absolutely destroying <a:luminelick:910325061582463026>
how is this guy still not banned <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
she's got me 600+ rn
im fine with hot
yeah
the rest of my teams suck ass
im using hot for this abyss
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
i need fucking aponia
<a:aPES4_Noted:838744541497393152>
yeah idk i haven't even been able to play with her yet, just my feelings from watching vids so far <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
yes she wont be able to function well with ae as support due to sp and the hb support from the runs ive seen just looks awkward in some parts for the length/set up of her burst
she needs better support tbh <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
stacks
i forgot
oh
this mfer hit 1m
idk i feel mine is pretty stacked, even ss senti in team but the most charge shot i see from her is like 700k+
hmm okay
is she supposed to have 2 cdmg and the rest atk?
every time i see an ely showcase i feel they outdamage mine by a mile
<a:aPES4_Noted:838744541497393152>
og it looks so mald
oh i see she's quite good for that hit count couatl
i dont understand how they getting such high scores with ely <:PES_CryComfy:643089269375762432>
what the heck
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
you guys think there will be 700s for mobius?
whats a good score for this boss
am i supposed to save big dmg phase for little homus
i dont get it
um.. so how do i do this boss <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>
elysia you never were and never will be a problem, you're perfect the wa you are <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i think it will be just like our anni
agreed <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
end hi3 and make fc game <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
if glb get anni select this year im getting aponia <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
dont worry guys we just have 2 more weeks of saving and then we can finally sate the gacha addiction, just stay strong <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
you would be a clown anyway <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943> go look at the boss schedule, not a single mobius boss in sight. and every day people coming up with newer/better strats for MA wolf without her
vv better investment at this point if you ask me <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
there's literally not reason
fr don't pull her
you will
imo klein is not worth at 2 star, but he's absolutely worth 3 starring <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i'm glad i'm not the only one to see it, elf ely is bait <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i dont have a day, vv banner ends in 2 hours <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
unless of course one of the kind souls here would like to donate me <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
sleep week <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

<:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
abuser
idk i haven't seen the fight
people are just able to brute force the ignite in nirv?
thats okay i dont mind <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
make ignite qua wather
i said they would do this as soon as vv was announced and once again i am proven right <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
just not hte skill <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i should have the gear for all the bosses
kasumi
lmaoo
oh
yeah can do
hot kosma spa wolf and whatever on doom

keilo
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
god forbid we have alternatives
they literally dont make valks skippable anymore
<:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
and the mobs before him ignite shield
kosma is in abyss in cn this week
did you guys see
good point <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ive been playing over a year and still dont have ana <:PES_CryComfy:643089269375762432>
i know
seems bronya is popular with these gaming chairs <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
wtf this kosma boss is so ass
the top 2 players in NA on kosma are hackers <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
really gresham making keilo beg <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257> <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
then your decent score time increases from 12 hours to 32 <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
no you're underestimating you
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
lmao doubt
<a:dalaoexplode:959706477151551498>
i want to be as lao as you
you would nirv retain if you cared to
not even gresham thinks i can score with anything but my hot <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
i only retain because i whale and i can't even retain top 5
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
people with hands
free for who
i hate doom
doom is the worst
what the hell
fun week minus shitty doom
but i dont have sos <a:thanos_boohoo:807273541379555398>
i wonder if griseo with sos will be better in this fight now too
actually
watching the run it just looks like a sp farming simulator <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
<a:B_ZhongBroke:891440994724229150>
i really wish hoyo would allow you to buy xp mats with b-chips, i never have any
that will be a fun return
lmao
<:WorryWeirdSmile_lum:685294150609928196>
i never use DA before
im excited for pig next week
i just max out DA weapon and i still have just enough for ely by doing this thank god <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i also prioritize metal every week from battle arsenal <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
keilo for your metal dont forget to buy out your bp and dorm metal <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
who's the new herrscher tet <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ngl that's reallly strange
well yeah ofc im just talking about ely team
i think is what cn initially said though <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
3* elf > ss > 4 star elf
3* elf  and then ranks
it literally took me 2 patches to max out 3 star klein <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
and not be able to unlock her 4* skills because they're too eexpensive <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i cant wait to have her <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
yes her 2 star comes with switch cd and gather i think <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
elfs are very expensive <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
maybe
idk if thats many mind stones tbh
<:FuHuaWaiting:723672423542554644>
he shouldn't be as bad last time either thanks to cezz b <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
yeah the rest of the patch should be chill for me
bke back in rotation monday finally a fucking easy boss <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<@370438895965306882> 
we'll have to wait and see, i think this boss should have a good variety of alternatives <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
ely should work
oh
what is our d
um idk <@180679257851166721>

<@370438895965306882> did you and keilo survive?
<a:PU_PeepoBlushyTips:747989798740033546>
ah thanks i knew i couldn't trust keilo
but idk
i thought it might have something to do with fulfilling a basic sequence early or something
oh hmm maybe
<@370438895965306882> do you know?
omg you mean you dont know either? i thought i was dumb
lmao
<:GachaPlayers:976191636415602738> <:TheLiterate:976191666564247612>
why in clock fight do we start hot breaking the cabinets?
i have a stupid question <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
gnite ruby
oh its exactly the same as tank stack <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i mean yeah it works but no where fishcl
no <:WICKED:897590154691248149>
i dont have sos <:WICKED:897590154691248149>
with sos
yeah ely is another good one
no cap shes saved my ass multiple times, i may not be top score but she's the answer for retain when i have none <:WICKED:897590154691248149>
SW is the best, theres nothign she can't do mediocrely <:WICKED:897590154691248149>
<:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
oh i thought eli was doing qua side stage with that <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
not american, therefore not real holiday <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
oh you guys celebrate labor day in sea too <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ruby isnt it your bedtime <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
if you mean in comparison to hohe who knows she hasn't shown up since her release <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
yes
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
oh no, you need chong in the team too to actually turn your dps into cryo but shenhe is where all that dmg comes from <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
like shenhe's c6 is so cool, she basically can turn any character into a broken cryo dps
yeah pretty much
but c6 can change entirely how you play and who you play with, that's why i pull for c6
r5 idk
<:durandalsmile:973569999757254666>
but its not down to my skill that people are outscoring me, i'm lazy, i'm tired, i was sick this week, i had to work late, i went on vacation
oh yeah true, i feel like im being judged if i dont push cap score with my 3s hot not just by others but myself as well
as long as there are people outscoring me regularly with lower ranks i will never feel bad about having ranks <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ranks isnt scamming anyone out of anything, you're just competing with other ranks
jeez keilo cut yourself some slack
<a:aPES2_HmmmmSip:903233569273569280>
make it sound like youre just playing the game more efficiently rather than scamming <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
interesting
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831> i will give it a go tonight
ruby do you fps scam
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257> that is so not worth
how much difference does it make in score for fps scam?
im pretty sure ive seen fairsky speak openly about doing it
i thought this is something all t10 do
well now that i know i can just change it in game to 120 i will
what is iriya against fps
i already have everything so i'd prefer flawless full set in a single 10 pls <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ye not bad

oh tf
ohok
how do i know if my computer can even handle 120 fps
i tried searching keyword fps but it's just you saying fps bullshit repeatedly <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
thanks
today?
is there a guide somewhere i can learn how to unlock my fps <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
keilo
ya true
tbh anything less than ss0 hot is cope still imo <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
idk tho imo 7tr comes with the caveat that you want ranks on your hot
where will your funds be for 6.1 then <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
that's a lot of crystal hak <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
7TR has too much coverage and dominates MA
no PE? no score in img
elysia and hofs have alternatives too
mobius has spa
just put elysian realm in genshin but make the lore about the archon wars <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:Pepega:687029111985930281>
yea those are probably my least favorite too, the ruin snake is the dumbest shit fight i've ever experienced. there's not even any rhyme or reason in those mechanics
pma and kenki are great
pog
why even bother
i have literally never heard of that

yes
if i was a cn player i'd be a forbidden retainer <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
honestly that is so disgusting <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
they never did anything about it? they just said yeah thats what it is <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
is there not a single gacha you could spend all that within lets say 12 months? isn't fgo pretty bad? <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
im sure razorninjas has probably spent around that amount <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i have not been able to stop pulling for ranks since the first time i pulled a rank for a valk.. it's just so much better <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i'm almost 450k
gresham? <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
whats your top up ruby <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
how the turn tables, leave it to america to take gacha and make it better <:KKona:932813351581540422>
what is the most expensive gacha game <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
people will make fun of me for spending on cartoon characters and then turn around and spend 500usd on a lootbox for a pixel knife <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
isn't CS just like.. cod <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
wow ruby i thought you were a genshin import <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
well im still enjoying myself but i have low standards <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
there are so many people that imported from genshin that only care about elysia
soon all that's left are genshin imports <:WICKED:897590154691248149>
everyone's quitting
all around elemental support, take it or leave it <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i'm telling you guys, new all aroudn elemental support is coming in 6.1 <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
definitely
i just hate not using it, it feels so satisfying <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
i'll try for 550 later i cant be bothered to really mald, theres too many aponia in my lobby
makes sense
<a:aPES4_Noted:838744541497393152>
why dont people use the weapon activeon dragon?
oh ty i missed it!

wait
does anyone have a 3s hot ref for this clock? i can't find any <:PES_CryComfy:643089269375762432>
i used to want her a lot but every time i see gameplay im reminded not to be that based
she looks so bad
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<a:PU_pepeNOPERS:850330663415578654>

chicken ramen or its üöÆ
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
my favorite mental state for maincord is that if you have sw, there's no reason to pull hoh <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i literally just said she's bait, anyone with a brain can look at all the refs, skills, and gear themselves to make an informed decision <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
how can you even ask that when ruby is the worst <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
assuming i interact with homeless people <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

no you have to be Gresham But Mid
i want to change my name to Gresham But Good but i have to get a score first <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
keilo doesn't have ss sw
what do you even have for clock keilo
i think so too <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
as you can see from the kosma run, sw is still good <:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
there were so many times last week i was thinking god if i just had this elf rn <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>

just a couple more weeks until we know what's coming in 6.1 <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
really? i feel the opposite
you can't go back, you can try but games can never give that initial feeling you have when you first start the addiction.. at least for me <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943> i've tried to get back into ones i used to obsess over but it never captures my interest the same way and always ends up feeling like a chore or habit
i'm very all or nothing with games, i usually play one obsessively for a year or two and then never touch it again <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
are you playing something else kielo
yea ive been seeing the hos survivability issue all morning, you have DA, DJ, or ranked HT? <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

what the hell gresham i thought you were better than the degens here, turns otu you're all the same <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
aponia has asmr voice actor, its really nice <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
stfu ruby not everyone can afford to pull all valk <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
this is why it pisses me off when the community starts saying lol x valk is soo bad coz i already know mihobo see it and start fixing bosses <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
yeah i thought so, i tried it last time and was surprised how fucking terrible it was <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
you really think that score higher than my 9s ht team though.. like to the point its worth malding <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:Harold_lum:657441749404221447>
i wouldn't have a clue how to even utilize a sw hb fr team
my fr is ss0 <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
maybe i wont lose trophies <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
no aponia, demoted to sinful <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

i literally struggle to score even in paralyze with hot, granted i get +100 but not without serious malding
toys mean nothing without hands <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<@781539392039682058> did you promote to nirv this week? <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
im probably gonna lose trophies on this cycle rip <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
PE released like 5 months ago and they're still putting her bosses in abyss every single patch <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
wow i actually t100 ma last week with zero effort <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
if i knew mihomo was going to fix all her bosses to be unplayable with any other valk 2 patches later i would have <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
just use aponia <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
üöÆ
whatever <:shrug:877047647511384064>
<@370438895965306882> the reason i got 600 here on p2 was coz i did purple combo with spin so the enemy froze for ult.. still dont understand where the extra 100 is from, maybe ult?

using ae not worth
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
link some sw type counter <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
really? <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
yeah sw will be good if you can damage him before lightening replica i think
i cant remember <:deadge:975652771082698782>
you can do it baban i believe in you <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
i can whenever
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
i just need 2 more pts in my bracket <:PU_PepeCringeZoom:763449983474728980>
you're not on NA server ruby <:WICKED:897590154691248149>
when we raiding
<:WICKED:897590154691248149>
not in the top 10 at least.. hackerimpact is styx. i think he's getting a little tired of his throne getting hacked. <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
get good gresham <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
gresham would be #2 myriad if it wasn't for him
incredible work from the #1 myriad player in NA <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
the enemies may have so little hp in your bracket that brute forcing is just faster
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
you using gaming mouse too hak <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
im using sw for runs too <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
when i have to use fr over gd the dmg difference is noticeable, i can't imagine what its like with cat <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
imo hot always suffers without gd <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
pe is not a herrscher

<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
its just more dmg
there are a lot of 946 with hot not using it
why
sw has timestop on ult? <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
hohe: top scores all of her bosses
hot: gets 100 points less
cn-discuss: wait so is hoh bad?
yea that was a typo <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
im just gonna use spa+cat for everything <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
im glad everyone is wisening up to the reality of bait <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
way too dank

keilao vs gresham.. what an epic showdown <a:aPES4_WickedDash:838744542445830154>
styx changed his name <:kekcry:973697358799978626>
<:PES_Sniper:667742302755749908>

<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
idk i think most of these people are just now retaining RL <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
wow cn-discussion is out of control today, suddenly everyone is a hohe skipper <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
well they don't need to pull hoh, just use mobi <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
okay i can't take this, tell them <@180679257851166721> <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>

lmao
i fucking used all my lite attempts on accident and now i have to wait til tomorrow to do MA fucking bullshit <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:duduL:889133920950575114>
easy bosses <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ty ruby <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
nvm i can do it with what i have
yea
what about hfs eden hot <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

yes
<@180679257851166721> hot or sw for husk this week? <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
that dorsn't matter when the other sss boss is heph <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
the year is 2040, keilao had thought they'd seen the last of tank. they thought it was over. but it's back. and their elysia pri is still 50.
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
double elysia week <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
no worries <a:pat:969402615538520064>
7 est?
oh i see
im confused, so the 44s is real but the original poster did a photoshop?
omg <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
velvet seems to be a believer <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
why people photoshopping stuff like this <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
yea idk
my hot is 1600 with mediocre affix <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
thats acheiveable at 3s <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943> 
2k for 80 point difference, worth <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
thats quite a gap on those ranks tbh
and 3s?
also hoh does not count, my s0 plan goes into effect in 6.1 <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
gresham dont you have 2s vv <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
my new plan is to s0 or s2 most valks and 4 star elfs <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
um idk tbh i didn't really understand how important elfs were in nirv until more recently, and really i just wanted ss hos because i hate farming sp <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943> and guess what i still have to farm sp
yeah i think so <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
eris got 640+ but i think that was 3s hos 4 star dudu <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ely is really hard on fire tank <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943> even with 3s ely 2s hos 3s gris and 2 star durandal i could only get 560+ in nirv
<:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
good thing you promoted this week, i know how much you love fire <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

devs are obsessed with elysia, no way she doesn't pop up at some point
already 100% better than whatever the hell genshin storyline is talking about 99% of the time
or they just scrap whatever the fuck idea they had for genshin and turn it into PE game
i hope they make a PE game
lmao
until 7.0 beta starts and they realize its bait and start saving for 8.0 <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>

show me the sheet! you didn't even consider ICD or boss resitance. your ER is 125% and it should be 126%, you cant even do proper roto <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
tcers in wfp are actually pretty chill, just take everything they say as gospel and you'll  be fine <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
they call that feelscrafting <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ruby really finds the best emotes <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
ruby everything will change this year with 3.1 anni <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i just wait for elysian realm in genshin <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
nah it'll only take a month for that to happen <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i mean an archon
she will be great, she's a herrscher
i had no familiarity with gacha games
and then signora appeared and i was like woooah wtf
i thought it was a kids game
you know when i first started playing genshin
yes
back in my day we had shopkeepers giving handjob instructions and paimon telling people to stfu <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
hu tao released before they realized they wanted to make this game for kids only <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
genshin is too conservative now, all the characters wear too much clothing and it's poorly designed to begin with <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i heard the next midfit will be for lisa, it's <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943> good they're releasing these based on popularity
hoyo knows genshin players are just content with mediocrity <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
omg huge
lmao
i cant believe that diluc outfit qualifies as a 5 star üöÆ
genshin outfits are so mid too
imagine being a genshin player <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
rng? more like rigged bs <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
not cool
<:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
i should've picked aponia
i voted ely too
MOBIUS WTF U DOIN <a:aPES_Shoot:493353112434638858>
I BET SO MANY TICKETS ON THAT ONE
JUST  VOTE FOR THE WEAKEST
RIGGGED
FUCK
imagine not voting felis <a:aPES4_WickedDash:838744542445830154>
<:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
can we say you're bad <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
you ever try her in those qua weathers? even with my sheer amount of dk/dorm whaling i can't touch those myriad scores
time is money, the payoff is not worth with mpe. she is a strong valk but she requires her team geared, her bow, and all that time to rank up and for what? range tank top score. otherwise, she is kind of like a PE in that she can cover so much and still retain for you if you're good.
different mindset, difference in mind
she isn't though, she takes a year to rank up + hos/gris full geared
shes like a jack of all trades master of 1 (at peak investment)
mpe sucks for the amount of investment she requires imo at the tier we compete anyway
<:PES_HmmSpecs:672161497413189680>
is it better to skip hohe for pe rerun
and no pe
if someone has ss sw
i thought we would get ae adv by now
thats one of my big regrest
me too
it makes the profile pop
her ss is really important though
bke dies in 6.1 who cares <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i did, i think i get her ss1 before pig actually
you dont need ely if you have felis, felis will be able to top score hepha just like she does every other boss <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i really cant wait for pig, it will be my first time using da
i know one person who pulled her ss and wont even use her for her patch so they can save mats for ely lmao
yeah, there were sooo many of those
i hope MA is nothing but hepha and bke <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
yes sniping for #239 <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
wdym sunday is MA mald <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
i keep putting off abyss till last minute the past couple weeks
its like that for me now.. you want to go out thursday? sorry i have to check my schedule. abyss closes that day and i haven't malded enough yet.
<:Derple:646956861861658624>
but it says hellmaru > otto, won't otto be thursdya?
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
also wtf we getting otto on ely release
i have a feeling 6.0 will still be half qua
woooooow
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
<@370438895965306882> let me borrow your v2v next week, i have a stig for her <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
so what? just spend on dorm <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
every time they send a message i cringe
collectors item, limited edition <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
wtf am i ever gonna do with this <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
how could you skip neon cat
<:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
colors are too pretty
the hair is nice
definitely
lmao
felis is actually scam, it looks no different from her default <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943> the neon pops off
eden's looks really good too
i want to see aponia's in action, the art looks really pretty but that one screencap looks awful with vfx changes
we know <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
it is pricey tho lol
i like it, the animations are cool
all those wafers and phase shifters <a:luminelick:910325061582463026>
im not getting any supply tickets.. just griseo skin, hb skin, and resources
1 supply ticket <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
oof
im actually good on asterite now that i have everyone 3s <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
im so damn desperate for some COIN
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<:PES_CoolNerd:661971911466549248>
here's my calc for spending bundles <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943> 
green balls = sushang 6.1 <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
like ma yeah
i think there is, but not to the extent it was with hov, i think hoyo will give them extra longevity in different ways
back when i was f2p i always made it my goal to fully gear one team before moving to another and i started with a herrscher, worked out great for me
well my original argument was only that v2v is for spenders
for a f2p, i just don't think its a good investment over hohe
yes but again.. s0 is retaining but you will be wanting those ranks sooner than later as temps keep rising and most of your nirv competition has alternatives and/or ranks
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
she wants ranks, she wants support, and she is best in a niche weather
v2v is for spenders, she ain't cheap if you don't have their supports geared
that's my point, their investment is wasted. what are they gonna do? pull for aslaug in 22? get lucky in dorm with AE? wait on a new fire support?
sth like well after qua shill vill-v will be my go to for fire <:worrypat:986461060104081508>
i actually saw them say today
<a:Y_Smh:977594042995068998>
someone must've told them rc/raven is fine
i still can't believe that person in maincord pulled vill-v over hohe with no AE and no aslaug
tbh idc i like bastet b, it's just so easy to use in ice.. if you don't feel like malding you just run for bastet and still get good score
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
temps are low on testing
we'll see on live
and make sure your ice dps need sp
i dont agree, all they have to do is make a turg that is exclusive to ice
i think that stupid fucking leak is true tbh lmao
nah check the expiration date, it says 3/23 <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
its a 50/50, either shes going to be more easily obtainable which means a sidegrade in the future, or they're just trying to empty everyone's bank before 6.1
until 6.1 when she's replaced <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
only $300 for +50 pts <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
should i sss senti then <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
yeah foreshadowing an ez skip <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
really though i chose felis because she always kicks his ass in er <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
pick one and tell me who it is so i can just pick the opposite, its been working for me so far <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
im at 5 wins in a row now, swimming in tickets <:MeiHappyJuiceBox_lum:686671081255469114>

i'd take that if the sp gear was like the ragna one tbh <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
gacha s rank and wt s rank (or like spa release with er stamps)
its fucking garbage but when you finally get it to work its the easiest fight ever <@148145559897636865>
do i need to ask lol
is it ass?
i dont think ive ever fought fgo in abyss
<a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>

i have some great shitty runs from my time in masters ex and when i hit exalted too lmao
lete me see
idk kosma got 2nd cycle
hopefully we will find out next week
sweet now i can use both of my elys
i think instead of fire they might just release a new all elemental support like ae
thats the sad thing, they actually think they do live in the real world. this qr person talks like they've ever retained a single nirv cycle in their life
i want her to be able to do fire tank!!!1 okay...
these people are actually fucking braindead, i can't anymore
i have no choice with these grandma hands
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
s0?
what team did you use
carv assuming i have 4 star klein <:huh:966619839307321394>
i dont wanna be medicore <:PES_Cry:493359762432327691>

<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
I DONT UNDERSTAND HOW TO KEEP THIS STUPID BOSS PARALYZED IN TRANSITION
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>

idgi then

fucking rigged istg
<@180679257851166721> stop trolling in maincord and tell me sea dist

damn i just checked and i lost my fight too
as sw?
well i did the same thing with sw and she served me well, i don't regret it at all
holy
you're acting like this is anni spending event
sheeeeesh gresham
how much did you have to go in?
is the answer gacha addcition
what made you decide that?
<:grisob:975016058928914452>
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SAVING FOR ELY WITH THE REST OF US
YOU GOT SS VV
WHAT THE HELL
i know you told me but i forgot
are you also using ht?
why mihole do her so bad
that's sad
wow
omg those are easily my least favorite <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> in abyss anyway, i dont mind tank in MA since i get to use ely
wtf so high maintenance
<:huh:966619839307321394>
does nyx need wedge?
who are you using babn
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
i dont like it that much
but yes
i like couatl <:KevinPeek:658443365364269057>
well maybe just mald to learn the fight
it looks mald just for an okay score
its making me v happy i didnt pull vill looking at myriad and her runs
all the sudden?
lmao
honestly she seems pretty solid from the myriad scores
most in mine are on nyx/fr
i just noticed the hacker still hasn't posted their score yet
i have no idea what it is in mine coz everyone is hiding their score or still hasn't done it
you should ask him for some tips keilo
wow!
lmao
will i be able to retain with this or do i need to try <:deadge:975652771082698782>
yea you right
but most people i imagine RL is still the challenge
yeah for someone who has the right team and the right team fully geared it feels like baby mode, especially when experienced in nirvana
its not paper for people who are missing gear lbr
its hard to tell sometimes lol
idk
i honestly thought they were memeing
with no qua
on couatl
+
oh yes, they're terrible, 650
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
and then someone said because they're bad
someone else asked why they're using sa
no, someone shared his ely couatl video
i saw that, and karto was like why are a3 players acting like they know anything about nirv <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
lmfao
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
i thought you meant morbmaid
oh
skin is still a good move for anyone that wants it honestly, it won't come back for over a year <:deadge:975652771082698782>
yea you better believe everyone in nirv is gonna have ss minimum <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
well it def is now with the changes
<a:hosYaY_hh:904476594373001216>
true
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
yeah you want to make sure all those nirv retainers in cn discuss skip this one <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
scroll up a bit keilao and look at the destruction ruby did to cn-discuss <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
get baited <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
do it <:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
cannot waitttt for ely
glad i have it lol
interesting
im so dumb
lmfaoo
because its sw weapon
oh
everyone had cb19 on ely sw comp last cycle
is it? its the first time im seeing it
why is falcon flare so common with her on hb?
<a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>
yea and im sure even if he didn't he'd still top score lol
im laughing because we spent like 5 mins trying to figure out why this person wasn't using AE just to find out it's iriya <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
ohh right true
i guess just making sure it isn't on cd
what is the difference if her evasion is also 3s tf?
V2: In HoHuman form, when enemy is frozen or time slowed, trigger QTE. Apply [Flawless Crystalline Blossom] to the enemy, and deal 1200% ATK Ice DMG. Within 5s after QTE, Total DMG +20%, and trigger 3s Time Fracture.
V3: In HoHuman form, when enemy is frozen or time slowed, trigger QTE. Apply [Flawless Crystalline Blossom] to the enemy, and deal 1000% ATK Ice DMG. Within 20s after QTE, Total DMG +10%, can be refreshed, and if evasion skill is not on cd, trigger evasion skill.
?
it says her evasion is 3s tf and qte triggers evasion
wait was her qte tf actually nerf'd then?
i really think people are overexagerrating the sp. its not ideal but its hardly gonna be a deciding factor in her live performance
ye this morning
v3b is out though
they are
they don't know, they just see everyyone enjoying vill-v right now and doomposting hohe. they just want to spend their savings lol
<:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
ruby and cn discuss have literally sent this kid into a crisis

what do you guys think myriad cut off is gonna be this cycle <:PES_Hehehe:751431445192376400>
full irene set in non-existent foundry by sunday no problem <a:aPES4_WickedDash:838744542445830154>
irene <:Lmao:966624069363597362>
coz i dont have irene
what is fr even using in that run
i have never played with FR, she's SS0, and the perma paralyze definitely looks mald
i should pull
hakcer said it
i dont have any gear for vg
<:grisob:975016058928914452>
would she be less mald than ely/hot? <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
next andrius i will use pardo, mobi, fishl <a:aPES4_WickedDash:838744542445830154> who needs ae
they know not what they say
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
the worst part of those refinements is that its pointless just getting 1.. you only really see a difference at r4+ lol
most USELESS c6 in the game and still i was like im already here..
that was LITERALLY me when i went for raiden in genshin
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
and then 5 seconds later i was like i may as well
um i have
yeah, thats why that rank is there <:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
i thnk if you want ranks on ely s3 is enough, just get the sp one
9s every valk is way out of my spending limit lol
it really is
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
spending more in counterside?
not even monthly/bp <:huh:966619839307321394>
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
where's the button to demote to red lotus for the next 3 weeks <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
with the benefit of pri materials
but ig really it just means ag retain for the first year instead of masters
yeah its rough out there for new players
you think that's still true?
blue = valk, pink = gear
<a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>
im still baby
<:huh:966619839307321394>
how many days do you have carv?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
you've been playing that long?
and the pacce of the meta now idk if thats the right path either but i guess its not a bad one
that doesn't sound fun to me but it would certainly force you to learn the agony of rotations/mechanics in a way you wont forget and benefit future gameplay
if you spend light you can save accordingly and skip certain s ranks
if you're a long time vet f2p then it might be a bit easier, maybe miss a couple pieces here adn there but for the most part you can get the gear
like if youre f2p and only a year into the game, you will have to skip some sp gear
yeah in honkai your priorities vary soooo greatly depending on if and how much you spend
there are a lot of people in maincord that are casual f2ps so i think the advice given there comes from people who are in the same situation or are assuming that
everyone assumes everyone is f2p i think
<:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
for me, i was hurting so bad
and i get it, for the right person that was probably okay advice
that getting shuijing from bp was the right move and skipping paga was fine
except worse
i was told the same shit
are you me?
and people would tell me in maincord that i dont need ever level a pri past 60 <:huh:966619839307321394>
its so bad
i was like wtf i cant one shot everything with PE???
SAME
she HARD carried several bosses for me that patch i remember
lmao i was lucky to have sw
coatl was my first boss lol
maybe a few weeks after
it was right after glb anni i think
i cant remember what it was when i broke through
RL retaining would be perfect for me <:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
yeah its hard
even yumi got 658 with SS hfs and she has xored coaching her lol
everyone in nirv slept on that cycle it looks like
if you do my fire tank again <:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
4/8 bosses i'll be okay i think
nyx and mobi will top score prob but i dont have either of those so lol
ely supposed to be p good on homu
fire tank, fgo, and homu?
im anticipating maybe 2 or 3 vill-v's in nirv brackets and the rest free real estate.. even if you're unlucky and you get 6-7 that still leaves 3 spots open lol
id be more worried if the nirv changes didn't happen
a preview into my pulls for 6.0 <a:aPES2_BeanTyping:903233567310630943>
just crazy
<a:PU_pepeNOPERS:850330663415578654>
the magical girl one is nice tho
yes i hate it lol
hov is ancient, she doesn't look half as good
aside from vill-v's banner
who else does that
this
but
yeah
oh right
what else are you whaling in now
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<a:aPES4_Noted:838744541497393152>
whats the cheat sheet?
<a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
isn't nemesis considered limited?
but is it always 50/50 for the limited ssr you want?
<@309634550273933314>
is it 80 rolls for guarantee, and is it always 50/50?
the world looks open and baron with poor textures too
no i watched some streams and it doesnt look that interesting, the characters are pretty but the gacha looks terrible
its never enough amount for mihole <:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
im sure ill find a way
i have ptsd from PE supply
gear is my biggest worry
well to me she's beautiful and i will treat her like a pretty pretty princess
<:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
make it go down
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
you hate ely
we know
i wish i could fund everyone <:grisob:975016058928914452>
yeah im gonna get all this vill-v bundles for her
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
yes
i think its close
so yeah
because 168.5k crystal = 2,081usd
<@180679257851166721> does this sound accurate or cope?
total crystal = 168,150
340 pulls = 95,200
140 pulls = 39,200
225 pulls = 33,750
225 for elf
140 pulls for gear
using your simulation, lets say i get 3s in 340 pulls
if i dont spend at all i think i will have around 30k saved up by the time of her banner
im trying to anticipate my ely cost the best i can
is it 100 for one pull on elf?
sure!
its 140 avg for full gear right?
where would be a good place to ask this
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
in in that case i would guess around 150-170 <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
<@148145559897636865> not to get you back on the simulator, but do you know the avg pulls for 4 star elf?
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
i cant wait to see how many vill-vs are in my bracket tmr lol
<@213811388546678794> this you? <:huh:966619839307321394>

i still dont know them <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>

<@370438895965306882>
still looking good <:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
exactly
hey guys i just got her is she good?
- why are you pulling without asking first?
- trash
- take it to gacha-salt
- you should've pulled hos
- you should not have pulled hos, she's in 6.0
- what is your current crystal count?
- trash
believe me, there will be plenty of those people
you ever been to beginner-help in maincord baban? <:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
<:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
yea theres gonna be so many victims to htat
actually i pulled twice above average
oh no
i had to go to hard pity once, the other 4 times i pulled on average, 1 time i pulled above average
feels the same as expa to me
<:PU_PepeEvilPlan:551575606911959060>
40k+ crystal for 6 card refund <a:aPES_HappyClap:622096721408950295>
if they start making it a regular occurence, then yes, i agree. people could start preparing for each spend event to continue farming an elf. but right now, its too early to tell. it could just be another way to encourage people to swipe for more things.
<a:PU_PeepoBigBrain:699716013708541994>
for me it was great because i picked up 50 frags from the cn anni last year and was able to get another 50 10 months later to get my 3 star klein <:kekcry:973697358799978626>
its just another way to get people to spend
for the people who get 50 frags and decide to swipe for the rest
it will be great if they give you an elf selection for free this year
they really need to do something about that
more coverage and cheaper
yeah definitely
i think s0 4/4 and going in on 4* elfs is a good way to go if you're looking for nirv retain+trophies now, or s2 4/4 2* elf
well tbf thats how it should be, 3s shouldn't be getting 100+ pts anywhere
honkai has definitely changed my spending viewpoint for the worse.. there was a time when i thought c6'ing someone in genshin was absurd. now i look at it like, wow i can get all this for that?! <:woggers:652740192653934633>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
lets not forget elfs.. and what's your valk gonna do without supports and their gear? don't forget you will need to rank those supports up quick too <a:Aware1:962890472152526920>
yes thats a different thing
you dont have to gear in genshin but lets say you want a c6, it still miles cheapers
if yo uwant to be top tier competitive in honkai, its going to force you to spend this way nearly every patch, or every other patch
and its not just that
honkai is 10000% more expensive
i think the most i did was 800
i have never spent over 1k in genshin for a c6
lmao its soooooooooo true
im just comparing it to honkai, im not trying to say 100-200 is a great deal lol
like a character comes in genshin after i take a break i'll spend $100-$200 max to get them.. honkai i have to get the valk + full gear that's like.. at least $300-$400 out of pocket no
yeah but honkai is like.. you need to save A LOT and have A LOT .. i dont have to have those things in genshin
i didnt log for a few months and i def felt the pain of no primos but besides that, it was business as usual
the good thing about genshin is there's no stress in quitting and coming back, its not like you're falling from brackets and shit
wish ic ould live forever
ah to live in the future
<:huh:966619839307321394>
i mean i started during liyue and i was overwhelmed <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
they would have so many characters to choose from too
first of all, i don't understand why people say there's no content in this game
whats the gacha like
<a:aPES4_WickedDash:838744542445830154>
dw keilao i havent even installed
looking for someone higher than lvl 14 for tower of fantasy raid
both 0/10 awful
<:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
this remidns me i still have to do blockade <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
if they make lvl 90 weapons they better make the materials more easily accessible <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
that just means new valks coming soon to dethrone others
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
vet players will always have an advantage over new whales with dorm/dks though <a:aPES4_WickedDash:838744542445830154>
and then next id expect a new bracket
s0 will def be able to retain now, but trophies will be less and less common
there are less and less s0s in nirv
i already see it
every fucking cycle there are new people in myriad in NA
are you sure that's like.. a thing as far as gear/kit goes, or was that honkai had a much smaller pool of people playing then? i think genshin affected teh game massively as far as spenders and players goes
well yeah if you're talking nirv standard everyone needs sig gear
hfs isnt bad with f2p gear?
ely elf got extension, i wont be surprised to see ranks or elf include extension from now on
full trauma meter and extension <a:aPES4_WickedDash:838744542445830154>
why would i want to imagine that
<:huh:966619839307321394>
if they put another da boss in 6.0 i think 6.1 will be bio fire <:MeiHappyJuiceBox_lum:686671081255469114>
6.0 will be all ely, da, and hot <a:aPES4_WickedDash:838744542445830154>
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
i did.. one of my first messages in arc-city while i was playing through story was who is this blonde haired bitch saving kiana
debateable
he looks like the spawn of a roach
how old is that in bug years?
kosma is only 17?
i dont love sirin
<:grisob:975016058928914452> omg
how would hua story end then? you think hua will die and senti will join the team?
more hua/senti story NOW <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
theres a lot of lore okay i dont know everything
hua is dying?
i guess if you're asexual
dating someone requires sexual attraction and there ain't nonne of that when dating gris
hua looks like a young adult at least
the point is if you remain the body of a child your whole life, you would never experience life as a real adult. you could never fall in love, the only people interested are creeps like ruby. you could never share the same experiences other adults do.
exactly
literally interview with the vampire
im js i wouldnt want to be 9 the rest of my life
couldn't have waited a few years?
what a shit surgery
is her surgery why she never grows up?
but i wouldnt even speak in an overwatch or cod lobby because a) girl and b) 12 year olds scare me

its true, you're not a real man if you're playing video games in america, you're playing as the star quarterback in the nfl or you're a wuss <:KKona:932813351581540422>
we saw people playing futball and calling it soccer but we knew the truth, football is soccer and soccer is soccer <:KKona:932813351581540422>
really keilao america invented all of these sports, we own them and this is what we say to be true <:KKona:932813351581540422>
a football is for football, a basketball is for basketball, and a soccer ball is for soccer. that's just the way of things here in murica. <:PES4_CaptainAmerica:797579203696132127>

minus any MA bosses
this year's DA
SW really is getting fucked
aponia is perfectly fine, perfectly fine to skip
he used hot on clock in my bracket and still beat me by 1 point <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
well ig content creators gotta do what they gotta do
content
oh
why would he do that
weird..
keeby has aponia?
and yeah ss aponia or death
aponia was still an ez skip imo, hot is perfectly competitive in nirv with her
i dont see any s0 vill-v myraid happening in nirv but we'll see
but even sw was useable at s0
yeah quite literally sw
biggest bait in the history of baiting.. free gear, requires ss
she seems pretty trash at s0
s0 though?
true <a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>
if i dont cap score first try i will just pull vill-v
i will try with mpe first
<:worrypat:986461060104081508> im sure will be enough to retain
neko you're in nirv?

exactly.. and cat with hot is nowhere near as good as hot with sss eden.. combine that with no lightening up + the nerf on paralyze and good luck
nirvana
this was in the context of using cat with hot in the freeze rpc boss, this person thinks that this will somehow allow hot to retain in ely's weather <:deadge:975652771082698782>
ikr
<@180679257851166721> that frann person was in the same bracket as i was during bke lightning and im 99% sure they did not retain with that cat comp.. ig they're referring to someone else that retained which is probable considering na but still <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
appropriately based
breakthru after 3 days lmao

i got 18 in MA this week <:woggers:652740192653934633>
lmao yea right<:PiKek:973573411911659540> i still suck with ae/hfs
this was back in rl tho ive never done him in nirv i think<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
legit the score in general, it was before i even looked at refs and didnt know how to use ae.. my opener was all wrong and my score went up at least 100 by the time we were done iirc
yep<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
yep
fire tank brings back fond memories.. my very first coaching session from keilao <:PES_Happy:493353112493621258>

thats for us? no heim this week?
hfs cat bd maybe?

probably not
maybe
i think most whales will move to nirv soon <:PES_HmmSpecs:672161497413189680>
oh <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i wonder how much malding the shield phase took <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
its just GET LUCKY <:C_HuPepega:855600443954692146>
theres no precisce rotation or mechanics
it pisses me the fuck off
FUCKING TRASHCAN BOSS ISTG
omg 252 second in RL <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
see>? <:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
i actually think most of my bracket just doesn't give a shit this cycle, including myself <:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170> i wont be surprised if i retain with that 300 score
my bracket <:PES_Hehehe:751431445192376400>
<a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
ah
sure i'll do a couple
are you still playing
where are you
raiko taiko has an 893 with same setup so it must be possible <:Harold_lum:657441749404221447>
even the 840 was close
s2
i have cezz t mei m newt b on gris and av tm cezz b on hos
dont have that either
i dont have gustav tho <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
im stuck on 840
if yyo ufind ref can u share
i dont have 4 star dudu or newt t
<@148145559897636865> do you need ss pe for 893 on assaka?
they might be preparing for a new bracket next year
no one will care if you're retaining nirv 2 patches from now, everyone will be saying ahem sir i'll have you know i retained nirv twice and i would've been t100 but i cant because only whales get that
thats how it always is.. if they're not talking about what a god they would be in nirvana, they're circle jerking conversations
then a few minutes later they're like wheres the guy saying 700+ <:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>  when someone said the cap score on nirv with spa is currently 400... like thats a marker to go by when a) half nirv havent posted scores yet and b) ITS NIRVANA NOT RED LOTUS
they were like well my score is 533 and im like okay but ma/ae gets 700+
i cant with this one person convinced their spa/rc combo is better than ma/ae like please just shut the fuck up
oh yeah def
<:PES_WoodySip:661970505175138324>
are there a lot of whales in sea nirv?
cut off for sea is +100 pts higher with higher d
thats crazy
yeah so they're actually similar to na
#100
what was the cut off?
the first one is a cheater though
this is na last cycle
not that slack then
yes please
yea im curious what sea and cn look like
kk
<@309634550273933314> can you show the last cycle myriad in eu?
vs na myriad
<:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
eu myriad this morning
yeah
wait let me find the myriad ranks this morning
its prob because their server is much different from the rest, every time i see ranks it looks like slack city and they have the lowest temp right?
i hope a da boss comes back soon, i just got her and i really want to use her <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
oh wtf
ely or hfs?
so hfs was used heim and hod here.. was ely top scoring sk and range tank back then? and da top on rime/parvati?
wtf is fortified
ruby please <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
10 BOSSES FOR ELY <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
GIVE MORE BOSSES FOR ELYSIA <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
<a:aPES4_WickedDash:838744542445830154>
but i saw someone in fen's chat yesterday that went 20k deep on her current supply just for her weapon like.. girl <:deadge:975652771082698782>
spa was great at the time for cost effectiveness, shes good to have if you got her then
exactly
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
imo the only best pull valks last year were hfs, mobius, and pe but of those 3 i still think hfs and pe see more extended value than mobi
idk i just remember there was a time i hurt without her, i dont anymore. she's on her way out imo
oh bloodlust? i forgot thats a thing
so not top score
what does she have in abyss outside andrius?
bosses? you mean boss?
i disagree, the d is too high for her at this point and take away the lighting up and whiel she is still obv top score on her boss, it's still a struggle bus fight that is currently taking advantage of a bug
cn-discuss is mass fucking coping that valks like ely fr mobi last further than 6 months. they peak in this timeframe and then usage goes out the window.
<@180679257851166721> why would you say mobi will last a long time? she's hardly seen anything the last couple patches, 2 SSS MA coming soon competing with hot supports, and she struggles even on her own boss in abyss
if you check pins in this channel kielo shared refs
literally its just how much time you're willing to commit to malding
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
doesnt sound bad maybe keilao can find a ref
oh duh
mw?
what are you working with tet
well if you want a good score, refs are the best place to start
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
i believe in you tet.. wait for the laos to post refs and start the mald after that
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
not without malding for 6-7 hours and am beat with people who have less ranks than me still
yes it makes me feel better to know im not the only one <:PES2_BlushLove:849698640942596127>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i thought type counter still had lightning up on this boss <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
its not skill issue its andrius
oh dear <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
im not touching this boss with a 10 ft pole
39 points
that top score is running this
im fuckin dead
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
3
takes 2-3 rotos to take down his shield with spa and by the time you can farm enough sp on raven its up again already <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
yea hate him
yeah i think rl was like 390 last time <:Lmao:966624069363597362>
what is na rl disturbance btw
fragile said they're exploiting a bug in the mobius comp but idk what it is, here's the run if you can spot it 
im not even gonna bother with nirv bracket
i think d is much higher than it was when it last came around
its just fucking andrius
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
please no <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
like calm down she isnt even doing naything bad
i still dont get why kevin kills ely
<:grisob:975016058928914452>
copium we get a PE game <:elysiacopium_hh:879534582897192970>
nah leave her dead, she's wonderful and perfect but the story is headed in that direction. if they kept her alive it would go against the direction.
people would be pissssssed if ely makes it out alive
i even saw the er is only here because mihoyo ran out of ideas complaint last night <:huh:966619839307321394>
and ely and fcs have no purpose besides generating money
the people who don't like her still knew she was coming, their main gripe is that the story is not on ogs
some idiots im sure
both hot and hfs debuts were iconic
fen and the na laos were bitching about ely and the er story for like a whole ass hour last night in stream <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
the reception ive seen is more polarizing.. like people either love her or hate her <:deadge:975652771082698782>
whats the d on this vid
yeah they would never
well its not so much that i want to be able to afford full sets, it's just annoying that one of hte new pieces are useless and i can't control which ones i'm pulling <:deadge:975652771082698782>
like cezz m is totally garbage
well im tired of pulling for full sets when 1 or 2 pieces turn out to not even be the best fit
maybe they will put something on a stig
she does need sp buffs
no hoh nerfs, only buffs <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
there are sooooooo many new whales pooping up in ex na every week these days
im like bitch i dont even have s0 <:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
yumi messaged me this morning asking what rank my mobius is
my bracket has yumi xored and bennett to name a few
<:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384> no. mine.
i am adult with steady income and a bf that pays for everything
why not?
i decided to suffer thru this vill-v patch and sss ely <a:mhvibeely:998945532913406003>
ahh nice
i dont think she does <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
does hoh get sp help with ranks?
that fight is fucking mald with cat/hfs
i totally forgot about this fight altogether
omg
also why ae over fucking hb <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
what about with ranks?
so will you be back in nirv just in time for qua or will you promote after wolf?
i think mine was similar
oof
wolf, heim, qua
anw i fully expect to start bleeding trophies
wait did u live <@370438895965306882>
wow i did im shocked.. there were 3 aponias below me one of them sss.. i thought they were hiding score <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

keeby's lineup
ice gave me some refs though <:durandalsmile:973569999757254666>
it is because i have 3s
i talked to fragile about it
i was following a ss0 ref for bke and it wasnt until i found a 3s that i could finally get a good score coz the roto was completely different
and i think sss usually plays totally different from ss0
i cant get it <:sadge:814362586631503953>
thats 2s
do u have a 3s hot ref? i seriously cant find any this cycle
is that iriya idk? im just asking if its real coz idk cap score for aponia
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
with 786
this person
no im not talkinf about the #1
is #7 on myriad a real score
keeby's gonna beat me with his ss hot by 30 points when he finally plays <:life:1001518241610485781>

hows your nirv score looking
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
watching zia bald bke is making me die inside
rpc and range tank pls
stfu ruby
please delete this patch
its really fucking bullshit 5.9 even exists
qua weather is only a week away <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i wait for na to play and find a ref there
ive stopped even trying to find bili refs
it certainly does in mine
and most of them think every ref they find is going to get them same score in nirv when literally 1 or 2 d can change a roto
not to mention half the time they're linking a nirv ref that can't even match a d in the same server
> sees nirv ref
> look just do this, its really easy
> never fought a nirv boss in their life
- a3 advice
saying hfs default skin is ugly and too much himeko in it <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
yea its def L take hour in cn discussion

type counter hit count next patch 
player #1 with the gaming hands <a:aPES4_WickedDash:838744542445830154>
no thanks
<:huh:966619839307321394>
i dont even have the motivation to do my own abyss <:deadge:975652771082698782>
thats true so no mobius and no spa <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
sw will be good though
yes
they dont want hot there anymore
its aponia boss
husk again
they want to make sure no one pulls for her by putting out 2 sss ae boss <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
its not enough that vill-v sucks
i have at least 4 myriad players in my bracket <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
<:MonkaS:383408020492910592>
you guys should really go check <#963273616852652095> <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
what about kevin? i think he will be made for her
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
they even have her fully geared
yea that is so weird
that is crazy what have they been farming i wonder lmao
oof
she's too pretty cant wait to play with her
keep us posted
<:PES_HmmSpecs:672161497413189680>
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
but it hink someone did the math and said the essentine changes was like very slightly minimally better
we dont get frags anymore by the time ely gets here
so you'd have to pull the card 12 times vs 10.. yeah i guess the difference is not that much lol
its 850 frags to 3s an awakened and 300 frags to 3s a non-awakened.. awakened gives 70 and non-awakened gives what? 30?
i dont see how an awakened valk would only be 100 pulls more <:Suspiciouspepe:920083771217285130>
so that's.. approx 1700usd.. not even including gear <:holothink:963352118855626753>
you guys familiar with war song or ria shion
lightning dead, qua valk or demote

<:PES_SleepDrool:646442060827590677>
my nirv bracket looks kinda chill but every time i say that its not

<:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
RL<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah gaming for t5 score
but look at the deal on dj? its too good to pass on
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yea thats a tough one
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
<a:PU_PepeRage:593498062782070784>
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
the attack on that hot.. their affixes must be perfect <:grisob:975016058928914452>
the fact that you have to pause game for a weapon to function properly is ridiculous
cerulean flare honest to god just pisses me off
i think its because he does not qte her in so he does basic seq attack so when she does she has full charge
why does he start on hot like that
<@370438895965306882> 
dead valk, better invest in spa
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>

wildknight has all sss gacha valks it looks like, but they were in RL last week and their MA scores aren't great so i dont think i have to worry about them
but people still have not played and hiding scores
it looks like a slack bracket
i know
oh thats true
oh no i guess donut's is worse lmao

god no
i'll give it a shot
<:huh:966619839307321394>

4 spots in mine are taken <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
<:meiMad:997543209221750834> .
whos side are you on
wow
none of the myriad players are posting their scores yet ofc <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
since the start of the cycle i keep seeing their score go up point by point lol
keilao your friend cookie is balding so hard
clear p1-2 perfectly, the stars align.. then boss teleports into narnia, miss all sp, every attack, suddenly qte isn't working <:woggers:652740192653934633>
<:KannaKMS:959736724462919690>
i know right
and then do the sloppiest rotation ever and crit everything and be top lb
with phys teams you can do the perfect rotation and get such a mediocre score
you ever mald so much with senti you start forgetting to even ult with her <:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
thanks, will try all that setup after work
i been using full cezz.. so now full cezz isnt even bis for bleed? <:deadge:975652771082698782>
and what emblem?
full cezz or beet m?
i'll keep trying later <:KianaFish:423917411465560065>
do you have qte on for senti
how many times do you have to CA with gris to keep the sp for the last roto?
<:elysiacopium_hh:879534582897192970>
where is our new mech phys dps
thats what im saying
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
and whats with him bouncing in the air and just sitting there??? hello??
i do! i LOVE that!
just perfect crit the first half so the boss can teleport to genshin in the second <:Pepega:687029111985930281>
yea this boss is actually so triggering
<:KianaFish:423917411465560065>
nice
im still on like.. 629 <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
you get to retain with trophies anyway?
that is so harsh
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
oh do you mean that's the bar in your bracket?
you got 680? <:huh:966619839307321394>
sucks i wont be in nirv for rpc <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
this boss is garbage
yeah i think you're fine too
<:worrynirvanajail2_hh:828444826822508554>
mobius is great but people act like she's a herrscher or sth
fragile tries to force mobius everywhere she goes, he ran her on every aka cycle coz no spa in nirv lol
idk s bke is pretty bad
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
i love how they say if its nirv like that somehow would make it better for mobius
thats a good one
i dont regret pulling that
aslaug is good to have hto
-100 pts for raven
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
my fr only ss <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
what the hell is this üò≠ 
i went searching for hellmaru refs on yt uploaded this week
<a:KianaShake:724341895311917117>

yea i activated mine the other day
fob on honkai again, please god do fgo <:PiKek:973573411911659540>

ruby
<:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930>
when you're on horse
why sometimes you weapon active with PE and she just sits there stabbing at nothing even though she's right in front of the enemy
i only tried her once, im sure it will be hell
ES?
its the worst when you get boss to 2 bar left and have to do a whole ass nother rotation, watch those points drain another 100 <:kekcry:973697358799978626>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>

idk how people retain #1 across every game mode consistently
honestly
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
they seriously always #1
how long has that player styx been around
i need more cadets
<a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>
cookie has sss carole

or is that kasumi
oh you mean that fight
i dont have sk
<:huh:966619839307321394>

<:huh:966619839307321394>

<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
keeby is at #26 on myriad with this <:huh:966619839307321394>
oh yeah
so she is cheaper
what are we saying
im confused
<:RozaLook_rein_lum:884598260210225152>
then theyre 1500 lol
aren't they cheaper for hot
oh thats right
yeah it takes time to wrack currency to be able to buy them.. unless you're sitting on a stash
no pulling for like.. 12 weeks
<:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120>
kinda true tho.. by the time you can get all the stamps it'll be january <:kekcry:973697358799978626>
<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
hot has the bke treatment now, no ranks no point
yeah shes tanky even if you're s0 hot
that s0 hot is prob s2 at least too
jthat person is slacking
uh <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
idk whats good for s0 hot in rl
klein carry ü§î
what are they using
<a:aPES_RunningCrying:666320715162583060>
i should prob do that too if im skipping vill v <:yikes:877047689521532979>
whats pta
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
i see what yyou mean
oh nvm
i never have the sp on eden when i ult in transition
its the transition that fucks me up
the opener is the only part im comfortable with at this point
ty <a:gaylaof:959722007153483816>
<@148145559897636865> is there any other 9s refs for bke ma yet? besides that one i sent you <:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
would be nice of all fcs got one
i hope she gets summer outfit in 6.0
ofc hte first roll is double psy max atk
i was rolling for hot affixes yesterday and today i decided to try to get more atk on fischl
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
my affixes could be so much better but they just wont roll.. and i saved up 20k affix stuff for it <:grisob:975016058928914452>
sameee
lmao
is it dks or affixes or ranks?
idk the rots ive seen have some technicalities for timing but really once you do it, its just go faster go faster go faster go faster
just dont open with gun, open with fischl > qte eden
1585
you dont ult
all you use her for is qte
theres zero brainpower required for eden
also i should say there are several ss+ hots above me... i think ss1 can score higher than what im doing
whats your team?
whats good for RL?
lmao
its cringe
there are several SS hots above me
theres always people that do better
thats taking advantage of klein ult too
yeah they stay on dragon long enough to fill out but even if i stay on dragon the whole phase for execute its like one little bit short <:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
i dont understand how they're able to fill the trauma bar in execute
most of the 800s are def ss1+
did you see fairsky ref?
with freakin SS
<:huh:966619839307321394>
810+ and they make it look easy
idk how the laos do it
<:mobiustired_hh:887701695172321321>
time bald again <:grisob:975016058928914452>
700+ tubes to upgrade a weapon is one of the most absurd things this game offers <:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
mobius and bb have the best summers, i like LE's too but its simple compared to those lol
i didnt either but tbf her default one is hard to beat, i feel the same about hfs <:PES2_Hide:528554354341576714>
whats senti's good outfit
yumi told me to do mitternacht and WOW what a difference
i was using cerulean
you know what the issue was

<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
is it me or are eden's inputs total fucking garbage
missing 20 atk and like 12% lightening <:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
and i still cant meet the dmg of that run
the timing has to be perfect or fucks up the entire rotation
the transition when bke drops into eden is cancer
i cant even get close
the sheer mald of this run, ive been at it for 2 houjrs
i am actually so depressed i still cant touch top scores
<@148145559897636865> do you have any good 9s refs for bke? i tried one but the d is different and it doesnt work and i cant find any <:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>

yea that shit is pain
watch keilao top my score tomr
and yes you can, i am pleb

my first and last, its only because hot had so many adv supply and bp stamps that i can afford it. when i did her adv i pulled her 3x and when i did her supply today i pulled her twice again back to back. .and then i had enough supply shop currency to finish her <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
am pleb maybe im not cut for lao status <:grisob:975016058928914452>
ah ty keilao
did i upload the wrong one
i thought i did do weapon active breath
i was doing weapon active combo for the longest time but it always did less dmg <:grisob:975016058928914452>
hot missing like.. 30-40 atk
yes same ranks same gear
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
i cant ult with eden during transition like the ref does, i dont know how theyre getting sp for that
<@148145559897636865> 
<:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>

<:D_ZhongPogUPoint:856680456173649930>

im pretty sure she stole the boss from hot in the first place so she should be fine?
:fpsemote:
ty
yea i have to play spa which requires specific timings and hits
andrius is the worst, i fucking hate him in abyss and ma,  so many different timings you have to get right from beginning to end

fgo is a hard boss
surely fgo worse than hod

i still havent been able to fully level klein and its been a month
everything.. they suck EVERYTHING
my friend: idk how you run out of coin, i have sooo much of it lol
my friend after pulling elf: <:huh:966619839307321394>
but i feel i always have an excess of torus
i would take the metal or shifters
the metal amount is gross as hell
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
on god i would take the phase shifters <:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
how much metal is it again to go from 50-60?
with those top 3 in your bracket you were bound to suffer <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:MeiStare:458045366063857668>

<:PES_PoggerSip:585724569197871105>

my hfs doesnt have the dmg for this
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
honestly most weeks in ma i just do what i want even if i know its gonna net a lower score
context? <:PES2_HmmmmPause:903233568141082685>
heph was only easy for me coz i have s2 pe
yea im havin same problem with heim now
you doing evade > bash > attack > pause?
yeah i noticed <:Suspiciouspepe:920083771217285130>
or fischl
or eden
i have no idea how to use hot
im not ready either tbh
<:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
they did 47056
<:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
theyre beyond ready for 7tr
the top score right now
lmao the bke leaderboard is full of unknown names
wtb hands
does he not even evade with hfs for time frac?
or aslaug?
mei m i g

<:CryingMan:861897710595735562>
does that matter?
i dont have homu m
<:HoSDerp:956555543378538596>
yay one down
perfect ty!

tehres zero hope for me then
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
im ready for someone to do my MA for me
okay guys im home
FR will be my carry to agony next patch <:C_HuPepeSmile:919761377449627708>
thats still already pretty good, would be cool to see just a bit higher with that +10 <:woggers:652740192653934633>
i feel like every time a new valks comes it pushes her further down the dump
when is nyx not losing <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
oh no hots are gonna be beating my pe now <:deadge:975652771082698782>
okay i'll take that ref, that i can do <a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
prob 1-2 sec without sss
can do with ss?
thats SSS hs
my pe is s2
maybe le carole ely?
damn it no kmb <:grisob:975016058928914452>
<:PES2_HmmmmNoted:849698641412096030>
oh yeah pe heph would be nice
please continue to share runs for heim/heph <:grisob:975016058928914452> i need ideas
<:huh:966619839307321394>
they just roll for valks and use whatever is recommended by game
there are so many people that dont even care about gear that play
<:MeiStare:458045366063857668>
yes tbh i think this is the reason most people SS her in NA, i actually see SS senti without gear
oh absolutely would be the standard the second shes in adv or bp
theres actually a SS senti in my rl bracket <:huh:966619839307321394>
i noticed this too, i run into SS PE alllll the time on NA
<:sadge:814362586631503953>
i hate heim and heph
i dont wanna ma this week
<:A_GaspTao:965934360668823593>
okay thansk for explaining
oh
wow i heckin love after ulting with PE hod dodges my block every time
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
how does he have all that starting sp on senti? 
scorin 200 pts higher than the 11/12 hfs team in bracket <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i'd like to see how fr is doing on these fights as comparison
does she have collapse outside of ult
her gameplay could not look more unappealing if it tried
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i just realised i uploaded the wrong video
tried out the new pado guide above 
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
of course not.. probably
i do but they're all affixed for bronya
man i want another set of bronya nex just  for my pardo er runs <:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
it was just that one brain fart run i swear i havent been doing it all the time <a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753>
i thought that means he's in front <:PU_PeepoDumb:531790523485126656>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
oh wow yeah thanks that worked
with what
<:HoSDerp:956555543378538596>
how?
if i ever get past floor 22 i'll try too <:PES2_HmmmmNoted:849698641412096030>
pe evade in that phase is so wonky
i just read it
oh yeah
lol yea after p1
why is it important to precisely hit every evade on hod in ma?
i have dumb question
<:5head:807876791393583106>
i wish i knew these things before i max my useless m stuff
why isjnt your marg fully leveled <:huh:966619839307321394>
are you using cross?
oh damn thats pretty good
what did you get with her?
still far from touching that bke <a:Yaeslap:966597937696223232>
managed to squeak out a 780
<:PES_EvilRondo:647054811002306561>
<:grisob:975016058928914452>
shes my last sp suit
wish i had her sss
1m on final burst hit <:huh:966619839307321394>
she does so much damage on this fight its insane
lmao
<:CryingMan:861897710595735562>
well fragile lives and dies by that this carole strat is very good
oh really.. hmm ill try that.. what for m?
i dont have sakura salvation either
spina too mald.. and can spina even top 772?
but i thought maybe i do the roto wrong.. just feels a lot slower
i tried PE just now and shes like -50 points from carole
thought so
i dont have either
hos type counter in abyss
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<@148145559897636865> fact or fiction?
<:PES4_BlushHug:797579203456532552>
<:E_worry:792812046563016704> so many bke in my bracket

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<@148145559897636865> will i t100? <:PES2_HmmmmPause:903233568141082685>
lmaoo
imagine spending crystal on vill-v ranks when ely herrscher is almost here <:huh:966619839307321394>
fenrysk was saying today shes garbage at s0, much worse than s0 sw <:huh:966619839307321394>
<:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
MA is stupid<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<a:bloodlao:959706412685099038>
her weapon gives 10% total dmg + upon casting ultimate teammated on the field deal 12% bonus total dmg + 20% total dmg for 3 set + sp
i think she gives tdm to team or something
try it?
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
do you have eden geared?
<:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
pain
how often do they give 23/23 affixes mat? ive played more than a year and only seen it once <:grisob:975016058928914452>
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
yes pls!
:dalaofrenzy:
i dont have dalao emoji <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
right on the heels of benett whos running full team SS aponia <:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>
thats some whale shit <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
wow erislao with the 715 FR team
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
yeah it is true but still
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
ruby not everyone is a whale <a:Yaeslap:966597937696223232> this allows people who dont have PE to at least compete
i love that my fave girls just keep getting better
ely had next to nothing, griseo is huge stonks for her
yeah seriously
300 diff is not bad at all
well ofc pe will do better but isn't that ely second highest score now?
this is so awesome, ely finally getting some play time
<@375625398542925825> look!
slayyyyyyyyyyyyy queen!!!
omgggg
<:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120> <:ElysiaOhayo:957224914463621120>
trueee
ye def senpri for ma but i want to get my bases covered in abyss first

ill prob just do cosmic then
fragile says senpri is better if my only phys dps is S2 PE
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
<@148145559897636865> for SS senti is it better to max pri cosmic or senpri? does she use senpri more at SS?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
poggers tryin this tmr

seele fans have it rough
thank god i took the advice of others lol
and to think i almost skipped her

yea i think its just crits
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<a:aHoVLoading:755152253278617753>
i think maybe senti crits
thats what im saying
i kept trying but in the end i was stilll getting similar results from chains due to my own slownessl ol
yeah its hard for my boomer hands to transition into swords
it is, its very rare i feel i dont need it
i kept finding myself having to look for them anyway so i tried the crit emblem and it was soo much better
yea its crit emblem
i want to but my beet m is lvl 1 and i literally have no resources right now
are you all geared out too?
i just notice i dont even kill the atlus in one shot.. idk how the rest is so much faster <:A_HuDisgust:805786818070970389>
you dont have to imagine that keilao <:WhalePat:607373633056407605>

<:sadge:814362586631503953>

why do aka's stamps cost more than hot's stamps in supply shop <:huh:966619839307321394>
def not tp, and not just cause she's dated but because her stigs are dated, they could be replaced at any point
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
see you in nirv <:TeriPoint:928714899658518539>

we were told but still wasnt expecting that much of a difference
yeah seriously
which is one out of 10 lol
i can only manage 780+ when senti crits
crit malding
cant seem to go further than this <:Suspiciouspepe:920083771217285130>

stalling for turg <:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
unless they put something i want gear wise in the shop, which is hella unlikely at this point, i will probably just buy out their stamps in case i ever pull them from dorm <:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
anyone i see using her on aka gets obliterated
i seen some use hero n rimestar
yup
doesnt matter, jizo not coming back after next patch
well the plan is to start stacking again after gris pri/7tr and if i can manage to pri cosmic and senpri during flop-v patch i will
cosmic or senpri, she aint got one <:grisob:975016058928914452>
i wish i could pri my senti <:grisob:975016058928914452>

756 <:CryingMan:861897710595735562>
still tryin to get the hang of the cancel
my p1 is a lot faster now
<a:aPES4_Noted:838744541497393152>
fast ult ae is i just throw one random attack in and ult right?
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
good to know, i thought it matter every time lmao
raven ult sooner during minigame?
okay so black paint combo at start
<:PU_PeepoCatCry:594631410887819265>
no i have sss but i also thought you have to lay feathers down to get extra fire buff at the start
i was trying to do the ignite qte so i could have ignite through out the whole combo phase.. once ae runs out i applied sirn
oh because i thought i need to just bbb for the initial ignite qte
i thought i did that though
bbb is white paint?
tank gives dmg buff too? <:monkaS:814357658698121277>
end so scuffed but i cant be bothered to repeat, thats the way i did it with the 760. no idea how i got it down so low in p2 for that one.
k one sec
i gib up.. i cant even replicate the 760 much less try to push it <:PES2_AngerySleep:849698641190322198>
you dont go for weak point in p2/
<a:aPES2_HmmmmNod:929006632569028668>
<@148145559897636865> do you ult with ae in p1 and farm sp by dodging before p2?
<:HoSDerp:956555543378538596>
oh idk about ranks hfs
im not expert but i been seeing people celebrate 800 score so i'd say 815 is great
<:E_KEKpat:849972793314902057>
