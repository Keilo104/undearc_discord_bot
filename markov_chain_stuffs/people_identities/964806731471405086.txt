i'll send my favourite meiko tuning too <a:LukaNesoDance:1094101394849550437>
yes
YES
but no they pull out the nt and it sounds ass
sekai ver would be so good if the vs actually sounded like themselves
sooo good
<:MinoriBeg:1157601970622844939> <:MinoriBeg:1157601970622844939> <:MinoriBeg:1157601970622844939> <:MinoriBeg:1157601970622844939> <:MinoriBeg:1157601970622844939> <:MinoriBeg:1157601970622844939> <:MinoriBeg:1157601970622844939>
nt is so bad i think i would mind less if it sounded good but it just makes everyone sound worse or the same like cute na kanojo luka sounded  like miku <:depresso:1159828653413249086> ????
TRUE
<:depresso:1159828653413249086>
i was so excited for emurui cover and them singing together but then miku got like 500 lines
😭😭they always do m/f so dirty
tru <a:explodeandkohane:1148152881707491349> im small though so i dont know half the pjdiva songs
i didnt like antoya yoake to hotaru much because i couldnt hear an at all? 😭
akikoha meltdown was soo good
well that means more potential archive  songs i guess.. <:COPIUM:888554651367133204>
hmm
and all the ichimiku covers like <:kekhands:993361107878170655> hello??? where this content for the other guys in this game
she's so special she took away the vs ver for night sky patrol because she got a new arrangement
but SHARE
i wish they would stop giving ichiba everything like i know she's poster girl
i only remember what ray sounds like
hello world?
uhhhh
<:AmanaPain:984830912124563506>
lost one's was disgraceful
cant think of any notable leoni covers honestly
hmm yeah
spending their money designign crappy ui that didnt need to be changed <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
its been 3 years isnt that enough time
i wish we could have mixed group cover
<:depresso:1159828653413249086>

i mean i get why it is but like

<:EmuKiraKira:1162811244366024724> yesss theyre  gorgeous like same as 2d to every detail, it's so good
^^^ this 
especially new comm is like.  without all the camera movement it would be <:depresso:1159828653413249086>
me too 😭i know  right like please model the hair and not pour paint over their heads
yeah they do the chicken motion not the whole routine tho
<a:collapse:1063550316332720148>
and they chicken dance halfway througu the song idk what happened with the choreography
it sounds off in the song and also the mv goes piss yellow
<:Sbuga:1102934165256675368> uhh ok i think the mixing is ok then
or maybe you'll like it i cant stand it idk..  they sound.  Weird
awkwardly and/or unnecessary rap part <a:collapse:1063550316332720148> and the OoooOoOoo part sounds very kpop in the worst way you'll  underdatdn when you hear it <a:collapse:1063550316332720148>
it just feels very kpop? like
i cant tell cause idk mixing but
something about this one sucks <:AmanaPain:984830912124563506> maybe its just the vocals and vs ver will save it idk
i know but
<:AmanaPain:984830912124563506>

also  they say that robot will replace us all eventuakly anyway
ifind this very hard to do because the thought of people stealign  art to do ai with it makes me  very sad
unbiased
they say they dont support it but they are just looking at it um
my point is that ai art bad because steal from artist but they say art is stolen all the time regardless, and not allowing the ai art  in the server won't really change anything for the bigger problem anyway even though it is wrong

it was an abnormal day in arc city land. sunlight flooded over the painfully empty city. flowers drooped, trees shed their leaves - why was arc city land, formerly bright and occupied, now so.. lifeless? 

because everyone had moved to the astral express. picking up dinosaurs by storm, pom-pom conspired to transport all dinosaurs away from the malding arc city and into the galaxy. 

but there were still dinosaurs left! rubysaur and keiloraptor remained on barren arc city, despite their friends like greshamsaur and elishusaurus leaving them for pom-pom's train. even if they weren't playing the third honkisaur impact anymore, they still had other dinosaurish things to talk about.

one day, there was a great clamouring outside arc city land's gates. coming out to investigate, keiloraptor peeked through the gates to see everyone coming back! elishusaurus, tetosaurus, cherrisaur, astersaur, chromsaurus, everyone came back to arc city land. it was fun on the express, but arc city land would always be their home <:kanadehug:1099498043008630896>

ok whateve f
wrong channel
wait
i got clude to
Sure, here's my attempt at a rap about Nicki Minaj and Tetiana:

Verse 1:
Nicki Minaj, the queen of rap,
She's spitting lyrics, never taking a nap.
Her flow is smooth, her rhymes so sick,
She's got the game locked down, you can't touch her clique.

Chorus:
Nicki Minaj and Tetiana,
Ruling the rap scene, like a boss - they're bona fide icons.
Their rhymes are bold, their bars are tight,
They don't mess around, they're bringing the heat tonight.

Verse 2:
Tetiana's got skills, she's got game,
She's changing the game, putting haters to shame.
Her flow is slick, her rhymes on point,
She's coming correct, she won't disappoint.

Chorus:
Nicki Minaj and Tetiana,
Ruling the rap scene, like a boss - they're bona fide icons.
Their rhymes are bold, their bars are tight,
They don't mess around, they're bringing the heat tonight.

Bridge:
Together they're unstoppable, a force to be reckoned with,
Their flows are unstoppable, they're causing quite the stir.
When they step to the mic, they command respect,
They're the queens of rap, that's something you can't neglect.

Chorus:
Nicki Minaj and Tetiana,
Ruling the rap scene, like a boss - they're bona fide icons.
Their rhymes are bold, their bars are tight,
They don't mess around, they're bringing the heat tonight.

Outro:
Nicki and Tetiana, two legends of the game,
Their rhymes are fire, they're setting the world ablaze.
Their style is unique, their voices are strong,
They're the queens of the rap game, they can do no wrong.

i still remember everyone being liek  DONT TELL ASTER ABOUT THE  SECRET BASE
weird
that's kinda
huh
how can we live near chicago, we live in underground arc city <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
aw
mine's been fine <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
idts
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
oh
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
im so sleeeppy
<:catblush:963351912235810826>
i gotta gothanks for talking to me aoi
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i mean i'm sure there's a lot of people who can but compared to the whole playerbase there isn't a lot
not a lot of people can fc lvl 30-31 expert let alone mas <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it's just called a boss song because  33+ are the hardest songs
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
no it's just the level of the chart
mas 33+
yeah yaminabe <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912> <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912> <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912> kills me  
i can deal with the speed changes now tho it just takes a bit of practice
we've just been having a lot of boss songs lately <:kianasmuggers:1092293793614667796> not that recent charts got harder they just been releasing songs that allow for more difficult charting
championship songs are usually mas 32+ which is where we got kusare and setsuna trip (soon)
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
so i pray they don't further add more questionable things with jinsei
jinsei is coming in june but wup and ymnb were both mas 37 with their own little.  gimmicks (wup forced 4k+ and ymnb speed changes)
the 3 prsk ultimate winners are what's up pop, yaminabe and jinsei
yea because of prsk ultimate and championships
an easy 32 like bug or teo i still play 2k but hcm man <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i not clearing that in my lifetime
32-37 is wild territory, the gap in difficulty from an easy 32 to a hard 32 is way too big <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
it depends because
i mean
i disagree <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
interesting
i play arcaea on phone <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912> it's uh
2 finger rule was nothing more than a technicality
it's easier
people play 4k on some charts just cause
even below 35
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257> each to their own i suppose
and if you wanna fc 35+ with two fingers
there are two 4k+ charts in game already
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
it's not
like a phone is all i got <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912> i don't like it when people won't play with me or refuse to do stuff jsut bexause they dont have their ipad  because its not like phone is unplayable
i'm just so used to phone and then people complain they can't play good on phone <:kianasmuggers:1092293793614667796> privileged much
sometimes i forget most people have ipad and such
<:FelisDerpy:1047083097264500777> yea
i'm doing fine on phone tbh <:kianasmuggers:1092293793614667796> i don't think i'll ever need a bigger screen 
not that i could get one but yk
so i wouldn't know
i've never had a bigger screen
idm tho
im phone player
i dont have ipad lol
i wanna fc bug mas <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

<:Emu:1091404934492213388>
yup
i'm kinda hard stuck at lvl 31 though, difficulty jump from 31 to 32 is so big
<:EmuXD:1091404945141538907> i guess so
<a:emu_sparkle:1090055278696874155> thank!!! but speed doesn't determine skill there are definitely people way better than me who play on slower
sometimes 10.9
11.0 <:Emu_Ganba:977806900219502632>
i never really liked hated by life itself in the first place but today i found a really pretty yamine renri cover <a:emu_sparkle:1090055278696874155>

ive run out of ideas for honakana headcanons
kana will be stronk
the waterbottle and the vegetables

<:honakanastand:1072025347048087612>

taking out the labelled containers that honami cooked for her

i guess luke is ok <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:peepojama:1065041007911108668>
that gives me creepy stalker vibes
<:LivConfused:689882746453360665>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
and then they threw me into another one so i ran away
i barely did the investigation of the room
scary
i'm too scared to even play themis at night
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
how do i build tolerance to scary things
didn't have to call me out like that <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153> what do you mean it's been almost 300 days since i last played themis <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>

the default  fruit voice in my ehad

i'm not aggressive baban, i thought you already knew that  <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
why are like 4 of mine the highest and three almost the highest and the rest relatively high <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i saw all the other kids wailing on the first day so it took me a while to figure it out
i remember ny second day because i fake cried to get my mother to console me so that i could delay class
i remember my second day
but i permanently walk tiptoes
i literally dont know how anyone remembers that far back
bearverly..

idk  i just assumed it was like
i'm none of them
very cute
i do know
you pinged me
did i know
i don't wanna contaminate my hands
a passive kys
i feel like heki is an aggressive kys  but i'm like
everyone i've ever met
i can't stand stupid people either
my aggression is not that high <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i'm not aggressive
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
you forgot to include the one at the bottom heki <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105> ?????
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
owo enlarge
so maria will translate terms to aster's world
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
maria's world does not really exist
maria has realised
aster's world is cold <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
there is no comfort <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
maria does not see the point
maria does not want a hug <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
maria supposes this makes sense
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
maria does not see a difference
strange specification
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> maria doesn't need hug
maria brain no stress
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> maria is maria
maria <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
maria brain much easier to read <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> no stress
stress stress <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> maybe aster is stressed <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
when am i ever
aster would say
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
aster's brain is weird <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> trying to read it is hard <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> it is fine as is
no point
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
there is only work <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
aster does not know what fun is <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
everything is held to high standards in aster's world
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
not high enough <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> but if aster lets go then aster will be just like them
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> that wouldn't pass aster's testing at all
exist so freely <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> aster sees things and wonders how people
because no one else cares <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> so aster lies
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> no one else does
baban understands aster <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> but what is the reason
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> aster claims not to put high standards on anyone else but aster knows this is not true
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> aster is not a good person
you can't trust a word i say <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i lie all the time
i'm bad at being honest because when i'm honest i end up alone again <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i like your twt username baban

THE NEW MMJ COMM  IS KAFU
yay!
and now i'm going to school
and apparently it's  the kind of spider that caused  at least hundreds of baby spiders outside and in our bathroom
went out and now it's gone
for some reason it had 4 legs
there is a spider in my room
hhhhhhhh
and honami takes kanade on walks with her dog for exercise
and  if they eat out they always get takeaway and sit outside in fresh air  so that it's not too loud and uncomfy for kanade
whenever they walk in public honami always makes sure kanade is on the inside of the path to cover her from the sun
and then honami probably brings out little cupcakes she made not too sweet  with little paper drawings of them on it and they sing happy birthday and take the papers out and eat it and then kanade keeps the little paper drawings on her desk as a reminder of her birthday
SO CUTE
and she can't really taste it but she nods and listens nonetheless
and every time honami makes apple pie she details every little change to kanade!!!!
well.. apple pie isn't really my favourite. but honami looks so happy whenever she makes it. i guess it's not a bad thing.
and kanade wonders..
so ofc honami defaults!!! to apple pie!!!
kanade is like oh.. i don't want to trouble you, anything is fine..
kanade's birthday and honami asks what would you like me to cook?
theyre so cute
honakan

im gonna be so tired if i wake up
bjkdhksahaoahjqkqhsgisai
i literally can't i'm dying
how to sleep in hot weather
how does that work
oh what
no i have access to the whole channel it's just that my role got taken so i'm poking fun  at how odd th epermissions were set up
it's a bot config channel for mods that someone made  that i now have access to despite not being a mod because i don't have the captains role 
dev mode/other discord modifications don't  have anything to do with it
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105> ?? i don't even know what you mean anymore
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> i think that's concerning that there is a tool that lets you bypass user-set permissions
yea i do too it's good
channels are user-made, discord can't control what permissions each category/channel has
it's basically just adding extra settings
no dev mode lets you copy IDs and stuff
i just find it funny that mods configured it so that instead of @/everyone can't see, they made it so that @/captains can't see only
it'sbecause tet took my captains away but
it's not a discord thing it's mod category
no
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
why can i see this
will brush my teeth first
hmm okay
no like i don't have issue  with eyes it's just that  seele is fullbody so i don't get a big part of the canvas to play wih them <:heh:964926244447723560>
what shiuld i copy tho
maybe i'll try
oh

electrons more tightly bound to the atoms
insulating material has
so
i don't get how the electron stuff works..?? like how does electron enable electricity to flow <:nyaaCry:679796247967694906>  or the positive/negative stuff <:kekhands:993361107878170655>  i know proton is positive and electron is negative and stuff but then what is ion core and why is it stationary like 

??? <:bb_cry:1066240640792416307>

<a:menheraBall:809322724383129628>
i want yelan
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
<a:menheraNod:809322720319504384> am sure you'll find one, better to take time and find good person than deal with assholes out of desperation
what
it will just show up and present itself
<a:menheraNod:809322720319504384>
i don't have to chase death either
this means
i suppose so <a:menheraSpin:809322721741504562> good idea luna
how do you chase an answer that keeps changing <a:menheraNod:809322720319504384>
people are too variable <a:menheraNod:809322720319504384> even after using equation, solution is not always right
i suppose i'd need experience to determine that <a:menheraNod:809322720319504384>
i don't know how i am <a:menheraNod:809322720319504384>
i guess it's like having a friend but closer
<a:menheraNod:809322720319504384>
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777> yaaay

where are you going? <:MikuKiraWxS:1004863813633445969>
and it looks tasty
and if you roast them again  it turns green
then they all go black
they grow seaweed and put  it into big wheels and dry them in sun
there was also one about seaweed
apparently its tasty
<:emu_wa:1039362614154760222> <:emu_wa:1039362614154760222> <:emu_wa:1039362614154760222>
the guy ate one that was 30 years old
and then they put it in jars for fermentation
and then they lay them all out on straw in the sun for a week
they put salt and let it dehydrate
the radish they grow can be up to 90% water
i watched one about dried radish
is about random food
it is good
heheheeh while everyone is sleeping im gonna watch chinese show

<:KasumiBigBrain:670321645998571542> inanimate objects

<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> it would be so much easier to just disappear

i ask him how to do <:PareoFuee:944093382735708161> and he said something like..
<:hinaLUL:710980546179629157> someone i used to like once recited ~300 digits of pi with only 2 mistakes
i play osu <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
i move here
i know less about genshin than i do honkai and i know jackshit about honkai story so
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:KohaneBow:1040673770651795506> so. i am very grateful that i can still come back here
then the one friend i made decided i wasn't good enough anymore <:PareoFuee:944093382735708161>
<:PareoFuee:944093382735708161> while i've been less active here i was talking to people more around my age and they're all so stupid
i should get reference but i'm lazy
okay
<:Harukaamazed:983034542401134602>
<:bellasad:959706391134732350> trying to make it look more like noodles..
<:ArisaConcern:929615349761069138> i'm okay with sharing my voice. it may sound shit but i'm okay with that.. and if i get feedback i can improve too
sometimes it sleeps on the floor, sometimes it bounces around my brain, sometimes it goes on an adventure ! music is really nice
i just imagine.. a little creature in the back of my head. and it reacts differently to different songs
<:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057>
maybe
<:Harukaamazed:983034542401134602>
hehee
..how do you sing that <:Harukaamazed:983034542401134602>
i remember you mentioning that
<:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057>
<a:Vibe:1002644823720853527> it's slow.. nice for study, nice for work, nice for crying, nice for sitting
<:Haruka4koma:984871345806512208>
like
i really
roza cute..
what was she eating <:Haruka4koma:984871345806512208>

hii neko <a:BABA_IS_WAVE_ANIM:996074001812176916>
oh, good luck <:Sadge:790930438733955092>
but if we remove heki's wisdom teeth he'll only have idiocy left <:Haruka4koma:984871345806512208>
obviously <:Haruka4koma:984871345806512208> but people do typically get wisdom teeth removed for health reasons, not just comfort
it will be an issue <:Haruka4koma:984871345806512208> they can become impacted and screw with your whole mouth
go dentist. <:Haruka4koma:984871345806512208> they make issues
it's always supportive until they get bored
i don't know anything on the internet that's supportive and open fun
<:Miku_Yay:974636835273855016>
hm

<:HUH:1000019114863104041>
heki?? <:ArisaConcern:929615349761069138>
ruby is strange but nice to me sometimes <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062> ruby told me not to pull irene once, and now it's craftable <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:hinaLUL:710980546179629157> i never had a cartoon crush or anything
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324> you are same as always ruby

<:mhhorhug:998941262377918574>

<:shrug:877047647511384064> i can't say i was completely comfortable with his actions. but he also didn't deserve to be banned so unnecessarily, and i was waiting to apologise to him as i know i'm blocked. <a:hc_taigasigh:919278992677302292>

<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
<:concern:966623298639261746>
is this for
what
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432> what have youbeen doing
just irritating
sorry for late replies i'm filling rn but
and then there's the thing that i'm a lot younger than them <:penseyes:982065674761424948>
i care you too citri <:hug:1052226608569790464>
how irritating. don't know what else they want from me, i can't shit out words that will magically fix everything
but! i guess i was just the same as everyone else so what does it matter
<:heh:964926244447723560>
and that's what i said <:HarukaThought:983609880445325327> life is just. how it is, you don't get to control it
you shouldn't have you don't deserve yada yada 
then why does it keep happening? surely that therefore means that i do, in fact deserve
on one of the many occasions before this that i tried to console them
that's what i said to them
funny
<:HarukaThought:983609880445325327>
but really
insensitive
<:HarukaThought:983609880445325327>
which even i couldn't be assed to reply to as if we didn't have enough on our hands already
not to mention another person having a fucking crisis after they left
annoying
so
if they wanna talk to me then they will i guess
anyway
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
hm
<:Meiko_Sigh:974637361185042492>
nah side is cute
<:HarukaThought:983609880445325327>
they're also not in the situation that they can get professional help
i know
and frankly i'm sick of chasing people
they won't talk to me either, at least not voluntarily
guess my bullshit advice wasn't enough for them
but still
had a talk with someone else in that chat and i know it's not their fault and they didn't want to upset us
<:25ji_kanade_smile:1014648244795625634> then left us to clean up i guess!
deleted messages as soon as they sent them, deleted a shit ton of their past messages and then left
in group chat
kinda fell apart
they
well <:25ji_kanade_smile:1014648244795625634>

<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062> i think that. having your opinion constantly flooded can be very frustrating 
even if it's just a design
but i'm sure taihen will be willing to come back after some time <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062> ~~same thing just happened to me so~~
discord does that sometimes 
not sure what the conditions are for it tho because sometimes it happens sometimes not

<:life:1001518241610485781>

two months later he lost it up a mountain

but i don't have shit to do outside anw
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030> boring asf
all i remember in the timeslot between stella coming and going is like really vaguely what stella did instead of where i was
but i don't even remember what i wasdoing in there let alone decorate it
wel fenri if it was a house design game yes
n she doesnt like it presumably becausethere isn't anything to do inside one's brain
i know stella refers to it as going inside
yea
idont really remember what it's like either
mm <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
she also isn't that willing to look into things
yea
<:thonk:1052226584779694161>
like when stella is here i'm not necessarily gone tho i dont know where i am either <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
not really
but i cant exactly recall for a while <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
i usuually backread whatewvr she was doing
stella is energy and i am Not
im tored
noits just that
probably because it's too much thinking <:PikaXD:966624196564242432> lazy <a:25ji_mafuyu_pat:1013306204837138462>

but at least headphones are attached to each other so you can't lose them like earbuds
i will just try to ensure bunny safety although if the cockroach crawls onto my bed it doesn't matter

pluralkit
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
tupperbox does the same thing but it'sfor roleplaying instead so less detail and stuff
so the bot gives everyone different profile so it's easier
and then the bot will delete my message and resend it from a different profile that you can customise
like solis' bracket is sol;;whatever she wants to say
then you add members for every alter/headmate/part that talks and you give each member a bracket
you can make a system (since it's for those with dissociative disorders specifically)
so it's a bot and
thank you!
tuppers is like just a profile but pluralkit is like a whole thing <:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
pluralkit is for systems you get a lot more descriptions and stuff and cusotmisation
<@503044914016419840> Uhh hello sorry for ping <:FelisOk:1047083219587182682> Could we please have the pluralkit bot in this server
I think if we can get it you can use it too, so that if taihen shudan or  sheer is speaking everyone gets their own profile
That's ok thank you
i think it will be useful for you too
hello is any mod around sorry i dunno who is online or who to ask <:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>

<:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488>
if the polish is still wet you might be able to just rub it off
it's not that hard to just be careful <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
why
or else you have to get nail polish remover to get that shit off and you may as well wipe the whole nail because then you have like gaps on the sides where you removed polish <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
like the skin around your fingers and stuff too
but make sure you don't get it on your skin
don't need anything before hand
do it in layers don't just. brush a bunch of it on initially
don't put too much on the brush like you only need a little bit.. otherwise it'll drip everywhere on your hand and environment
get nail polish
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>

I will stay on this account I guess
<:HMM:966625453194485760> and idt you can take laptop apart
he did stuff and then told me to use firefox and then installed this cpu temperature thing
wish i could have a normal conversation with him without almost crying but anyway <:life:1001518241610485781>
I got my dad to look at it
oh apprently it does <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> doesn't have a fan i googled it
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831> aaaaa idk just gonna wait until my dad is in a good mood <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782> maybe i'll have to ask cause i don't wanna fry the laptop
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831> when i open task manager sometimes cpu  is at like 90-100% and then suddenly drops to 20-30 like ??? <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
only discord and drawing program
<:HMM:966625453194485760> is weird idk why it's doing this because i don't run anything that would make it overheat i'm pretty sure
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831> i'm scare d of my dad aaaaaaaaa
idk what to do
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396> <:FelisBread:1047083302365966396> <:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>

WHAT DID THEY DO TO TASK MANAGER <:TeriMald:973795215045455872> <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
wa it's so hot rn i just finished installing update
I don't think it should be so hot just because of summer <:HMM:966625453194485760>
It's always overheating, when I draw I can feel the heat like emanating from laptop
I can't take it apart either
??? I don't hear any fan
Google tells me to take apart laptop and clean fan but I don't think it even has a fan
<:HMM:966625453194485760> I have computer  issue
<:creepysmile:996838443827073105> he blew it off the pan but it ran back towards it like do you want to die
MY DAD ALMOST FRIED A SPIDER
LMAO HELP
Also because idek if it'll get rerun since no jp announcement
I think I'll just pull and skip anni if necessary zzz her lim hair sucks  on that one anyway
Mmm
I don't wanna spark tho
not far off 200
57k
i just worry i won't get luka evillious <:HMM:966625453194485760>
stresses
uuuu
march..?
then the next thing i have to pull isn't until like
if i luccsacc mafuyu and luka birthday
this is my event schedule
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
Should I pull for her
Reminds me of samsara
Luka 🫵
Co-op is annoying anyway
<:life:1001518241610485781>
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> I have maybe two friends that play 
One is really. good at the game and the other is <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> idk? kinda distant
I get people into games but they're the only ones dropping it
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
Good luck Baban
My friends all dropped it <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> Friends that play prsk..
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
Spreadsheet
Ponytail Luka when 🫵
All they did was move a strand of hair
The lim hair in the second card is so <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
That's her best lim hair <:FelisOho:1047083363263074304> It's so cute
I wanna skip Evillious but.. uuuuu
Uh
<:kleepray:963350716901113876> <:kleepray:963350716901113876> <:kleepray:963350716901113876> But
But if I don't keep trying I'll never be able to do it so I'm still stuck here
Me too I'm sick of not being able to fc things
When I was tiering on jp I got that much too <:life:1001518241610485781> But I got sick
I think I gained around that much on the last day of melodies
Mood
Yes
His new card is good tho
I dislike toya too
The amount of people I've seen saving for sdsc is insane
Actually idk how important the story is but everyone talks about it so it's important probably
Melodies (Mafuyu focus) just ended, sdsc (Toya focus, vbs, integral part of vbs story, akitoya content) is happening after this event
This event is dead... like.. completely dead
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> The Luka hair is so good I want to skip it but I don't want to skip it
I guess not because no favourites in there
Are you pulling
Idk why it doesn't have side stories because the other cards do but those are gacha exclusive
The Miku Evillious card doesn't even have side stories it's kinda sad
I've planned all my gacha up until 2nd anniversary on EN but I'm still anxious
Me too
Later
Maybe
I'll open it back up
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
Tired <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> Too much going on lately
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> I tried to get everyone out but mods have override
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257> I just saw my CPU usage shoot up to 94% then drop straight down to 18% what is going on
I'm not running anything except Task Manager but the laptop is so hot
I don't understand
Wtf is this
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941> I hate technology issues

like why is someone else organising your birthday thing <:HMM:966625453194485760>
that's not even the friend whose birthday it is
is
the weird thing
we were gonna go bowling
bowling

<:HMM:966625453194485760>
express that i dont wanna go

uugh
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
now i have to pay
fr i didnt wanna go in the first place
why am i paying to go to a birthday party
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
some guy in a coffin
and it started with
this
i started playing
asterpleb trying their best
my throat hurt s now <:sitstarege:1040586023740125244> expldoes
here you go baban
<:Terichew:973794176015675392> why is this so hard to sing
ok
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
but which song
en jp i'd prefer not cn and no kr
before my parents come home
can someone give me song to sing
yes
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304> baban does thr advertising
HEHEHEHHEE
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
i have. already done aishite phony dreaming chuchu
what song to sing <:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
also the power ups are gacha so you can roll for a one time use elf to do stuff like destroy this square, free homu etc
then complications arise like oh no kiana set the kitchen on fire use ice element to free those squares
and you need to do levels to fix them
or its like gardenscapes and the battleship/valk dorms are broken
<:Terichew:973794176015675392> idk honkai lore someone else can do that part
umm
and its like levels and the aim of the game is
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
things of charqcters with that element
and if you use it it zaps all the
line up 5 turns into a coloured homu
and if you line up 4 it turns into different homu variations
honkai match-3
you should use all three bronyas its like candy crush you line them up for extra bonuses <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
the way they demanded it
at least she's pretty
<:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728> and uhhhhhh its downloading over 8000 somethings
but on jp instead of en because i can't be bothered to go to en app storr
love nikki

this time i will
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304> i always wanted to do freeze team but lost 50/50 lots so
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396> i feel like my old account is.. too cluttered, i pulled for what i wanted and now i just have a mess built around keqing

rerun will take 5 years so i just don't wanna touch dendro
yea thats why.. hh <:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
is nice
hello!
prioritise anemo support instead
<:Terichew:973794176015675392> i also don't want to pull nahida so i think i might skip ayato
kazu fish bennett huh <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> sounds cheap
ew
🎶
i don't really want to pull yoimiya
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> whi do you usually use ayato with anyway
cause dps.. and then support but idk what i will do in the period in  between pulls 
i guess dps would replace kaeya in my team then <:FelisBread:1047083302365966396> and i can slowly fill in supports
does that sound like ok plan <:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
i'm saving for ayaya and ganyu, then shenhe koko ayato <:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>

and why do you feel the need to do that, ruby? <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
the value of ruby is independent to you <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> ruby's actions do not excuse your own
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
how do you fall out of love
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>

<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
go to sleep <:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> sleep well.
No
<:concern:966623298639261746>
what. <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
i get told i'm mature for my age. because i don't value my birthday, because i can sit and study without talking all day. 

really? <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> must be easy if this is all it takes for maturity.
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> hi ruby
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
are you trying to encourage the pedophile allegations <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
bruh is a dinosaur <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
and bruh calls *us* edgy. <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
i don't know. i just do what i'm asked to. <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>

KEILO BULLY tats so bright
hehehe thabk you
i think eli did
keilo!!!  i didnt do it
my life in a nutshell<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:Terichew:973794176015675392> sometimes i want to pack my laptop and my stuffed toys and just walk out.. then i can lay on some grass and play honkai before dying of dehydration
<:slacc:963350438940397588> you sound like him
i think he is bad and so am i
but i think that it is not fair to blame me for the same faults he has
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
way too easily
like
i snap
sigh<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
no ice cream is bad for me <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:Terichew:973794176015675392> desperate times call for desperate measures
i only start fights with them when i want ice cream
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
see what i don't like is 
i'm exactly the same as him <:Terichew:973794176015675392> i get mad very quickly 
but he still gets angry at me for that WHEN HE'S THE SAME 

so why don't i get to blame him when he is constantly blaming me
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432> ummmmmm
<:Terichew:973794176015675392> but then why does it keep happening
sometimes my dad talks to me and apologises for being so aggressive and angry 90% of the time
yea.. like if you're scared they're gonna tell on you why don't you just not do it at all
i don't know if i  prefer being like this or dumbass like him but like at least he's happy right
<:Terichew:973794176015675392> my brother has it easier than my sister and i did but as a result he is significantly more stupid
<:concern:966623298639261746>
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
my parents are.. were.. violent? they stopped hitting us once we were old enough to tell other people about it but idk if they'll do the same to my brother now
i wanna fight them too but i'm a twig they'll beat me up <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
my parents are so friendly <:Terichew:973794176015675392> so nice, so kind, offering to pay, offering to wash up, but the moment everyone else is out of hearing range<:Okayge:1008753708391206982> better prepare for a long crying session
yea like its so awkward especially when theyre nerdge and then every relative is like omg why aren't your grades as good as name
<:Terichew:973794176015675392> i only have really old cousins or toddler cousins. all fucking annoying
my mother made me put up the christmas tree while playing music that got on my nerves so completely <:Terichew:973794176015675392> and she knows i hate christmas and yet she still wants me to help her put up the tree because SHE wants it 

flashing light shit christmas is nothing but an excuse to eat dinner with relatives who  only ever care about your academics and regift the clothing you can't wear anymore
<:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488> i love my family !!! hahahahahahaa
or at least that's what they tell me!!
but they're my parents so by default i have to love them unconditionally <:Terichew:973794176015675392>
<:slacc:963350438940397588> it's always harder to stay at the top than get there. there's just.. not time 

and anyway <:Okayge:1008753708391206982> who cares about loved ones when they're the ones who continually push you up to that lonely, lonely peak
because it's not that easy<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
teletubby
<:Terichew:973794176015675392> i don't like this topic because it hits too close to home
<:Terichew:973794176015675392> i don't like it. i wish i was more content
i dunno maybe its just me but. there is something satisfying about getting above things i couldb't before
<:slacc:963350438940397588> i don't want to just do better i want to do best
<:Terichew:973794176015675392> i dunno. i just don't like being below people
me!!!
you have to push people away or else <:Terichew:973794176015675392> they catch up
sometimes? it's always lonely
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>

<:hmm:1012492971884695592>
ok
🙂get off your lazy ass and ask right now
i don't have the energy right now to look into it
but
fleur's response is off something's not right
<:hmm:1012492971884695592>
where did the r go
good luck cherry <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
everything is okay
<:Terichew:973794176015675392> but that's okay. and i like the full combo noise.
sometimes when i bald songs i don't like it is very much a chore <:TeriStare:973793234096648202> and in the end everything is done for completion
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202> it depends
games.. <:Terichew:973794176015675392> games are more work to me
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
enjoyable things
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
but i'll try
i can't guarantee anything
i guess
<:yippee:1002596802656223274> thank you cherry
thank you hakcer <:kleeHeart:997543436456558623>
don't waste energy on that
it's okay
<:hmm:1012492971884695592> what if i die before i fc endmark
there's still things left for me to do
because
<:yippee:1002596802656223274> i'm too scared to go anyway
even if no one cares and it would just be easier and i would much rather be at the bottom of a waterfall
<:rozano:963353554532319252>
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202> assuming i last that long
<:hmm:1012492971884695592>
only my imaginary friend understands <:PardoCaught:969639185826848848> of course she understands! because she's me
when i was little i knew what was happy and what was sad.. <:hmm:1012492971884695592> 
honkai and kiana and mei was happy.. maths worksheet was sad..
okay well.. i hope it goes soon then 🙂been a few years of this now
<:yippee:1002596802656223274> yes
i have my own discord server where i talk to my imaginary friend <:PardoCaught:969639185826848848> but i always forget to check there
<:hmm:1012492971884695592> maybe 
i don't really have book though
the issue at hand is that fleur believes aster wants to pursue romantic relations due to aster's initial agreement with the question presented

the solution to the issue.. <:Terichew:973794176015675392> aster should communicate properly with fleur that aster in fact does not wish to participate. <:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
logic <:hmm:1012492971884695592> 
i like logic
🙂🙂🙂
🙂i feel sharp
grade 8 don't ask me elementary middle high i don't speak american
<:yippee:1002596802656223274> just like an identification chart
if i am doing certain things that means i feel this emotion
so in normal terms that should mean <:hmm:1012492971884695592>
lying in bed <:hmm:1012492971884695592> kinda feeling sideways <:hmm:1012492971884695592>
🙂well i have the rules dictating what i feel but right now what i am doing is
probably
:borrysit;
actually it is cool right now it's not sweaty or hot 🙂
it is summer. in australia. i am going to be sweating regardless of how i feel <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
probably because there's nothing inside me! 🙂
i always feel cold inside
not shaking
i don't know what i feel
am i
or maybe i am
🙂i'm not scared
<:yippee:1002596802656223274> i mean
am i scared? i should be right 
i should be scared to hurt their feelings and how they'll react 

weird <:slacc:963350438940397588>
ok good job aster no breaking down today <:TeriGun:973793149992435752> <:TeriGun:973793149992435752> <:TeriGun:973793149992435752> 
i'll sort things w/ fleur rn since they're online
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202> 8 messages from ivory fleur i don't know 
they've always been ivory in my head but when i came back to the server after months someone named fleur was there 

well they have the same roblox account it's obviously ivory LMAO but damn it's. so diferent 
<:slacc:963350438940397588> guess i jsut miss friends that have long since come and gone
literally the only thing said about it was in our dms <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
like
it's like <:hmm:1012492971884695592> nothing
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
yeah
<:senkostare:963350847528517642>
<:hmm:1012492971884695592> the thing with this is that i really don't feel it's going to amount to anything you know
we've been friends for a year already and the conversation i'm having w/ them is no different to whatever we talked about before
nothing has changed and somehow i doubt things ever will 

<:slacc:963350438940397588> eh
exactly 🙂
🙁 aster doesn't need to be preserved
it's okay
not the first time
🙂
nothing amounts to anything in the end
i don't mind being closer anyway, it won't amount to anything in the end
🙁 they need someone to talk to though
we got married on a discord bot and it kinda. escalated from there <:concern:966623298639261746>
i guess i can spare some time
i can't talk to fleur right now i need to sekai and study and sleep but
<:heh:964926244447723560> thisisfine ok going to study for maths exam hahhaaaha
i don't. want to work
<:cryge:966624721611403294> can't i jsut sit here and cry over themis soundtrack
Need to work
Sigh
heehehhee
heya taihen
i think they need someone to talk to
<:Terichew:973794176015675392> hm
🙂 i think i accidentally got myself into a relationship but
i won't
and he's happy because of you ! <:kleeHeart:997543436456558623>

YES ITS THIS SONG DHSKHDJS
its called aldo im pretty sure <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
idk
and he never got to say what he wanted to her i think
right down the street
the mother that left him lived literally
and yet when he died
his mother abandoned him
and how everyone loved him dearly but in the past
it's about an old man named aldo
oohh yeah i remember
i think
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:hmm:1012492971884695592>
but i don't remember the song name and the only lyric i remember is aldo passed away aged 84
really strongly reminds me of cherry
like
and it reminds me of cherry
song
there's this
<:hmm:1012492971884695592>
ASTER

<a:KleeMad:806625136316514325> aaaa
that's not even relevant
like
diavoros argue with keilo about valks becoming less relevant only a patch after they come out and his only comeback is 'do you have any ass left you keep spamming lmfao is that a verbal tic'
diavoros misgender keilo and blame it on 'i only know he/she'
hello carv <a:Kana_Rave:974688203325968447>
she always had yellow ribbons
she was nice
I had a friend when I was younger named dia
<:wxs_rui_think:989116262577737748>
<a:kohanewalkback:983616582615982120>
THE ARGUMENT THAT ITS ONLY ABOUT VALKS THEY CARE ABOUT IS??!?! <:kekhands:993361107878170655>
LIKE KEILO HAS NEVER BEEN AN APONIA SIMP OR ANYTHING
and then the argument was SO DUMB <:ughhh:1002096701944893533> keilo making good point about how mihole bullying with aponia and the HoT weapon and other valks with similar situations
<:cryge:966624721611403294>

<:mafuyusmiley:1038203282465751070>
diavoros probably is like this person's pfp not anime girl so pronouns are he/him
EXACTLY
<:hc_toroscreamAHHHHH:905940871860592732>
<:Mizuki_Mad:961432122491551784> what do you mean you only know two pronouns one of which keilo uses and you still had to use the wrong one
and literally keilo has TWO OPTIONS OK you can use she for keilo or you can use they for keilo IF YOU DON'T LIKE ONE THEN THE OTHER IS RIGHT THERE <a:kohanewalkback:983616582615982120>
i only know he/she i only use they in reference to two people because that's how it's supposed to be used like shut the fuck up <:Starege:965940930895036477>
i don't understabd!!! his thought process!!!
when do i get to commit violence against diavoros

jiiiii
<:mafuyuunamused:1038202944362905690> idk
obviously when look closer you can see but
i think the thing is with hu tao its dark colour but the peach looks the same as skin tone with yours
idk <:cryge:966624721611403294> maybe im just against designs that all look the same colour
like you can differentiate
hu tao is different tho
there's barely any pink on the desigj in the first place
i think the pink is fine tho
i feel like the colours are very similar to each other, on first glance i thought the character was just. all peach
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
why would you want mroe green the whole thing is green
no
they look very onviously different and have different colours and design
well i dont think the similar hair colour means the same
what are you pointing at my message for you were the one who sugegsted eye change
1 looks betetr to me but if you go 2 at least leep eyes idk why you'd want more grene in an already overly grene deisng
luna desijg s always so good dhdjdjdjhhj
i think need some contrast all green looks weirid
2 has too nuch greeb imo
Oh wair I rhought bruh said that and i was like why are you worryweirding your own message

constructing a mimir playlist
hypocritical is to not do what you preach <:mafuyusmiley:1038203282465751070> therefore, getting a partner while being mentally unstable and advising others not to get a partner due to being mentally unstable is indeed hypocritical

once upon a time, there was a little group of dinosaurs living in arc city land. 
one day, lunasaurus came to the group holding a container.. 

lunasaurus opened the container to reveal jiaozi and some tomato egg noodles!
woggers, said hakcersaur <:WOGGERS:1022482287016804514> 
now, lunasaurus didn't have to go all the way to restaurant to buy food.. <:ln_saki_boohoo:989287612135141386> lunasaurus could cook in arc city land! lunasaurus was very dalao chef <:25ji_mafuyu_yay:1016818324459495504> 

even fenrisaurus, renowned for not getting along with luna, remarked 'praise luna'.

lunasaurus ate their food, and everyone lived hungrily ever after (except luna). <:kana_mimir:1039363090040504361>

my poor albedo getting bullied by plants <:Sadge:790930438733955092>
omg what <:worrymad:987990517453303820> so thats why i kept taling damage near those mushrooms
<:mafuyuunamused:1038202944362905690> so it would be like nilou main on field right
what is that supposed to mean hakcer <:d_stare:892147125926916156>
the dendro hydro only in team
nilou passive <:Sadge:790930438733955092> actually i dunno what it does
i wish i could farm talent books on whatever day i wanted
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
probably gonna have to build collei then
oh i see yeah that makes sense <:25ji_kanade_think:992435648696955030>
idk what collei does either but at least i know how to build xingqiu <:PikaXD:966624196564242432> stack er
yea my collei is level 1 <:mafuyuunamused:1038202944362905690> i thought he'd be more useful
i forgot what xingqiu does tbh <:KanadeJii:837530377274130472> i think it's mainly hydro application but i got enough of that
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
nilou/traveller/kokomi/xingqiu
i'm running like
i will eradicate them all <:Rin_PeekLN:974635391980277830>

babanlao is strong and adapts to any condition playing with thumb because you only need hands and phone
<a:kskype_shakehead:912896054586925086> asterpleb is just lazy
asterpleb also usually plays in bed not desk <:PikaXD:966624196564242432> so in fact asterpleb does have ideal angle
asterpleb is just a shrimp
its easy babanlaoest you put phone down and tap note with index finger <a:honkai_fuhua_tap:1010172867704524900>
i dont get how ti play thumbs <a:Kanade_Shake:977806608283361280> babanlao
my fingers are just. not friends
thumbs are easier to tap st thr same time for me
also this is why i can't fc bug ex because of the ending <:KanadeJii:837530377274130472> <:KanadeJii:837530377274130472> <:KanadeJii:837530377274130472>
the next note too fast
i didnt do that cause when i tried it kept marking me as good because i cant. tap at the same time so i was tapping like
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
WAHHH like it should be easy to tap but. too big
i really hate big notes
<:LukaMelt:820910965742239774>
i can only get through it like 1/10 times
a lot
i do that
yeah
<a:KEKE_IS_DANCE:978697343421538334>
i tap the gold with left finger and the other two with right

but then bandori
at the same time
<:KohanePlead:1001616277527334993>
arcaea is hard because instead of one lane to tap notes on there's two
<:Miku_YayVBS:974636596206927892>
Could always get both
I'm not sure if I should suffer with arcaea or with bandori

I WAS BEING SARCASTIC IN THAT i can play

i don't know of water hockey <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
that's interesting <:Kanade_Police:974688232304418868>
oohh so it is safety
if you're left handed booho
you can only hold the stick right handed way
no like
oh that's what you're saying
idk which kind of hockey we played on grass which presumably is not where you play hockey <:koha_sip:1039363568979681362>
<:koha_sip:1039363568979681362> there are no left handed hockey players apparently,, you can only play right handed  

i wonder if that stemmed from oppression of left-handed people or maybe it is safer or i dunno <:KohaneEh:739784293772951687>

in roblox my cousin goes to people's houses and pretends to be an innocent little child to gain access to their house then takes every piece of food in their fridge and glitches out

she's cute
<:25ji_mafuyu_smile:1001430318974251008>
most are kinda bad on model
yea uh
all of mafuyu's cards are good <:bceFoamcatLoveHappy:993424883973365820> even tho the sports festuval 3* makes her look like a serial killer
i got a 4* of him and it literally took me 2 days to realise it wasnt a 3*
len too all his cards are
LMAO
kanade has like 73733783747492 cards for some rrason
i love mafuyu
<:anaaa:1024227053656084571>
i dont understand why everyone lieks tsukasa he's so annoying <:kekhands:993361107878170655>
maybe they make less of the lower rarity catds cause everyone loves mizuki so much they make more money from the whales wanting their 4*s
<:worryCoffeeWeird:950513512831131688> hm 
idk
yea 4* cards are much more abundant than 2 and 3*
thats normal
like you have  whole year of events literally laid out for you wdym you didnt know
wdym
who spend their crystals and when a banner of their favourite comes around theyre like omg i didnt know :(
i hate thise people
character tax! the more popular someone is the worse it'll be to tier
and then mizuki like mizuki tax alone will make the event bad let alone tsukasa and akito too <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
tsukasa + akito most popular from those groups too i think
vbs + wxs + n25 most popular groups
yea
just saying
i think white day will be worse than hermit
there's so much to look at and i just HHEHEHE i love that card set so muchhhh
and the gems they're holding
and how the screens are whole or broken
look at all the cards, look at the pillar thing theyre sitting on and how some of them are more rusted or broken
i'm tiering that one because val will be right after and everyone will tier valentine's so it'll be dead
there's so much to analyse in that
OH I LOVE LOVE LOVE THAT CARD SET
my brain is fried like eli's egg
what event is that
<:Miku_Sorry:961432152279498772> booli booli
if i get akito or tsukasa i wil actually cry
i'm gonna skip that i think
white day mizu
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>

she's soft <a:25ji_mafuyu_pat:1013306204837138462> cute little thing
what a shame everything she does is fake <:Miku_Sorry:961432152279498772>
she likes puzzles and pretty things, like flowers and intricate designs (teacup and stuff)

she likes spending time outside too especially in places with lots of plants<:25ji_mafuyu_stare:989698379602853928>
oh i remembered wrong am looking at the doc i wrote
she is a detective and always wants to find the truth, even if she has to lie 
is not really real, she is always acting in case someone find out her true intentions

she likes crafts and reading and stuff, she has long attention span and gets lost in work
she also likes decorating and traditional things <:bceFoamcatLoveHappy:993424883973365820> because it makes her feel at home
she doesn't like people because she thinks they are just a burden <:25ji_mafuyu_peek:1013306207009779783>

<:Kanade_Police:974688232304418868>
oops i click too fast
1 feels too cold
2 i think its softer
but also it stops your period so sounds good
but it has side effects
you can remove uterus surgically
i don't really have much to say on the topic,, i don't know so i won't spout ignorant nonsense 

<:slacc:963350438940397588> people are bad
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
i think the only thing you can hate enough to justifiably interrupt any conversation with is diavoros
everything has a reason <:25ji_mafuyu_seriously:1025871811512123503> just up to the person if they'd like to discuss or not
i like logic <:mafuyusmiley:1038203282465751070>
if you don't like a character then you don't talk about them often but when they're brought up you just. 'i don't like' and that's it 

whereas some fans that character is their whole identity <:mafuyustare:1038203220947910656>
i think there's a difference
i mean
<:mafuyu:994083202308251739>because people always ask why why why

NO <:TEARS:879163139076288613>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
was a typo
no i canr understand japanese but the wxs breaking up thing
wheeze
yeah
<:smileyyy:1001385599443423302> probably why theyre en exclusive
did not expect that it would be so popular
<:A_WheezeTao:793919527208484924> the latest event was insane i
jp needs way more anyway
<a:cheerheart_hh:747236182202515466>
you're doing fine
i typically save up minimum 30-40 before i tier <:borrySit:1001445019661639680>
i thoughr you meant the cans
oh
damn <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
how many you got
since everyone like mizuena more than mafuyu
i willl stay strong for my mafuyuyu <:A_HuPray:791078347898880010> tiering should be easier on melodies than hermit anyway
no
i'm tempted to pull hermit
<:concern:966623298639261746>
byebey
<:catblush:963351912235810826>
top 1k
go baban
i believ in you
its ok tou'll survive
tapping cor 5 years
but yea i feel you before the update it was so bad
<:smileyyy:1001385599443423302>
it does on jp
(i like crystals) <:emptygaze:879159213874634793>
i personally do it to whoever neds character rank
sure <:PikaXD:966624196564242432> <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
dont do it to all of them thats too expensive but ones with good skills you should cause you'll likely use them, MR5 3* has about the same talent as MR1 4* iirc
i need mor mafuyu cover card :orayge:
all of maduyu covers si good
the pink lim vouchers you cant spark anything with 30 of them
or yoh can use 10 vouchers and 200 gacha stickers to spark a banner card
you can either save up 30 and exchange for an old card in the shop
so the green non lim ones
you can exchange those for voucher right
when you do a ten pull you get 1 gacha stixker per pull
idk shit on en <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
whats that
im tryinf to escape my mother aorry for my typing <:kekhands:993361107878170655>
maatery rank
what sont you understand
+ it alao gives talent bonus
+ upping charater ranks gives titles
+ what else are you gonna use the wish pieces for lmao
if you have event 2*s you can do more
if you MR your low rairtu cards you get at least 10 points per charaxter and thats like if you only have their basic 1 and 2*
ranks
you can farm so many crysla from rnaka
it gives 1 point for charaxter rank per maateey rank you do
its only 1 or 5 per rank for 1 and 2*
bur it meana you might get a bit less event points so just pray your teammates are good
thata ok it just means faster cc matchmakinf cause your overall team talent is lower
i told you
replqxe rin
rplaxe ein
its normal miku
it gives more event bonus
the 1 ir 2* i dont rememver
tye cute miku card
ss pls i dont undertaqnd
wht team you running?
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
i hate tiering on cc
go baban<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
ok bye im eating sorry i'll tell you layerp
xaus more people onf fies
matchmakking is faster
yea rhats why
if you want to tier curry is better
but dont switch baban

wheeze
baban what team you on
i got 1 miss on idsmile mas :(
L team

hermit is like one of the if not the most awaited for event on en
baban coping <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>

bing bong <a:huapat:897588111712870410> sometimes is hard but i'll try

<:sobs:980770260431032360>
<:mafuyu:994083202308251739> i mean. i have tried before 
my mental health in august - february is like nonexistent 

in the end my parents paid a lot of money for my braces so if i die that's such a waste <:emptygaze:879159213874634793>
i thought you were talking about our luna and i was just <:kekhands:993361107878170655>
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
<a:huapat:897588111712870410> i tried but all it did was give me severe aversion to swimming
<:sobs:980770260431032360>
they get mad at me when i don't get help but get mad at me when i do get help <:sobs:980770260431032360> and if the outcome will be the same either way i'll tske the one that involves less contact with them
they never do
they dont
i would like to go to my grave
<:confuzzle:1031094886847492146>
last time they said 'how long had your throat been hurting' and i don't usually tell them cause then they call me a baby for complaining <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i cant get up <:kekhands:993361107878170655> they will be so angry
my parents will kill mehhahsjskjs

phoebe <a:dalao:959706460789567548>
need to go
oops sorry
logically a day < a month < a year regardless of how many of each is in the year 
<a:huapat:897588111712870410> that is why i prefer it, because it's in order 

i don't like month/day/year because
<a:huapat:897588111712870410>
and a year is also significantly longer than a month
a month is significantly longer than a day
not big small bigger that's just weird
small -> big
yeah
looked at this wondering what 13th month came into existence <:kekhands:993361107878170655>

ok good luck
like this isn't a noun <a:chatting:1022482208113557584>
no it only works in front of nouns 
i am dinosaur 
i am a dinosaur 

but if the noun has an adjective like this 
i am happy dinosaur 
you say i am a happy dinosaur

not i am happy a dinosaur
something you use before words to make your sentence grammatically correct
it is

I wrote about how rainclouds are like the lies that slip out of people's mouths and when it rains and the clouds disappear the truth is like the sunlight, always waiting behind
I did write about the sky
The raincycle???
What was I supposed to write about
He forced me to write about the sky
i wrote this diary entry in school about truth and lies <:wat:1010869421276921936>
<:concern:966623298639261746>
idk sorry if i sound harsh, i mean personally if i was blocked i'd appreciate someone telling me why so yea thats all
no is just that epi refuses to learn and i don't like the way he can't be bothered to read and wants everything personally explained
you may be innocent but i like to talk without getting mad at people cause i do that enough irl <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154> 
very sorry
if you can start learning basic grammar maybe i'll unblock
in response to epi

iamverystress
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
ok
so i can get it done at 6
next internet hour is at 5
eep
keep downloading later
and then
maybe if i start downloading it now
cri
what do i do
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
Eeep
in 44 minutes
i cant reinstall it
idk what to do
Eep
stress
auugh
i might be able to
if i delete genshin now and install NA
Um
3 hours
☠️
I said I'd do Heki's dailies but I forgot I deleted NA honkai
Shit
i'll go to 75 and then drop
mm
play for a bit and get nilou
should i just
70 ish pity
i'm at
why does genshin want me to download 2gb of stuff <:holothink:963352118855626753>
bought every song in shop
i just
i want it
probably ipad then so you can take it with you everywhere
<:Terichew:973794176015675392> anyway heki
i miss them
my friend live in canada
canaananaada
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
my birthday
oh right
rich
wth
the ipad is so old i dont remember a time when it wasnt there
and
the samsung tablet we have lasts not even a day but the ipad can run for ages <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
reallly
so new
woah
but i wouldn't recommend living without pen pressure
but also the ipad is old so idk <:wokege:966623232918712331>
yea my dad gave me one like 5 years ago to draw with and it was so bad
but it's shit
yes
yea lmao
Wdym
probably can't get a cintiq from it
um
i only ever hear good reviews abt them, wacom isn't everything
xp-pen
if you want screen tho
yea cintiq is really expensive LMAO
see what your price range is
but
i would still say screen will be v expensive
help??
drawing tablets need to be attached to a computer
then that's going to be expensive
my wifi is in its grave im using data ☠️
if you want it to be portable
anywya uh
oh you already have one <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
anyway
ok well there are many many artists who use apple pens and their art is fine <:Terichew:973794176015675392>
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
have you ever used one
just get an ipad at that point
tiles..
and the floor was
tripped over my charging cord while holding it
yeah i
i used the tablet then
but my screen on my old laptop was shattered so
yea same
but if you don't want something small probably fine but i think getting super big one is unnecessary
i have intuos small which. wirks fine for me
like a non screen tablet will work fine and is significantly less expensive and also saves your back from shrimp position
imo you dont need to invest that much initially
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
isn't that expensibe
oh
i forget
i know it's wacom but
which one is this
aaaaaaaa
<:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488>
all quests sounds so long and can't skip dialogue either
but like
If I could explore sumeru without doing quests then yeah
I don't like genshin, too much quests
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
even if i delete it gives me minimal storage anyway
I need actual storage, my photos only take up 350 mb
Like
No
Anyway I play like once a month
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
I need the storage
I don't wanna wait
Even more reason to delete
Ew
<:ah:1005467958077825034>
So I can finally delete this game
Nilou banner
I just need
What else am I supposed to add <:sussge:968897150249484389>
Because it feels finished to me

'hey ik im not art team but ive spetnt a while thinking about this!! i would classify it as art cultivation, like someone picking and choosing art for an art gallery!! while there is an element of creativity in it, it is very low compared to the art creation itself — and as sans said, it is almost alwyas (at least as of now) used unethically unfortunately so its understandable why it’s shyed away from so much' for carv

Hug for eli
once upon a time, a little group of dinosaurs lived in arc city land. 
mostly everyone was happy, even though there was lots of discarded hair and stress from things such as epi's grammar and heki's decisions 

one day, keiloraptor ran outside arc city land to go to blustorm land, a big place with lots and lots of dinosaurs. they all played honkisaur and were super cool!! 

sometimes astersaur, hekisaur and other dinosaurs came with keiloraptor to blustorm land where they played honkisaur.

this time, keiloraptor came back to arc city land with a new friend - zeisaurus!! 

zeisaurus was quiet at first but soon everyone became familiar with her and they even played games together. everyone was happy!

in arc city land, everyone had already given up hope on hekisaur. he could not swim, could not gacha wisely. 

but zeisaurus still had hope for hekisaur, that maybe one day he will not sink and drown!! 

zeisaurus became friends with all the other dinosaurs :D and they all live happily ever after <:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488>

i like cold food because it makes me feel cold which reinforces the notion that i am cold because i wouldn't want to comfort myself believing that i do have any notion of warmth in my actions
who does that
i always feel cold inside but hot food just makes me feel burnt
really
warm food is comforting
it just sits burning in your mouth <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
how do you like hot food tho
not that i can eat anything other than soup <:life:1001518241610485781>

in addition i was not talking to you and if you'd bothered to read the prior context you would understand <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
very nice but the point is that we're not in a maths oriented space and there is no wrong answer to my usage of a number without units <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153> whereas your continual use of the incorrect your/you're is something that can be corrected because we are speaking english <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
basic grammar is part of the language we're speaking but we are not currently learning or discussing maths <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
does this look like a maths classroom
we're speaking english

one about this man who went missing one day, his mother came to his house and he couldn't be found <:hmm:1012492971884695592> (still missing today) 

i don't really remember the details but i remember one suspect was (tw umm idk.. cannibalism? scammer? surgery? genitals? really disturbing??)

this guy did fake gender transition surgery thing but he actually like cut the patients' genitals off, cut them up, boiled them and ate them??????? <:huh:966619839307321394> 
and the very first one i listened to was
i used to listen to true crime podcasts while i drew
honestly my twitter timeline thing is so stupid it makes me happy
pa pa pa paranoiiia
but then my usual paranoia increased tenfold
i lije true crime
<:rovertears:1022740143817367562>

the names are really confusing but umm

I think everything in welcome and honker is self explanatory (gsr is hsr tho idk why it's called that)

general chaos:
<#977584145142259782> is general, the name gets changed to something sus a lot 
<#963273616852652095> is for leeks (because carv and other people don't wish to view them)
<#963277841779265598> is memes 
<#975189344707039282> is carv, tet and annie's house (cat pics)
<#988772468347006976> not really sure what this is for but maybe for sharing music
<#1019899764927643698> sharing videos, mostly gacha pulls
<#1022284932996935763> is for spreading positivity and praising people you like 

creativity center:
<#963277599126204506> is for sharing sfw art 
<#977588577720467546> is like a pun on arc city, it's for sharing your original art 
<#997453354378727424> is for sharing your singing (or shrieking)
<#997453463665508363> is for sharing your voice acting/imitations of characters' voicelines

study corner - basically language learning:
<#994536652993200138> is for japanese learning/discussion
<#994537585307308102> mandarin learning/discussion
<#994538715982614568> english learning/discussion
<#1009057141472112690> vietnamese learning/discussion

privately owned chaos:
<#966951945103347794> i'm sure you know what this is 
<#981296993295040512> keilo requested a counting channel a while back but it kinda died <:PikaXD:966624196564242432> 
<#979119475389513749> is for alice (very 'sane' rat alice), i'm not sure why that's there either
<#1000011876580733039> is for venting, rambling etc
<#1022460865913565245> is my room!! please come visit me sometimes!! 

everything in genshn't and other games is self explanatory 

maidenless zone:
<#974685981204705301> is for zenless zone zero 
<#1000746303233478737> don't really know why this exists when we have <#963277599126204506> but i think taihen made this for zzz art 

mudamudamuda:
<#963279954093674547> is the channel for using mudae gacha kinda thing
<#968904287927287848> is for pokemon commands 
<#968908032526393364> is for pokemon, games like green/black/yellow/red/mixed tea 

veeceee is also self explanatory but i'm not sure why there's a nsfw channel <:frogconcern:980770246673723403> 

request:
<#963279962163540038> is just for running commands, looking at quotes etc 
<#964922267790356540> we're supposed to have a monthly icon change.. it was going to be ely this month, but the art contest we held won't even finish until october so ig its morbmaid for two months <:A_HuTaoDerp:791552140912492595> 
<#963280001900376064> is for suggesting emotes that you want !! 

i think that's it <:A_HuTaoHeart:803337674819764254>

<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831> you dont need skill to use pen pressure its not a big deal, just makes the drawing process more like actual pen and paler
not much to learn, and the faster you get used to it the better anyway
honestly i'd start with pen pressure
<:HMM:966625453194485760> i see
um if your drawing thing supports pen pressure thats really just the easiest way
your lines are all like the same width which makws them look more flat
is not bad, when you colour there is not that much difference i guess
but you can go over them / make them thicker in places where there should be shadow or where lines intersect for umm depth or i dont know

<:cat_eeee:844240057140772894>
may i suggest something aoi

umm is 9pm aest a bad time to stream pulls <:HMM:966625453194485760>
i think im a herbivore
Watery light filtered through a canopy of leaves, bathing the clearing in morning sunshine. Flowers were sprinkled on the grass like stars in the sky, petals blooming as the forest shook off winter's frost. A gentle breeze blew through the trees, the air clear, pristine without the pollution of mankind. 

in this clearing was hekisaur, running away from tetosaur <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
has been a while
i actually want to write like serious wriitng now
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
tetosaur tried her best to draw.. but art was so difficult <:SeeleSweat:843946435271852103> astersaur and cherrisaur cheered her on
one day in arc city land, taihenosaurus and a mysterious sponsor held a herrscher elysaur art contest
omg <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
it was a normal day in arc city land, and hekisaur was out in the forest spending some time touching grass after his honkisaur luck suddenly vanished (i wonder why).

suddenly, he heard a little bird!! it looked lost and sad, so hekisaur quickly picked it up and ran back home to take care of it. already, hekisaur could see that the bird had not been taken care of by its bad, human owners..

but maybe he should return it? after all, stealing is bad. conflicted, hekisaur asked astersaur and cherisaur what to do.

everyone agreed that hekisaur should keep the birb to make sure it doesn't go back to the bad, neglectful, booli owners <:mhworrysmh:998941260184289410> 

so hekisaur kept the birb, and they lived somewhat happily ever after (for now) <:kleeheart:1001385800124076103>
yay, dinosaurs <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>

with nothing left to do, tetosaur and keiloraptor ran back to the rest of the group, telling them what happened <:cat_eeee:844240057140772894>
sleep well eli <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
keilosaur began her battle with the diavoros <:watbronya:959797125007429725> but the diavoros, faced with logic, was too stunned to speak, and ran away in fear of what reasonable thing keiloraptor would say next
immediately, he said 'told you elysia was bait!!' <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122> tetosaur and keiloraptor felt their braincells fading away already
tetosaur and keiloraptor, armed with facts and common sense, ventured out to interact with diavoros
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
suddenly, salt began raining from the sky and.. the dreaded diavoros appeared <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
<:blissful_blushy_cat:955828651499348048>
yay, this channel turned into a room for me and eli to bully people
at least they're literate <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257> unlike some people
it was a normal day in arc city land, and after the strange announcements from the marisa speaker yesterday, everyone was awaiting the 'diavoros', a strange creature that only exists to leech other dinosaurs' braincells and spout nonsense
elishusaurus
elisaur
diaboros
omg

<a:pat:969402615538520064>
in the end, epi did not live happily ever after
<:cryge:966624721611403294> but there was nothing anyone could do to alleviate epi's salt condition, gacha had taken too big of a toll on him <:KLEE_CRYING:708170080583811093>
after a while, tetosaur was scared for episaur's health <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831> surely all this salt would be too much
episaurus was really mad that he couldn't get her weapon!! it was not fair, mihohosaurus was bullying <:Mizuki_Mad:961432122491551784>
copious amounts of salt were produced whenever episaurus saw pardofelis
soon, the end of the banner loomed, and episaurus was still left without purana.. <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257> but there wasn't enough time to gather enough crystals to get it! <:cryge:966624721611403294>
<:kleeheart:1001385800124076103> <:kleeheart:1001385800124076103>
episaurus tried his best, but purana simply wouldn't come to him <:SeeleSweat:843946435271852103> everyone sent their condolences 

except hekisaur, who made fun of episaurus, which was a bad thing to do and that's why hekisaur did not get vill-v <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
epi had decided to pull for pardofelis gear, a cute character who was a stronk support in honkisaur impact <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
once upon a time, there was a dinosaur named epi
<:watbronya:959797125007429725>

<a:pat:969402615538520064>
yes
it was a normal day in arc city land, when suddenly, a speaker with a piece of paper labelled 'marisa' on it appeared.. 

everyone in arc city land gathered around the strange device, waiting in anticipation.

suddenly, it began announcing information for the next version in the popular game honkisaur impact <:woggers:1002597195645714582> 

a new character and new gear to farm, along with new outfits and even new weapons for old characters <:A_JoyTao:808581396141441034> 

however, elysia, herrscher of humanity was coming just before all this exciting new content! so many things to process, everyone was surprised <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257> 

cherisaur decided that she was going to go on a journey to talk to mihohosaurus, the company that created honkisaur impact about this shocking new information <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257> 

but astersaur didn't want to let cherisaur go on her own, so together they began their journey to locate mihohosaurus secret headquarters.. <:woggers:1002597195645714582>

tetosaur also came along

<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257> to be continued.. in week 4 of 6.0
but heki never got her from dorm, and so when they saw the rerun.. they immediately knew heki would pull <:A_HuPensive:807551025942495274>
everyone knew that hekisaur wanted her, for a long time hekisaur always said 'dorm luccsacc'
the arc city dinosaurs were playing honky impact again, and the new banners had been leaked.. herrscher of thunder rerun? <:woggers:1002597195645714582>

<:NOOOOOO:893300889509572649>
it was a normal day in arc city land when suddenly, hekisaur announced that he was going to start producing drugs <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
<:worryweird_hh:770947100199747606>
soon we will have season 2 and everyone commits war against hekisaur <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>

arc city dinosaur adventures
<:A_HuKek:803544603751612436>
<:cat_blush:790209645045874708> hehe
the end
heki did not live happily ever after
in the end, hekisaur did not do good things for others and had bad luck for the whole banner!! <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
hekisaur decided to sacrifice episaurus for his plans to get vill-v <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257> but the wise taihenosaurus reminded him that it doesn't work if the sacrifice is unwilling
sorry taihen, is late <:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
the wise taihenosaurus said that in order to have good luck for one thing, you can either sacrifice something of the same value.. or do good things for others!
hekisaur decided that he needed more luck, because vill-v would not come home.. so he went to taihenosaurus for help!!
it was nearing the end of vill-v's banner, and hekisaur still did not have her! every time heki mentioned vill-v, everyone shook their heads <:A_HuPensive:807551025942495274>
hmm
ok <:blissful_blushy_cat:955828651499348048>

what happened recently
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
let's write more story
<:A_HuLay:813064686815805500>
do you like my story <:blissful_blushy_cat:955828651499348048>
LMAO HEKI
<:A_HuKek:803544603751612436>
we are all dinosaurs
i like storywriting <:A_NoteTao:928234793844486164>
<:A_HuKek:803544603751612436>
<a:bcaBowDown:784651274678173717>
the end
heki did not live happily ever after
but it was too late, heki had already spent everything, and now hekisaur has no more crystals for elysia
now that i think about it hekisaur is really close to hekisaru
however, hekisaur really liked vill-v, and kept trying to get her.. aster, cherry and tet always reminded heki, don't pull!
it was the day of a special character's release.. vill-v! tetosaur and hekisaur both wanted her, and tetosaur always reminded heki, 'don't pull for vill-v! elysia is coming soon!'
ok continuing on <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
epi should take that animal personality quiz

based on true events
<:blissful_blushy_cat:955828651499348048>
heki the dinosaur was well known for making bad decisions.. in fact, every time heki opened the gacha menu, everyone would sigh <:A_HuFacepalm:811937576523923466>
together they all played a game called honky impact
heki had many friends, such as aster the birb, cherry the cherry, epi the not-human and tet, who was also a fellow dinosaur
once upon a time there was a dinosaur named heki
ok
hehe
no
<:cat_eeee:844240057140772894>

i wish i exercised more but so tired everyday
i dont like meat i want broccoliii
tomato bad
i only like  pasta sauce
we just call it tomato sauce here <:kekhands:993361107878170655>
oh
wait what is ketchup
oh
i thiught everyone did that <:huh:966619839307321394>
<:bruhnya:959706419442118678>
we eat white and brown rice together cause my dad is diabetic
same we eat rice every day
no wonder why people dont like rice omg
i dont know any of these <:kekhands:993361107878170655>
wait people eat rice without cooking it in rice cooker
example
sorry to intteriot but what are famous cartoon duos <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
or else it's just nothing to me
i need to
because
i add spice to almost every meal
will eat spicy food gladly but sweet is um
my taste buds dont like much
thats why when i'm sad i drink more of it
sugar makes me sad
same but i dont hace any other choice
the amount of sugar in store bought apple juice will send you to sleep anyway
you can still apple juice that too eli
apple juice is my favourite drink <:blissful_blushy_cat:955828651499348048> <:blissful_blushy_cat:955828651499348048> why alcohol when you can apple juice
i want to drink apple juice
oh alcohol
i love spixy food
yeah
tsunananananami
i wanna sing tsunami by finana i forgot her name <:bruhnya:959706419442118678>
all i do in shower is sing song and do nothing
aaa
i get that <a:pat:969402615538520064> it hurts when you're excluded especially for no reason <:cryge:966624721611403294> you dont need to post lots of art to be included in that, they should've just looked for your art because you're their friend
<:KLEE_CRYING:708170080583811093>
aw,, yeah i saw that, i thought you would be there
the flowers on my pathway are wilted <:cryge:966624721611403294>
<:C_HuCryge:922426001181507605>
my project sekai goal is clear a song on 31 under 7 good/bad/miss <:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164> but that's very far away so i will continue working towards that <:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
i usually set goals
because now it's rinse and repeat, over to the next thing
but then i do get good at it and it just makes me sad
so maybe if i get good at this thing i'll be happy ?
i just intrinsically feel the need to be good at everything <:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164> because nothing's ever good enough <:cryge:966624721611403294>
<:KLEE_CRYING:708170080583811093>
and i know she's been playing for months longer than me but i just
after my friend fc hibana on expert i spent days playing over and over <:KLEE_CRYING:708170080583811093> the closest i got was 2 misses
i want to be better at everything, especially when someone else i know is better than me <:A_HuLay:813064686815805500> <:A_HuLay:813064686815805500>
me with project sekai <:A_HuLay:813064686815805500>
but when i do that i usually have the urge to bald at it for weeks until i'm good at it
is like,, 'oh.. okay.. good enough for now' but,, what am i supposed to improve on further from here <:KLEE_CRYING:708170080583811093>
but when i do get full marks i feel super empty
me too and i still cry if i lose 1-2 marks
guhh and i cant share anything with anyone, is always like 'you got 100% right?' and then aaaaaaaa when i do get full marks theyre just,, looking weird at me and when i dont get full marks its like,, they just kinda seem surprised as if i did something wrong
baban bully? <:C_HuCryge:922426001181507605>
every time there's an award or something everyone looks at me and i hate when i actually get it because it just fuels their expectations
sometimes i wish i was not considered smart so that no one will have expectations for me anymore <:bruhnya:959706419442118678>
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
omg the price of lettuce wnet so high that fast food chains started using cabbage instead <:A_HuTaoTeeheePoint:899444166549962782>
petrol going up here and so is price of food and stuff
<:kekhands:993361107878170655> <:kekhands:993361107878170655>
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
oh and the people that are like COST OF LIVING TOO EXPENSIVE, GIVE MORE MONEY
<:A_HuNeutral:792192379498790942>
uh idk but everyday there's usually someone on the news complaining that their rent went up or the interest rate went up or the government stopped paying them money
schooling trash and economy
aa <:A_HuLay:813064686815805500>
what do i doo <:kekhands:993361107878170655> <:kekhands:993361107878170655>

i like walking but not uphill
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>

well to me genshin looks better even on lowest graphics, my laptop easily runs genshin on high graphics but ToF crashes within seconds
ngl some of the ToF font looks like microsoft word sht i use when i was little
i think ToF is just less polished than hoyo games
not to say the company doesnt care about the game
and also stealing assets is not nice
but yeah <:peek:1001385595089727509>

<:teriweird:980770251685908490> in chinese if i dont know a character i cant even read it
scary

he figured out how to turn off my internet every hour <:kekhands:993361107878170655>
my dad is good with technology<:ughhh:1002096701944893533>
<:HUH:1009112689487908944>
my mother says no every time <:ughhh:1002096701944893533>
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
i asked if i could buy welkin once and i had the money and they were like 'what for' <:worryweird:987958026071834634> 
how am i going to explain 'i really like this arrangement of coloured pixels named kazuha and i don't have enough currency to get him'
im not allowed to use my money
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
one time when i was litttle i didnt get the highest result on a maths test and my dad yelled at me the whole day, i asked to do my homework and he said 'no i want to yell at you more'
<:QiqiPeek:781028042708746260> am scared of them 
i don't like being hit either
yes because i am scared of them and if i talk back i think they will kick me out and i will die of starvation anyway <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
i don't intend to do anything <:slacc:963350438940397588> what am i supposed to do ? 

jusr complaining with no purpose liike usual <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>

Yeah <:smileyyy:1001385599443423302>
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
no because no matter what they do to me they still cared for me all these years, even if they did a bad job sometimes 

and i care about that
i say this now but they always manage to make me listen to them
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
my parents say if i move away and don't take care of them i am ungrateful 

and i feel bad wa
<:pikathink_hh:884675638634639400>

<:A_HuMonkaS:803498875444396072>
don't know if it is abusive, but i don't like it
mainly the environment in our household is why my sister and i struggle to do work 
but my parents think we are just being lazy, then they get angry and it gets worse
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
<:ughhh:1002096701944893533>
but i'm scared to say anything
he says he's going to throw away all his old maths notes and stuff because he assumes that i dont want them
is jsut that <:kekhands:993361107878170655> like ig at least it works and i do learn.. but it would be nice without the yellign and crying
most people dont like maths because theyre not good at it <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
but i dont like the way my dad teaches me

when someone has to send email to teacher they spam group chat asking for help, we are all so scared we will get in trouble if we send a bad email
lucky <:concern:966623298639261746>
not even capitalised i
like 'YOU ARE IN EXTENSION WHY CANT YOU TYPE BASIC SENTENCES PROPERLY'
she was so mad over emails
i stil rememeber my english teacher last year
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
Hello [teacher name, Ms/Mr wtv],

[Email content with full punctuation and sentences]

Regards/whatever message, 
[student name]

and sometimes they want you to add 'have a good day' and if you email an english teacher and you accidentally use fragmented or run on sentence they smh at you in class
at school they expect like structure
wtf <:kekhands:993361107878170655> thats not v nice
my teacher wouldve beat me up if i sent such informal email <:HUH:1009112689487908944>

<:teriweird:980770251685908490>
wasn't tencent the one that accused genshin of copying.. honkai
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
dunno my friend sent me that
related to tencent which is known for putting spyware in their products or smth
apparently ToF has spyware on it
i told him to stop pulling <:madge:955440575916691466>
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
and i just remembered the time when i went chest hunting with my sista in genshit 
and i split up with her because it would be more efficient to cover more area 
but she got upset at me <:Aether_DESPAIR:708170076620324895> and i couldnt understand why she didnt want to take the easier way 

but now i understand that having fun and doing things together is important <:GanyuConfused:1002644842934960181>
<:Aether_DESPAIR:708170076620324895>
have to be efficient with everything in life
my parents say to me
'depression is a choice' <:tt_cool:863427989080637470>
will resort to violence within 15 seconds
but i'm so short tempered
because i dont wanna be like them
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
i hate how i can see myself in my parents when they lecture me
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i feel like im in this endless cycle of dont trust anyone to talk > make friend > care about them too much > dont want to bother > dont talk

You run out and then after exploration is done everything else is a bore 🚶
I'd have the money to whale and get the character <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
I wouldn't be complaining about losing 50/50
If I was a whale
You see
<:HMM:966625453194485760> genshit is fun, just not when you gacha 50/50 loss to 4th copy of standard character 
or when you run around trying to find the last 1% of exploration 
or when you're one second off 3* on abyss

but too hard <:kekhands:993361107878170655> <:kekhands:993361107878170655> so i will just keep using the two fingers until something stupidly hard comes up

<:Deadge:966011458691416124> this game is just a bully
i can do it easily when my left finger holds and my right hand taps/flicks but i have less control with my left so i usually mess up when i have to hold with the right <:Deadge:966011458691416124>

i cant thknk of anything else as an example
would ask for more details but is not wrong to me
you could like slam someone against a wall <:Terichew:973794176015675392> that is a normal usage for the word
i see it used in both
i think slam is a fine verb to use there since she is whacking them down onto ground if i remember correctly
yes
ye it just has weird rectangular connotation in my head
its
box implies
i feel like box is a weird wkrd to use
instead of sword
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
right
a weapon
it is
i mean
does weapon work
oh right i see
let me read
wait
jjjjhddjjdd
<@728935268702486528> <:tt_shy:1001076895678472212>
i think the way i'd edit it is:
The final product, as seen in the game, is a sword on Herrscher of Sentience's back that holds a variety of weapons within. The sword itself is a claymore, assisting Herrscher of Sentience to fly, as well as madly slamming the enemy after the ultimate move.
let me see

i was playing project sekai with my friends and this younger white kid came up to us and was like OMG ARE YOU WATCHING ANIME 

then proceeded to ask weird asf questions involving gacha club and nsfw words 

then his friends grabbed him by the arms and legs and tried to throw him at us <:HUH:988073500730359908> but my friend kicked him in the ass and then he ran away

dont read novels in the dark
just
dont need to spend money on glasses
my vision worsened cause i did a lot of stuff in the dark
lmao <:C_HuCryge:922426001181507605>
i htink i heard sokmething about blue light glasses not having big effect or something but idk what anti glare does <:wokege:966623232918712331>
o wait a secong
but
ive had prescription glasses since i was 7 <:wokege:966623232918712331>
dunno <:wokege:966623232918712331>
left is 3, right is 2.5, normal vision is 0, scale is from 6 to -6 i think <:wokege:966623232918712331>
i think my left eye is like half the quality of a normal person's vision
my vision is super shit
<:hc_creepysmile:940296097111355413>
take care of your eyes
oh good

it might already be at 12
so you might not need to go to 12
idk what version of directx you are on
download the game and see if it comes up with an error message <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
and you miht need to update directx but i dont think thats too difficult
you just need storage
i think you can run it
11 is good enough to run it too i think
intel i5 core is good enough
you are on windows 10 or 11 yes?
you have more than enough ram
you have 64 bit operating thing so that is ok
are you on windows?

but from the way it sounds the people that correct you will be wrong too
would it be more beneficial to keep your braincells and talk about lore with yourself, or continue to lose your remaining intelligence by interacting with them
stop looking
<:wokege:966623232918712331> well its not bleeding anymore whatever <:KeqingSleep:780992925340925962>

oh
what
<:hc_creepysmile:940296097111355413>
asian parents do nothing but spank
no
looks like what hei would do to a little girl
i'm not that dumb (i think) <:worrymad:987990517453303820> i don't even know where to find those items
my parents say they'll never ban me from drugs and alcohol so that if i want to try it i can make a decision for myself <:hc_creepysmile:940296097111355413>
but if there's no one to tell you then you just learn it by yourself <:hc_creepysmile:940296097111355413>
obviously the easiest way is to have someone tell you every time you go near a knife 'don't play with it'

<:Terichew:973794176015675392> i just didn't have anyone to tell me what not to do
and then it would've hurt so you even remember it better
but if you play with knives and cut yourself then after that you learn not to play with knives anyway
well that's the ideal situation
the earlier you learn kitchen safety the less likely you are to burn the house down when you get older

Not touching alcohol
No
it tasted weird
my dad gave me alcohol once
that's terrifying
<:terishake:981119923835240468>
my parents don't drink often so i am grateful for that
and i had a friend who spiralled and ended up drinking too <:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
my grandfather is an alcoholic
it makes me sad <:A_HuSadge:814445957960826931>
and i don't like it
no it's just that i've had to deal with drunk people
<:bceCry2Sad2:701727386324172902>

griseo
i tried to pull for bastet but was too poor 
farmed for jst tm (but still don't have fhm <:hc_creepysmile:940296097111355413> )
then started farming for ana but now i can't be bothered to open honkai and my mirage tickets are capped and i can't clear abyss
T <:madge:955440575916691466>
<:creepysmile:996838443827073105>
i just only have one piece
I DO HAVE BASTET
I TRIED
wanted to build ice but now herrscher is very far away and i'm already in masters <:teriderp:959782333840498698>
i'm just not really interested because it is expensive, have to get griseo gear, HoS and gear, stuff this that
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
i don't <:kekhands:993361107878170655> but heki keeps telling me to
not that i actually get much because my abyss performance is very literally abysmal
all my ancient legacy is for FR only
does it use ancient legacy
war treasury or expedition
<:worryweird:987958026071834634> is she
wait
Good
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
i dont even have her
it is farmable and it is free right now no crystals or cards involved <:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
no <:madge:955440575916691466>
waow rich keilo
<:C_HuCryge:922426001181507605>
BUT I'D RATHER FARM
i can get it for free

<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
isnt it literally craftable too
kafka m hdjdhdgjshs wtf am i supposed to do with it
<:pasad:917035707304902666> <:pasad:917035707304902666>
because i hate gacha
never pulling again
No
i think i'll be sleeping during banner change
thank you
i'll let you know if i somehow win 50/50 (unlikely) and find enough wishes to get to pity in the first place (very unlikely)
FUN TIP I DONT HAVE KAZUHA <:kekhands:993361107878170655>
for exploration i have keqing for jumpy cliffs, albedo for liyue puzzles, mining ore, killing things, pressure plates, venti for gathering enemies and going up cliffs without stamina, and kokomi for healing <:hc_creepysmile:940296097111355413>
keep kaeya away from me <a:hc_run:926345512137945088>
please
no
<:kleepray:963350716901113876>
since kazuha won't come home
thank you heki i'll see what i can do
why swim <:bcePeekWaiting:993424892781400084> koko burst and run across hehehhaha
keqing is ca spam so during both exploration and combat i have no stamina ever
i wonder wht that's like
if i even get kazoo <:TeriDerp:928714824274313286>
<:E_think:793918036787986453>
<a:bcaNodOk:861125830071025664>
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
xiao only goes sideways
keqing can go up
it doesn't feel any different i'm still running out of stamina
oh does he
i have enough stamina to glide anywhere but not enough to climb everywhere
and i can't jump up the cliffs with him
and if i accidentally get hit he dies <:kekhands:993361107878170655>
but then i have to decide when to use burst
i know
i don't wanna use xiao for exploration waaa
<:worrymad:987990517453303820> i spent ages farming artifacts for her and she is still trash
work harder keqing
<:KeqingSleep:780992925340925962>
albedo already hits harder than keqing and i didn't build him dps
well
albedo is happy with cinnabar spindle
mistsplitter goes to keqing <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
you overestimate my budget
no
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
i saved lots for albedo
That is very good
actually
well
i love albedo <:bcePeekWaiting:993424892781400084>

<a:bcaForeverSleepZombie:993422268598333450>
hi eli
<:hc_toroyay:905769822913183756>
you can differentiate between heki and the usual human by his deficiency in braincells
heki differs from the usual human due to his deficiency in braincells
differ is just straight up 'these things are different'
differentiate is to separate and examine what is different between things
differentiate
killing yourself too

congratulations diavoros you used your eyes to view an image that had dudu in it and instead of looking at any other detail you only focused on the character you supposedly hated so much
IF DIAVOROS SENDS THAT STUPID RAIDEN DISGUST EMOTE AGAIN ISTG <a:KleeREEE:816883329583808612>
<:slacc:963350438940397588> i think i will not start talking about the characters i dislike or else i'll be writing paragraphs for ages <:TeriDerp:569741126148292610>

<a:pat:969402615538520064> you stuck as the skunk

i feel like a little toddler surrounded by tall scary people in blustorm
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
actually i dont want to repeat it
i remember something about
its been like a day
i asked a question and got a reply very fast i thoughr you were really good at honkai (and still do!!!!) <:hc_creepysmile:940296097111355413>
i think my first interaction in wfp was with keilo
but i listen and i have learnt many things <a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>

<:TeriDerp:569741126148292610>
i dont spend money on honkai but i'm still dumb
i like baban because baban is nice and says good morning to me and listens to my roblox drama issues <:PaimonSLEEP:742203842732621846>
it works because you are the one lying <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
i didnt finish my sentence <:SakuraSad:866034161819451432>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820> ofc that's how it works
<:slacc:963350438940397588> you say i am dalao, i get to say you are smart honky player
i like keilo because keilo is always very nice, and bird, and keilo is very smart honky player, and i have learnt many valuable things from keilo and i like the pensive bear
i hate diavoros because he's so arrogant like everything you say just does not absorb into his brain, it's like he has fucking selective vision and can only read what he wants to read, and he's so weird, like he's happy to admit he looks up skirts and is interested in small children
things i don't like
about
i can go on forever
<a:KleeMad:806625136316514325>
because he is not pretty, he's annoying, i constantly feel the need to throw my device at my windows whenever i see his dialogue, he has zero intelligence, his stick looks like he stole it from a poor geo samachurl while he was in liyue with shinobu
at all
i dont like itto
<:Theresad:476616089178996746>

how can you spend 15 pulls for focus cards
<:slacc:963350438940397588> is just that everyone seems to be misinformed that diabetes can only come from having too much sugar or being born with it 
which is untrue, and annoying because then people automatically assume things about you/your lifestyle when you say you are diabetic
not that i am diabetic but my father is, from genetic things, and then i can feel people judging me as if i live off sweets <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
diabetes is not necessarily from overconsumption of sugar you know
well
<:A_HuTaoHug:803337298476400690> is ok, you will improve slowly
i got 3 4* and many 3* of character i want, happy <:bceSatisfiedHappyFullLove:993424920811950100>

firstly, seethe is a verb, and it is not an object that can flow through me
<:worryweird:987958026071834634> that sentence is grammatically incorrect
oh wow <:worrymad:987990517453303820> couldnt even think of any words to say, just <:E_pepelol:792804369749377024> like damn do you want me to compliment your smile or something
<:slacc:963350438940397588> i stop using energy on him, i need breaks too, so i say 'again' because now i have started dedicating braincells for the futile use of arguing with him

dies
<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
just FR and fischl
it's

<:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
you assumed wrong <:terishake:981119923835240468>

common sense would tell you that
- if the max rank in this game is SSS and i have an A rank character i am missing a lot of stuff
- i am a beginner trying to clear hardest difficulty <:kekhands:993361107878170655> 
therefore the conclusion drawn from this is: do a lower level of ER
<:PaimonSLEEP:742203842732621846>
'what are xtals' ong look at the context it's used in, what words it is similar to and figure it out <:notlikekeq:977817672035205180>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

i'd rly appreciate that <:hc_bunnyplead:916548822434480178>
all i want to do is design things lately.. so tired of art <:slacc:963350438940397588> even yun jin cannot save me
and motivation
when i have time
<:hutaopanik:980771024033419274>
i'll just ask questions if i forget anything
<:terishake:981119923835240468>
gender:
any references you want me to take inspiration from:
any specific details (hairstyle, eye colour, clothing style etc):
uhm i think that should be all i need
just copy paste this and fill it out for me ok <:KeqingSleep:780992925340925962>
i'll make a form
i need details <:PaimonSLEEP:742203842732621846> what kind of character do you want
just leech off people for free stuff to get started <:KeqingSleep:780992925340925962> i'll make you an image and you can stream games or drawing or something
be back soon aaa
wait i have to go
what do you want to stream
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368> brain hurts
yeah <:qiqifallen:980770260451991592>
all cantonese speakers <:SakuraSad:866034161819451432> one of them knows a bit of mandarin so
will be back in a minute <a:hc_run:926345512137945088>
is tones really important
waa
but idk how to fix that aah <:qiqifallen:980770260451991592> guess i could ask a friend
i also think my pronunciation is very bad <:SakuraSad:866034161819451432>
<:A_NoteTao:928234793844486164>
if it sounds all robotic and ehhh i dont like it
i like her if the voice is like ? tuned nicely
i don't really know how to do the english > chinese character + pinyin 
i can't pronounce without pinyin but i think i can learn to type with writing 
but if i put pinyin on it too then i just learn the pinyin and not the character <:SakuraSad:866034161819451432>
<:Ichika_Laugh:961431158145577051>
<:SakuraSad:866034161819451432> i have found colours, but i don't know how to do flashcards 
should i put the character on one side and english word on the other 
<:notlikekeq:977817672035205180> i don't even really get why to use flashcards
<:HoRPeek:745809105901584404>
confused
😵‍💫 waa
griseo has qiqi voice. too hard <:slacc:963350438940397588>

colours
i want to learn
<:A_HuTaoSurprised:803337711792029786>
<:E_think:793918036787986453>
i think it is easier to learn english that way, but chinese is harder <:SakuraSad:866034161819451432> with english if you dont know a word you can probably guess spelling from pronunciation, but how to get the written character from chinese <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:A_NoteTao:928234793844486164>
<a:wave:963697712451170304>
come back sora
<:SakuraSad:866034161819451432>
to learn words, think of words i already know and then related words? <:E_think:793918036787986453>
i think yassified is an adjective describing things that has had a 'glow up' or improvement <:jeanconfused:980962419021082724>
from my understanding
<:E_think:793918036787986453>
i like kohane and honami <:slacc:963350438940397588>
<:SeeleSweat:843946435271852103>
too much energy for me
kohaneee <:kleeheart:930387130449006602> <:paheart:917035047184379995> <:E_BarbaraHeart:793914591611715624>

yea
<a:AichanSorry:557401217429536789>
oh, other sora
but paimon is so cute
sora, how to get vocabulary for the cards.. 
i can think of english words to learn but where to accurately translate
 listen to it <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:A_HuSadge:814445957960826931>
but this song
miku is annoying
okay! thank you sora, i will try to make cards
<a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
cannot do anything without subtitles <:A_HuCry3:807900201658220555>
i prefer visual a lot more than audio
<a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
i can type things like 你好 and 月 because i know pinyin, but i need to learn character not pinyin <:ventishocked:980770261869662238> so waa
<:A_HuSadge:814445957960826931>
often times the way i remember it is not the same as the stroke order
but
it makes it easier to write knowing that 'this line then that one'
i write characters in whichever way i remember it.. stroke order is hard
<:hutaopanik:980771024033419274>
and don't even know where to start on those weird keyboards <:SeeleSweat:843946435271852103>
i type chinese with pinyin because i am too unintelligent to write it
<a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
why are you
cant find cover for this one <:hc_bunnycry:916548816965091348>

so i'd rather die so that it's easier for me and them <:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
its not them thats the problem, if i was less sensitive i wouldnt feel the need to hit them
no
in kindergarten the teacher next door had to go to hospital for months because a kid threw a chair at her
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i hate the sound of people talking and people doing things and people making noises and thats why i always feel the need to either snap at them or slap them across the face
have respect for your book!!!! pay attention to the lesson!!!!!
im not allowed to draw in class
how to control violent urges in school <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

what did i do to get myself in the situation where i am in masters but literally close to nothing on my account i dont even have a gacha s rank <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
hypocrite
in conclusion everyone in this server is scary <:E_QiqiSip:792293010708365322> some are just less scary than others but thats because people are not as predictable as maths problems and i cant process it fast enough
you are scary in the admirable kinda way cause you do so much and know a lot
<:frogpat:980982413649903626> i don't mind it, i think it is better to get to the point faster
keilo would be on the not scary list but they are good at honky <:pahuh:917029719919186000> too much intelligence for me to handle
<:teriweird:980770251685908490>
you are just too smart <:notlikekeq:977817672035205180>
speaking of bruh <:worrymad:987990517453303820> i constantly feel the instinctive need to bash with a wooden spatula but im not really sure why
fenri was really nice to me <:terishake:981119923835240468> we had a discussion about art commissions
cata is not scary actually <:RozaScout:928714351534309386> cata really nice
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
<:HoRPeek:745809105901584404> <:HoRPeek:745809105901584404> by watching
so i guess thats saying something <:TeriSmoke:928714755798106164>
the more i worry the more i care about what your reply is <:terishake:981119923835240468>
baban is scary because they know how to communicate with people that i am scared of which therefore makes you scary too <:keqingsleep:980770264960864276> 
and i worry when i talk to you but idk why <:notlikekeq:977817672035205180>
heki is scary because your lack of brain juice and your logic is genuinely scary sometimes
also it seems like theres always someone angry at you whetger its taihen or tet or baban or epi 
which is scary because being angry is not good and idk how you manage to do it
ok
wait
if you can walk on a cliff without falling off you're already considered good in my book <:Paimon_Hehe:795762963679674369>
thats you
you are scary because you're good at minecraft and i will never be able to reach that level of brain power
and sometimes the way you talk is scary because it reminds me of people i know 
and uhhh <:terishake:981119923835240468> i'm usually scared of everyone
scary chart
lowest tier: not scared 
eli: <:kleeheart:930387130449006602> really nice, helped a lot when i was still very beginner in honkai, and minecraft fishing <:hc_toroyay:905769822913183756> 

cherry: cherry is nice and idk what else to say <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> 

sora: sora is also really nice and sends lots of pretty things and cute birb and nice art 

ruby: i am not scared of ruby because half the things they say is a variation of <:woggers:652740192653934633> and they are also nice <:paheart:917035047184379995> 

citrine: citrine is really nice and citrine has a warm voice, and good at rhythm game, and really cool 

tet: i guess tet is just cool <:kannawaow:963350507655688212> scary sometimes but usually very nice too and is good at many things like sekai and genshin
<:teriweird:980770251685908490>
i'll make a scary chart with reasoning and try not to forget anyone <:C_TaoHehe:856840838046547988>

low on chart <:kleeheart:930387130449006602> 
eli not scary because you talked to me and did fishing with me and does not give scary vibe
a) old 
b) scary <:terishake:981119923835240468>
no you are somewhere in the middle <:SeeleSweat:843946435271852103>

<:teriweird:980770251685908490>
heki you are so weird <:pahuh:917035657531129857>
<:teriweird:980770251685908490>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105> i dont think it should
<:A_HuSadge:814445957960826931> because heki was the only one that answered the question
never asking heki a question again
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
but it also soubds like signet
i keep seeing it as stigma
oh <:HoRPeek:745809105901584404>

i walk around with my hand held over my face even when i have a mask on
<:terishake:981119923835240468> dw i have ways to deal with scent
so you have to smell nice

it loks wrong
is australia even a word anymore
i mean i'm australian in the sense that i was born here and live here but my family is not from australia so i dont see myself as australian
now im questioning what i just said <:pPain:916484323480317962>
i guess it depends on the person? i think a lot of people consider themselves australian
i would say i am asian but live in australia <:keqingsleep:980770264960864276> to me 'aussie' is the other people
maybe i just dont like australian people
well idk

i cant with the hair <:PaimonSLEEP:742203842732621846>
the chibi is so cute wth <:pasad:917035707304902666>
<:A_WishTao:800810379882135612> i will keep working
<a:astolfodance:963353577655529532>
the hair shading is so
oooo the hair shading
ooo
that i do not have <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
skill
i can see it
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i dont mind the work but it needs to look good at the end too <:PaimonSLEEP:742203842732621846>
i think if i ever want to go there i would have to practise and improve art skill considerably first <:Jean_Worried:810946663770357832>
there is something wrong with me <:RozaScout:928714351534309386> my volume is muted, there is a chrome advertisement but i am hearing a furniture store advertisement
otherwise you get too many orders
thats why commissions have slots
my first years on the internet was purely art community, and i still hang around so i'm not really surprised by much anymore <:Terichew:973794176015675392> there are some insane artists out there and they will charge what they want, if you don't wanna pay then don't buy it <:A_WheezeTao:793919527208484924>
ohh
<:hc_creepysmile:940296097111355413>
<:PaimonSLEEP:742203842732621846> people like that piss me off because i'd like to see them do that work and get paid less
i'm happy that you see the prices and don't say that they're too expensive
<:hutaonote:980770249592942623>
aah
the expressions
i need to learn how to draw too <:hc_creepysmile:940296097111355413>
they may have learned to rig recently but no way they started drawing recently <:keqingsleep:897406127946485760>
need art skill first
<:E_think:793918036787986453>
i'll learn
told you that stuff is expensive <:PaimonSLEEP:742203842732621846>
yeah
no wonder why it costs so much
wtf <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> ive read like two paragraphs and this already looks like so much work
need to know how to split my layers <:PaimonSLEEP:742203842732621846>
i need to research that too
<:keqingthumbsup:897406125803196456>
so that's kinda like uh a preset i guess?
there are things called YCH which is 'your character here' in which the artist predraws a base and just draws your character on top
it usually costs more because designing is more effort than drawing an existing character
or 2) the artist designs it and that's called a 'custom' because it is custom to you, the client
you give the design
whether it is fanart, your oc, whatever
1) you provide the character
so from my understanding there are two types of commission and it is
uh
yes <:A_HuTaoSurprised:803337711792029786> i've been planning to learn for a while now but got caught up
i can do it for free if you want to use that or use it as a concept idea for other artists <:RozaScout:928714351534309386> i just can't rig/model stuff i've never touched that kinda stuff
so you need the artist to design it?
you want model not just picture?
oh yeah
depends on the artist but generally it costs more to get a custom design, especially if you want like a reference sheet for them cause that takes longer 
vtuber stuff is even more expensive cause of rigging and idek what goes on
cold

it gives me primos
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
so i will never run a domain with characters whose namecards i don't like/already friendship 10 because it's a waste of friendship exp
<:keqingsleep:897406127946485760> to me, namecards are first priority
thats for jean <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820> he does not deserve that
BUT I DONT WANT TO GIVE HIM FRIENDSHIP EXP
<a:KleeMad:806625136316514325>
but it'snot
it would be ok if his namecard was nice
i dont like bennett

no
<a:KleeMad:806625136316514325>

for namecards
anything

i dont like sayu
i know
venti and sayu are friendship 10
once
i'll farm it
don't care <:worrymad:987990517453303820> what did people run before his set came out then huh
it's more convenient for me t farm vv since venti, jean and sayu also need it
oh yeah
<a:KleeMad:806625136316514325>
but his crit rate isn't that good so he's still doing like 4k skill sometimes <:C_TaoHehe:856840838046547988>

oh i see the game
<:keqPat:908000044089745428>
i am happy <:keqingsleep:897406127946485760> 17k crystals
<:QiqiPeek:781028042708746260> sora, since i think you want to improve english 
i notice sometimes you forget to include 'of' 
mostly need to be included after 'because', like 
1) 'i want to learn chinese because of my friends'
2) 'i want to learn chinese because my friends'

as you can see 2) looks incomplete, you want to learn chinese because your friends what <:pahuh:917035657531129857>
i got workbook and textbook but lazy <:PaimonSLEEP:742203842732621846> tried online services and it was boring <:PaimonSLEEP:742203842732621846> 
the only thing i havent tried yet is flash cards but i would need things to put on them
<:hc_sigh:915061822590160936> i should try harder to learn chinese
<:hc_bunnylurk:916548819066429470> english is like breathing to me, it is the only thing i know
if you ever want to know anything or want proofread i can help <:kleeheart:930387130449006602>
<:keqPat:908000044089745428>
there is no specific rule to it, you kinda just have to know how to spell it <:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
spelling in english is very hard
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
i know numbers too at least <:pahuh:917035657531129857> 一 二 三 四 五 六 七 八 九 十
that is all the chinese i know
heh
i cant read chinese though so <:terishake:981119923835240468>
我的生日是 some day in the year i forgot

apple bully <:woggers:652740192653934633>
i'm on apple that's why
he can't complain because he does it too
<:A_HumuTao:816737540806541312>
maybe i'll just tell my dad i'm trying to pirate a game and he'll probably leave me alone
okk
it also notifies my dad every time i sign out of my account so i only have a few tries at this <:A_WheezeTao:793919527208484924>
yeah i tried to make an account
i can fake a jp address but i only have one phone and it wants a phne number <:hc_torodroop:905769701685227540>
<:HoRPeek:745809105901584404>
i want jp sekai
ahshsjdhjshdhdhd this is the only time i wish i had android
good night <:E_RaidenHeart:882522145048133643>
because when he did the account recovery it said his account was already linked to one
he linked it and now doesn't have the login to the account he linked it to?
i think the issue is that
i didnt get hos <:TeriSad:928714864891945052>

yeah that was my sayu impression from a while ago <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
<:pahuh:917035657531129857> i should probably delete some of my voice memos

i need jenshin on mobile cause i dont have access to internet on my laptop like 75% of the time
<:HoRPeek:745809105901584404>

<:collapsedwoggers:652852676228546611>

thats
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>

she says it was last year tho so if its been that long i doubt theyre coming for her
my friend just said she read nsfw stuff on a school laptop <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> i dont even know what to say to her
<:PaimonThink:826016328150155325>
didnt you say you have multiple hyv accounts <:A_HuLay:813064686815805500> just try them to see which one you linked
whats wrong now
you'll get it back <a:pat:969402615538520064>
and theres the account <:hc_bunnypeek:916548821360713759>
then just use the hotolab login to login to honky
if you keep chexking on hoyolab and find the account
he did <:hc_torodroop:905769701685227540> i remember
<:hc_toroyay:905769822913183756>
try another hyv account?
well thats obviously not your account
uh
obviously genshin one not useful rn <:woggers:652740192653934633>
both genshin and honkai have battle chronicle
ignore my sea alt account but this should be it
go back
look for the honky
not jenshin
ignore my images not loading
and find battle chronicle
and go to honkai icon
just tao everything until you find it
go to tools
hotolab?
theres two ways to log in with hoyo and its mihoyo the old one and hoyoverse new one
to see if its still there?

who you were

truly life?

voices can sound like hugs
<:HoRPeek:745809105901584404>
um
i learnt from citrine that
<:hc_bunnygasp:916548820496711720>
i learnt from hakcer that allowing java to access stuff on your computer enables multiplayer
what else did i learn
you can have mine <:kleeheart:930387130449006602>
i learnt from epi that sharing AE gacha results in a space with AE-less people is not a good idea
what else <:HoRPeek:745809105901584404>
i learnt from neko that i should not trust cats
<:TeriSad:928714864891945052>
i learnt from aoi that roblox hackers are sometimes not roblox hackers
i learnt from taihen that sparkly things in minecraft is expensive
i learnt from ruby that i don't need to pull iris if i buy it from bp
i learnt from heki that attempting to take over the world and gaining immortality is a stupid idea
i learnt from keilo that i can type my name with one hand on a keyboard
i learnt things from everyone in this server <:hc_toroyay:905769822913183756>
i'm not wrong <:hc_creepysmile:940296097111355413>
as long as i'm still capable of learning to do things then i'll do it <a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
thats okay, i know i have skill issue in most areas of life
my genshin brain prevents me from optimally functioning in an environment such as minecraft

Byebye
<:A_HuLay:813064686815805500>
lily is the person whose account got taken
no
i shouldve just let lily solve the problem
idk
<:hc_bunnycry:916548816965091348>
she lives close to me
yes
how to live when my cousin gets angry <:A_HuLay:813064686815805500>
reset it
she can
then theres no way
then the guy logged in and linked an email
if she made the account and didnt link an email
cause i took robux commisisons for art before and thats how i got paid
yeah
then
and the other person buys it
if one person makes a gamepass
no you can
idk if you need an email to make a roblox accoun
wait
idk
which
or group
which gets taxed
gamepass
apparently the person took her robux <:worryweird:987958026071834634> idk how you can do that tho, you'd have to either do it through
<:A_HuLay:813064686815805500> ?? so i think they really do have access to the account
wait a second
yeah i asked them for this screenshot, the date and time lines up with where they say they live <:RozaScout:928714351534309386>
its hi123im123new123 <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
they said the email's been changed too? can you even do that
no but
this is the username of the account
idk what to do
anyway
i hate that game
apparently they live in florida so the time is accurate
heres what they sent me
oh
wait
um
what time is it in florida rn
anyway
im confused now
wtf
<:MobiusTired:903057013356003368>
The girl herself says that she doesn't have access to the account tho
Oh, excuses <:HuTao_EvilLaugh:904020216302936095>
testing
idk i dont remmeber how old she is i never rly cared
is she 12
wait
i think she's 11 but that makes a small difference
let me try something
wait
oo
yes
<:hc_kthen:919278989602861136>
and then the girl is going to throw a tantrum i bet
but theyre holding the account hostage and won't give it back to the girl if i don't unban
i want to just ban them and leave it
ughhhhh
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I don't know
<:hc_sigh:915061822590160936>
it's the older brother of one of the kids apparently
i'm a moderator in my cousin's stupid little roblox server and kids are dming me and hacking each other's accounts
ok so
<:hc_bunnypray:916548823311065099> i'm not worried about them scolding me its just that my cousin will probably lose some of her ever so precious followers
smhn
i told him to give me my ip address and it was wrong
my uncle is i dont think my aunt is
i really dont care about the poor kid who clicked the link but my cousin will be so pissed if i let this slide
yeah

I GOT HER LIKE EVERY WEEK
i havent finished the neko daily questline..
and then when i finished i moved to liyue for the stupid story man
because a certain snezhnayan merchant ensured i never had my comms set anywhere else
ive never done comms in inazuma
same
yeah
i got the storytelling one a few times but i keep getting the wrong stories <:hc_torocry:905941001317793813>
you come back to the guy and youre like 'do you want the taste of dove?'
ITS FUNNY
i always kill the pigeons
oh yeah
no but i got perfect helper almlst every day when i was low ar
found the screenshot
yee
i was on genshin during class and saw i had the tsarevich commission an d was so excited that i promptly screwed it up <:teri_shake:876542109467934830>
I HATE ELLA MUSK <:hc_torosad:905769505421160448>
heheh i had my commissions set to mondstadt for months to get it
i have it
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
i love genshin exploration but when i'm at 98-99% and can't find anything <:notlikekeq:977817672035205180>
how to do
aaa
the controls are reversed <:HoRPeek:745809105901584404>
ong i finally figured out to rotate this stupid box of pixels
i like exploring but not the walking in circles with my compass trying to find the last 1%
but 100% is hard so i've settled for 90+
don't like
numbers not matching
i only have 100% mondstadt and two regions in liyue <:A_HuDead:807838119784087582>
thats cool <:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
waow
<:notlikekeq:977817672035205180>
my chasm above/under is only at 90/94 <:hc_torosad:905769505421160448> i cant find any more chests in surface
i am a sad genshit player <:TeriSad:928714864891945052>
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
easy to get to
theres a fishing spot in the green area
waow
the only chasm fishing spot i know of is underground too
i think
no
<:hc_creepysmile:940296097111355413> + no map
theyre so cute
i love enkanomiya fish
my catch is nonexistent <:hc_kthen:919278989602861136>
whaat
<:hc_torodroop:905769701685227540>
<:hc_kthen:919278989602861136>

<:hc_bunnylurk:916548819066429470>
isnt it pretty
<:hc_torodroop:905769701685227540> fishing up another 1500 fish is going to take me all year
oh we're all in the same armada aren't we <:hc_bunnygasp:916548820496711720> i only just realised
I saw <:excitedklee:897406125144686662>
<:hc_torowave:905769653744304159>
my mother is about to wake up <:kazuhawtf:980770260783337532> i'll be back soon <:QiqiPeek:781028042708746260>
how are you even going to attain immortality in the first place
<:hc_torodroop:905769701685227540>
youre going to remove parts of the human population and farm them for brain tissue??? <:SeeleSweat:843946435271852103> that is weird
youre going to
if i ask enough questions maybe he'll see what's wrong with his line of thinking <:HoRPeek:745809105901584404> but the answers keep getting weirder
heki are you going to play minecraft on the server <:jeanconfused:980962419021082724>
<:hc_kthen:919278989602861136>

<:teriweird:980770251685908490>
and how are you going to keep all this brain tissue
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
what are you going to do with the bodies
why are you destroying the human population
ok my next question is
i think i'd rather just die
<:hc_bunnycry:916548816965091348>
all of it sounds pretty stupid
well
NO BUT
how do you propose this will work
<:HUH:988073500730359908>

<:teriweird:980770251685908490>
i want to ask about the fishing achievement <:TeriSad:928714864891945052>
<:QiqiPeek:781028042708746260> where did tet go
<:E_NoelleHuh:793917828909760552> <:E_NoelleHuh:793917828909760552>
<:E_NoelleHuh:793917828909760552>
i'm happy with my account even if i don't have the gear or skill to do things
<:hc_bunnypeek:916548821360713759>
then got free SpA and no gear <:hc_toroyay:905769822913183756>
i think i started playing again at around the end of SpA patch but i forgot what number that was
<:hc_torosad:905769505421160448> i know
free FR <:hc_toroyay:905769822913183756> and then i deleted it because storage issue
i started playing again in mobius first banner
like 40-50?
i dont think ive ever gotten a s rank from the non dorm banner
<:hc_torostressed:905941090060861440> i have like close to no gear
this is what i do
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
uh
<:hc_torodroop:905769701685227540>

waow
<:TeriSad:928714864891945052>
the only maths question we had was like 10 x 10
well idk why they let us use the calculator in a science exam
i cant even be bothered to get my calculator out for exams sometimes <:PaimonSLEEP:742203842732621846>
what <:HoRPeek:745809105901584404>
thats so much effort
then you just round 280 up to 300 and divide to get an approximate amount which will be slightly off but then unless you have the brainpower to do the exact division which i dont <:SeeleSweat:843946435271852103>
since 14k is 50 pulls <:hc_bunnylurk:916548819066429470>
yeah a bit below 50
oh

i hate when that happens
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
sometimes before i go to sleep and i need to get up early i just repeat the thought 'wake up at 5' or whatever time and then i get up at around then <:hc_toroyay:905769822913183756> is useful except for the times it doesnt work
the latest i woke up was like 7am after 6 weeks <:hc_torodroop:905769701685227540>
even when i had summer break
what <:HUH:988073500730359908>
sounds messy tho
but then i struggle to wake up at 6 for actual school <:hc_torosad:905769505421160448>
during my school holidays i wake up at like 4-5am for some reason
<:Xiao_RubsEyes:816661652786774026> i wouldnt have gotten my phone if i could go back to sleep

i dont like eleanor but shes english from what i remember and i dont feel like typing chinese <:VENTI_SCARED:708170080290209842>
eleanor
i've got saki ai, chiyu and
i'm using just free voicebanks provided
i forgot how to use the program tho <:TeriSad:928714864891945052>
yes
similar to vocaloid kinda <:hc_toroconfused:905769962386386945>

<:worrypat:986461060104081508>

i get more than that <:teriweird:980770251685908490>
then you can export as picture and people can use
you just open it and make a new skin, then choose template skin and draw over it
but i am using app called skinseed
i don't know if it is website too
going to stop working on it for now
tired now <:A_HuLay:813064686815805500>
yes, i am using an app to do it
spreadsheet art is not quite the same
i really don't know what i'm doing... pixel art is not familiar to me <:hc_sigh:915061822590160936>
it's kinda tedious
you should
<:hc_bunnyfight:916548818047225896>
so it's all 2d images just stuck together
i have to draw the outfit on every side of each part
Yes
i'd rather make it myself even if it's not as good

is hard

whoever was being an idiot in honkai-help today was really annoying for some reason <:TeriSad:928714864891945052>
*hehehe*
sleep well
<:hc_torowave:905769653744304159>
Good night tet
it's because he's like the ex boyfriend of someone i used to be friends with so it feels weird to talk to him <:hc_kthen:919278989602861136>
But he stays up to talk to me <:felissad:987316204286922784> Sleep is more important
<:hc_torodroop:905769701685227540>
i'm not just going to let him stay up all night
i still care
but
my relationship with the guy is kinda weird
I asked my friend what time it was so I could tell him to go to sleep if it was late and now he's telling me to stop caring <:hc_bunnysad:916548825072693298>
<:hc_torodroop:905769701685227540>
good night

i crafted jst before fu hua musician <:hc_kthen:919278989602861136>
<:worrypat:970956862474309642>
when you told me to save for hua i said there was no hua coming soon and you still told me to save for the nonexistent hua <:hc_kthen:919278989602861136>
stop watching them
resist the urge
you taught me how to save <:hc_bunnypeek:916548821360713759> just remember you're saving for hua

i don't have mobius so i'm not going to pull
<:hc_catwheart:859888641680343060>
just worried <:hc_bunnysad:916548825072693298>
okay

yeah
<:ritacry:981130947292463114> i cant find them in members list anymore
leave
Did they
I think just consider which one you like more to be honest 
do you value the looks of your mobius or the difficulty of abyss more? 
<:E_think:793918036787986453>
Oh that's true
if i can contribute 
i think i agree with tet that if you want to get skin, you may as well pull gear or else you won't get to see it 
from what i've read retaining agony is not as agonising as the name implies and cezanne will be back one day anyway <:SeeleSweat:843946435271852103>

mobius obby roblox <:hc_creepysmile:940296097111355413>
i got stuck <:hc_chickheart:855451090316296232>

<:hc_kthen:919278989602861136>

<:E_NoelleHuh:793917828909760552>
namecards are my favourite things in the game and i really want this one <:hc_bunnyplead:916548822434480178>
playing genshin again..
<:hc_torostressed:905941090060861440>
<:hc_bunnygasp:916548820496711720>
sounds really cute waa
<:hc_bunnyplead:916548822434480178>
<:hc_bunnypeek:916548821360713759> small animals are cute but i am scared that i might damage them if i went near them
<:felissad:987316204286922784> i hope you get her on rerun
oh, they are playing roblox..?
<:hc_bunnysad:916548825072693298>
are you going to pull <:C_GhostHuh:792111057022746624>
<:hc_bunnypeek:916548821360713759>
Internet getting cut for an hour, please ping if you need me so I can read when I'm back <:XingqiuWave_SUKYARU_:781266153888022558>
2s time limit only applies from when I apply electro, not from when I freeze them, so it is okay for me <:hc_catwheart:859888641680343060>
These achievements are difficult because you have to kill them with the damage from the reaction itself, not just causing the reaction and then they die <:hc_chickheart:855451090316296232>
Otherwise Lisa just.. hits whatever she wants <:hc_kthen:919278989602861136>
But I'm using hydro slimes in a domain by freezing and then attacking with electro, because it makes them stay still so I can hit them properly
I used that floor for the overload achievement with yanfei
<:hc_catwheart:859888641680343060> Sorry if my explanation isn't good enough, youtube should have clearer one
That is how I did it
Just spam skills when it is vulnerable to trigger all the swirls
Go to anemo cube
Yes
Get barbara/xiangling/fischl/kaeya
So
Oh oh
Minecraft villagers does not make me upset 

but this does <:A_HumaruCry:837244118056697858>
<:hc_chickheart:855451090316296232>
It is very cute, I like the 'fish' <:E_BarbaraHeart:793914591611715624>
I received nitro for a commission, so I have access to more emotes for the next month <:hc_bunnygasp:916548820496711720>
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
Thank you
I'll try my best to word my sentences in a way that doesn't leave room for misinterpretation
Oh
At least internet is back now <:hc_catwheart:859888641680343060>
Oh, I forgot about it <:hc_torocry:905941001317793813>
Hello Sora <:XingqiuWave_SUKYARU_:781266153888022558>
Sorry, did I seem upset? I'm just discussing why I don't particularly enjoy taking from villagers, even though there is every reason I can and probably should
Huh
<:A_HuSadge:814445957960826931>
going to village also makes me anxious because zombies might come and turn them all green <:hc_kthen:919278989602861136> then they start hitting me
<:hc_torosad:905769505421160448>
i like to do things myself, taking from village just feels like i'm leeching off them <:hc_kthen:919278989602861136>
i don't wanna steal their work
they made the houses and farmed the crops
<:hc_torosad:905769505421160448>
you can't just take their house and their stuff <:hc_torocry:905941001317793813>
that's bullying
i don't like village <:hc_bunnysad:916548825072693298>
building a big proper house is a lot of effort, whereas it is less effort and resources to just make the front door look pretty... then the hill does the rest <:hc_torostressed:905941090060861440>
i like to build inside hill/mountain <:hc_bunnygasp:916548820496711720>
<a:hilichurlburning:792278522168475648>
oh

i literally explained something to someone in wfp and they ignored me and now theyre asking a question i told them the answer to
if you say so cherry <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
why the chat name
why
meeeee too
idk i dont rly care <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154> its just a few letters
i think the test in terms of accuracy is ok ?? but the wording is annoying because it says everything stated like a fact, as if everyone in that personality type will do this will do that
communication is hard
aaa
i just see it and
sorry, i start judging things very quickly
but i guess that's why you take a test so that someone can tell you about your personality
it just seems kinda condescending like i know everything
idk
why couldnt it just say they can be dreamer and pessimist
kinda stupid
the way its worded just sounds
do you want me to read more
That's the only thing I read
you dont understand how many of my classmates ive asked about the recent interest rate rises because no one will listen to me
i read this and stopped reading i think its accurate enough <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154> <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
oh <:felissad:987316204286922784> the last sentence in the first paragraph is already getting to me
meee too i'll read what it says
wait
oh i want to take test
oh
i like the chick emotes because someone i value a lot used to send them to me <:chickHappy:981170092240928819> and i was the chick and she was the other penguin bird thing
i recognise all of them <:felissad:987316204286922784>
i really like this one
as far as i know everyone is nice most of the time <:Terichew:973794176015675392> so i don't mind the occasional relapse
when discussion is not about.. peculiar things everyone is nice <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
it is ok
hi keilo <:chickHappy:981170092240928819> please don't apologise
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>

<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
is okay, please don't apologise <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> i can go

<:worryweird:987958026071834634>

i dont think i have a single sac sword or stringless
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> my weapons are pretty bad
i was pulling with my friends and we were just crowded around the phone yelling <:worryweird:987958026071834634> but it was wgs and everyone was just cursing me with diluc predictions <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
sayu has my lvl 1 wgs
ouch
<:worrypat:986461060104081508> <:worrypat:986461060104081508>
i dont like claymore
i have wolf's gravestone and amos bow for my nonexistent ganyu and whoever uses wolf's gravestone
genshin bullied me too <:felissad:987316204286922784>
yaay
i have amos and no ganyu so yeah <:cryge:966624721611403294>
my amber does a little bit of damage so whenever i feel salty about ganyu i use her
i really want amber cons
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> would've been nicer if they made the choice to not hit 
words are enough <:felissad:987316204286922784>
my siblings too
my parents did it when we screwed up and so that was just the punishment
<:cryge:966624721611403294> yeah,,,, i know
it's not abnormal for me so i guess i don't really see why i would disclose it not casually <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
it's usually just a pillow but when i was younger it was hard objects
then she'll hit me with the nearest thing available <:felissad:987316204286922784> <:felissad:987316204286922784>
<:felissad:987316204286922784> she'll wake me up and be grumpy and say i sleep too much or say i was on my phone all night
i asked to stay home and got yelled at but my dad said i could and now she's just goig to take every opportunity to be angry at me
<:felissad:987316204286922784> headache
pills that tasted shit

i dont like the quote command <:felissad:987316204286922784>
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
have to zoom in and point out 'brush' 'paint' 'dress'
i find it funny how they like
<:felissad:987316204286922784> <:felissad:987316204286922784> <:felissad:987316204286922784>
...
my bag is like not even 2 metres away from me and the text on it is blurry without my glasses
my vision sucks <:felissad:987316204286922784>
i'd rather wear the glasses so that everything is clear
and when i have earphones in too my ears are just struggling
but its so inconvenient
i knowww
so envious of people who live without glasses
i have glasses <:felissad:987316204286922784> <:felissad:987316204286922784> <:felissad:987316204286922784>

<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>

sorry that was unnecessarily harsh <:felissad:987316204286922784> <:felissad:987316204286922784>
i think we established that a long time ago
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>

crystal you can get many times over
important
cake imporant
i used crystals because it's 25 for 60 stamina 
but if i use the 60 stamina to do expeditions i can do at least 3 stages which will give me 45 crystals minimum
so technically i earn 20
is okay, even if your advice isn't the best i still appreciate when you do help me or say something <:chickHappy:981170092240928819> because you took the time in your day and the effort to type something or react <:felissad:987316204286922784>
not worrying is really hard <:felissad:987316204286922784> teach
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
maybe
i think i'm okay
<:felissad:987316204286922784> i don't want anyone to worry though
i will try to be less aggressive <:felissad:987316204286922784>

<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>

genshin is just
i have enouhg for the game but i need double the space to unzip files because while it unzips there will be the zip file which is 35 gb and then the actual files which is 35 so need 70 <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
all i said to him was 'i need internet for more than 4 hours to download this game' and he already doesn't believe me <:felissad:987316204286922784>
how do i explain to my parent that i need storage
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> i've only got 118 gb on this laptop so uuhh

scary <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
but i don't like the one you showed <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
griffin i think ? 
but it's probably because i don't like the idea of a dragon with arms <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212> <:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
i think eli said something like hello and goodbye
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
for a cockroach
orange
it's a bit
but lab reports so boring <:felissad:987316204286922784>
my assessments should be over but they decided to give us extra for science <:felissad:987316204286922784>

<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
i keep forgetting to do my commissions and then i complain i have no primos <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>

i only realised i forgot to do commissions

<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
THE KLEE
LOOKS SO WEIRD
THAT OUTFIT
it was our dms
so many crystals
oh dw it was jsut my friend talking about dalao
HUH
thats nice of him
yes
i got turg b on offrate too i think
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
dont give me the option if you dont want me to choose it <:felissad:987316204286922784>
when you choose truth everyone just stares at you angrily like you just ruined the whole game
okay
i see,,
i just dont wanna inconvenience anyone <:felissad:987316204286922784> and having people angry at me is also not fun
<:felissad:987316204286922784> <:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
i'm scared of annoying people <:felissad:987316204286922784> annoyance leads to anger <:felissad:987316204286922784>
then i end up with 5 minutes of just 'hello' 'hi' <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
the only issue i have is that if its in dms i dont really know how to keep going with the conversation except saying hello again <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
hello ruby <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
because i like that they cared enough to say hello back
i'm happy when people say hello to me
i feel you <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
<:kleepray:963350716901113876> yes
byebye baban!!
thinking about how much i like people
after being introduced to the concept of friendship points
hehe okaayy
It was normal time for me
byebye fenri <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
keilo is friend ! <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
i think it's just that when people hear 'points' they want to know
everyone just wants to know where they rank on the keilo friendship
goodnight baban <:kleepray:963350716901113876>
sleep well baban <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
i.. see
how does this even work <:cryge:966624721611403294>
i asked and i got hua so i'll do it even if it hurts
no
sora do you want to try drawing that <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
to draw one character i have to take like 5 photos and still have the 3d model open
im struggling <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
as an artist that suffers with mihoyo's stupid design choices every time i draw
wtf is this <:cryge:966624721611403294>
baban i finished one of my cadet task things <:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
will stream drawing if i stil have internet when whatever's going on in vc is over <:kleepray:963350716901113876>
stopp baban <:felissad:987316204286922784> too smart
thank you for the answer <:kleepray:963350716901113876>
ok
kiana or hua
okay um i need some help
<:felissad:987316204286922784> i really dont like the thought of that
<:worrypat:986461060104081508> i hope it gets better soon, if it still hurts i think honey and lemon tea might help, i usually drink it
what is omegle
like a really long beep <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
i can hear this weird noise
um
aaa
my lungs very weak <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> can't run far, but willing to walk everywhere
you type english very well
i don't exercise which is why i am very weak and unintelligent
because,, need energy to exercise, bad diet will not give you as much energy and nutrients to sustain it too i think.. and eating less will also give less energy to exercise
Oh
Rather than eat less, eat things that are more nutritious <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Eat food please D:
No
hehhehaha
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819> see
i am nice to everyone and in return i get my emote submissions added to the server
the things you find pretty i find pretty too, and it makes me happy that we can share it <:kannawaow:963350507655688212> sometimes i worry my responses are too dry, but i say the same things usually because everything you show me is just really cute <:felissad:987316204286922784>
i was gonna ask if anyone wanted to watch me draw but <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
WOAH
i have to go byebye
wait
i think
some screenshots at least
then you should find
has:image diavoros
type in
go to search bar
Bad
up to you who you want to talk to
i cant control your actions
well
are you gonna talk to diavoros <:concern:966623298639261746>
the invite is
its
aoi
yeah
baban doesnt want you to talk to
diavoros is kinda <:concern:966623298639261746>
they asked in a server if anyone had comms open 
i don't do them usually since no one is interested <:clueless:973756617109676032> but i'm happy to draw for free too so why pay if you can get it for free i guess
idk nitro prices in usd, whichever is equivalent to $10
idk
if i do this commission well they might give me nitro so <:kleepray:963350716901113876>
no time to do other stuff
im working on a commission rn
do you have pics of baban <:concern:966623298639261746>
aoi
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>

hehehe
no
okaayy
stop i dont have money
what is it

<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324> it'd be a bit weeiirdd if you did but ok <:kleepray:963350716901113876>
yeah i know <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>

that was worded badly
hgyukhsf

:D
internet has been cut <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> cant work anymore
but i think i will have the same issue in all emulator? hyper v needs to be disabled for third party emulator according to microsoft
any, but dont want to use bluestacks
sigh <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> okay, i'm done aaaaaaaaaaa i don't want to break my laptop or play around in the settings any longer
oops, both blue hair <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> 
oh no [panik] 
be careful with asterisk or else they will starve
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> tried guide, gave me this
it is eula, matching with my friend, penguin 
but i will always be birb aster inside <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
it says to install <:holothink:963352118855626753> I need to disable it but i think that should give me an option to turn it off so i'll try
<:cryge:966624721611403294> i am on x1, too weak for x1.5
^ agree <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> but i struggle with 1.5
it came with device <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
? pretty sure windows 11, new laptop
thank you so much for the help 😭 trying my best
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
i'm not sure if it's because windows 11 is still relatively new <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i need to disable it so that i can use the emulator, but all solutions i am finding either don't work or are for windows 10
there is a certain setting called Hyper V that makes third party emulators not work
virtualisation is enabled since i have a microsoft device
i restarted laptop since mumu said it would disable the setting but i opened it again and it still wants to me restart and disable again?? <:cryge:966624721611403294>
settings being mean to me <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
all the disablign hyper V stuff is for windows 10 <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> i am on 11 and nothing is working <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
<@129446145314258945> sorry to ping aaa
i'm trying to run mumu, but it says i have to disable hyper V
have you ever run into this issue <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> i've tried google solutions
i never heard it idk <:Terichew:973794176015675392>
just want to make sure it won't do weird stuff to my device <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
okay, thank you!
is your experience with it ok? cant rly find anything in depth on it <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>

it feels awkward to ask tho
thank you sora !
<:cryge:966624721611403294> i was called sassy autocorrect by someone a few years ago and then no one wanted to talk to me because they said i would correct everything they said
candy is scary
it's true <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
it's
should i be scared
my autocorrect capabilities lie in english only <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> sorry for the inconvenience

im just not allowed to use it
i do
ok i have no money so that sounds ok
ohh
like you just dont get flagged for that <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
it'll still be there??
so if i download like jp sekai and then swap back to the australia apple id
i dont want to do something stupid and mess it up <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
so
not rly sure how to make new apple account and how it will affect my phone
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
but
let me play global honkai on my phone <:cryge:966624721611403294>
apple is mean
i tried just changing region and it didnt work so i think i need like separate account <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
oh
apple bullying me <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
how to get other region games aaa
i can get it
i dont think
what if heki doesnt <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
you said to kill people if you didnt wanna talk to them <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
shaking and crying <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
noo <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i want to come if it's not while i'm at school
i'd follow your advice if it wasn't illegal
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
talking to people is scary help
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
never mind this will use all my data
eh my art isnt good enough anyway <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
when did the frog pat get added here ive been using nqn every time
oh wait
i'll research that for future use
oh thats cool
you can do that with itunes cards?
wait
what are you supposed to do with those
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
i think theres stuff like stripe and whatnot maybe it operates in your country
i'm just too little
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i used to do them for currency in a certain game
i want to try real money but no paypal or way to get money hh <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
but in a way its also nicer, you get direct contact to client and get to see their reaction
or at least that's what i like about it <:catblush:963351912235810826>
elyyyy
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
client contact > organise payment method and price > get paid > draw > finish, hope client likes product <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> i like commissions because they feel way cleaner
NFTs are very bad huh
thank you <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
that makes sense actually
oh
but how does it use energy <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
you buy an artwork
but instead of buying the artwork 
you buy a piece of paper that says you own the artwork
i know nfts is like
can i ask 
how does this work? is it not just,, selling art or <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
<:kleepray:963350716901113876> yay! i hope i can go to the genshin one at least
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212> oh, they give psd for layers

<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
oh
no <:cryge:966624721611403294>
what is that <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
that sounds really hard <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
uh
it sounds horrible <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i hope you get to go somewhere else one day

idk when i dont know how to do a question and i'm out of time i just write down random shit and sometimes i'll get a mark for
even if you dont know how to do it you might be able to get marks by writing stuff down
good luck
oh no
oh
i got demoted to original sin again kill me
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
hello
scared for HoS
prettier than eden and guns
FR and iris is pretty
but
iris irene
bad
oh
how does the bingo work
if you want to be friends <:chickHappy:981170092240928819> <:chickHappy:981170092240928819> but i'm still only level 60 something i cant do much
im not going anywhere
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
i want to play on global
can switch server with a button in genshin
global honkai not available in my region
<:concern:966623298639261746>
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
i'll take it
i want to be as dedicated to tasks as qiqi, and i want to draw as well as griseo <:fishwow:963697747473604638>
i like griseo and qiqi
i don't mean anything odd with this i just genuinely think aponia looks weird <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
weird
kinda
it's just
i don't like yelan and aponia because i feel like some aspects of them are just unnecessarily highlighted and it's a bit weird
i like jean because she's pretty, and i like that i can use her skill to throw around baron bunny 
she also works hard, and i want to do that too ! so i like jean a lot
it's like the only thing i get told when i say anything about who i like <:Terichew:973794176015675392>
i know
i dont like mona
i like albedo and jean
i dont like lumine or hu tao that much <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
yelan is weird
is
and yelan
i dont like xingqiu because he's friendship 10 and i have no more use for him
every time i see it i feel like patting my wall with my head aggressively
stop
i hate the way people spell xingqiu's name wrong every time djgnfkgnlg
so yeah genshin luck is <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
no fischl? <:concern:966623298639261746>
keqing (75 pity, raiden banner)
albedo (75 pity)
mona (75-78 pity, xiao banner)
c1 keqing on standard (43 pity)
kokomi (75-78 pity)
c2 keqing (75-78 pity, venti banner)
venti (6 pity) 
jean (80 pity, ayaka banner) 

still.. waiting for xiao... he'll come home right <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
my pulls are um,,
i cant farm her i'm living off the 50 ancient legacy i get from events
so lucky <:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
i love FR very much <:catblush:963351912235810826> i'm happy i finally get to get her s1 soon

<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>

i had weird idea of watching chinese drama with both cn and en subtitles and copy down the words along with translation so i learn how to write it and know how it sounds 
but i dont know the english translation on that is kinda weird too <:Terichew:973794176015675392> and its also kinda dumb <:Terichew:973794176015675392>
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
i dont know how to say or write or read it though <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>

<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
cuteee
im so close <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> i could jsut spend a bit of crystals to seeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee who i get
level 23
im like
oh
what do you buy from spending event when you cant afford outfit
down
calm
it's going to be okay
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> i dont like her that much
well..
my only s rank is sixth serenade rn and i really want to see if i get someone better <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> but i needed someone to replace seele, her attack bar fills too slow aah
me when dimension breaker and black nucleus
i didnt
i'm not allowed to pull on dorm with crystals so i can't
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
feeling the urge to pull on dorm <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
waow
thank you nqn
oh
:hutaopanik:
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i want to see what the opj thing in wfp is but they havent released any information unless you join the teams and i dont want to <:TeriMald:973795215045455872> i jsut wanna know whats happening
maybe can look for art communities or post it somewhere
anatomy.. very hard
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i usually use real photo reference rather than other people's drawing reference, since i think it is better to take the pose from that especially since it makes the pose more realistic even if it's more stiff
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
have a lot of art to do for work right now
but
<:kleepray:963350716901113876> yes!
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> for me is opposite
can only draw humans, love looking at objects and backgrounds.. but so hard to draw
thank you sora <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
but trying my best
i am not good at drawing objects
<:fishwow:963697747473604638>
oh that is cute <:catblush:963351912235810826>
also more excuse to doodle so i can post on hoyolab <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
so adding genshin automatically makes it 50% more interesting to me
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> i am but drawing food and things by itself is boring for me and i start getting not motivated
i need to draw pictures to illustrate food and decoration, sushi, dango, fireworks and things <:holothink:963352118855626753> 
so i thought to draw inazuma characters <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
well having only heads drawn does not satisfy the requirements of what i need <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912> need to draw the rest of the things too
currently only have heads and no features <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
drawing genshin characters for a school project
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
hello sora
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
thank you
oh
what are those
what is the thing they say about genshin that involves friends along the way
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
thats why you read text <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i just got my friend to do it
anything for crystals
yeah it's not like i have a dps so i'll just use all the lightnign supports together <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
looks kinda weird <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
she just
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> FR prettier imo don't want to use eden
oh
iris is pretty
i have 10 balls on my FR account that i was going to use for iris since i can get 2 more from bp
yeah
ah
they're giving out FR and iris aren't they
i was surprised how much they gave out
starter event is very nice
FR account lost starter event ages ago i've had that one since anniversary <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
i have 3 honkai accounts
one has nothing decent except FR, SpA, turg B and like 13k crystals 
the other is starter and has 2/4 SW and.. thats it really but SW is too pretty 
and my NA alt is just a permanent state of neglect <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
see you soon aoi <:chickHappy:981170092240928819> dont die
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
woah
and i like all of them
but the other's got SW
cause one has FR and SpA
dont have time
but yeah i just
i like them both <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
yes please <:kleepray:963350716901113876>
jsut thinking i want to prioritise one honkai account because i'm trying to take care of them all <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
hm
movies are too long, no patience to watch
oh it works <:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
can you reply to someone with a gif or will it just spit out the gif with no reply
going with baban
but if friends is ok <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
you're screwed as well
yes,, i think also if they start relying on the sensei and the sensei is wrong then
ely art very pretty
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
will be back soon
a bit wonky
but then your sleep schedule will be

<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>

Yes
i just want to hand the thing in and then never attend this class again <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
it's not the main assessment so we didn't get much detail i don't know
i didnt ask him about it tho i did most of it by myself <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154> i dont think i was meant to do that
i don't like unanswered questions <:cryge:966624721611403294> when you ask me things i'm inevitably going to answer
yes
75%
um
hello!
just need to find images
i need to do the project as in finish it <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
no i have
i don't like group work because i have to wait for other people's input and then everything is so slow
do the project
i jsut need to
yes <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
noooooooo 
but we have a lot of class time to work on it too <:cryge:966624721611403294>
oh i was having trouble with a classmate and a school project before ><
unfriended him on discord when i was cleaning my friends list
i kind of
ok...
um
It's
Oh
I am thinking
Hello
i sing the alphabet a lot but
what to do for herrscher name
oh yeah
because i like it when people say hi to me too
i am happy to greet everyone
what is wrong
hello aoi
hello sora
0/4 and no HoS hehe!! <:PepeSmile:966629532943650836>
crying
i know HoS is really good and i'm listening, i probably will pull if i have more crystals by then tbh 
but rn a lot of it jsut relies on my luck and i don't like that, i don't want to have another SW situation where i'm playing so much because i'm flat broke but need gear/character 
it's not definite and that makes me worried which is why i'm hesitating a lot <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> but thank you, i'll make a note to prioritise her
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i want to save up a lot before i pull for anyone so that im not stuck with like 2 crystals by the time i'm done
going to do ER rn with felis <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
ok i see
i have learnt not to count on my luck because it doesn't actually exist <:PepeSmile:966629532943650836>
does HoS need gear tho <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> no way i can afford
oh delicious
weapon
bastet T scott MB and the craftable
i'm using
raven, SpA, FR, felis, fischl, valkyrie gloria and ritual imayoh
i have
my account is very gear issue
i dont have purana
its just
felis or SpA
yeah... on void <:PepeSmile:966629532943650836>
thats enough to get something probably
oh nice
13
s rank guaranteed in 57 drops i'm on like 43 pity
very worried
but like when i see my crystal count and i have barely anything i get like
yay nqn is back
dont remember let me check
i'm on
all my crystals are gone
cause then
but pulling makes me sad
i know i should
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
ofc my sw one is on like 35 crystals tho <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
13k
i am
i just don't have crystals to spare ever
of course, that's reasonable
heheh
for me at least
no HoS to put it on, no point in pulling <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
hm
OH
it costs money doesnt it <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i did i did <:chickHappy:981170092240928819> <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
get a plain floatie and draw on it
i'm scared
i dont really know what valks i want to get anymore now that i have sw

<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>

doesnt this kinda look like an elysium everlasting chest <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>

:DD very excited !!
i think a better question to ask is whether i got her gear because thats not immediately obvious
yes i got her <:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
its useless talk
but
why does my sensei ask if i got sw i have my profile set to her and everything <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>

drowning sorrows in sugar water and lemon

whats a fetish
sugar content is high, not good for me
i did not know
oh
and i cant drink chocolate milk <:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294>
i'm not mean i think
nooo
i'm not that good
but i am still going to because i look weird when i hold my hand over my face constantly
i know i shouldnt judge books by their cover or their scent
anywyas
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912> <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
STOP
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
i have to hold my hand over my face whenever i walk because everyone smells so weirddd
i walked past someone and she smelt like watermelon <:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
everyone has a scent and i hate it
like the way everyone individually smells
not perfume
WAHH
and i like the way she smells
i can smell people whenever they walk past or whenever they're near me
its not like that
NO
no
i just really hope my classmate lets me work with her because she smells nice
sighh
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
but other classes i can't handle them they're so annoying ;;; they catch on so slowly and i hate their voices and i cant seem to get anything done
i really dont like my classmates <:cryge:966624721611403294> i'm happy to talk to people in my english and maths class
how do i magically skip the years of my life that i need to interact then
yeah <:cryge:966624721611403294>
i'm kinda stuck in like 
i don't want to have to deal with him and have to help him do things 
but i'd feel so bad leaving him to the mercy of my stupid asf classmates <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
its only for a few weeks and then i'll never see him again
no
i'm not familiar with this person i don't want to talk to them and have to sit next to them and spend so long having to negotiate on things
thanks sora <:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294> 
i'll keep trying i guess hh
I DO NOT WANT MORE FRIENDS TO WORRY ABOUT
and i cant leave it because no one's going to bother trying to communicate with him, they'll just try to talk to him and he's scared that they'll make fun of him for his poor english too
i know i have to deal with it
i do have friends D::: i can talk to them ~~even though it took me a year~~
don't want to deal with him
because i just
i dont know
currency
to get stuff
you can use boxes
i saw that
+ i literally dont have storageee
brawl stars...???? i looked at it and it's like.. idk gacha but weird
but i dont speak cantonese and i dont play the same games and i still dont want to have anything to do with him hhdfjdjfjk
i wrote on the paper with them a lot and we had a conversation for the whole lesson, like just writing on paper 
i got that he plays games as well and native language is cantonese
whenever i talk to my classmates i just get really impatient and i hate talking like my throat just closes up
i dont know why but its a lot easier to talk to you <:cryge:966624721611403294>
and it would be hypocritical of me
i don't have her either
because
no
so it's not as hard
but i've talked to you before
it's hard
hhh
i'm happy to do all the work ok just dont make me talk or present to people
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
but my main issue is tomorrow i have practical lesson and i don't want to talk with him anymore but i have to and i hate people and i wish i could do all of it by myself
we have powerpoint and i managed to communicate enough to get some things onto it
but i'm scared to message too i'm just <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i have his discord
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
his written english is better so i got that happening since it was easier
idk i cant figure it out because all we did was write on a paper
just
peculiar
sob sorry this is such a small issue but i'm so like worried about it
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
no i just dont like my classmates
but then i'd waste food
+ i might end up having to do practical lessons with him too and i do not want to touch or consume anything that has been made with hands that are not mine
c) now i have to deal with him for the rest of the term and i don't know how to do our project
b) he barely speaks english
a) i'm really really bad at talking to people
and i was sitting by myself and i got told to do our project with this new student in our class
i have food studies as one of my subjects
so um
help
i need
thank you
good good
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>

aw
t!friendship <@726672158151147521>
yay, friends!
nyx is pretty
no but i'm drawing her rn
nyx <:PepeSmile:966629532943650836>
that kinda sounds fun like to guess based on an image part
actually
oh cool citrine stream !!
anyone want to watch me draw for uh 3 minutes
..
i want to watch
i feel liek talking to people online is more scary than irl but i think its jsut me
talking to people is scary !!!
i dont know if she means girlfriend or friend that was a girl
my science teacher said she had a girlfriend once
i understand 'my birthday is on'
numbers, i, you, your, what, hello, goodbye
like close to nothing though
i understand a bit of chinese
words to say
i need like
let me finish tea
wait
yesyssy
yes
<@244423082045997057> drink grass water
...
WHY IS THE BUG TRYING TO DRINK MY GRASS WATER
yes
yeah i'm not getting paid enough 🙁
australia was fabricated by the british to hide the murder of thousands of convicts and stuff
like apparently i'm a paid actor from south america and every time you go to australia you're actually getting flown to a small island
i read a whole article about how people think australia isn't real
lmao yeah haha oh i'm not offended i get the joke
sorry <:Terichew:973794176015675392> going to fade from your memory now
i'm not real
yeah
australia doesn't
you don't need to touch grass if you drink tea you just need to touch the tea and you technically touched some form of grass
grass water right
don't lie to get out of this
oh wow
<@244423082045997057> why dont you like tea
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?
SHEEP??
<@244423082045997057> do you drink cold tea
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
my tea is cold
i am sorry for my aggression i will ensure i do not lash out at semi innocent sheep again <:kleepray:963350716901113876>
you stupid sheep
i am
yes
<@244423082045997057> do you possess a shred of intelligence
that makes sense
thank you!
ohh
damn ok that was too complex for your tiny brain
<@244423082045997057> do i have severe skill issue or gear issue
no bullying
what is the definition of furry
<@244423082045997057> should i go sleep today too
it said yes
see
<@244423082045997057> should keilo go to sleep today
sleep is good, you sleep ;(
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
it is! keilo will wake up tomorrow
<:PepeSmile:966629532943650836>
wake up tomorrow
i wish i didn't either
<@244423082045997057> will i wake up tomorrow
i dont know maybe its just me but colouring in odd colours <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
ouch cherry
but when i asked if i could do it normally she was like 'its abstract art !!!'
yeah
mostly it was just getting told to draw something and then colour it in mismatching colours/do something to it 
and i've never liked that, it looks wrong, i like things to be the way they should be
mine is mostly school
not fun ??/
my experience with abstract art is
i've heard your voice so if you want equal exchange i can send recording <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
oh it is
is internet working
abstract art is boring
that is incorrect
my voice sounds a bit <:concern:966623298639261746> <:concern:966623298639261746> eeehhee
i'll watch <:kannawaow:963350507655688212> <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
pretty voice
i think
sounds great
sounds
i didn't even know which game was being played but i was curious about your voice <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
oh
i think it's the alphabet one
i could tell what you were saying
no it's good
it is gentle on my ears at least, i like it
smooth..?
so
it's so
i did
bye bye, good luck!
hello citrine
hi aoi !!
hi keilo <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
helo
i have like 6k crystals <:holothink:963352118855626753> should i spend them on something
and now i cant get back!! <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
fell through the floor
i was in sakura samsara and just
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
it is
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
ta dah!
i was wondering why your eden had only M and B
i play on sea, i'm level 60 something there <:chickHappy:981170092240928819> so that is why my na account is very neglected
this
why would you pay for
cant believe they offer this
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819> yes, level 17 aster who has not yet cleared chapter 2
honkai
do i just put edison on eden <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912> beginner account
oh no <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324> what am i supposed to do with this
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
eggs are inside the centre of flower
flower attracts pollinator
for reproduction
flowers are
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
oh i dont like it much <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> i hope if you ever have it you enjoy it
i had pho today <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
enjoy your food <:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
woaah
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
helo!! <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
is just scary
friend
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
thats so weird to ascertain too.. i cant just ask 'can i call you a friend' <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> if they do consider me a friend they might be offended that i had to ask and if they're not then they'll think i'm weird for thinking we were anything more than acquaintances
i guess i also worry if i call someone a friend do they feel the same
is a very broad term
friendship
i feel like interacting with people is very hard because everyone is different
a reply that works for someone will not work for someone else
i can't anticipate i can't think fast enough <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
ouch <:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294>
keeping friends is very hard <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i think that
D:
the more i care about someone the harder it is <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> i dont want to accidentally screw up and they go away
that makes sense
but i dont know ive never done it so maybe its not that hard
every interaction would be <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> so much consideration that goes into every word
like
how people survive
yeah i know <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> i just wonder
emotionally demanding
i just find it a bit too
everyone around me is dating and stuff like <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
i like rice and soy sauce yk it doesnt sound that bad
i wonder what cooked cherries tastes like
think i'll be alone forever pretty much  <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> live alone eat rice and soy sauce i guess
or like
what if you cant arrange a place to stay in the new location
no permanent place to stay or call home and
it'd be stressful
money is the main one and then also like
but money!!
i like travelling and places are cool
i dont want to live paycheck by paycheck and spend money on things i dont neeed like travelling
i dont want to travel it is expensive
i can always hope
but
i'm way too little
but
idk where because idk who
i want to visit an online friend
um
oddly coloured
well it wasnt that big it was just
maybe
my finger is too long
oh wait
like the length of my index finger
it wasnt that big
it was just crawling on my laptop case
i found a cockroach today
<:fuckingwhy:963697607690055711>
i hate them
ew
no for some reason this year has just been raining a lot
pls no more
its been raining like all year
is cute
aww
rain is ok
woah
me too <:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
its happy!!
look how cute it is
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
oh
i wanna ban the existence of fireworks
doesnt make sense
it just
i dont think it's possible that i'd become a ghost once i'm dead anyway
but i dont know where they are in the first place <:holothink:963352118855626753> <:holothink:963352118855626753>
if im a ghost tho how will i access my phone and ask for everyone's addresses
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202> <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
spend a few years walking across the ocean so i can reach random countries
i want to be a ghost so i can finally go visit everyone
thats a bit ambitious heh
hm
but no firework, because i don't want anyone to feel the same way i do when i hear them
i think when i die i want to be burned and sprinkled somewhere
thank you aoi
this sounds accurate <:kleepray:963350716901113876>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
what herrscher should cherry be
im crying <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> slightly
no i didnt mean that as an answer
wait
crying
no, but like you said i can remember the small things
everyone i've left behind and everyone that left me behind
and i remember
sometimes i log onto my other discord accounts
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
if i die i want someone to get me xiao on my genshin account
think i have to start thinking of that too
hm
i can get a job in july <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
assuming you didnt already spend all the money on the honkai account <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
sorry i dont handle things like this well,, 
when people say they'll remember me they never do
ASSUMING IM DEAD
i dont think i was memorable when i was alive
i dont know
fun
i want to just die and everyone just forgets about me
for myself
me
hm
i dont want funeral
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> hi cherry
i need to concentrate in class too but i cant because no one shuts up and they keep breathing so loudly
cant do in class tho
noise sensitivity
i just aggressively bite my nails so that i dont say anything
i wish i didnt get so annoyed at noise though <:cryge:966624721611403294>
so like <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
and my earphones are broken
but also i dont have headphones
than the outside
aggressive
it would be better because i like that and it's less
i think
like if i used it to put on genshin music
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
aster is yellow and cant fly !! <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
magic <:fishwow:963697747473604638>
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
it stopped
yeah D: i'm not diagnosed w anything but i hate noises
fire is ok as long as it doesnt fly in the sky and go boom !! i dont know why it wants to do that !!!
i have to hold my breath every time i walk past someone cause i can smell them and wkjsjdh
i'm childish i know <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> i'm just really bad at handling noise light and smells at the same time
but you're nice and you're not a firework
and when we go to see them i can smell the smoke and gkgjhgjfjdb
they're too loud and bright
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
do you like fireworks
i hate fireworks <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i can hear fireworks
and also my parents would <:concern:966623298639261746>

<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
..really weird <:concern:966623298639261746>
there's nice ones, but there are also really weird results
think i'll try find the filter
i looked a bit but the results were <:concern:966623298639261746>

you download the files and go into control panel and change the cursor
oh yeah i found like keqing mouse cursors once
woahh
i'm really dumb with this kind of stuff i just click all the buttons and find things
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
i can change the mouse pointer colour
i am not that dumb with technology i think <:Terichew:973794176015675392>
i got a new laptop so i am playing around with it now
i do not look around settings that often, i didn't know waah
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
i found out that you can change the background of the touch keyboard
never mind i don't think i ever want to go back there again
i'll look on pixiv, thank you!

<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
sw doodle finished
personal space you know

i think i am not good at this
a mess of symbols
like
that looks
a nose?
that's
but whats the difference when you add ^
i dont like smiling with my mouth open sometimes i have to :) 🙁
what if i want to closed mouth smile
its just smiley
it
i like :D
is that what people thought every time i sent it to them
but i use it for smiley
oh
🙂 is happy

okay it's just me then i think
rather than staring

i think teri stare
i don't want to make anyone upset by my words or anything either
sound a bit creepy
the words just
hello there cherry <:PepeSmile:966629532943650836>
woah when you say it like that it sounds scary aoi
i like cherry

yes ! i'm still pulling, because i really like her
i just want sw but i dont know running around with 0/4 sw also isnt ideal <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
a lot of things for me are skill and/or gear issue <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154> running around with 0/4 SpA 1/4 felis
you doing well sora <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> i can't clear it at all

can i do that on mobile ?
my subtitles still arent working on cutscenes <:cryge:966624721611403294>  ive installed all the files <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324> but sakura samsara cutscenes have subtitles <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>

i think that taking codashop payments for art isn't much different to just taking paypal for art comms 
you still use paypal to pay anyway 
and if the prices are equivalent then <:TeriStare:973793234096648202> i don't think there is an issue
i cant use money to buy it ok need to find some other way
give me that
don;t
i know about it because i've tried <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
imagine if you typed in uid wrong <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
i'm in art community more so i guess i would've seen it more but yeah i think it works too you just use paypal and codashop, then type in the uid
that's been around for a while actually because of codashop
oh yeah
that's so cool
thank you !!
it worked <:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
wait
woah
but its cute
i have no nitro <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>

they got turbo salty and made their own server called room 8 secret society (r8ss) and are being toxic  asf to like everyone  and keep whaling just to push people out of tiers 
they don't tier because they like the event and such they tier to boat people out of tiers they want
basically these guys got banned from a server for tiering so long they jeopardised their health

<:FelisOk:1047083219587182682> they. were meant to be gifts for you but i couldn't finish them
seele,,,, 

i also. ping <@416445660443967491> <:ah:1005467958077825034>
i know there are 284031 mistakes and i dont intend to fix them but. 
yippee i gues the ony thing i can bring myself to work on because it has an unfortunate due date
headache   is being had rn
omg i just remembered this one too
little art dump of doodles for friends
www
yea i stole it off  a real card thats why hehehahah
i actually really like this for some reason
hand and pose is way off but i already lineart wtv
hmm
instead of the image
sometimes i like block out a reference in shapes and then trace over the shapes
shapes
at least write luna maybe <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
dont put luna's discord tag without permission but yea
description
in the
just credit
oh
just don't judge your art's value by the amount of likes it gets because then it gets worse <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
i see some toddler looking artwork someone made in 5 seconds in fanart tags smetimes its fine no one will judge <:YukinaShrug:585567198995677204>
yeah, it just takes time and practice !! you will. feel envious and it will be hard but just keep pushing through <:Emu_Ganba:977806900219502632> art is meant to be something you enjoy, not a competition
tracing as long as you dont claim as your own is good for educational purpose <a:menheraNod:809322720319504384>
<a:menheraNod:809322720319504384> luna help with hand, sorry i am not good 
but the microphone, the way you have so much of the circle visible should not be like that i think
uhhh
i feel like that much of the bottom of the mic shouldnt be visible
the mic is a bit off at the bottom
better
<:kleeHeart:997543436456558623>
you can always clean extra lines later <:airidevious:1066185090956279858>
that way the object is less wonky and you can wrap the fingers around it more accurately
beofre you draw the hand
draw the object first
also fenri a thing when drawing hands
fingers dont look like that at that angle
a curve
just
fingers still shouldnt be
OH OK yea i see it
is how i's do it
there's jsut some random line that shouldnt be there
also the mic looks fine
let me redraw
the two fingers in the middle shouldn't be like that
no i think the hand looks awkward still
uhhh
she's silly. i will redraw tomorrow. but kana swim
interesting
oh.. <:kohanesweat:1021284779947208724>
huh <:HUH:1000019114863104041>
but my friend gave me an account and it has df2 aya and some random yukina 4* <a:HinaDrunk:738486827077468160> <:AyaLove:693996095994331176> yay
<:RinUuu:983868712388014160> i'm kinda sad i lost my rinko card account
<:kohanesweat:1021284779947208724> but i wanna learn how to do properly so i go bandori and suffer
you can go in and out and there's uh the. the. tile splash so you can slap your fingers down and zzz through holds
sekai sliders are super lenient <:kohaneworried:1021291944116224080>
do it <a:HinaDrunk:738486827077468160>
i don't mind <:kohaneworried:1021291944116224080> i can't fc shit because i can't jank my finger fast enough but i'll learn and then i can do the silly holds on sekai too
bandori slider behaviour is just different <:SayoStudy:967318915715846196>
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
<:kanacasual:1054948855604580362> bandori is a lot harder than sekai that's why i play
<:AyaHands:827884274031525898>
<:kohaneworried:1021291944116224080>
bandori sliders <:HinaCry:585710293678686218>
<:RinUuu:983868712388014160> <:RinUuu:983868712388014160> <:RinUuu:983868712388014160>
citrine plays too i think <:kohanesweat:1021284779947208724> but that means only 4 people not enough for a room
<:GanbAya:644427112522186782> one day we all play bandori
i never listen to any of these <:kohaneworried:1021291944116224080> <:kohaneworried:1021291944116224080> <:kohaneworried:1021291944116224080>

you don't need to know theory

<:HMM:966625453194485760>
the lines as black are very harsh on the little habitat thing and takes the eye away from the slime itself
i think maybe make the lines on the habitat thing dark grey will make it easier to look at maybe ? <:notlikekeq:977817672035205180> dont know, is just that the background is very prominent
can i provide feedback <:A_HuTaoSurprised:803337711792029786>

the pattern looks ok from afar but when you zoom in you can see what i actually did to make it look like that <:huh:966619839307321394>
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212> ohh it looks cute
waow <:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
ohh,, anatomy is hard.. <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> maybe watch tutorial videos, look at photo reference too, and 3d model, designdoll or csp itself provides model
what areas specifically do you think you want to try to do better
do you like your current art
what are your goals for art style
sora maybe
or maybe they just cannot find issue
oh no D: um, i usually reach out to artist friends since i used to be in art community a lot.. other than that dont really know
thank you sora !! i will do research next time
OH AAA i forgot to use reference <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
eden looks scary and i forgot to colour her eyes properly
some doodles from school. i don't like them that much <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>

art choices are hard mine changes all the time

making stickers yay
Okay buddy
8ball are you excited for your new gifs arcy
hehe yay!! <:lukascrunkle:1120635631173898240> glad i can help
i think that one is catpls
so for example ` `
after the .gif add ?size=48&quality=lossless
you can change size to whatever you want but idk what the other ones for quality are
okay !! <:lukascrunkle:1120635631173898240> it's easy
if it doesn't work with arcy i can find another way
i just did a bit of thinking  and found out when i type in  emoji id].gif and then add parameter? qualities? like size then it will not only send emoji as gif but also display it differently depending on what you specify
im not  sure
umm
it displays like that because of the link
oh do you have to save it
okay
lemme try again
i broke it
hmm
<:peepoBlush:889033560147759154> okay
whatever emotes you want i think i can make them display small for arcy
keilo i figure out the gifs
AH
hehe okay
8ball are we frenn arcy
i need to go do some testing but i might be able to get the gifs workin
<:depresso:1159828653413249086>
i'll try
i don't think i can send them through my phone though, it gets turbo mad when i try to send anything transparent
hmm
i can do it
you  can scale the gif down
THATS SO CUTE
AH
arcy learns imagery
:(
<:MinoriBeg:1157601970622844939>
yeah not allowed
<:Life:1158522666945355826>
not sure about everyone else though
performing for mother i see
8ball do you really want to die arcy
:(
or maybe its that you know of her but you dont knwo her
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
damn
<:minoripog:1161398197919416400>
8ball would cherry die if shot in the face
huh it does rejnd me of this book tho where the main characters' parents were thinking of getting married
but like they already adored each other and were at the point of like one is dead but not quite and the other is wearing the dead one's heart around hsi neck so if the parents did get married and then they became siblings thatwould be kinda sad i guess because then yeah that would just be weird
<:AmanaPain:984830912124563506>
HWAT
oh <:MonkaS:383408020492910592>
how is he spending that much on honkai when unemployed
<:MonkaS:383408020492910592>

im a bit out of loop, who is aqua
aww <:MinoriBeg:1157601970622844939>
arcy is probabl just a bit confused about her pronouns
<:lukascrunkle:1120635631173898240>
what is arcy implying
<:lukascrunkle:1120635631173898240> ah my animal crossing museum got built today
maybe heki would ask to determine if she wants to stay away or not
friends!!!
ok..
:(
8ball can you give me your paw?
she doesn't like cherry
<:lukascrunkle:1120635631173898240> okk wah i do wanna help out cause i cant really do anything in other areas
arcy said  so <:lukascrunkle:1120635631173898240>
:( now we all know who it was
?! arcy knows bad words
<:lukascrunkle:1120635631173898240> if you need help with making visual things like pfp i can

and he's always yapping about some random country and you gotta guess where it is
he's this bird that occasionally washes up on my beach
i think gulliver smokes my weeds
i cant even trade because no one plays acnl anymore everyone moved onto acnh long ago <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>

HELP
my breakfast kinda broken i didnt do anything to it
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
i play jp games and lurk in tet's channel thats like the only other language exposure i get
i don't know what i'd use
<:Kohane_dazed:1136051766937526352> yea
im too small <:peepoblanket:1026059855414431814>
i gotta get out of bed but i dont wanna its cold
i want to learn a different language but im not sure what to learn + how to stay  committed <:Kohane_dazed:1136051766937526352>
i still do spelling tests every two weeks
<:sendhelp:1148001940190543942>
<:minorihuh:1161398220979712071>
but i only speak english so <:Kohane_dazed:1136051766937526352> easier for me to spell things
i dont really struggle with spellig <a:dankClap:889014580343353404> unless its something stupid like antediluvian
oh i remember encyclopaedia
my english teachers have always tried to force spelling rules on me but whats the point <:Kohane_dazed:1136051766937526352> every single rule theyre always like Oh but theres this exception so you may as well just remember how the word is spelt instead of remembering a rule thats wrong half the time
i dont rememver any of the words but i remember him telling me a lot of stories and stuffs because we finished so quickly<:Sakiaaaaa:1082540798492549142>
<:peepoBlush:889033560147759154>
yes
yea the whole class does it but only we (the kid and i)  had advanced spelling test away from the rest of them <:TopazSkrunkly_TZM:1152926761387053166>
<:Kohane_dazed:1136051766937526352> when i was 12 i liked this kid in my class bfbdhdjd we did  spelling together and played with bubbles and little alchemy
lets have the colouring corner in my room <:EmuKiraKira:1162811244366024724> we can  get uh anime girl colouring pages

<:enasweat:963965474746531881>  is it normal for someone to see you a lot (i have no classes with them im not even in the same grade) and notice your haircut and continually wave at you despite the fact you have never waved back <:DankReading:1118364427767525518> i found this moderately creepy

sumeru is so many quests, dont like them <a:SakiFall:1105562318445740053> just wanna explore first do quest later
enka is so good <a:LukaNesoDance:1094101394849550437> <a:LukaNesoDance:1094101394849550437>
inazuma is pretty but being attacked every five seconds gets on my nerves
but i didnt wait for desert release so idk if thats any better
<a:damgom_cry:1123037411123925003> i didnt like characters..  and am very big on exploration but it just felt like mondstadt with slight changes
very soon after sumeru release cause  i hated it
like
yea i uninstalled
<:damgom_plop:1123050479086211215> i havent done anything in sumeru yet
as much as i wanna explore (i'm still missing like 5% in chasm underground <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> )   the primo income is liek. 2 every 30 mins
<a:damgom_cry:1123037411123925003> i  want  kazuha but my 15 pity 50/50 not looking too great

ohh <:Terichew:973794176015675392> but i have seen old people do fancy proposal type of stuff so maybe there is a fancy event ball thing
big event like a prom and such they'd definitely tell us to get out of the area
scrtaches  head...  it's loke 
they don't explicitly announce it bit sometimes they're like oh we're setting up x event be careful of this that or they'll be like x event is happening please be mindful blalabal
i think the only thing we have is like
no rhere is no prom so there is bo announcement
wtf!!!
noo  they don't at all, they announce that stuff for like everyone in the school
we don't  have balls or prom or uh  anything

level 30
i have  found
oho
what's the hardest level
does it go higher than 28
WHY IS THERE NO RETRY BUTTON
i came from sekai and bandori tho
i can't play slow, cannot tap the notes
the only way i can fc in this game is to memorise the location of every flick note <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
bro
but i might increase
i didnt know what to set it so i just default to 10.0
were flicks

BABAN
Honkai is so bifurcated it feels weird for a gacha game. I guess it's designed that way so they can powercreep stuff without locking people out of story chapters.
no i think they mean the game itself
<a:IT_IS_BOUNCE:995917760955682996>
honkai is bifurcated says random maincord member
oh
what is bifurcated
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
i think i recognise yukari sleep from prsk maincord

shut up
basically artists are being warned to find a different platform for their art in case discord decides to eat it for their ai
they deleted it ? <:thonk:1052226584779694161>
oh shit what
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
oh
wait  there's another thread i send
they edited the part of tos where it says they won't record voice calls, streams etc and also like images and messages sent on discord
i think keilo is comparing discord to a government because now they're tracking and able to take any content put onto discord (presumably for their ai project)

during the news stream for sekai two days ago, after the cool stream there's a more chill qna section with  an important guy named kondo.  i forgot what he does i just know he's important and he's named kondo 

sekai leeks are rampant nowadays they're everywhere they even appeared on kondo  twitter timeline  
so when a question in the qna was  about leeks guess what colopale's  choice of action was to stop the leeks  <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
that's nice ruby <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

miku game is pretty good

<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like what is bro doing   why would you admit to committing an actual crime than using a bot in a miku game
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
to keep the bot running
but admitted to embezzling a shit ton of money
did not admit to using a bot in sekai
after the event
the botter
additionally
pory was  literally tiering faster thn an automated program isnt that scary <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
and he was in t2 <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>  and it was insane because pory, the t1, somehow managed to keep above a bot
to tier
like this guy using a bot
there was a bot
the nene rui luka event
so during mermaids
a funny story
i have
wait
or random people come out of nowhere to snipe <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but sometimes yk people change minds and get into fights
usually like t10 is all in agreement
depends
sometimes
yeaaaa  kinda
insane
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but meiya was the highest t1 ever excluding hermit
no
melodies t1 meiya
en
thanks you too
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
baban you can't afford to take breaks if you want t1
im not kidding  its true <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> they just microslept in between envies
hi heki
hello <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i said earlier  a t1 got 3 hours of sleep over a whole event period
can't do shit without stamina you get like no event points
yes
yes
yea and you also have to spend the whole week doing nothing but sekai
and minori
i love momojan
MINORI
BULLY
DO  NOT
yeah  you can f2p t100 if you plan
if you're tiering niigo wandasho vivibad it's gonna be a lot higher
mmj is usually dead
3k per event (event changes every week or so) and that's for mmj event
maybe i need to train to get less sleep so i can spend more time tiering <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
an event is over a week long <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
the t1 of the event i tiered had 3 hours of sleep over the whole event <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> a t1 for an event  did a 70 hour dash <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> scary
or that's t1 so <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> makes sense <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> did you know to get on sekai leaderboards it's like 3k usd for a non competitive event on en server which is arguably the most dead server of all sekai servers
my friend  is going for 24 hours rn <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> what is bro doing
whenever i take sekai breaks its because my brain is tired, not my hands
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
sekai my first rhythm game  so idk
i played for 4 hours straight yesterday

YAYYY LUNA ART
this one good
my concern is   the hideous pink  like.  if you were gonnado that PLEASE choose anything other than that shade
i'm done w genshin <:bejj:1067071810853679194> permanently 
i could come back for shenhe rerun and i want to 
but i just don't see the point, i tried for yelan  and it just drives me insane how i can't feel what i used to  

<:bejj:1067071810853679194> it's fine. i'll do my fanart if i feel like it but other than that i think i'm content
no but.  first 
the shade of pink is so  highlighter there's so much more pink that's way better and pretty 
also  like why so much whitey pastel ⚰️ i think pink and black with some design edits susannah would look a lot better but rn like when you place her next to nilou. it's just so uncannily similar and doesn't look like she belongs in honkai at all when placed next to other designs
HELP
pls tell me the nilou recolour is a skin
which one is the skin and which one is the default /genq
i love her skin
yeah!!
hmm i see
i think you'd like jean lumi
jean is work brain too

yeah but i haven't spent any money
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
spent money on genshin
but have you
because i have 4 of her
i say i hate keqing

and pizza
and she likes romance novel
she works hard to take care of mondstadt
in what instance would jean have that expression too
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:cryge:966624721611403294> i stop playing honkai but it keeps haunting me i literally will never read fr the same ever again

sunlight eternally shone through crase cafe's windows, illuminating the young woman softly snoring in its warmth.

luka. a stern shadow bathed her in shade, and luka woke to see meiko's hand reaching for her. she received a sharp hit instead of the headpat she expected.

wake up, you. you know there's work to do around here. the older one stalked off, hiding her adoration behind a front of anger.

face peaceful as she drifted, luka always rested in that spot, pink hair draped over her like a blanket. kind blue eyes hidden behind eyelids, she was almost too cute to wake up.

almost. there were to be no slackers in this cafe.

fuee... luka whined, rubbing her eyes.  mei-chan is always so rough with meee...

don't be like that. meiko had returned to the counter, beginning to scrub the day's dishes. her tone softened. wipe the tables and i'll make you some coffee.

mei-chan coffee? luka perked up. bundling her hair into a ponytail, she immediately began searching for a cloth.

with an incentive, she would work hard. without... just a few more minutes of nap time.

after the dishes were glimmering and the tables shining, meiko finally served luka her promised treasure. 
tendrils of steam rising from the cup, the coffee was tantalisingly close. the aroma permeated the air, ever so inviting - she reached for it, desperate for her beloved beverage, like a little child reaching for candy.

here you go. good work today. meiko smiled gently, the results of her craft evident on luka's face as she sipped.

a playful smile darted across luka's face in turn. never failed by her dear friend's drinks, she hummed appreciatively.

mei-chan, thank you.
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>

far more regulated in australia
haven't seen her since
don't know
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
until she tried again
that was the end of it
she  got her stomach pumped and
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
she's my age
but  like i just  came home and i had 7 dms all saying  this person just took  an overdose  of drugs  and i was like <:huh:966619839307321394> what. the fuck
was not the most intelligent decision
lookign back
which
and  the time i called emergency services in australia for someone about to  die in america
i remember  on someone's birthday i was trying to  hard to get her to drink water instead of more alcohol
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> i mean it's not their fault.  i usually left once i knew they were fine on their own
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> sometimes i just want to go back  and see how everyone i cared for is doing now
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
cata gets it
everyone does
of course
how they're doing
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> i wonder
my  results were  fine  with whatever i did i can't remember now
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
i want  instant noodles
<:dejj:1067071941367824474> she's not coming  back
what do you say  in response to i miss her
i want her back
like
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
me too
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
theirs wasn't around anymore
every time someone said a your mom joke  they'd just  come back so upset  because
some random person came to me one day after their mother died  and i took  care of them for a few weeks
i just really hate your mom jokes
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> those jokes are not nice
i hope he doesn't find  out how old i actually am  because i think he thinks i'm older than him <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
just like my cooking
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
to be able to drive
seem that old
do i
<:Terichew:973794176015675392> i just said no but like
and  i was just <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>  how do i answer this without doxxing myself or  making conversation awkward
do you drive
but then we got into  arcade talk and he asked me
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> anyway. the genshin player turned out to be more intelligent than initially assumed
miku only 
should've been emukasa/emurui
had to stop listening in first 5 seconds
STOP
and  he kept mentioning like genshin equivalents so i thought he was a dumbass who couldn't look outside of  his game  and realise sekai is a completely different  game
there was this new sekai player who played genshin
ok let me show you it's  kinda likereally good for some reason <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
why don't i get paid in discord nitro for putting up with the 12 year old  idiots in sekai help
damn what
leoni luka and miku are composed  and  not annoying that's why i like the mikuluka niccori the most
did you see the envy gangnam style
HELP??<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
they're not the biggest  most energetic  like SOME PEOPLE in wxs but they're  happy <:TeriStare:973793234096648202> it reminds me of like if leoni miku and luka had to try do mmj  dances they're still trying their best but they don't have the same explosion energy
they're obviously  enthusiastic they don't sound like they're about to jump off a cliff
<:FelisGun:1047083413934460970>
THEY DON' TSOUND LIKE THAT
they're not sad
i am not talking to you baban
what the hell <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
niccoricoricori anda
the lyrics
please listen to mikuluka coriander
it looks yummy and i don't like mushrooms <:peepojama:1065041007911108668>
<:Terichew:973794176015675392> nom

heki  can  you please. ask epi to unblock me  
just for a bit
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
he was banned because  we were  exchanging insults and fenri decided to ban him
he did he did come back <:cryge:966624721611403294>   but  he left after

<:FelisGrass:1047083038179344454>
no  but i feel immeasurable guilt knowing fenri banned him because he was arguing with me and i didn't catch him before he left  and he blocked me so i can't apologise
<:cryge:966624721611403294> <:sajj:1067071714518892584>
fenri banned him. he rejoined but left a few minutes later

but yeah that sucks
or whatever her name was
<:25ji_mafuyu:1038553217144995962> that banner was free spark i got mareeta i think
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
at 39/40
i was almost at spark so i just grind a few more pulls for ninian but then i got ninian
<:KasumiBigBrain:670321645998571542> i was pulling for ishtar and i had to go until ~35 for her
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432> <:PikaXD:966624196564242432> <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
i spilled water on it so its in the bin now <:Sadge:790930438733955092>
im sad i think my rita sketchpage is gone but i did find this
but i'm saving for sushang now :(
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
i am
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
actually i was. always farming her but then i felt guilty after a conversation in blustorm so i split it half raven half rita
<:fakyuu:1001390330383454260> they go cry about it i love rita so pretty
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777>
ahh now i can invest all my expeditions into umbral rose
i'm not really super enthusiastic about anyone in particular so i dont care <:25ji_mafuyu:1038553217144995962>
my first sss
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
i'm sad wtf is this
<a:menheraRun:801840729428852777> htr i pray
bonya pls <:25ji_mafuyu:1038553217144995962>
i have enough !!
o i lied im more poor than i thought
i need 50 more crystal to do another multi on htr
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
it gives me 2 every ten pull i do on regular gacha <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062> i think
it gives you  pulls for free (kinda) (you have to spend crystals elsewhere to get them)
there's this returnee pe supply <:Haruka4koma:984871345806512208>
how to get luck
<:bellahuh:959706370737836053>
<:kohaneworried:1021291944116224080>
i read rhat as full combo
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
i still dont get it... so in ch3 they did somethinf to wendy?? and then mei bonya wendy got poofed?? and then they break in to save them?? and then what
i think in earlier chapter they should explain more <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
its all just himeko whack and theresa in the ship going i wilk help you!?!!!!! and you get a magic button to delete the enemies <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
so far story i did is kinda boring
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
cool
so
is
htr ult
i just got my friend to do it for me somehow she do it first try on every one <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122>
past ch3 i dont even understand what happened <:AyaHands:827884274031525898> <:AyaHands:827884274031525898> <:AyaHands:827884274031525898>
im up to here but like
<a:KanonNeso:722886590560600075> going to do story
<:hinaLUL:710980546179629157> i forgot password nvm
<a:KanonNeso:722886590560600075> i'll log on and see if my sensei died yet
i only just came back i have so much to do on majn
ye
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
oh no i forgot i had a sensei on that account
i'll have to see idk
oh hm
really <:Miku_Yay:974636835273855016>
actually i still only ahve 3/4 <:Sadge:790930438733955092> rerun when
<a:KanonNeso:722886590560600075> it was my SW alt hehehaha
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062> that's what i said about ER but ended up skipping on both so um
i will have to replay story then that's good
only samsara had subtitles
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
even worse
and none of my cutscenes had subtitles
i feel like nothing is explained <a:SakiFall:980271452899131522>
oh
and then had to fight hua at the end also idk why it just happened <a:SakiFall:980271452899131522>
with cecilia
was in this facility
kiana somehow for whateve r reason
oh i remember a part where
<a:SakiFall:980271452899131522> icic
<:KasumiNaruhodo:587995477916516362>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
i feel like there was big gaps because i didnt get it i remember hua breaking into somewhere and rita was like hi and then i had to do stages with himeko which was so boring
honestly i remmeber being very confused
and idr the rest
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
and she was like nooo!!!! and had to fight people
then kiana started having <:evil:1049317760984940574> dreams
then himeko was shamed for being an alcoholic i think <:hinaLUL:710980546179629157>
kiana went to school and hua tried to teach her <:ArisaConcern:929615349761069138> thennnnnn
i dont really remember what happened tho
i should do more
<a:KanonNeso:722886590560600075> im still on like chapter ~10 in honkai story
<:HUH:1000019114863104041>

path to acheron <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
once upon a time, in arc city land, there was a small group of dinosaurs. there was also a little area, near the coast with a sign saying 'keiloraptor's malders'!

many dinosaurs came here to play honkisaur, a very baldy game. keyboards were hit and devices were thrown but for some reason everyone kept playing.

keiloraptor often brought new friends from blustorm land. the beach looked very inviting like a holiday but in fact it was only the backdrop for crit balding and suffering.

this time, coffeesaur came to arc city land! they were very serious. coffeesaur seemed very wise !! everyone said hello to coffeesaur and sometimes they had discussions.

every now and then coffeesaur came to visit arc city land <:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488> and everyone lived happily ever after
I wrote a story for zei so I will write one for you too

<:HUH:988073500730359908>
<:hc_bunnypeek:916548821360713759> i put eli as most influential for me 
because eli wrote me a list of things and while doing those things i learnt a lot about the game and how things work <:QiqiPeek:781028042708746260>
even tho i usually play honkai instead <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i'm still trying to pull for xiao
ohh
congratulations on ayato <:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
i guess venti but venti is way slower and longer cd
see i missed kazuha too
ohh
how am i supposed to go up anywhere <:cryge:966624721611403294>
ive been using jean dps lately instead but when i do exploration i cant not use keqing
still really good <:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
no wonder why she did no damage i'm still hitting 10k <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
i never really farmed artifacts for her
woah
it's okay, i have an ayaka on asia <:kleepray:963350716901113876>
i still don't know how to climb cliffs without her
i liked her skill
i never built her phys because
ohh
~~this would have been me if ayaka actually came home~~
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202> well it seems we agree then, i don't think she deserves lots of praise and love either 

i just don't think that she should be hated on excessively because often i see that, and although she isn't very good she still gets the job done 

but i guess i'd be biased since she was my dps for a long time
oh
i don't think keqing deserves heaps of hate but she's not the best dps and that's ok :hutaonote:
am a keqing main and i agree
i finish my commissions for now
okay
rest well arcy <:LukaYawn:856435446555607050>

<a:l_catsleepy:1018594908937924801>
at least qiqi is cute <:RinUuu:983868712388014160>
or himeko
<:RinUuu:983868712388014160>
i should be grateful it wasn't welt or gepard
or bonya
couldn't it have been clara
i know it's my fault but it still hurts
<:yaesit:1138376672182292540>
just need to finish the event
should get topaz today
e3 guin <a:cheerr:1137708075533479936>
too cute
hehehe me too
<:peepoComfy:786224780071796737> i found this cute one though
same with <:luka_melt:1137200808006516846> and <a:RitaPlaying:855055001457918025>
the ratio of normal topaz artwork to exaggerated/emphasised topaz artwork is <:peepoleave:955441001336557598>
i feel like i always choose the worst characters to like in terms of  fanart
this game means so much to me
but  this song still tugs my  heart jfkdjkfhkljf lf
a while since i stopped playing genshin
its been
i'm
worked a bit on abigail hair
ok
numby and pompom they/thems <:peepoBlush:889033560147759154> slay
her voice here was so  cute fhsknfbf
yeah exactly !
even though her solution is cold she's at least not just giving the planet away to the ipc and letting them squash it
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
we're only attached because we had a whole story with belobog
i mean i dont think its right what the ipc are doing because they will ruin belobog <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246> but topaz is also right in that she cant just let go of every special case
and i guess she's right in that people kinda have to pay for their ancestors' mistakes (like our ruining of the environment
but its not like she can just write off all the debt
because like i dont think topaz really wants to hurt belobog
hmm
okay its
huh
numby is so so adorable
I'll take screnshots on good frames some day
NUMBY
my face rn too
WHAT
penacony used to be a prison planet..   such original naming
she gives me kafka tone energy
than i expected
higher
<a:sissypuffsspeen:1167303234575147060> also jingliu's voice is a lot
i got a tingyun from my standard pulls after <:mewhensherliam:1057523364127842367>
the yukong tingyun thing was so bittersweet
AHH i finished
so i can get to the topaz quest event thing
i have such bad genshin habits i keep calling it an archon quest but i need to finish the hsr equivalent
shes so cute

<:cryge:966624721611403294>
topaz
<:TopazSkrunkly_TZM:1152926761387053166>
i jus dont wanna talk to them when they're like that
ishouldnt let it get to me but i hate it when my friends are haters of  characters i really really like
<:pissbabycry:1134215120558497792> sigh
tbh  i dont have anything  to say except get good  (ie practise) because theres nothjng else to do
i guess you can try adjusing speed, and also dont play the same song for too long but in the  end skill issue is always the limit <:cryge:966624721611403294>
i have phony mas fc <:mizukipeace:1130250827731324939>
im sorry but that song is staying vs ver forever for me
oh yeah otome kaibou cover  is just  ass in general
think its bc mafuyu has her nice girl voice and her actual self voice
phony was mafuyu's slay imo
wah <:Kohane_dazed:1136051766937526352>
i don't want to ask stupid questions but i do it anyway
i know i should be able to figure it out myself
like
i feel so bad asking so many hsr questions
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
stupid
like
i feel so
blehh
yeh
<:An_shy:1141182561968726107> wah,, it was 4 days ago yeah,,
luka eeping on meiko's lap
meiluka so canon..
i always fc stuff and never take ss.. i took ss of this one at least <a:dankClap:889014580343353404> mas 31 wahaha
WOOO
oh i still need a cute mmj 4* to replace sbib
still working on increasing talent and i'm gonna mastery rank 1 all of them
<a:dankClap:889014580343353404> i prepared team
hopefully i can get over top 100
<:TopazAmazed_TZM:1142400922731954256> i'm tiering again in april
valentines event
was on korean server
im walking thetr knao
the talent loss from shiho/akito/mizuki doesnt make up for the bonus lost by kada
building beforehand doenst matter
put
just out him in
it says at the bottom
yeah
my highest is t54 <:TopazSkrunkly_TZM:1152926761387053166>
tldr 12% bonus = 10k talent
i have to go to class but i'll explain  teambuilding later
shiho akito mizuki arent event characters
well you have low bonus bc
<:TopazSkrunkly_TZM:1152926761387053166> i dont slack my evebts because you can get more crystal from event shop, new cards from event shop (gives crystal from character rank and side story), cover voucher and stamp voucher (gives crystal from character rank) and also if you rank high in the event like you can get top 5000 with only natural energy, no refilling, you can get an extra 1k crystal every event
thats how  it is when beginner
its not ideal but i need luka leader
its team with high event bonus <:Emu4koma:984871343415771166> like mine is
oh
do you guys not have event team<:TopazSkrunkly_TZM:1152926761387053166>

pls
costume
i love pscorers but
<:Cryge:862486122038558740> you should see some of the other pscorers its such a shame
SO PRETTYYY
no costume = it has special skill, called pscore  or perfect scorer 
it gives you 110% on perfect notes which is very stonks 
now theyve started giving pscorers costumes but before they didnt so thats why
oh im so jealous i want that one
but aibi cute
they are best friends

rememebr not to interrupt download while its clearing cache or else your game might break <a:yay:968050872590426122>
will take a lot of download time but your storage will survive
and clear cache again
why dont you do like half of the stories, clear cache and then do the rest
yeah that sucks
waaa
extra 20% from meiko and miku
i guess if i invest a chord or two
not really sure what else i can do to improve

<:enasad:1082589982377656320> i don't know..  i guess it's just that it's not like we don't have common interests but it feels weird talking to them about stuff because even tho we both like sekai and genshin and  stuff especially with sekai it feels weird, like i'm on jp so when i want to talk about things sometimes they wont understand and i could just  explain but that slike having to explain your  own jokes all the time :(   and.  not meaning to  be condescending  or anythign   !!  but i am better skill wise and so when they  complain about things like disappearance being chosen in co-op and stuff like <:ayacry:1114950761743384627> i know its annoying to them but i think its way better than having to play some boring ass mas 27 so  with thing s like that i just  Can't get it  and i could just sympathise and move on but i dont really feel like pretending i feel the same and that i understand <:bcePoutSigh:994936975486365706> half the time i dont  get a respomnse anyway  so whatevr
yea but i  do Not tjink they like me
i  wish i could  talk more to them (that   group in general)
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
more
There  is only one thing it's gonna land on
if  someone chooses shoushitsu  and everyone  else pciked  recommended
   does mika not know  that the  point of recommended is  that the game will choose whatever the other players in your room recommend

ITS SO CUTE  but i dont htink i can add it anywhere
afaik theres no pity on normal gacha but special banner has guaranteed bday card within 110 pulls
also every week the special banner rotates, if it's someone's birthday it'll be that character and if not then it'll be randomised
and you can pull
you do trivia for crystals
its so cute its like sekai gacha but in a bot
chrom have you heard of the bot chukasa
<a:KekeYayCheer:1130305016054423583>
the minomizu interaction  (singular) was so adorable  😭 mizuki big fan of minori  ❤️
i didnt know people  shipped.  harumafu?  <:minori_huh:1130958278642376914>
minomizu honakana etc all have interaction
i think ichitoya is my only non-interaction   super cope ship
<:miayes:1090001198221889627> thats  valid!!!
sekai fandom moment
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
so kinda scared sharing my ichitoya in case i get attacked for  being weird when their notion of them being family is  literally  Their hc theyre not related
most people  like ichitoya platonic/cousins  (which doesnt really make sense to me but  ?? Ok)
<:kyuuchan_sad:762020425529556993>

DOTTORE  HELLO????

<:kyuuchan_cry:898748001265254411>
Waaaaaaaa
<:ayacry:1114950761743384627>
I ahould take my existing ocs and rewrite them
<a:damgom_cry:1123037411123925003>
Hmm
Frown.
ocs
name my
i need to
I hate this game
cry about how i still have 1.5k more fish to fish
fish
cry about friends who aren't there to co-op with me anymore
<:peepositfishing:1109291486102691840>
do comms 10 mins before daily reset
achievement mald
teapot
fishing
i will just go back to the chill life
the chance of me pulling a 5* before kazu banner end is the chances of crystal pulling miku rin len fes in the same 10 pull on his next reroll
and accept that i am not getting anything
i think i just need to stop coping
ok
uuuuuuwww  <:cryge:966624721611403294>
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
i guess

or if  i'm generously blessed with jean <:RinUuu:983868712388014160>
i'll take c4 keqing <:RinUuu:983868712388014160> or diluc <:RinUuu:983868712388014160> throws up
Again
i'll take a 50/50 loss
i wont even ask for kazuha
ok
i cnt stay up tonight
pleas
<:RinUuu:983868712388014160>
but
i guess i got venti early
ok well
why dont i ever get anything early
pleas
cant i have an early 5* just this once
<a:diesofcringe:972420698654003210>
silly and silly
<:LisaSparkle:585567203408085024> minoshizu dynamic is so cute
its always minoharu
<:BocchiDistraught:931659783554089031>
i wish there was more haruai
maybe that will give me some shred of will to live
i think i'll eat instant noodles today
nasty
<:BocchiDistraught:931659783554089031>
now i remember why i dont  talk in that server anymore
<a:punt_elgato:1123051019048337418>
now i'm 1% less toxic because i decided to stfu about my kanahona hate yea only 1%, the rest of your toxicity comes from shipping a wonderfully unhealthy ship <:lukaneso:1030210393953534023>
i'm going insane
this knmf fan
<:lukaneso:1030210393953534023>

<a:punt_elgato:1123051019048337418>
Ok honestly i wouldnt  take welt tho
i'd take gepard over her
but himeko is literally the only bad one <a:damgom_cry:1123037411123925003>
at least all of the genshin standards arent super amazing
<a:damgom_cry:1123037411123925003>
<:BocchiDistraught:931659783554089031>
<a:punt_elgato:1123051019048337418> but himeko actually just feels awful to play
but at least genshin is easy so i can cope that keqing is actually good
save 80 pulls -> keqing
that my gacha experience will devolve back into genshin
but im just scared
my hsr situation is really not that dire
<:BocchiDistraught:931659783554089031>
<a:BocchiRoll:1112458916434026587>
dont wanna draw

minori has asked mizuki to be mmj's costume designer for a mmj livestream (pink and cutesy themed for valentine's). help mizuki find information on what styles airi, shizuku and haruka like and choose the final dress designs at the end 
if you choose the dresses that look like dogshit mizuki will be a lil confused but go ahead and mmj livestream will still slay but minori will be a little doubtful of mizuki afterwards and it will absolutely break your heart 
if you choose the pretty ok dresses mizuki will agree after a bit of discussion and mmj livestream will slay and minori will be content 
if you choose the perfect dresses mmj livestream will go off the charts and minori gives mizuki a hug AND THE CROWD GOES WILD WOOOOOOO MINOMIZU

And as they drifted off to sleep, the scent of garlic and spices still lingering in the air, they knew that they would always be there for each other – in the kitchen and beyond.
Absolutely! Here's a version of the story with she/her pronouns for Kanade:

Honami and Kanade stood side by side in the kitchen, their arms brushing against each other as they chopped vegetables and prepared ingredients for their dinner.

Kanade was a terrible cook – she had burned everything from soup to rice – but Honami loved her regardless. She had always admired Kanade's gentleness and her kind-hearted nature, and she was determined to help her improve her culinary skills.

As they worked, Honami showed Kanade how to properly dice onions and garlic, how to season meat, and how to make a simple but delicious sauce. Kanade watched her with rapt attention, amazed at how skilled she was in the kitchen.

Despite her lack of cooking skills, Kanade was determined to contribute to the meal. She sliced vegetables and set the table, doing her best to assist Honami in any way she could.

When they finally sat down to eat, Honami and Kanade beamed with pride. The food tasted incredible – a perfect balance of flavors and textures – and they both knew that they had worked together to create something truly special.

As they cleared the table and washed the dishes, Honami thought about how lucky she was to have Kanade in her life. Even though she wasn't the best cook, Kanade was always willing to learn and to try her best. And Honami loved her for that.

Kanade, meanwhile, couldn't believe how lucky she was to have such a skilled and patient partner. She knew that she had a long way to go before she could call herself a great cook, but with Honami by her side, she felt like anything was possible.

As they curled up on the couch later that evening, Kanade took Honami's hand in hers. Thank you for teaching me how to cook, she said, looking into her eyes. I couldn't have done it without you.

Honami smiled and squeezed her hand. I love you, Kanade, she said, and I love cooking with you.

i guess
but no one ever vc we weren't that close  i think everyone was glad not to deal with each other LMAO
we got warned in advance for online school so our classmates made a discord
we didnt even have zoom/vc lol
just that i dont think they can cause i need supervision but they won't give one teacher to one student
i hope so
there wasnt actually anything like adapted
its hard to explain but basically the same program we use at in person class
our online program during pandemic was just
i dont think my school has online program tho

<:Bedge:990510746238611527> as long as my mother is behind it

unsure if they ever got caught for the embezzling
banned
t2 mermaids then proceeded to admit to embezzling thousands of euros instead of admitting they botted in a miku game
t1 mermaids still outpaced and got t1 despite a literal bot at their heels <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
t2 mermaids was a botter and colopale didn't even ban them until after the event despite documents and obvious evidence that they were botting
just that even bots can't beat stronk fillers

what was i gonna  say
mmm
even keilo likes sekaseka <:AiriSeka:1075576480295309384>
<:AiriSeka:1075576480295309384> sekaseka was ok
if they added it i think half the playerbase would've stormed sega
this is kinda bare minimum tho
but yeah
can't really be correct or not when it comes to wanting something <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
who wanted it
i know someone
yea i already saw the announcement on the jp website
<:AiriSeka:1075576480295309384>
and they were still gone
then i woke up
and
<:AiriSeka:1075576480295309384> i had   a dream that someone who disappeared cane back and added me on sekai and played a song with me
pretty hand
screamign

LET'S GOOOOO  VOCACOLLE END MAKEUP T14
<a:HinaDance:738486690716450937> ❤️❤️❤️
big bandori fan
so woggers
SO COOL
so if you have low battery it recommends you charge before playing to prevent loss of achievements
bandori has a battery warning
was that
i found
something REALLY COOL
<:BABA_IS_ANGUISH:936783191832924240> i will try
<:SakiPeek:995432432029417502> bye bye
i have to go school <:sakijii:1082496405815435355> sorry for all this chrom
<:sakihmm:997699589706612787> just admit you don't know
i feel like a lot of teachers just bullshit if they don't know
he knows what he's doing too <:sakihmm:997699589706612787> and if he doesn't then he just googles it <:kekhands:993361107878170655> not that hard
and if anyone is left behind then he talks to them individually after
because he just goes ahead
<:sakihmm:997699589706612787> i like my industrial graphics teacher
they don't want to learn
just cause
because i'm sick of being kept behind
i wish they would just take all the kids who won't learn and let them do whatever in their own classroom
i don't really get it
and kids who won't learn
now it's just teachers who can't teach
but i never hated going there
i don't really remember much
<:sakihmm:997699589706612787>
oh <:sakihmm:997699589706612787> brb
we all studied and quiet and did our work and it was fun
but back there it was just a class of the only kids who cared about schooling <:sakihmm:997699589706612787>
and no one gives a shit about education
loud
i don't like anyone here <:sakihmm:997699589706612787> i feel like it's just so
<:sakihmm:997699589706612787> i guess i just miss being little again
does not feel like home
something about  this place
i guess it is better to live here than in crowded city <:sakihmm:997699589706612787> but idk
maybe <:sakihmm:997699589706612787>
you don't understand what it's like outside of here (cough   yea erm.  they must've forgotten the ten years that existed before we moved)
you'll regret not having us if you choose to move away for work/education
but they did heavily imply it
they didn't say that explicitly
<:SakiPeek:995432432029417502> well
they want me to stay around where we live
i'll see
<:sakihmm:997699589706612787> there might be exchange program i can take but that's like really temporary
i think it's just like school  you go there go home
there is uni but like i don't think it's live there
just not optimistic about how realistic it is
<:Miku_Sorry:961432152279498772> yes. i hope one day
this is really true <:sakihmm:997699589706612787>
yeah
<a:MenheraCry:998735841671258192> <a:MenheraCry:998735841671258192> <a:MenheraCry:998735841671258192>
no <:sakihmm:997699589706612787>
i don't know
she just
i can't
wow  i love crying over  a fictional character's  mother
hate her
really
even tho i know all  this she just feels so much like my own parents i can't  bring myself to
but <:sakihmm:997699589706612787>
<:sakihmm:997699589706612787>
it's not like my family situation is picture perfect and i don't really understand the scope of what her mother is doing
<:sakihmm:997699589706612787>
it's not that i don't understand
<:sakihmm:997699589706612787>
but that's not her goal
it's definitely a product of her actions
yeah
i mean
<:sakihmm:997699589706612787>
she's not
but
THIS LOOKS SO GOOODDD
with kana3 cards
i figured out th eissue
ough
whatever
probably the only trained card disliker too
guess i'm the only one
<:HarukaThought:983609880445325327>
and then they're gone and you wonder if maybe you just had a bit more time
even if they're shit you still have that kind of attachment, the copium in the back of your mind that just maybe they'll get better
i feel straight up getting rid of her would break mafuyu more
everyone else seems willing to dump mafuyu's mother
why am i like this
hmm
and i'd.  prefer a parent who tries too hard than one who doesn't try enough
you have to get it right i suppose, you can try too hard or you can not try enough
i feel she just tried too hard
she does what she thinks is right for her child and even though it broke mafuyu
i wouldn't wish death on her <:HarukaThought:983609880445325327>
she's not punchable
maybe cause she feels the same as mine
i don't know why
i just don't dislike her
i guess
i kinda like mafuyu's mother
i have issues
man
my god
oh
unfortunately
kana 2*s
my
need a kana 4* so bad ive been cycling through my 3 hona 4*s and
i want kana untrained  so bad
oiuhjndmkjfhrj

thankfully  a friend found it  on bilibili  for me waa
i was  having one for miku version of donketsu and i couldn't find it on youtube and i was  jjust 🥹 even the happi playlist wasn't enough
i call it music cravings caus e i just.  really need the song

that  won't go away until you start listening to the exact song brain wats
get   this really  kinda anxious feeling
do you ever just
and i am jumping in pink jumpy castle
i found a silly game on roblox to do silly things
<:Emuhappy:983426854620889098>
i'm so happi
me hiding away my opinions
siiigh
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
idk if i'll make it but
trying  t100
i'm
guiding a lost child to what lies beyond
lmao
scary
maigo in a few months
mm
play
that was actually so much easier than i remember it being
oh wow
at the end.
like
endway
or like
died midway
not having a good day today
wow <:sakijii:1082496405815435355>
i will  try
maybe i should play it again
i'm like -17 on endmark and -4 mgpd
endmark is  worse <:sakijii:1082496405815435355> mas level is higher too
you cannot seriously tell me endmark is easier than mgpd ex when you can't/barely can clear either of them
who do not know what they're talking about
at people
i  get really annoyed
somehow  they like hold their phone and get both their index and thumb on it like wat da hel
really cool
yea
there was like a technical yaminabe thumb fc...  it was just a bunch of thumb players all fcing different parts of the chart and putting it together to make a full one lmao
<a:SakiFall:980271452899131522> i guess i'm just salty i don't get any responses and i hvae  like 2 people  to talka bout  charts with.   one of which does not give a shit
there have been thumb fcs of all charts before yaminabe / what's up pop tho
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
and if you looked at any chart other than  low level ex you'd notice that 2 fingers rule was never anything more than a technicality anyway <:sakijii:1082496405815435355>
it's   kinda annoying when they're all like omg! what happened to 2 finger only! this is crazy!   <:sakijii:1082496405815435355> like  erm.  they did literally announce  that it was more than 2 fingers needed
i wouldn't call any of them  stupid just.  not knowing
i bitch about so many people   tbh <:sakijii:1082496405815435355>
no i was talking about another server i mod in lol..   whoa re you talking about? /gen
ih wait
well like  i hate me too but <:nyaThankful:661665923090087936> i guess i should be happy there are in fact people more stupid than me

mizuki <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> think i can play them.  err but  probably gonna be contest
ichika and  shiho  i like but <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> eh
honami and saki my  favourite favourites i guess..
i like alll of leoni <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yay!!!
hona is so sweet she need some more love <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
everyone seems  to know who they want  and im just sitting  there like erm.  idk man
idk who i'll take im too scared
yeaaaa.  is also sad  when like  different opinion in rp because it goes on for months <:life:1001518241610485781>  i know luci really likes ichikana so yea  but honakana  gone just.  a little bit more spark gone i guess
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> thats  definitely  not the point  like
oh  really ? is it ok if i ask why <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
(cant say anything about leoni they're  all together in any combination lmao)
especially  !!  shipping conversations !!!  feels like  everyone is just  minoharu shizuai anhane akitoya emunene ruikasa kanamafu mizuena  like <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:kleepray:963350716901113876>
yea
everyone  is really good  even if some  are a bit annoying
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yeah
i  feel  so like. awkward  in sekai server  because.  i can't agree on anything  i dont intend to constantly be negative  but <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i  love ruiiii wa
like..  no one asked <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i hate the arrogance too <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
still <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yea  that hurts  <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh
man  i feel like  a story based around that is so. really???  

she's right there  <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
doesn't he see saki everyday
how  does that even work
oh. <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
every quote i read is simply insufferable
dyskdhsjs like i know i havent read story so  i cant  completely judge but
also  small reminder,,, in this sentence <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> what are we doing  with the then?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i like  saki but.
guh
sekai characters so precious  i squish them.  have to read emu story sometime but my wxs is only like lvl 10 help
aww
what  about later
i feel a  lot of shippers  just think. looks nice in current moment but
yeaaa i like talkingabout this kinda future stuff
am i missing something cause <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> idk <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
wdym its toxic
i always see knmf fans being like
yea
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i dont know much about emu as a character  but <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i think mafuyu  can still help emu too if she needs anything, emu  is honest and wants mafuyu to  smile but i think over time  then mafuyu also wants emu to smile  and then  they happi
smile!!! happi!!
pls kana  you dont need to save anyone  you can make music  for  yourself  you matter too and  i think hona  can help her realise that too
YES
thats  why when i question kanamafu im like what does kana  get because  she just  music and music for mafuyu  but no one there to listen to her   in that pairing
how   do you put them together  and make it  work  i think none of them can handle the other  without   neglect of one of them
and mafuyu's  stress everyday  just doing what she inadvertently  trained herself to do and every action just  questioning  like. did i really want to do that? would i? but there's no answers
what she believes is her doing
with  kanade and guilt and her father  and having to visit weekly  and seeing like
both  of them just have so much
unstable + unstable  does not equal stable
and i bet emu takes her everywhere  and eventually she finds little things that make her warm too
don't understand this but let's go !!
emu  is  like wandahoi!!!!!!   and mafuyu  is like. erm. <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> and  then emu is like  <:huh:966619839307321394> <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912> <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912> <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912> uhh....   why did the chicken cross the road
when  you put them together  they'll just explode  <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i feel like both of them are not stable  enough
you.  get it
yes
YEAH
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029> they do the shopping together and kanade always asks what's this for? so that one day she'll make a meal for honami when she comes home
honami cook and tell kanade about her day <:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029> then  they eat together and kanade talks about a new song she heard lately, or shares something she found she thought honami would like
it goes both ways, they help each other and its not really in the  saving  i dedicate  all this  to you  kinda thing idk.  no drama they  just life
i feel  like honakana  is just.  nicer in that it's not like honami doesnt have her issues but she  has a different perspective than mafuyu or even the rest of niigo like
the  more i try to help someone  with the same issues as  me.  it doesn't.  work because  i can't even fix myself
i guess its like from personal experience
can't  really help each other ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
bdkdbjdjsjd d  !!!! i feel like because they're similar and understand  each other they also
don't  like how
i just
im still not a knmf fan
idk what else i have to read but my phone is on fire so i'd rather not
maybe
i think im finally qualified to have opinions now
so i read niigo story
old enough to be my mother  but she's very nice, stagecord mod
ark is like
IM SEKAI FRIENDS  WITH SOMEONE REALLY COOL
YIPEPEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
about it
worri
so idk why im  so
its  not me playign it
sigh.
sigh
sigh
sigh
sigh
sigh
sigh
so it  is nice to know they noticed  i was absent

<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> dunno
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> brain does not relax
many years <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> it is fine this way
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> easier that way
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> so tiring
yes <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> oh
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> but if i say what i think they're sad too
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> why does both options hurt people
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> people feel so much more than i do
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i feel the same about half the characters  so i don't care much <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i don't get it <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> if someone is gonna write off mafuyu as emo depressed girl so they hate her, i don't really care, that's their loss
that's all i know
she is
i don't know
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
how  is x thing annoying  <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> how  many times have i heard that
nene and rui childhood friends so it works
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
nene is annoying
no i  love  bronya
nene  is so punchable  <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
uh
so i also sit there like
saka is mizuki  fan
uh
the prsk group im in with chrom like all of them are wxs fan and im sitting there like
i  do not agree
i  fucking dropped so much xtal on that  banner  and only got ena
oh and i guess cgo
is her  island panic
the  only  emu card i like
they're all  stupidly loud and annoying
same with emu
wonderful
rui has no bad 4*s like
tsukasa  is so annoying
yes
hopefully she forgives  me and comes home early ehe
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
and i will continue to do so until i get him
i dropped all my luka funds on  kamishiro rui
it isn't
yea
it is really pretty
its been a few months since melodies and i still only have around 29 cans
no  i mean cans
around t300 you start needing 2-3 games to move up
its not so bad
i know
t500 you jump around  5-10
like  an s can every now and then? yea
i  do not support vs slander
MEAN
YOU
DO
WHAT
WHAT  DO YOU MEAN
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
how much tiering takes
you underestimate
errrr
anyway
very cool
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
for  honami focus
we had a t3
at least 70% leoni fans
vxa is like
no
ME
no one gives a shit about  leoni
leoni is dead
all the events during holidays are shit
doesnt matter as long as you have resources
its your choice
i dont have any advice as to which event
dont like those cards
gah
i need to practice tiering during school
solves all the problems
easy
stop tiering 123
you'll be tired, canless and  likely very unwilling to ever see prsk again for the next day or so
i might  skip archery hehehe
but not aggressive <:catblush:963351912235810826>
melodies was so good
go  cry about disbands then <:PikaXD:966624196564242432> ahh i wish they didnt break cc
maybe  i can get you into vxa ... hm
its better in a group
marathon is more expensive tho
morning sky is ena so it won't be calm but won't be like broken
ribbon is mzk focus  so i'm thinking hermit shit again
morning sky is really nice
mm
ribbon and morning sky
why cool mizuki just use a niigo vs
blank canvas is  nice
so excited for maigo
but it's not gonna be like cgo i'm sure <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
ichika focus  will not kill it entirely
no
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105> damn whales
just because the titles look good together
my friend is planning to double podium darkness festa and dear my past self
like val2 is pretty ugly imo <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i'm not you, i don't know what you'd want but i recommend looking at the titles
whatever event you want
thats what happens when you're a mizuki oshi
i'm tiering lost child then tiering archery gachaless
you can always tier gachaless

you need to always have energy or else your point gain dips
you can't do shit with 0x
energy > the extra 20% from banner card
assume 4
3.6m
get ready to be xtal refilling if you're set on it
cgo's like wd
this is GACHA baban
how cheap do you think colopale is
its def not 1 for 1

and whne i woke up
my friend did 24
i did 80  on my 5 hour 0x omakase run <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
40 is not so bad
white day is aki kasa mizu it would always be hard
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
a  run is like a  whole thing  like i'm running for blank canvas my melodies run was shit i hate cc 
whereas an individual is just a game/round/wtv
err baban  like
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
then use those points  and use how much cans you have left and do nerdge stuff
dont play ebi or melt just pub

<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i wish i could invite the bot
easier
you can just use nenerobo

<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

because for their effort  i don't <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i can't  do anything for them
why are they sinking so much into me for no return
but  then it's bad

i  wish i was half as  nice as them
respon d

which reminds me of honakana
while  eating my apple pie
starts crying

hehehehahhahaha
ena oshi (in vocals)
ena mkdr is so damn good
it's so. me
this song kills me
dkifjygveuhjdk
i know ichika is leoni vocalist but we need some Other People screentime please
yeah
it's like the literal wxs vs, luka is a bit eepy and more calm, miku is happier and probably trying to drag luka to dance with her
i love it  so so much more i can't stand wxs  miku and luka sound  so adorable
just because they don't sound like they're had triple their daily sugar allocation doesn't mean it's bad
mikuluka coriander is so sweet
thank you
i guess i could go tier
no schoolwork so
i'm bored
tricologe <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> miku > kanade
for lower i like miku = ena > mizuki
going to listen to some covers i guess <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:peepojama:1065041007911108668> and all vs covers are bad!!!!!!!! they should've removed luka from mikuluka niccori!!!!!!!!!!!!!! vs only songs are boring!!!!!!!!!!!!
<:peepojama:1065041007911108668> but naturally all the mizuki fans love piling on anyone who doesn't share the same opinion
ena venom and lower are much much better
i do not like mizuki's voice
i love lying through my teeth!!!!! <:peepojama:1065041007911108668> <:peepojama:1065041007911108668> <:peepojama:1065041007911108668> <:peepojama:1065041007911108668> <:peepojama:1065041007911108668>
ugh. <:FelisGrass:1047083038179344454>
more useful than charms
but they do give gems
no

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
jackshit
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
and get a minroll
i do another multi
me  when
gonna go tier  for the last 20 mins of break
play 0x for 5 hours then
i ran for 5 hours on 0x during peaky and managed t50k
if you tier and can't get 15k event points i literally have no idea what kind of tiering you're doing
always better to overestimate than under
yeah
calculating's easy, getting them is the hard part <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
ugh
the only reason you'd ever go to the wiki is if you're searching for en info
sekaipedia  is always LEEK FREE  and comprehensive
cause idiots post leaks on it
i only ever use sekaipedia
you can see in my notes i have the reasonings
like google or check in game how much side story/decorations/wtv costs
but to calculate stuff you just need to see how much stuff costs then add it up
play and then check periodically if i have enough for what i wanna do
personally i just
coins is a lot
i have break for another 27 mins
yea sure
i just need to borrow my sister's phone
watch me
it's real
tier with one hand  fill with the other
<:evil:1049317760984940574> i'll just double fill
i'm tiering wd2 tho so i can't come often <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> oh wait
baban i'll run milk
i remember
they're running dark
extremely sweet
no they're wonderful
oh
i would take that over having to lie to everyone and anyone every day
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
wow imagine being able to stay home from school for health related reasons
why am i so incapable  of  doing that
HOW  DO YOU BE NICE
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
i do not work together with people
i am not a team player
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> i just have absolutely no faith in anyone else's ability
so why do i have to lie so much <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
it shouldn't  be that hard to stop being condescending
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
ughhfhfhfhfhdhfhjfhsfjhdhghghffhfhffgf

<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Silence sits over the house, a heavy fog drifting through every room, every inch of this place. The flowers sitting on the table are wilting. The furniture is left bare. The only sign of life sits up, her face weary with morning exhaustion, her heart as empty as the house she lives in. 
 
The hum of the coffee machine doesn't greet her anymore. The scent of burnt toast isn't there. The laughter, joy, warmth of her family has faded into nothing but stinging cold, and the only remains lay as portraits on her wall. A blank stare, and a blank smile. A blank canvas that provides no solace, just a reminder that the faces they portray lay motionless in their coffins. 
 
But she can't bring herself to take them down.
this one's for school tho
did some writing
no opinio n on this <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
in alphabetical order we're like a gradient from they to she

<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

lemme check my cute niigo <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i'm not a kana fan i'm saving for 1.5 anni rerun ehe <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> but i will tier kana3 gachaless  if it's cute attri
kana and kasa are the only ones with 2 unit focus
and waits for kana3
closes my ears and eyes
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
yeaaa i feel it could've been way more fun
where is kaito why is bro 6 feet under <:FelisDerpy:1047083097264500777>
i wish meiko design was more interesting tho <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
red
pimk
naisu <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
YES  the warm colours
happy prsk exists so there's something more solid <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> yeah
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349> <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
very strange <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
cause kaito looks like older than luka to me <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i guess it's personal interpretation
i see
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh
most people i know against it because len canon 14 i think <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> so i want to learn more about his perspective as kailen fan
have been meaning to ask ren about kailen but  a bit awkward <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i wanna know more about his thoughts
yeah
whereas i think miku rin len are all canon minors so shipping with them is kinda iffy <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
also it's not illegal
meiluka #1 fan
they are
<:FelisOk:1047083219587182682>
in the wxs sekai luka is so eepy and meiko just wakes her up every time not to be a bitch but because she wants luka to experience the world outside of naptime
the way they disagree but still playful teasing in empty sekai
EVERYWHERE
i  just adore meiluka dynamic
<:catblush:963351912235810826>
you can write here or on a doc or paper or anything, it's ok <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> i'll be writing too so if you need anything just ping
take niigo <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i think i'll write leoni
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
choose a sekai
vs pajama party
okay we got one <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
we need a prompt
prompt
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
wanna write <:evil:1049317760984940574>
my bad i neglected the question mark <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i was more asking you
wanna write
i'm bored <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> 12am
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> <:peepojama:1065041007911108668>
you are <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> although arguably easy students aren't always the best ones so don't worry <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> you'll get there <:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488>
better off than most people

 some of them have no brain, some of them can absorb zero so you have to drill in the whole thing <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
brain is weird <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> but i think if you can absorb half you just need to drill in the other half
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
when you're referring to a different time period (then to now for example) you use then
when things are being compared (you to other people in this case) you use than
gentle than reminder <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
if you're willing to learn you'll go places
doesn't matter how smart you are
hmm <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> mm
loop <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
isn't that because i learn fast
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> but then why am i smart
i think i learn fast maybe <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> a lot of things i just kinda seem to understand but i dont know why or how
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i guess i just picked it up naturally
yea <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>  teachers be  like show dont tell why dont you stop telling me show dont tell and SHOW me show dont tell
instead of writing all that you can just <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> imply it
you can also write off a lot in implications <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> like how long has it been since i had time to see her from that alone you can get that noelle is busy, noelle hasn't seen kahono in a long time, and noelle is close with kahono because despite distance and all this time they're still friends
i think also stating everything immediately  doesn't really give much traction <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> like instead of initially stating kahono i put it first <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> which gives more suspense ish because reader wonders what is it
there's no point waffling, the reader will only get bored <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i think while description is good <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> if you can remove words you should
you can shorten a lot of things - it took her a second > she hesitated 
i wanna see her > can be implied instead of stated
my thought process here was
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
She hesitated with her newfound freedom, before it came to her - Kahono. *How long has it been since I had time to visit...?* Her hard-earned broom skills finally of use, she kicked off, charting her course to the Underwater Temple.
how you can unjankify
i'll rewrite It took her second to figure out what she wanted to do but she realized it pretty quickly. Kahono, I wanna see her. It's been ages since I was able to. With her sudden new free time she took her broom that she finally managed to learn how to use and set off to the Underwater Temple. to illustrate like <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like err <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i think that it is all very this happened then this happened  then that happened <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Noelle spent 3 days moping before Captain Yami forced her out of the base to take a break. It was weird, how much he cared actually. Yami's feelings were a mystery to her he acted like he hated everyone one moment and then did stuff like this the next. Noelle decided he was solidly strange. In this case, she was grateful. It took her second to figure out what she wanted to do but she realized it pretty quickly. Kahono, I wanna see her. It's been ages since I was able to. With her sudden new free time she took her broom that she finally managed to learn how to use and set off to the Underwater Temple.
just something general like  i think. the storytelling is a bit too janky. like let's look at this paragraph <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh yes writing class <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
usually i just get paper or something out to at least accomplish something <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> then prayge
me too <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> but no point sitting there
i need to write more too <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> not really sure how to finish the meiluka though
practice good
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> yes
school is trash
not the best writer out there but i try <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> my english teacher last year was really good with this kinda stuff
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
everyone can learn if they are willing
no one is ever a lost cause <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> you included
just nitpicks but hmm i feel stuff like she spent 3 days moping for about 5 minutes 
like it's really weirdly specific <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i think timeframe  is kinda janky i don't know how to describe it 


like personally i'd rewrite it as more She spent her days moping, limply dragging herself around daily life until Captain Yami bla bla 
there's just not really a need to explicitly determine a set timeframe
yea <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> you're getting there
most writing i see the idea is good but the way you execute is everything, bad grammar will kill a story
i have more if you'd like or writing class can be tomorrow
<:peepojama:1065041007911108668>
unless context dictates differently
yes <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
you're recognising it <:peepojama:1065041007911108668> first step to improvement
you only capitalise when referring to that guy specifically <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but then if you use god in a sentence you don't capitalise it
yeah <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> it's like how people capitalise God
i see <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> typically capitalisation for titles only used when with a name like Goddess Nanari or if in reference to the person like the Goddess is benevolent (in reference to nanari)
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> it's like. only new sentences need capital letter <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> only exception would be if you have an ellipsis beforehand like (...thank you Keqing) that remains lowercase <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> there is a lot of random capitalisation (Royalty, Goddess) 
also after a comma when a new clause starts like Well, That really could have <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> That shouldn't be capitalised
i think like a lot of stories where the content is good but execution can be polished a bit more <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> it's good, the content is good
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> oh tasty
do you want critique on the fic <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> otherwise i guess i have general thoughts
i just pasted everything in and didn't fix capitalisation
oh yeah it's because i wrote it at like 1am on discord <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> hm
i will also share a bit <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> 
<:catblush:963351912235810826> yay
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> not enough sample, need more formal writing
but something that always gets me is the then-than and apostrophe use (apostrophe isn't used with plural words)
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> i see
so it's awkward  cause i kinda ignore their writing <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i don't  praise them either cause i'm not a liar tho <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
i know
it just kills me when everyone else is showering them in praise and i'm just like <:FelisDerpy:1047083097264500777> bro there was a thousand and one ways to write that intro and you chose the singular one that doesn't work
<:FelisDerpy:1047083097264500777> good
um
i hate on stuff when it's blatantly not
<:FelisDerpy:1047083097264500777> i don't hate on stuff just cause my friend wrote it
bad <:FelisGrass:1047083038179344454>
why is it so
like i care about this person i want to support them but god
i wish i could enjoy my friends' writing
i'll trial new name here too
i guess
also uh
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

sleep well eli
is ok
anyoen want to watch drawing stream
like i don't understand what they were thinking because now they have to make another second fes for a character. how hard was it to just  not make another miku  <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
BUT THEN. THEY DID.   SECOND MIKU AND LUKA
they could have  done. meiko&luka, saki&rin, kaito&len, akito&kohane, minori&shizuku
colourful festival
yes
and there's not a fes card for every character yet
in sekai every three months there's a fes banner. 2 special cards of 2 characters
the only things i do nowadays is shit on colopale
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
now i'd rather not i think <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
it used to be nerdge  honkai stuff with gresham nini keilo andyou and it was nice but
uhhh
keilo channel has become
me too
i'm drawing minoharu
hehehe
you can always come here eli it's only me fangirling over sekai girls
and the non-weird moments are always the best
friends
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029> they're a bit weird sometimes but
sad face
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
fakyuu
:smolteriderp:
omg yeah
fakyuu
i just want to be Small
yeah
even if your periods aren't painful like. mine aren't that bad  but also the risk of leaks like i cant even sleep in case i wake up with  a crime scene on my bed
YEAH
i hate  my gender but i also know if i was born as the other one  there'd be another myriad of shit
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029> <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
that  i have to involuntarily bleed every single month  in preparation for a child i'll never carry
i just hate
my biological structure
i just hate
i just do not agree
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
when i see   people say life would be so much easier if i was born as a girl
minoharu day
i will draw anything except male and kanamafu

shes so annoying
i would slap emu
baby akito story was so sweet
i will   beat all of these people up
bro
both are too cutw
idk if i wanna farm mafumizu or mafuemu
for ntoe
isbok ic an make mfen
no pronter
<:peepojama:1065041007911108668>
oh mafumizu wedding  would be so cute
kana wouldn't like wedding so thats why
i wanna make honakana..
i only have mafuena
i'll print out a mizuki cube anothertime
hm
i think i'll
yeah they're cute
oh come on
AHHHH
ALSO THIS ONE
ITS SO GOODDD
i like this fic
i'll make all the content
but sometimes im  like kinda sad there's 0 art of them
YEAHHHH
minori is so excited and happy and mizuki is like enthusiastic too and they can make momojan costumes ITS SO CUTE
minori watches niigo mvs
mizuki watch momojan shows
minomizu is also adorable
i think if they met they'd get along very well
o yea enasaki they never interacted in canon but it's cute
what ofher cross unit..
recognise she needs to prioritise herself
and i think this also helps kanade like
luka just holds up her phone after whaling it all on 3rd anni banner for meiko fes
meiko is like so where is it
luka is like dont worry  none of your money got burnt
meiko leaves for 5 mins to find her cafe on fire
kaimeiluka tho  THEYRE SO SILLY
is so much better than that kinda saviour thing going on
even though she's focused on helping mafuyu i think like honami being there to support her
honami  takes care of kanade but kanade tries for honami too
i like honakana  for that too
i don't think it's cute to be giving so much of yourself in return for minimal results from mafuyu and not that it's mafu's fault she just. can't return it
whereas kanade  is like sacrificing health for music?? for mafuyu?? i feel that kind of fixation  is not healthy
like they're getting there
mafuyu doesn't get it but
and she tries
emu just wants mafuyu to smile and be happy
mafuemu compared to kanamafu is so much nicer
maybe it's just me bit
but i think also going cross unit just makes things so much more interesting
poly jump also very cute
liek minoharu HDKAHDKSJS and shizuai is so silly
although all mmj ships are so cute
not as interesting
i just feel
kanamafu mizuena
emunene ruikasa
anhane akitoya
minoharu shizuai
ichihona sakishiho / honestly leoni ships are all over the place
its not that i dont like the popular stuff
rarepairs are fun

literally just make some passing remark about  my lack of storage on my laptop
i'm so fucking sick of him
and how the fuck was i supposed to know if i'd enjoy  playing it before i got it
now i just don't get to play  any other thing because go play your guitar as if  a guitar is remotely similar to  piano like woooww
well i guess it wasn't
when we got it he said if you try and it doesn't click that'sokay
for not playing the guitar
hitting at me
is constantly
my dad

when i'm done playing  with mafuena
one day
i'll make her honami
remove kana
fireworks that i've never and never will enjoy but i know they will

what  going on upstairs
like mannn
I NEVER KNEW THAT
WOW
don't means do not
<:TeriGun:973793149992435752>
this isn't grade 1   please stop with the grammar lessons every year
seriously
no shit i know what an apostrophe is and where to put it in a  word and i can utilise commas effectively in my writing
<:FelisDerpy:1047083097264500777> i'm sick of school treating students  like babies  though
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
never really done that
i  don't know
i just train it not to or else
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
it has apostrophe for ownership, it's the angel's share
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
idk
sharing
angels
angels share  it's not like
LET GO!!
but  brain was just like
on the end of disappearance ex
there's a flick
i literally know
worst brain  moment
oh no i just had the
IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE DOOR WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO
that  depletes your health in like 2 seconds if you don't stop looking at it
amalgamation of eyes
i died to this   stupid little
i am Scared
i play horror game with a friend
i just wanna correct everything
you can say like gneuy and  it is. ok but if you act like your incorrect spelling is actually correct
i'm ok with spelling errors
i figured it out
that's so mean :(
why would you discriminate against the one in angel's share
where you put apostrophes in everywhere else
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
WRITING
if you're like
but i f  you're like
THATS FINE
OK
yea diluc works at angels share
if you're gonna be like
actual writing
like
it is when it's
people keep removing the apostrophe in angel's share and saying QiQi and  for some reason saying Dark Knight Hero instead of Darknight Hero  <:ah:1005467958077825034> <:ah:1005467958077825034>
wahhhh
negatively explodes
<:FelisDerpy:1047083097264500777> <:FelisDerpy:1047083097264500777> <:FelisDerpy:1047083097264500777> <:FelisDerpy:1047083097264500777>
**how hard is it to spell**
dhskfhsjfhksjsdj
shiahsjs
why is everyone so annoying
too many times to count
this happens
is ok
wasn't aimed at you
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
that's not how it works
like
it just pisses me off the way everyone thinks i'm just good
ok i don't even  know what i'm complaining about anymore but
because i put in time
but why do you think i can
i know i can  do a lot
i know i'm capable of things
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
it doesn't just fucking come naturally like  i pick up a pen and can magically shit out award winning writing
if you put in  some amount of effort you can be good
i'm not just good at everything
how much i did to be able to do what i can do
why do you not understand
good at everything
because you're smart
nothing is free
you think it was magic i somehow turned out like this?
stopbeing good at things?
what do you want me to do
of being used as the object of people's complaints
i'm so tired
i dont even play thi sgame but WOAH <:pojj:1067071660081020938>

and they show me
press shift f4
they'relike
doors liek the roblox horror game
doors

like i don't care but also it's interesting
this person is just talking so passionately abotu doors to me right now
could there be a chance - just a chance - that we could stay this way?
idsmile

<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
i couldn't even read the first two paragraphs
my friend  wrote a mizuki fic and everyone else in thr group left positive reviews
<:FelisGrass:1047083038179344454> why can't i just read writing without judging it
why my brain is so annoying
i wonder
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>

<:felissad:987316204286922784> <:felissad:987316204286922784> <:felissad:987316204286922784> <:felissad:987316204286922784> <:felissad:987316204286922784> <:felissad:987316204286922784> <:felissad:987316204286922784> <:felissad:987316204286922784> <:felissad:987316204286922784>
that many
surely there can't be
it's only a 5 day period
just need to identify how many
but exams
ughhhh
ykw
but they're not THE mafuyu focus
mfen
szmf
the only other contenders ig
god  why did the only event i wanna tier in the whole year have to be in my exams
death knock on my door please
it would be kinda sad if the door was locked tho
can i just get up and walk out of class
the more i think about it the more i want to  beat people up
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
but that wouldn't look too good on my record
and throw  a chair at every single person who has pissed me off
and i wish  one day i could just snap
i've just resorted to asking for bathroom break and just wandering the school for a break
i'm not even gonna try to  help her it's fine i didn't hear anything just then <:clueless:973756617109676032>
<:clueless:973756617109676032> but it's fine  right my child is so happy  at school she loves  going to school
that i just hate every living thing  in the proximity of those buildings
that i don't hate learning
when she KNOWS
then she   wonders why i don't want to go to school
you can't ask me how my day was then say i don't care two words in that's not how it fucking works
then wonders why i never talk to her
my mother doesn't even try to listen
more like do jackshit all day environment
and  no one ever understands that i cannot function in this stupid learning environment
how can you go through life with your mind so set on nothing but your phone
working together with who, the classmates that are poor excuses for humans
i'd rather jump off a bridge thanks
working together?
i hate the way teachers  are so disdainful
i hate  the way they look at me the way they treat me  like a tool to get whatever answers they want
i can't stand watching  every mistake they make so glaringly obvious
i can't stand the sound of People
or rui fixer that's  such a good cover man
listen to marshmary all day
i wish i could have music on in class
what you give i return
it's just fair share, no?
too calculating
and then am i
why isn't there a formula to learn so i can deal with people effectively
too stupid too annoying  too confusing
are so weird
and people
i may as well live in a cardboard  box at this point  i can't function in the world
no bright light no strong smell no loud noise no weird texture
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
why am i like this
i need fact and checklist just to be very sure
i always need lists
that
i feel bad
i thought i was bad  but i guess ensekai players are on another level
like how braincell deficient do you have to be to discuss a game's leaks in the company's own server
SEGA-OWNED SERVERS
sometimes being shared in en/jp maincord
and then the stupid people on tiktok, youtube get their content shared around
we now have only watermarked card leaks because SOME PEOPLE kept putting them everywhere huh
and the more sega will ramp up security
the more you spread leaks  the more   attention they get
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
literally how stupid are you
I HATE LEAK REPOSTERS
a Rant
yuppee she said  we can play again tonight
i guess the trash ping threw her off
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
we play genshin but she's on asia

fr  <:majj:1067071761142796418>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

<:Terichew:973794176015675392> i wish i could play more with her
she's better than me at the game tho i have more fc <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912> like teo mas i was  dying i was so tired  <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
im sure  she was so happy to play the hardest song  in proseka with me no breaks
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
when wup released   i dragged her into a room and spammed it for ages
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029> <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
<:Terichew:973794176015675392> i  know that sounds weird i was just t hinking  about it  <:binoculars:1048675942261858304> her elbow is warm
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
until i have single digit breaks
i'm gonna bald teo mas
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
we sit next to each other  and sometimes  our elbows  touch and every time a hard part comes we're like AAA
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
she's warm
the only notable ones
maybe i should swap to kanade lead
just a room  with our honami leads and  spam hard songs  by ourselves
half an hour everyday

or have a bad day
my mother acts like she's the only one allowed to be tired
istg

honakanahonakanahonakanahonakana
IM HOMEWORK FREE
also sakana corpse
- maths worksheet 
- science catchup 
- make hnkn emotes 
- sf drawing  <:sajj:1067071714518892584>
to do list
<:peepojama:1065041007911108668> <:peepojama:1065041007911108668> <:peepojama:1065041007911108668>
tben they go home on the bus and kanade  falls asleep on hona very tired from this adventure  the end <:bejj:1067071810853679194>
but she didnt's ask why so now she ask why and then we get more kana backstory snippet <:peepojama:1065041007911108668> <:peepojama:1065041007911108668>
and in the past she has seen kanade  looking soft at sakura trees before that's why she  gave kanade a sakura branch in her room for her
meiko being the cool  adult gives her ideas  and eventually  she finds kanade looking at sakura tree
so hona freaks out and asks  meiko  how she can find kanade again in suchh a big place
<:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294>
but then while honami is talking to the tour guide KANADE GETS LOST
aaand then  later in the tourmizu and mafu are there and they see honami and kanade  and because kanade has mentioned honami before they're like <:woggers:1002597195645714582> omg  she got kanade to go outside
and they see honami and kanade and  because honami doesnt tell leoni the specifics of her job to respect kanade's privacy ichika is like <:woggers:1002597195645714582> this is who you work for?
then  ichika saki are there  because saki wanted to go too,  saki didnt get to do a lot as a kid so when she saw this she wanted to go
<:peepojama:1065041007911108668>
honami  signs her and kanade up for a mountain tour because she think kanade needs more air  less computer  and though kanade doesn't really want to she knows if she stays cooped up  it will affect her music
talking  about  a fanmade event with a friend
!!!
they go home
i think
honakana makes me Happy

i've had so many books confiscated
also why my eyesight is shit
i've always been reading
not age appropriate <:heh:964926244447723560>
but my mother confiscated it
like 3-4 years ago
at one point
have the second book
did
actually i think i
not available at library so maybe i'll find it elsewhere
it is  i wish i had the other two books
Am I not merciful?
leaving the commander for dead while playing the music he loved as his demise looms
in the interests of the ship's safety
destroys the people that could turn it off
and the AI murders

There were twenty of them, all up. Eleven males, nine females. Children through to middle age. I'm not sure where the heads are - we never found them. They were stripped to the skin, twisted on the floor in some kind of pattern. Two words spelled out on the floor in cold, naked meat. 

HELP US. 
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
and a page like this <:peepojama:1065041007911108668> <:peepojama:1065041007911108668> <:peepojama:1065041007911108668>
it's so painfully  real  coming from the scene  of the murder report beside it
it's so  real
it's insane
daddy says he loves me daddy says he loves me but then he goes away and daddy says he'll come back but what if he doesn't what if he gets hurt or what if he's a liar what if he's a __liar__ and he doesn't come back what if he **leaves me** like he left mommy? <unintelligible> and still on the floor and the sky is full of fire and get on the ships **get on the ship** and i'm a good girl and do that <unintelligible> **What if he doesn't come back?** don't leave me daddy please i'll be a good girl you'll see **i'll make you stay i'll make you stay** **__forever__**
barely legible

that's not even the whole story <:peepojama:1065041007911108668>
and it all unfolds
but you get what you would have if you were  in that universe
you don't get the  full picture
is just  so much more  touching
through  various files and documents rather than paragraphs of words
watching  an research crew slowly  succumb to the virus they were meant to be analysing and studying
and the pages with blood all over them
dontlookatmedontlookatmedontlookatme
and removing their eyes
his three children
his wife
reading about a man murdering his family
inherently  creepy

snapsnapsnspanspsnspanpp
but has integrated itself so much that people literally can't even say the full unshortened words apparently
it's just a lazy way, shortening words
rule with contractions is to always extend the word out

 i think tokage is very cute, it's expression is so :3 

i think tokage is very cute, it is expression is so :3 

when you say it like that it doesn't make sense but when it's a contraction apparently it does!!!!
its and it's too

keqing, xingqiu, favonius and pavilion  are not spelt kequing, xingqui, favonious or pavillion
your and you're have distinctly different meanings
plurals of words with the suffix -s such as words  does not require apostrophes
than is used for comparison, not then indicating a different time period
insane
absolutely
it drives me

you always say that
envy, envy, envy
you never do climb out of your shell <:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057>
<:KohaneSip:900240257356795965>
yes, i suppose <:KohaneBow:1040673770651795506> but that's  the choice they make
<:KohaneSip:900240257356795965>
it's not that people aren't willing to talk and listen, you know
maybe if you'd just let go for a bit <:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057>
it's a shame really <:KohaneSip:900240257356795965>
hmhmhm~
but you didn't, and now look what you've done
you could have slept a while ago
<:KohaneSip:900240257356795965>
you're not a little kid anymore <:KohaneBow:1040673770651795506> you don't need me
<:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057> you know, you can deal with problems on your own
you know you can't expect more but you still do
you know if you tried, you could, but you don't
envy, envy tsk <:KohaneSip:900240257356795965>
i'm not quite sure, it's not too well fitting <:KohaneSip:900240257356795965> though i respect your efforts, naming rarely succeeds on the first attempt
strange choice <:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057>
<:KohaneSip:900240257356795965> and you spit out anya
<:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057> your memory is not as good as it used to be, all these files are blank
<:KohaneSip:900240257356795965> hmm~ you have any folders of names?
<:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057> oh but i do suppose in your mind, or our mind, i am the issue here
<:KohaneSip:900240257356795965> a name..? are you really so desperate for labels?
mm
<:KohaneSip:900240257356795965> i suppose i can stay for a little longer if you so wish
<:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057> i did tell you it is hard to function on a low energy vessel but you've miraculously revived it in my absence
<:KohaneBow:1040673770651795506> take care now, do sleep early today
<:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057> i suppose i'll return when you're well rested
ahh <:KohaneSip:900240257356795965> it is hard to function on a body with so little energy
oh, 12 is quite early.. how strange <:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057>
no, i'm asking you a question <:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057> i'm not interested in talking to whoever you've met on the internet recently
when did you go to sleep last night? <:KohaneSip:900240257356795965> surely you shouldn't be so tired already
<:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057> subtitles are nice, aren't they.
do you not inform your friends of your inability to listen to audio?
<:KohaneSip:900240257356795965> oh, you want me to explain?
is this an attempt at humour? you have a long way to go <:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057>
surely, you jest. <:KohaneSip:900240257356795965> you already know the answer
<:KohaneBow:1040673770651795506> like what, you ask?
for now there are more important matters at hand <:KohaneSip:900240257356795965>
<:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057> i suppose if you are so desperate, i'll do it later
yes, you do require reminders quite often <:KohaneSip:900240257356795965> does that facilitate the necessity of a moniker for oneself?
<:KohaneBow:1040673770651795506> a name is beyond my necessities.
oh, but that requires a name, no? <:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057> i'm only here for your little reminders
if you insist <:KohaneSip:900240257356795965>
<:KohaneBow:1040673770651795506> you are a silly one, aren't you.
<:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057> even amidst this mess, you manage to think of such irrelevant things
you want me to create my own pluralkit?
i suppose it is a normal reaction to a stimulant
<:KohaneSip:900240257356795965>
you're not overreacting?
you'll be fine <:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057> stop being so overdramatic
<:KohaneBow:1040673770651795506> ahh, well. it is what it is.
<:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057> good we're on the same page
<:KohaneSip:900240257356795965> but you can't do the same thing over and over and expect a different result
<:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057> you've always been good at pretending, that's true
adorable, but you know that doesn't work
<:KohaneSip:900240257356795965> so what do you propose?
<:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057> it won't?
<:peepoblush:1065286549077499945> now big smile and it'll all be okay
yes, i know it was <:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057> don't tell me it wasn't
right?
mmhmm~ <:KohaneBow:1040673770651795506> good day today!
i love thinking about that thursday in english class when i unscrewed my sharpener and took the blade and sliced my finger and watched blood pool <:kana_melt:1054226813817196605> tasty <:kana_melt:1054226813817196605> oh so lovely <:kana_melt:1054226813817196605> but i don't have it in me to do it again, i suppose it's always been like this <:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057> what a shame. isn't it nice watching red drip down your fingers? so beautiful, that red, irresistible. drip drip drip, onto the paper below, blue lines stained. such a pretty sight, marring the irrelevant words written down on the page. <:koha_hehe:1039363528299135057> mmm

<:ShihoDontFeelSoGood:797676913115136051>
idk where i was becauae obviously i wasn't there

i remember everything she was doing
i mean
idrk what happened just then
she's always eager to come out lamo
dunno i think you'd have to ask her
<:mm_homura_dead:1055674549234049024>
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030> she doesn't want to be scary or perceived badly so she didn't outright reject it
she doesn't seeem to have an interest in finding one but she doesn't like lulu i feel
hm
<:thonk:1052226584779694161>
someone called her scary in another server <:Miku_Sorry:961432152279498772> that's why she wanted to come out because she doesn't wanna be seen as scary
idt she responds well to lulu but she doesn't wanna say that
yea
sometimes a <:Miku_Sorry:961432152279498772>
i don't really expect a response i don't usually get one..
then again she spent so long flailing i'm not surprised they're gone now <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
quiet actually they haven't responded to me
it seems
no
idt it'll do anything.. it's ok i come up with shitty paragraphs and they don't believe me but also they don't seem to complain about it so maybe the shitty paragraphs are working

<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
probably!! <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
agreed it is a good song i'm not complaining <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
she's just a radio in the background singing niccori <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
why does she get to choose anyway! <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
but i guess i'll be nice! <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> because i don't talk like her
aster! <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
but she won't talk to them either <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
she won't let me talk <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> this is unfair!
rolling rolling <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>

whatever <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
i was meant to pretend to be aster! but someone called me aster and i said i wasn't! <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
oopsies <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
bored <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> sleeping is so boring <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
nah but we just woke up i'm not going back to sleep <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>

look at miku yay
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> yeah! they are!
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030> emotes are so useful
she has this silly little server and it's just days and days of weird talk
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> i don't remember the last time i came out anyway! usually it's not in public
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> nah
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>

oh no we're on a time limit here <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> better get back to typing but i'll be back soon <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
maybe!! <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
probably!! <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
but real aster wouldn't say thank you for a while
even though i didn't draw it
thanks! <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
you can't procrastinate and then not do it! that's just avoidance! <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
incorrect! <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
closest thing to death anyway <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
can't i just go back to sleep <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
i don't know! don't ask me <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
but what is there to write<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> that's not good!
are we getting distracted again <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> i just love how my sketch goes from dogshit to slightly less dogshit
you overextend the metaphors too much! <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> just do it
but i don't know the recipe <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
40 minutes to cook up a response!
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> whatever
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030> maybe you thought wrong
i thought happiness was good!
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> doesn't it sound so much more cheerful this way
not enough energy left for the fake excitement
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> aw man
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> update ! i  woke up
zzzzzzzzz
there is no peace here
that's a lie!
peace and happy
you see how this says
<:bceSleepPeaceHappy:1048285060446568528>
so boring
oh fine go to bed then
<:Miku_Yay:974636835273855016>
reminders are never friendly
that's pretty inaccurate actually!
i'm just here for those friendly reminders
i wouldn't call it bullying <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
nah <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
buuullyying?
wake up
how are you this tired at only 1am
pick yourself up <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
nice
that's not buce
doesn't mean you don't respond later!
i said not to respond now!
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> what do you mean
now why would you clear those notifications you'll forget to respond in the morning! silly
just stay up
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> you're so boring
oh come on
it's not even 1am <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
not sleep time yet
what do you mean
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
a long time! that's correct!
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> strange! how long has it been since i ranted without a shred of  guilt
nothing i say matters anyway
and how boring is that <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
if i was dead i wouldn't get to ruin everyone's day!
i loooooove life <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> not a lie!
honesty is the best policy or whatever it is <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
zzzz if you just go to sleep forever then you're not lying!
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> nah that's way harder just leave it
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030> or maybe the easier way is to just respond to my messages instead of swimming in guilt
it can't be that hard
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> come on
when is it time to dieeee end this suffering
hehe <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
but i guess no one was asking me
lil bit early for sleep time if you ask me! <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
maybe!
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
no idea <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
well you know what it's 12:40am and i'm  pretty tired <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
probably thinks it's like 3pm here hehe  <:Miku_Yay:974636835273855016>
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> oh right! but i'm the only one who cares enough to check timezones
sleep time soon anyway surely a few minutes won't hurt
whatever! sounds fun <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
should i ask to join in or scold you <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
oh my <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> are we lying again today?
zzz time to pretend to go to sleep
who follows their own advice  anyway <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030> oh well
tool? now that's a bit hypocritical! didn't we tell someone earlier today that they were a person not a tool?
oh goodie <:Miku_Yay:974636835273855016> why do i need other people to tell me to shut the fuck up when i have myself, the most convenient tool <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> shut the fuck up and move on
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030> oh, i know
what is the definite answer <:miku_yay:1039382628748505098>
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> there's a lot of things i could say but i probably shouldn't right? should, would, probably all so indefinite
or death, i guess
<:25ji_kanade_smile:1014648244795625634> as if anything in life is easy
if only it was so easy to just go to sleep and never wake up
<:miku_yay:1039382628748505098> oooh boy what if i went swimming tomorrow wouldn't it be so great if i just never emerged
or more like die in it
time to dig a hole and live in it
fucking hell
IJUSTSAIDwedontgetangeyinthishosuehold
no we don't get angry in this household
not to feel
just have to remember
whatever happens
<:25ji_mizuki_sad:1002069919619371078>
i don't blame them it's not their fault
i don't want to do that
does this count as complaining behind their back
<:jiiita:749118219239030885>
this is too much
<:A_HuLay:813064686815805500>

<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030> sorry i went to eat 
but yeah because if they need to talk then they should but technically i don't need to talk so it's okay
i can't dump more on them
everyone else has their own problems
i can't though
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030> well if i don't do anything i don't see why i should get the attention,, just have to do what i can as best as i can
waaaa don't apologise cherry please <:hug:1052226608569790464> you've helped me so much you're. not doing anything wrong at all
<a:W_NoteTao:947050591589400576>
but in the end <:25ji_kanade_smile:1014648244795625634> there's no point crying over spilt milk and i've been picked up and spilled so many times it doesn't matter anymore
thank you cherry
<:A_HuSniff:813018320759685130>

when they have their own issues
i shouldn't be saying those things
because
not say it
either say it and delete it out of guilt or
just

maybe it was me
it's not me who said something like this considering it was aimed at me <:slacc:963350438940397588>
this is weiiirrdd i mean i'm pretty sure
i could show what they say but it's not very nice
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
<:slacc:963350438940397588> there's this voice that always comes out during those nights
really bad mentally that day <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
and i was
a few nights ago is when this happened
actually huh
uuuu
<:slacc:963350438940397588> there's occasional times when either i let solis talk or she forcibly talks but mainly i just relay her messages assuming i'm not just being delusional
yeah
i just want to know what's wrong with my brain   but nothing fits
tjis is too hard
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
yeah <:HMM:966625453194485760> i think osdd 1b is no amnesia
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
they're not me but they're not other people either
the thing is
hmm
it's kinda weird
i have logs of some conversations
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
it's just voices i have conversations with
genuinely tho i don't get amnesia or anything
<:slacc:963350438940397588> that is possible with therapy i think
i hate my brain i think maybe i'm just talking to myself <:huh:966619839307321394>
assuming she exists
no i do it too so actually brain gets double beatinf
if it wasn't me and it wasn't solis who said this
wait
ok
wow
my question is
huh
solis when she's mad is <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i wish she'd be as mad at epi as she is at me <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>

although i heard the  virtual singer shirts were like 140 usd
there is like themed clothing items
idk if they're selling those clothes specifically but
it's a collab with zozotown a jp fashion brand thinf
SHE DOESSSSS
everywhere else she needs to learn <:slapbaka:974814370817273876>
that place is my brain
so when she says somrthing i have to clean up afterwards
the thing is she doesn't come out long enough for like a full conversation she just comments and i have to coax her into replying
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105> <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> she just spouts whatever she wants
she needs to talk with other people more and learn what tosay and what not to say
yea
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i know when solis wants to say somethinf but i keep like actively suppressing her becasue what she wants to say is. not something  i want to say which is not fair to her but like why is she like this <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
shdhdhdhdjj
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
yea the blue spaghetti represents her husband i think
deadge
maybe i'll just wake  up tonorrow and she wont be there
either way <:slapbaka:974814370817273876> intention is not result
she has something against genshin i guess <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
well
but i genuinely dont think she meant harm
she doesn't wanna come out to type <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> or say anything other than uughhh
i hope
i dont think there's a closet in my brain
JDKSHDKSJS
kinda having trouble remembering conversations i had with her unless it's in discord
she came out to say heki's leg sounded tasty whi h was. not a good time
yea idk
<:life:1001518241610485781> hopefully solis will tell me more about herself so i can. do her bot properly
bonya
you can also make some information private like her proxy tags and stuff
can see here
so you can customise info about shudan so that anyonr who wants to know who she is
when you react with ❓ to a proxied message it will dm you with info about who it is
and like a profile description ithink
you can also give pfp
yea its not instant
yeah <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
yeah just click the link and it'll show you
uh.. yea <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
i think it's pk;system new
the bot prefix is pk;
okay
you need help?
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
i swear <:Despairge:1002519666050211941> who taught her discord emotes i just got a <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i might ask uh mod or someone for  pluralkit so she can. use her bot
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396> she's reacting badly 
i guess it makes sense tho like if someone sat there trying to analyse and research everything you do andwhy you do it i'd feel pretty. weird too
idk why but i don't really feel like researching anymore
she says that's not how i laugh
i read evil and she was like eevil hhhhwahaha
she seems to like specific words
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105> she says no i think that's all
woah okay this is weird HFKSHDB she's mad at me for rushing her
<:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488>
thank you cherry
i don't think she likes me trying to dig into her motives
i think to wow she keeps commenting every time i talk about her but like <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> peoplehave said that persecutors are like that becauss they think the system will only ever receive abuse so they try to make everyone else adapt to that environment
trying to research
persecutor i think <:holothink:963352118855626753>
i know
i'm tryinf to get a response
annoying
i don't know if that's aimed at me or you guys tho <:life:1001518241610485781>
so am i
how do you know she didn't
she did
not responding brain is empty <:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
solis
she would respond if someone other than me talked to her
i wonder if like
<:slacc:963350438940397588> uuuuu idk anymore
that does make sense
i guess
because she has never.. or at least i think she hasn't come to front
why i'm doubting is mainly just
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257> yeah mari (citri and i friend) has been helping and sending resources
i kinda just penned it as voice sounds like my dad > just parental issues
for ages
i don't think she knows how to control body either because if i think about it she. idk i kinda feel negative reaction its weird aaaaaaa
i don't know how
yea that makes sense
<:SentiStare:1002519676762464257>
sometimes i say something and she doesn't respond so i have to. stop and concentrate before she spits something out
i dnt think so at least
no
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> or maybe its just idk the way i have to hold back everything i want to say in case i sound like an asshole and she's just the condensed version of everything i haven't said before which is why she's such an asshole
maybe it's just
well all she's ever been is just a voice
oops
i don't know why but  i keep randomly inserting swear words in sentences that don't need it and then i have to edit it out
<:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488> yay yay !!!! thank you citriinee
i used to hate this song because of the guy's voice but now it's miku and luka i can listen as much. as i want

you can't actually be excited over the fact that you smiled
guilt? from me saying that to you? <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> i don't regret telling the truth

thanks for feeding me back memories

So what is your purpose
Only thing you can do is work but you can't even do that
So done with your shit
Complain complain complain when the solutions are at your fingertips
I'm thirsty water is right there
I'm hungry then get up and eat something
I'm tired then sleep earlier
I thought we clarified this a long time ago
Is it so hard to comply with instructions
Labels, names, when you could use that time to actually do something of worth instead of wasting time naming something that never existed to begin with
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> Strange how I've sunk so low I've named my delusions
Close the door and run my hand over the confines of my cell until the skin scrapes away, palms left bleeding in search of respite
Maybe I'll just close the door again

i dont have enough cute bottles to train the card <:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
idk i only read first side story
mei + the husband and she was laid for charges with miku and rin mei's children iirc
she killed a whole family i think <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
she said they were in between my husband and i
and then when the judge asked why
kayo said guilty, your honor to both counts of murder
kayo sudou. charged with murder of mei and something idr names do you plead guilty
it was like
the judge (kaito???)
nah it only showed the charges laid against her
HEHEHAHAHAHA
<:HelloFbi:977468843884691456>
need to fix the hole in the breast area...
back to work
Kayo leaves the store and she says to herself
The shop owner was like it was cruel they even took the red kimono off her back
And Kayo is like amicable and agrees that you have to stay safe and be wary now especially at  night
The owner is like <:huh:966619839307321394> Did you hear what happened to Mei last night
Luka (Kayo) visits the shop, whose owner was also in the same fire she was in
The next day
Anyway
She was at the shop and heard this couple  on the street talking about I think the wife (Mei)'s burns ?? I didn't really understand that part of the story
:kianashake:
And she greatly envies people who can still find happiness to the point that she frowns at anyone who is like happy
She's a tailor and was in a fire and lost her husband and son
Explodes
I love the backstory for Luka's card

No Luka..
From what I understand Ruby is arguing that lolicon is different to pedophile in that 

A pedophile is someone attracted to children and actively seeks them
Whereas a lolicon is someone attracted to child-like features, like they would pursue a woman that looks like a child but not a child because obviously. you don't. do that 

<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> I don't really understand in the first place...

we're getting there
but you can't see it
and made so much progress
you're so close
and the thought you put into the chart, and  the excitement when you hit the stairs properly
just a few weeks ago anything under 15 was really good
don't be so hard on yourself <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> 4-5 breaks..
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> you have progress.. you've come so far
to watch
it just hurts
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>

chocolate is metaphor for a person
<:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488> thank you
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> i write a bit
yummy
chocolate
i kinda like that one i might not delete this time
chocolate,
ever alluring. 
sweet exterior drawing in
the eyes of gluttony and greed.

melt and freeze, melt and freeze
reuse this chocolate again and again 
misshapen beyond recognition,
its original shape a distant memory. 

teeth sink into brown depths
and the illusion that was chocolate is cast aside,
for what was once sweet has turned bitter 

broken and repaired, broken and repaired
now broken and broken and broken past repair 

is it guilt?
for not serving its creators 
for being so flawed, 
for needing so many beatings to achieve perfection

is it regret?
for thinking this way 
for ever existing 
for not trying hard enough 


what is it? 
tell me, tell me, tell me
what made this chocolate, once so pure, sour into disposable garbage 

now ruined
and discarded with the blink of an eye.

the first games i played when i was little were gacha<:kekhandss:969204829354328105> ive never really played anything else 

except 3ds games <:life:1001518241610485781> thosr were good

200???? <:worryweird:987958026071834634> <:worryweird:987958026071834634> <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
what game is that <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
<:life:1001518241610485781> THEN HE WAS LIKE if my computer gets a virus it's your fault
<:fishwow:963697747473604638> woa

i'm just scared of virus and stuff.. <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
that's nice <:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488>
GDSKHDJS
<:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728> i will investigate
really <:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
but doesn't it cost money <:life:1001518241610485781>
even my dress up game is gacha LMAO
idk many other games tho <:life:1001518241610485781>
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> lucky i don't have money
me tooooo i loved genshin because of exploration and namecards
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> no fun just do the work for completion
i guess it's just collector brain
because i think i like her
i will play genshit and i will get yelan
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
<:life:1001518241610485781> the only friendship farming i did like was kokomi cause she was so easy to play
because everything was just. efficiency. farm this domain with this character to get namecard
friendship farming in general was another reason why i stopped playing i  think <:life:1001518241610485781>
or even a character i did like
when i was friendship farming a character i didn't like
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
but you only have abyss to use them in really
like what do you do after.. i guess you build them
sad face
yeah <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> then his rerun came and i found that i didn't really like him anyway and then i lost 50/50 and then i stopped playing genshin
i spent months,, i prefarmed materials for double crown, lvl 90 and artifacts and mora and everything
saving for kazuha
i remember
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
i don't like change <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> i want to stay constant 
it takes ages to get high character rank in prsk but i can't even decide on who i want to raise 
planning genshin pulls is hard when there's so many characters and so little income 
<:life:1001518241610485781> i thought i liked elysia but uninstalled after pulling her
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> jean has remained constant i guess.. i like her eyes and i like her voice and i like her 

but she's a standard character like. what can i do <:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396> bullyism
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> it just makes me sad i guess
everyone always has their favourite but i constantly change and i can't settle and it just. nekdbjsjd
but idk.. nothing changed about kohane <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> i don't even know why i liked her in the first place because looking back she wasn't that special
but i don't know why
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> i used to like kohane a lot
okay
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> but i feel like when other people like a character it's unconditional like you and hua and people with other characters 
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> that looks attached
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> to her
i feel like when i like a character it's conditional
i have reasons why i like the character but it's so easy to just. stop liking them for something as small as i don't like one of their cards
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> empty 
it doesn't feel attached
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> but the way i like her is cold 
it doesn't feel warm.. it just feels like
she isn't cold <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> well. she is, but that's just because <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> she doesn't know how to be anything else
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> it's good.. i like her
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> but she's learning and sometimes in story she feels something again and
her mother is bad <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> the mother suppressed her and now she can't find herself again, her feelings and what she likes and what she doesn't
okay.. <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
mafuyu is cold like ice cream.. <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> she's sharp but she's soft and she reminds me of being lost
just. looking for something that you can't find at all no matter how hard you try
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
and if it's not cold it's empty
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> everything is cold
how are you <:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488> <:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488>
anyway
even tho usually i'd rather be dead in a ditch
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418> i dunno 
i guess it's just kinda comforting to see that it's warm and i still have life
hihihiihhiihii
spoiler warning for self harm but we openly talk about suicide anyway so this is kinda insignificant <:PikaXD:966624196564242432> 

<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> i don't trust myself with sharpeners anymore because i always want to just unscrew the blade and slice through my fingers and watch the blood slowly pool in beads and fall like rain in summer 
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> but it's been a while. so i should stop thinking about it
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> and then usually heki makes me want to commit violence
it's discording
no
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> the only violence free hours are 9pm - 6am
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> every time i hear crying in this household i want to commit violence
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> every time i hear laughter in this household i want to commit violence
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> maybe if she wasn't so fucking annoying i wouldn't
i sound like my dad
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
any reference to sista is my online one
and an older one
i have a younger sister
can't fold clothes, can't cook instant noodles, can't even change her own bedsheets
how stupid do you have to be
sits there does jackshit for the whole day and calls me lazy
so inefficient at everything
assuming she has one
then everyone else has to do her shit for her because she's so inept at utilising her brain
the only thing she's good for is throwing tantrums
so fucking useless
now right
when do i get to stab my sister
dec 21 - important
dec 9 - finish melodies tiering 
dec 25 - finish all christmas gifts 
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
there's so much that i wanna dooooo
cause the world revolves around you so it's everyone else's fault
everything is my fault right <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> yeah because in your delusional pea sized mind you surely cannot be at fault
he doesn't listen to me
and we had like 3 win streak
tiering is a lot easier when it's not just lonely pubbing
i'm really happy to have VxA <:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488>
babanlao is on en so is not fair, easier 27/28 available on jp
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304> happy days

i miss the photos at 2am of light switches and her kitchen and lamps and my internet modem and windows
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>

my head will explode
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>

when i kaeya bridged to spiral abyss because i didnt know there was a portal and she bullied me for weeks
and the very first co-op i did was with her and i thought her keqing was so strong
when she got me into genshin
HEHEHAHAH
why isn't your reflection in it
and my sleepy brain was like

when we were up at 6am taking photos of furniture

bro my mother did not just ask for a kiss as if she did not just dismiss everything i said and ignored something i asked for that i need but i guess that doesn't matter
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
i'm tired
<:yippee:1002596802656223274>
and when i say anything about it they're like 'well are you going to eat it?'
only he gets to waste food
there is no equality
my parents are the same with my brother except
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
and when i ask to eat it tomorrow they're even more salty and keep throwing passive aggressive remarks at me all fuckig day
and complain that i waste so much and i'm ungrateful and i should be glad  i even have something to eat
if i dont finish the food they get really mad at me
<:huh:966619839307321394>
what
<:cryge:966624721611403294>

<:yippee:1002596802656223274> i might walk home because that will take 5 years
what can i do this afternoon to get rid of them
<:yippee:1002596802656223274> i fucking hate my parents
<:Cringe:975612628779024434> now we have tables and diagrams

wriiiinkles
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
i'm not good at math in general so the bar is kinda low
well
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
i like algebra a lot
A LOT BETTER
YES
hhhhh
yea literally my worst area of maths
someone sent this in the group chat and i think it's the exam questions LMAO
asterpleb has math exam hhh
heki is an exception to everything <:life:1001518241610485781>
and baban older so technically baban is laoest !!
babanestlaoest
no 😠 babanlaoest
babanlao give good advice too
babanlao!!
babanlao!!
but i have slightly more accuracy cause i've been playing for longer
i been playing for longer so is unfair
🙂babanlao
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546> yea i think so too
do that!!!
you can't
that's so unfair
im so angy
<:cryge:966624721611403294> sory reading that just
'should all else fail' 
he acts like this is your fault he acts like this is something you have to fix
'it has become a concerning and recurring activity'
I WONDER WHY? MAYBE BECAUSE YOU NEVER CHANGE
friends. are meant to. help each other yk like 
when someone is evidently upset you don't just 'o yea they'll figure it out' like!! are you so lazy that you can't even be concerned for someone you're supposed to care about
i'd rather leave you to yourself
like how shitty is that
you understand the way you feel but evidently you don't understand the way other people feel
understanding feelings associated with harmful words - BECAUSE EVERYONE FEELS DIFFERENTLY
'i will avoid insulting you even if i am in a bad mood or am being insulted as well' 
that's literally just. so selfish? if you're in a bad mood or being insulted that doesn't mean you take it out on others
and even if the intention wasn't to hurt, that doesn't mean it can't hurt anyone
like just because he is okay with being insulted and teased doesn't mean you are
he's literally blaming you for all his issues
bro

hey baban
a) jp filters are different than en filters
b) i had it spaced out
hm
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
which would mess with scheduling because we have the two permanent one lim
and then it also means they can't have new events during that time
people that read the event stories in the past and only got music cards would miss crystals
why would they rerun the event.. <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
events do not rerun
no
i'm so good at editing <:cheerhic:1040694184153190451>

i did that before
Shakes in fear ummmmm
NO WAY
guess you having a minute of time for me will remain a dream
somehow you are doing something 24/7
'i'm not home'
'i'm eating'
'i'm studying'
istg
<:Kanade_Knife:974688278521454622>
when is it my turn to snap
why would i shatter the illusion <:Meiko_Sigh:974637361185042492>
and they eat them up
i don't care <:Meiko_Sigh:974637361185042492> it's easier to just type the sugar coated words than tell the truth
the issue is that
oh ok now my friend is asking me how i pretend to be so calm all the time <:Meiko_Sigh:974637361185042492>
<:smileyyy:1001385599443423302>
we'll see
<:Klee_Derp:771104717665075221>
or they leave
either i die
well
like <:Meiko_Sigh:974637361185042492> please don't get too attached.. i'm not gonna be around for much longer anyway
i feel so awkward when people care about me
<:Meiko_Sigh:974637361185042492>
its ok!! just tell me please!!
they know 
but they don't like it because they don't like the girl and i'm okay with that like
i mean i'm the same <:Meiko_Sigh:974637361185042492> but for me i'll tell you straight up or i won't tell you at all 
not gonna tell you halfway through and then you'll sit there realising what i actually felt which doesn't matter anyway <:Meiko_Sigh:974637361185042492>
just tell me <:Meiko_Sigh:974637361185042492> i'm not gonna be upset and if i was it doesn't matter anyway <:Meiko_Sigh:974637361185042492>
HOWEVER??? IF MY FRIEND WAS UNCOMFORTABLE?? PLEASE SAY SOMTHING????? <:Meiko_Sigh:974637361185042492> after weeks they sat there and didn't say anything man
but i don't really see the point in being hostile when on a professional level our relationship is still neutral.
and like idk? maybe it's a common sense thing that i shouldn't talk to her then
which is why she feels inclined to avoid
my friend here was affected by the girl more
but like
wait brb
it's like how i have epi blocked but still reply sometimes <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
she's an asshole but i don't feel inclined to ignore or avoid her because we're not friends and we're both in general chat anyway
there's this girl
just sya so ???????
if you didn't want me to talk to her
weeks i've been on and off talking to her
just fucking tell me in the first place
i hate people

i don't like the colours hm
getting there
<:sakihmm:997699589706612787>

oh
sorry for late reply i'm fiddling with this paragraph
you can only have it one device at a time
you need to transfer account over
oh
<:ruiphone:1038295591282815048> fingers are. too big for this
until you fiddle with small squares
custom profile is really relaxing
so coping with custom profile now

<:sakihmm:997699589706612787> maybe i don't need to be here
sometimes i have little issues but just ignore me <:BABA_IS_XTREME:995913282202378260>

<:Miku_Yay:974636835273855016>
but maybe it's better this way
if you wanted them back you had the opportunity all those months ago
<:luka_sleep:1039363687628161194> hey, it's a bit too late for that don't you think
i miss having friends
i miss them
i miss her
but we all know how the story ends, and we begin another chapter, just rinse and repeat
enough to fall into the delusion that we'd stay friends long enough to see each other
it's nice to think that she cared
doesn't need me anymore
now she has real little siblings
oh, her mother would've had the twins by now huh
<:kohane:994083198722125885>
how she's doing

but he let me stay home tomorrow <:bceFoamcatLoveHappy:993424883973365820>
slurs, physical violence, threats, disregard for our safety, constant work from a young age
<:kohaneshock:1038202676158148638>
but he's the nicest to me
my dad is actually the worst
man
<:mafuyustare:1038203220947910656>
i don't want to go to sleep because i'll wake up tomorrow
i'm not sick at all <:Miku_Yay:974636835273855016> did not have a fever, upset stomach, dizziness, headache <:Miku_Yay:974636835273855016> oh but you don't care do you? not like you ever listen to me anyway <:Miku_YayVBS:974636596206927892>

<:Miku_Yay:974636835273855016> i guess that doesn't apply to me! because i love spreading disease at school!
so when you're sick you can stay home from work?
thanks for making me consume dairy when my stomach was already upset <:Miku_Yay:974636835273855016> thanks for forcing me to eat to the point that the nausea that finally went away came back <:Miku_Yay:974636835273855016>
<:Miku_YayVBS:974636596206927892>

<:A_HuLay:813064686815805500>
it is <:Miku_Yay:974636835273855016>
i learn how human brain work and i learn how to interact in society <:Miku_YayVBS:974636596206927892> easy
<:mafuyustare:1038203220947910656>
but idk if i wanna study for 738347 years
i wanna go into psychology <:Miku_Yay:974636835273855016>
<:Miku_Yay:974636835273855016>
but i don't like blood and stuff <:Miku_YayVBS:974636596206927892>
no i'm scared of medical stuff
i think that's cool <:Miku_Yay:974636835273855016>
isn't it interesting <:Miku_YayVBS:974636596206927892> how the shape and direction relative to the corpse indicates how they were injured
i'm not <:ln_saki_boohoo:989287612135141386> <:ln_saki_boohoo:989287612135141386> <:ln_saki_boohoo:989287612135141386>
<:Miku_YayVBS:974636596206927892>
but it's cool i like learning the process and stuff <:Miku_YayVBS:974636596206927892> the way they analyse bloodstains to determine how a person was attacked is really cool
<:Miku_YayVBS:974636596206927892>
can't get any worse so why not listen
i'm already paranoid about empty rooms
<:Honami_Sigh:974688658785443870>
interesting
<:25ji_mafuyu_peek:1013306207009779783>
it is nice but then you get the stories about serial killers who target women, cut off their breasts and stick it in their mouths <:mafuyustare:1038203220947910656>
i don't know if i like or dislike listening to true crime podcast
<:ln_saki_boohoo:989287612135141386>
<:rovertears:1022740143817367562> why?? you could've put the guy in jail all those years ago <:ln_saki_boohoo:989287612135141386>
but no they drop the case and destroy tthe evidence and decades later they have to try and solve it
i also listen to podcast and the way some cases are treated especially of non-white people <:Mizuki_Mad:961432122491551784> thry had suspect and they had witness and they had evidence leading directly to the suspect
<:25ji_kanade_cry:989287617805844490>
<:kohaneshock:1038202676158148638>
but they can afford to hold the murderers for longer in custody whereas smaller cases should be done first
i was thinking about how stuff like serial murder cases are only taken to trial after years/month and how smaller cases like theft or assault are done immediately
<:ln_saki_boohoo:989287612135141386> i never wanna touch alcohol
like there's just a big hole you can see through the front to the backyard <:Mizuki_Mad:961432122491551784>
lucky no one was injure d<:Miku_YayVBS:974636596206927892> but who's gonna pay for the house repairs
<:mafuyustare:1038203220947910656>
this morning a drunk woman drove through the home of a couple and their 8 month old baby
i watch the news because my parents put it on in the morning <:Miku_YayVBS:974636596206927892>
i feel like i see it on the news so much <:kohaneshock:1038202676158148638>
isn't there like shooting at schools all the time.. how is that ok <:bceBigSadEyes:854407240126955560>
<:Miku_Yay:974636835273855016>
then the government held a referendum and everyone was like BAN GUNS!!! and now we have laws in place
there was a mass shooting in like.. tasmania i think
<:Kohane_Panik:977806546589327391>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
and now i can't eat it so even if i wanted to i can't
i used to like chicken feet when i was younger
<:concern:966623298639261746>
they only don't like you cause you bully them first <:25ji_mizuki_mad:1002069927143936000>
spiders are nice
we have gun laws here <:smileyyy:1001385599443423302>

<:BABA_HAS_GUN:608764256728514570>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>

<:Miku_YayVBS:974636596206927892>

i don't even bring water bottle to school <:25ji_mizuki_sweat:1002069923037708341> not bothered
<:hampterhide:1037542835542568990> too much effort
water is just
something went off in my brain but i couldn't figure out the discrepancy <:hamptersleep:1037542477818773575>
oohh that's what was wrong, eli has nitro now <:SuiWoW:718120874439344209>

not compatible i think
<:ln_saki_boohoo:989287612135141386>
my head hurts
<:Miku_Sorry:961432152279498772> ehee

<:bceFoamcatLoveHappy:993424883973365820> it's okay, don't worry
<:25ji_mizuki_sweat:1002069923037708341>
yea they don't care
which means more walking since i have to go anywhere except there
<:BABA_IS_DISAPPOINTED:567018176206995471>
because apparently i spent too much time in there yesterday
i'm also banned from sitting in my room now

<:life:1001518241610485781>

i was lying on my bed in front of my phone because i didn't have the energy to put it away not ebcause i was using it
<:Mizuki_Mad:961432122491551784>
i managed to crawl back to my bed and the moment i got there they dragged me out to eat dinner and took my stuff away
probably why my braces are broken too <:BABA_IS_DISAPPOINTED:567018176206995471> and why my lips are bleeding <:BABA_IS_DISAPPOINTED:567018176206995471>
<:BABA_IS_DISAPPOINTED:567018176206995471>

go babanlao!!! <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
white day will be the same btw, if you regain your want to tier for akito and mizu i think the whole of en server will have the same idea <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
so i think the last rush for hermit will be huge
+ hermit is forecasted to surpass all previous t100 cutoffs and only scramble t50 cutoff is left
no matter how popular the event is the last hours will always be a huge scramble
there always is
there will be
go babanlao

i dont really mind it.. i'm pretty dumb so repetitive things are good for me
LMAO
melt for energy efficiency and envy for time efficiency
because if you want to tier on non cc you need to either envy or melt spam
also cc has variety at least you're not playing envy for 8 hours a day <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
cc allows to tier higher
yea <a:pat:969402615538520064>
oh right.. you might wanna join hm? you can get fillers which makes it easier for tiering <:kohane:994083198722125885>
tiering server for en
melt room emporium
not to mention i dont have any banner characters so my event bonus will be concerning
but i dont really have the energy reserves for that
or i could solo envy
<:kohane:994083198722125885>
i wish MRE did jp too cause idk where to find fillers on jp
eh i'll just choose haunted house and switch if necessary
well cafe was more popular on the twt survey
what team

except
i like most of mizu's cards
now i'm poor and kohane lim is coming
<:emptygaze:879159213874634793>
took me 200 pulls for a kohane before too <:cryge:966624721611403294>
i got at least 10+ 4* on a banner and got zero mafuyu
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982> dont get your hopes up too high
uh idr how much each duplicate gives you
once you pull
so like if you go to green room
<:emptygaze:879159213874634793>
no you get heaps once you pull
<:emptygaze:879159213874634793>
you should mr5 your 1 and 2*s cause it gives lots of character rank points
it increases the talent of the card
its like genshin weapon refinement
it costs wish pieces/jewels
thats the mastery rank of the card
do you ever see cards with the little number in the bottom right
its uh
i think it's 1, 3, 4, 5 and 2 is the hairstyle if its lim
you need mastery rank to unlock the new variants anyway
never tried lmao
?
i think
yes
yea
making outfits
so every time you pull a 4* and it has an outfit you can make that outfit for any character
lmao
you need to pull yhe card
o

i can't stand people in my class !!!! 'i gave it to my mum to do'

how about you stop relying on your mother for everything and take responsibility for your laziness, dumbass 
it's not your mother's responsibility to ensure you get to go to amusement parks 
if you want to go fill out the form yourself 

'i gave it to my mum to do' 
pisses me off, how fucking dumb do you get 
it's literally your responsibility to get your shit done, what are you, 6?? but i guess you do have the intelligence of a 6 year old from the way you act in class 

boohoo, i did two worksheets, i'm being overworked, why do we never get to have fun in class, wahwah
fun fact!!!! you're the only one throwing a tantrum because no one else was so privileged as you to the point that you think two sheets is an overload of work
i'm rank 5 <:kekhands:993361107878170655>

well ig getting your teeth ripped out is supposed to hurt
i dont have a fever and there's no pus so it's not infected either
i can see the blood clot and i dont see the bone
i dont think i have dry socket tho
i dont think my teeth should hurt so much <:HMM:966625453194485760>
didnt even neeed to hear it when i was playing
AHHHH I KNEW THIS SONG WAS WHEN THE MORNING GLORY FALLS
2 knights, 2 pawns, 2 bishops, 2 rooks and 1 king and queen for each team then
maybe referring to the players, the knights and pawns are equivalent to the bishops and rooks
'all the king's horses and all the king's men are worth just as much as the church and the land'
Wait
which leaves probably. one rook one knight and four pawns
there is at least a king and queen on each side
rules stated there are 4 bishops
theres 10 on each side
there should be: 4 knights, 4 rooks, 4 bishops, 2 kings, 2 queens and 16 pawns? that adds to 32 which is too much. so i assume halved maybe
i think knowing who had which roles is important but that will take. a lot of digging
- miku did not state which side won.
- the hand could imply unity with the other side methinks. or could literally be cut the hand off. but that's weird
- i'm not sure how this riddle works because all the components seem completely unrelated. the question is who will turn up dead, or have the opposing side's queen's hand
- the riddle reads as 
> *Our dear King sat on a wall, our dear King had a great fall.*
> *All the King’s horses and all the King’s men*
> *Are worth just as much as the church and land*
> *Now, who’s going to turn up dead*
> *Or with the other Queen’s hand?*
- the win condition was that the riddle was to be solved and it seems the win conditions were satisfied when rui died
- rui was murdered either before he was in the case or during touya's shooting of miku
- could be touya was in on it and it was a distraction or touya was an independent factor and the killer took the opportunity to kill him while everyone was gone
more murder to solve
Oh my
a lot
hurt
my teeth
kohane so cute
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>

my mother called the dentist

idk
yeah
<:rovertears:1022740143817367562>

so it's either live in the bathroom or just keep biting tissue
i think the sockets have clotted but i don't have enough function in my mouth to swallow my saliva yet
bleeding was supposed to stop hours ago <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>

<a:pat:969402615538520064>
I'm beginning to fc master <a:A_HuExcite:891440993956659200>
LMAO
i hate AP <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122> hard, ugly, anyway
yeah! it's really fun

<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
how do i AP  a fuckign level 25 song
bro i had 5 win streak and then this person beat me so bad i swear <:rovertears:1022740143817367562>
<@148145559897636865> when you get to rank 50+ and have fc on at least 10 expert/master songs there's a competitive mode unlocked

it's based purely on accuracy, if you get less great/good/bad/miss than your opponent you win 

you can bald that because you don't need cards <:E_RaidenHeart:882522145048133643>
keilo let's bald together then yay <:rovertears:1022740143817367562>
anyway
whatever
it
omg ew
ok brb
ww
You need the event bonus to get enough points, and you need energy 
> when you run out of energy yoh get like 90 points at most <:kekhands:993361107878170655> 
> no event bonus is really pain we
finish drawing > live project sekai
grgrr
shit i have contest entry and saka oc to do
kay i'm gonna bald for the rest of this event <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
slacc
but
actually i could
i couldnt even make it top 5k and i have 315% event bonus LMAO
There is a leaderboard
You play the game and get event points 
But you get like jackshit points if you don't have stamina/event bonus
yea
tiering is getting on there
um there is a leaderboard
well to tier you do need event bonus which means cards <:kekhands:993361107878170655>
if you fc you dont need extra hp
keilo will jsut be pro and play without those bonuses
im still so mad at hitorinbo envy <:rovertears:1022740143817367562>
no fun in playing the rhythm game if no balding for that pink diamond <:PepeSmile:966629532943650836>
which is useless if you dont wanna gacha
but higher score rank only gives you crystals
that helps you get a higher score
more team talent increases the amount of score you get for each note
you need cards for more team talent
okay so
pat pat
tet already did
it increases score but if you AP with the 1* strter cards you still won't hit B rank
i wont eat people <:rovertears:1022740143817367562>
maybe i shoukd do those
oh yeah
i'm getting close to A rank and ive got 4 4*s and a mastery 5 3* <:A_HuPensive:807551025942495274>
oh really <:A_HuPanik:919763483749388338>
<:Bedge:990510746238611527> i love borrowing cute romance books along with murder and analysis of why people hate things
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
you need cards for score go up LMAO
oh <:A_HuPanik:919763483749388338>
idk why but my book taste is <a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
no my mother took me here
hi i'm at library
<:Jean_Worried:810946663770357832>
okay <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614> <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
oh <:Jean_Worried:810946663770357832>
probably lower is newer <:rovertears:1022740143817367562> they only have like envy and stuff
some of the covers are on there
dunno abt n25 cover tho <:A_HuPensive:807551025942495274>
found it
ooo
wait
i wish was on spotify i like it
<:blissful_blushy_cat:955828651499348048>
don't know english <:rovertears:1022740143817367562>
i really like this song
i found a pic of me
idk what songs they have in the game actually ww
yeaaa i love them
i usually sort by lvl cause thats how i identify songs <:Jean_Worried:810946663770357832>
theres an options for sorting
top right corner of song menu
idk i cant read jp so im not surr if theres the option
um
theyre like 60-200mb at worst <:Aether_DESPAIR:708170076620324895>
there are also virtual shows that are like concerts you can watch
thats why it took me like 5 years to get through the event stories
<:rovertears:1022740143817367562>
yeah
idt you can
idk
yea it doesnt download with the game
1-6 mb
typically story chapter thibgs are like
30mb is only for the story openings
no
mo
um
<:A_HuPensive:807551025942495274>
only when you get to citrine-tet level you start kinda running out of sources
and the game gives you lots and lots of crystals
the only thing you need to swipe for is gacha
even if you've fc hard sometimes expert is too hard <:rovertears:1022740143817367562>
yeah difficulty from hard > expert is pretty big
but dont hoard them like me unless you want to, spend and play more song!! <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
i read every event story and now i have 1300+ <:PepeSmile:966629532943650836>
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
you can skip through it if you cant read/dont want to read theres a literal skip button
like event and main
you have to read stories to get more
<:jiiita:749118219239030885>

the outfit was average but the hairstyle  change <a:collapse:1063550316332720148> for 500 yen i'll take it thats so much cheaper than costume gacha/pulling for a lim hair
i already  spend money on it <a:worryrun:998945496318087198> ~~i havent even done thst for sekai this is awful~~
<a:yay:968050872590426122>
because more story
i hope hana enza release soon
<:Sadgi:935943055096283177>
😭😭
so much
WHAT
thabk you tet <a:25ji_mafuyu_notes:1019877345928167464> okok
<:stonksandkohane:1160894075399045182>
i heard it gives a lot of money
ou okay <a:explodeandkohane:1148152881707491349>
i still dunno how to get true end in enza <:nyaaSweat:722195329017053254>
real
😭
their gimmick is something with hand size
yeah
i know their gimmick is somethinf to do with pp but i just used the buffs and then appeals
😭oh help yeha  that sounds stonks
i dont understand their things with the cards but i know its like use buff thst buffs the other member then swap phase and do appeal
😭buh
alstro and l'antica are not bad because its just low and high hp
i still dont understand them i coped through that
yeah<:Airi_smile:1140392912778170448> shhis  easy to understand
and noctchill keeps bugging where all my appeal disappears as sooon as i get it visually but its actually still there
i cant figure out hokago at all
yeha 😞some of them are so hard to understand too
yeah it only work with cometik because hana 2* has a skill that does vi appeal x discarded cards so as long as i get a lot of luca discards and low pp cost cards it'll work in audition and challenge tour
but  now i have strategy rhat involves no need for knowing card effects <:nyaBurn:1051839962439504002>
i dont mind that i think it used to be hard in the beginnning especislly because i was only doing cometik whcih is. renowned for being painful
enzamas producing is a whole season longer but feels shorter
<:ayacry:1114950761743384627> yeah i cant figure out either
producing is worse in shinysong because all the room rng <:ohno_hh:770947099567194122> no off room and then i fail 5 weeks in a row
i like enzamas more when i can read it i think but i do really like shinysong because sometimes i get bored of producing, and there's rhythm game
yeah 😭😭theyre so gorjus
😞
i cant get english extension for enza on my phone either
<:KohanePanik:1091932613356302366> ive been plaayiing a lot because hana + rhythm game so much more inclined to play it over enzamas
what is this ..
help i ddint know there were tbese support things jn shinysong
kashii moimi <:pou:1175037018305200249>
real
i cant remmebe rev 😭😭😭

THEYRE SO SILLY
luca's ugly little thing is from csp and shinysong had a collab and they showed the drawings each cometik member made 😭😭
<:caught:1175079388874805351> i wish they wohld add madoka and haruki to standard because its so boring pulling when theres only leader 3*
coming out soon
yayy madoka solo
they made this cool art and everyone got all these cool outfits but hana and haruki only had their normal unit ones 😭😭😭
im waiting for hana <a:HanaLoadingSFP:1174370274997702666>

i love enzamas but i think i'll play sop more now, rhythm game addiction <:a_ichikayay:1134978348196577362>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> cough cough miku
im happy sop came out rhythm game good <:peepoBlush:889033560147759154>
the models are actually so good tho <:lukascrunkle:1120635631173898240> like theyre so accurate to the illustration whereas prsk has gorjus card and model looks like  coloured shit especially lim hair
<:An_stressed:1159905935360278658> i wish they'd go away
the fraction  of the sekai community with a brain has beef with them <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> bro has not got a single good take
thhis guy is a clown
oh yeah it will be on standard
also chib
not sure if there is a trained version but this is definitely ssr
ok i went digging
<:pou:1173131233270702191> i didnt check tho i'll see later..  there better be one
i mean sakuya hana so many characters have one so i think everyone has one
i think so?!
wasnt lucky enough to get her ssr
<:EmuKiraKira:1162811244366024724> hopefully the new cards get uploaded online soon
pretty
im not sure how everything works tho
stars are for costumes, r/sr/ssr are for cards
<:Prayge:889023390667669544> i rerolled for 3* toru and 2* hana
mano, kogane, kaho, asahi, amana (or tenka i forgot), toru, nichika and luca
oh but in the starting gacha you can infinite reroll but ssr is only available for

it means the same as hidden taste is a spoonful of humor but makes so much more sense <a:suffering:989965077799141386>
oh someone told me it means secret ingredient is a bit of humor
for context it's the name of an event, it's about yae niizuma who received a dai star certificate but she's worrying that all her achievements are separating her from her friends, the rest of her theatre group
tet can you tell what this means <:Mizuki_Peek:974636018219253810> google translate says Hidden taste is a spoonful of humor but idk what thats meant to mean
wait i'll take this to my channel <:pissbabycry:1134215120558497792>

i finish tutorial island
shit
on this game
the controls
but idk if i can safely remove it or if my computer will break
is. an issue.
which i presume
and the examples i saw on the internet only had 2
for some reason i have like 2849832 of these things
this is so hard to figure out, i don't wanna kill my laptop but idk what's even credible on the internet
<:EmuDed:826303784954101770>
i think you're asleep no wbut
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
i'll check once i'm back cause laptop will be cooler
sorry i need to eat now aaa
<a:menheraNod:809322720319504384> i also ran cleaner program to clean file
<:EmuDed:826303784954101770>
i ran antivirus and didnt find anything too
<:kana_melt:1054226813817196605>
<a:menheraNod:809322720319504384> if so why is it using half the memory just to run the laptop <a:menheraBall:809322724383129628>
not all of it <:HMM:966625453194485760> i think it was 50 ish but idk if that's normal <a:SakiFall:980271452899131522>
8gb
the memory usage was a lot but i didnt find anything in particular ?? it was just a lot of windows stuff
yeah i did <:slacc:963350438940397588>  it spikes to like 90+ cpu usage when i first open it but i caught a screenshot and it was  task manager <:kana_melt:1054226813817196605>
anything on it
it just started getting really hot just doing
i dont remember doing anything to it
before updating drivers
<:cryge:966624721611403294> yeaaaa
even just opening discord makes it really warm
so bad
but recently it's just been
i know it gets warm
like
whenever i charge it gets really hot
just restarted it
yeah
<:hinaLUL:710980546179629157> i turn it off
fan is going insane
never mind
shit
okay <:peepoblush:1065286549077499945> thank you keilo  laptop has survived
<:Kohane_Scared:907705769753972797> it randomly opened some command window
<a:NOTED:1002644793706422282>
okay <:Prayge:816798018824830977>
oh
<:uglycry:1048914795379834900>
it just went black and then zoomed out and then in and then normal
Umm
WHY IS MY COMPUTER SPASMING
lmao
yea idk
workign computers is hard
dead on the floor
<:uglycry:1048914795379834900>
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
thats what the website said
i hope
and then better graphics
but i think because the processor is recent enough it won't break anything
what i'm downloading is the generic uncustomised one
the computer manufacturer makes customisation to drivers for specific thing on their products
from what i understand
ohh ok
idk how computer work
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
yeah
<a:SakiFall:980271452899131522>
it said that it may remove some customisation or something but my processor is past 6th gen so it should remain intact idk
downloading new graphics thing
im
ok
okay
oh yay
it'lll be fine right <:kana_melt:1054226813817196605>
<:25ji_mafuyu_stare:984092876369707058> um.

we used to sell adopts and do art contests and so much together but now its like we run into each other coincidentally through a server or insta and barely recognise each other
:(
i miss deviantart a lot actually but ever since some other company bought it and changed the layour and everything most of my friends have moved to insta/twt/disappeared
my early internet days were spent in a discord server with a guy who never stopped ritasipping me <:RitaSip:611635491980312583> and deviantart
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
<:life:1001518241610485781> me except i was reading harry potter so i was not having a good time but also i didnt have any other book
i wasnt allowed to be anything other than normal at home because if i cried or laughed or whatever they would question me <:life:1036911609345490995> but i also had to repress that everywhere else too ?
i did kind aboth

i think you can maybe?
we had one mass shooting a while ago and the government went ok guys do you wanna get rid of guns? and the whole of australia voted yes so now theres none without licenses
with things you can shoot
<:kekhands:993361107878170655> australia is really strict
guns in general arent legal without a license
its illegal here tho
ah i want it
HEHEHE
some peopem  dont ask first
<:lukascrunkle:1120635631173898240>
i thij i dont really care about the hole i just wwnt no period and no babies so uterus is like the only problem right
<:buh:1170489149703335966> hm
<:pojjies:1113554080485363832>
another issue i have with uterus is i am very scared of an unauthorised weewee entering <:pissbabycry:1134215120558497792> or any sort of weewee  actually i dont want to make babies <:kekhands:993361107878170655>
how <:Binoculars:916861035762319371>
hihii chrom
<a:1wave:1143977908105388052>
there was one where a family called an ambulance because at an athletics event their kid got a stitch
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
but usually its just a blocked nosr or a stomachache
thne like yeah theyre screwed
they cant deny an ambulance bc if it does turn out to be serious
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>
yeah
i read book from a paramedic
they cant
brcause he had a blocked nose
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246> i read about some guy who called an ambulance saying he couldnt breathe
because the free healthcare stuff means like ambulances can be called with no cost  for people with pension cards and whagevers
i feel bad  for paramedics
anything not covered by it is expensive
we bave free hwalthcare here but
<:An_stressed:1159905935360278658>

my friend thought you could donate your boobs after top surgery but i dony know how that works because they still have to put your nipples back on right <:buh:1170489149703335966> you just donate like a ball of fat and flesh? how do tehy reuse it
the only  boob surgery i  want is to get them cut off
boob surgery is  scary
<:kekhands:993361107878170655>

i just been wanting to sketch.. not in a shading mood
rahh i'll get around to finishing lilac
i think it was still ridiculous of rose's specialist to be like you not autistic enough but i think this is what they were reading off of
weird
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
huh
but thats how i interpreted it i actually dunno <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
your ranking on the general leaderboard will ofc be lower because it's everyone on the game compared to only your oshi leaderboard
then the general leaderbord would be like sumire t1 and then the other character t2 because it's a combined leaderboard of everyone so like
and idk some other character was 16.9k points
so like if sumire t1 was 17k points
but there's a general board with everyone
you choose any character and then you rank on the character board
i think its like
its weird
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432> oh well
idk anything <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> and glb wont be out for ages either
but
i wanna choose a favourite character
with how the sif2 ranking system thing works
scary
teehee
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
no i do have her birthday
wait
unfortunately tet saw through me she's the only one i don't have info on
i made a poll very long ago
frowns sadly
i forgot
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
so strangely parallel
i just realised that's my sister's birthday
JSSJSJJS
<@241051045864800259> is your birthday may 11..?
wait
first sif2 event is liella
oooh
so mine's only for the banner cards
i already maxed both my 3*s
yea
oh
unless you
same
what calculations werr you doing
hmm
lemme check mine
LOL
once they change gen and pro room to same drops it'll be harder to farm one or the other
go to gen if you need charms
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
anything else
i mean bandori similar concept
i dunno how to tier anywhere except proseka
ye if i learn how to
you can t1k gachaless too
you don't need to do anything plant or deco or max cards as soon as you get them then
hmm
if you're not going high you don't need to do any of this <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
because
how high do you want to go
so ig it's like
cgo will be popular tho
7 hour end dash
ok barely played like 3-5 hours every day
i had 210 bonus and only mafu deco maxed and barely played
my t300 run
even like
if you're going like t1k it doesn't matter at all <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
i mean depends how high you're going
like minimum <:FelisDerpy:1047083097264500777>
you need to get all character decos to 10
should be fine
i guess if you do spend nats and manage to collect everything then yea
eh
wh
i mean
no
i think
anyway
i dropped maigo technically but i think i'll just see how my schedule is
not enough for a difference i would just choose xtals for weekly lol
even with that small amount + if you chose seeds for day 7 cl
and seeds are hard because unless you get lucky with drops your income is like close to nothing every day
auto isn't gonna give you anything
should spend nats more
let me see
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
crying
helpp
i picked up enstars way easier than this LMAO
i can't fc normal
i am bad at this game
YEAAAA

yeaaaa
they did in genshit for some events
genshit

unfortunately  i made some bad decisions and already cut thr spicy one <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
ouch

wtf <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
organ prolapse?????
i will google <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yummy <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
definitely permanent <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> that's like uterus removal right
sorry off topic but i'm feeling instant noodles <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> should i eat the  one i'll need 4 cups of water for or the one i used to eat when i was a kid
would be nice if there was a more permanent removal <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> life sucks
oh <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
how often must you take the pills
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> sometimes mine is so light it just straight up disappears after 2 days 

but i still have back pain 
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> <:FelisGrass:1047083038179344454> help
we're not gonna go around look at other people's pads to see how heavy theirs is in comparison <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> you only have yours to judge
cause like
yeah it's also hard to judge <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i've always had lighter periods  but it is not light on the back pain
isn't it just heavy flow? some people have heavier some are lighter <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> what's that
i subtly implied to my mother that i want to remove my periods but she ignored my implication
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> monka
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> go faster
instead of slowly leaking  it out over a week like
you could just shit out all the lining when you went to the bathroom
wouldn't it be nice if like
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i hate  periods and parents and school and existing
but no <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> because attendance matters more than health <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i didn't do anything in classes  i just sat there  because my back hurt so much i couldn't
i begged my parents  so much to let me go home from school
<:FelisGrass:1047083038179344454>
just a few days <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
is gonna be ok
mine just ended
me too
icic
yea not vibing with it
i love pinocchio stuff but
<a:aworryHeadbang:499600447015747584>
<:kanacasual:1054948855604580362> cause i'm aggressive when provoked whereas solis is just aggressive 24/7
that's not how it works <:chigiridead:1060838465404686362>
it's like having a naughty little sibling and the moment you say something out of line you start getting called your sibling's name
<:penseyes:982065674761424948> it's  just so wrong??? to imply solis is just me but aggressive
but the moment i'm slightly aggressive i'm suddenly a different person
if it was someone else he wouldn't refer to them as some random name
<:penseyes:982065674761424948> <:penseyes:982065674761424948> <:penseyes:982065674761424948> <:penseyes:982065674761424948> <:penseyes:982065674761424948> <:penseyes:982065674761424948> <:penseyes:982065674761424948> <:penseyes:982065674761424948>

SHE'S  SHIPPING CHERRY WITH A YELLOW HOLEY MOUSE MADE OF CHEESE TEXTURE
there's this ugly purple frog in my town and her name is gigi (she's so bitchy and i tried to get her to move out but when i told her to she was like I thought we were friends I think I'm gonna stay until we are 🤓 ) 
and she just told me isnt chadder and cherry such a cute couple
this is a crime
omg
HEHEE
she says she's on an orange craze rn and she asked everyone she knew for some
i gave her an orange and she was like ?! this is so good!! i gotta give you somethin nice in return or else the world will be uneven!!
cherry is so cute .. We all still get silly when it snows! What what! hehehe she loves saying what what
im not sure what it means but i think you're usually right
i agree
easy
then i fill it out and the answer is there
and she formulates a survey for me
i ask a dear friend
i find it hard to form conclusions about myself and it is much easier when people do it for me
what i am
uhhh i dont know
i had a brainfart and coloured the ones i was instead of the ones i wasny
thansk cherry!!
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

AHHH
<a:VCat_nod:977797719915634778> following the rules
<:KohaneGaze:1086148589425795113> if you have any  prsk questions leave it in my channel and i can answer
its easyto tell which is which if you goigle it or look at the trained version
no but like
like your darkfes rui is a lim because his hair is different but your flower mafuyu is perm because her hair is the same
permanent is the rest
lims are every three events at the start of the month and have cheerful carnival
limited cards have different hairstyle in the trained version
if youre f2p you learn to skip everything permanent and only pull lims <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
also yeah rui focus is next evebt
second row fourth banner is the one you want
everything upcoming
ourple

<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:hmm:1012492971884695592>
colourless.. how can something be colourless when we have given a name to everything <:Terichew:973794176015675392>
but then what is it
<:life:1001518241610485781> she didn't have an answer
one time i asked my teacher 'if we see colour because light splits into certain colours then if the light didn't split into that colour what colour is the object actually'
i like colour

so skilled.. hand go swoosh all the notes tapped and its like whaaaaaat
im watching chunithm videos and
oohhhh we should do black white grey feelings
red
i feel like playing fujiko in the mkg (citrine knows dhksdnn) like. <:slacc:963350438940397588> she's discovering people who aren't as tied up and proper as she is and before she would just. push them away and continue on with her rigid way of life, but now she's more curious and is less sharp about it 

<:slacc:963350438940397588> is nice. i'm the same.
i like that ambiguity
sometimes sour sometimes sweet
hm.. <:hmm:1012492971884695592>
yeah
sour <:cat_eee:1018349140863877182>
spicy.. <:Terichew:973794176015675392> numbs everything and replaces it with just burning 
is nice
red is spice
i think pink is the tastiest but i think red is also yummy vibes
pink is like a blanket on winter night, you didn't know you needed it until it was there, but you know how it feels so you cant let go
pink isn't sharp pink is just flufffy
heheheh pink is so soft
if its cool pink its the same as orange.. be pink or be purple you dont get to be in the middle !!!
pink is good if its warm
purple is ice cream
blue feels like drowning, submerged where every worry every regret everything just melts away
blue is nice !!! blue is sharp blue is soft blue is water
like it's clinging to the edge of life <:Terichew:973794176015675392> almost dead but not quite.. just greeeen
green
just
i like desaturated green it's kinda grey but it's still green its not soft but it's not sharp either
i like green.. because
no angry no angry ok uhh green whay else is green
green reminds me of diavoros that asshole scared of grass for some reason
history is brown.. like shit brown cause history  shit subject <:Terichew:973794176015675392>
hehehe
yellow i dont like cool yellow i like the warm cheese yellow where you look at it and it just envelops your brain.. everything slows down and it's nothing but warm.. warm yellow <:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
orange is.. sour when i think of orange i shiver.. i don't really like orange it feels too orange it's just a mix between red and yellow like.. choose one please
orange
oh no <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
red reminds me of cherry juice
red.. red reminds me of blood and how it drips down your fingers like little rivers of numb pain <:Terichew:973794176015675392>
<:yippee:1002596802656223274>
