It would be fucking unfair, i want an elysia lvl animation for seele, this one wasnt enough <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:life:1001518241610485781>

<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Idk what am i even waiting for, all the stuff i need is new
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<@180679257851166721> is there any new stuff in forge and exchange shop in V3?
Mpe things
Now unless my luck is in the underground i should be able to get at least 3/4 prometheus and then save for her skin
MY MOMENT HAS ARRIVED
OMG

AE??
Next should be elysia stigs and her bow right, unless is filler again
I read it like once
Im prolly wrong tbh
I think it was sand, snow and salt or smth <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
What <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
What is GC
I also want a new phys dps but gresh told me not to go for hare
K then, cuz prometheus is gonna leave me broke
Or i can just keep using pardo
But for like a lot,
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Fuck

<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
So kira is a support right?
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
But without effects

<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
No way
<@416445660443967491> is this confirmed?
The HoFin skin is looking with intentions of leaving me broke
<:huh:966619839307321394>
In honkai impact 3th?
A healer?
Wtf
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

Yeah my sushang still without her stigs
Im using my pardo until i get tired of her, you aint making me use kira <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Those  bke stamps are looking tempting

Sexo?
Nothing else?
Wait V2 only had nerfs and buffs?
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

Ive seen like at least 2 people in Twitter get it
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>

I thought it was bronya <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
And im still blocked smh <:deadge:975652771082698782>
For someone with only 2 stars dudu

<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
Well all i know is that i finally have one patch where the new valk wont make me pull for her gear
Dps right
So is she a dps or supp cuz i havent read her stuff
Are we talking about sushanna?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
But has like 5 stamps ready for her
I think eli is missing 2 stigs too
Or the 2 verne pieces for my nonexisten nyx
Fucking fischl weapon just for the collection
Wait if 6.6 is new crystallum wtf do i buy with this one
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>

Fuck kosma

The fourth one would have been good for halloween
I like the one we got <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>

Mine said the same
Im looking at you
<:peepojama:1065041007911108668>
Maybe i can get the elf
Mmhh
When would the spending event end for glb?
You are not changing my mind carv
<:life:1001518241610485781>
I came to the conclusion sus is only on M cuz she is one of the S rank valks and the 3 being there meant that kiana finally got to their lvl
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
When is that
Should i delete it
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Oh i thought they were in beta already
<@483689649727078400>
Always, she is our sleeping paralysis demon
I knew aslaug was gonna work for something
<:Um_actually:1008018476859932742>
She got snatched a head of height
With goemon in exchange shop, shui should be next right <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Idk how much time has passed in game so i just remember their ages at the start <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Lmao
She is fucking 17 or smth
Why they want her to act has a depressed 30 year old
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Its just a piece of cloth
But tbh i dont like her skirt either
I thought heki said it has a joke

LMAO
I only love eden enough to craft handel, but not enough to actually use her
The opposite of hack cuz every time they send ss of their acc they have 100 crystals max
Me, im gacha addicts
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>  hack
Yeah the train teleports im in your direction
Are you gonna pull for 7tr?
Failed
And i did like 13 pulls in AI supply for her weapon
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Well i did pull for Sus, but with terrible luck
Fogetting 2 abysses and one ER its like a gunshot
70 i think
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
And i have 60
I also have that
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
But i only have like 60 pulls
Ngl HoTr is tempting me
You would have to save the boxes until 6.4 to not get dupes right
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
There is a metro in the capital of my country, and im sure some day i will have to constantly use it <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

Char
I already forgot his name
I remember when we lost the first degen
Carv sent him to jail
I think we know why bruh hasnt been here for so long
<:life:1001518241610485781>
Did you take care of the people you were gonna take care of carv?
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
Or smth else
But then they left cuz of kiana?
<:life:1001518241610485781>
Why do we expect anything from them
CN base made the bunny event get cancelled for a server that wasnt even theirs
Including yourself
I didnt like kiana's design a lot but damn i didnt expect them to dislike it this much
Give them time and they might <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
69 <:Um_actually:1008018476859932742>

Finally genshin collab part 2 <:Um_actually:1008018476859932742>
Carv do you have hare in your predictions or is she a Sushang case where it takes like 8 patches for her to get a banner <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:FelisGun:1047083413934460970>
Never forgiving them for not giving us HoDeath seele
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
And haré?
Yeah i suposse, but i dont think is gonna change much
I expected more from her ending pose <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Who are you
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Im gonna be honest, ive been thinking you were neko the entire day cuz they are only ones i remember had an invisible name
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
But i have time runner so i wont use it if i got it
Yeah HoF looks good too
My favourites colors are red and blue and there is always a constant fight on wich one i prefer, this time is red <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>

I completely forgot carole is getting a skin in 6.3
Lmao
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Stun finally becoming meta
What if Hare is the next phys dps, to keep it in the family
If it wasnt for the op pardo she would have lived even longer
She lived a lot longer that one would expect
Im coping with BKE <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Wow almost 10 patches
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
Actually, when was the last phys dps
Phys support trust
My HoH luck aint repeating any time soon
Same, i know damn well that with 20k crystals i wont get her and if i do i wont get full gear and i dont like that idea
Tbh i also want to test my luck with a ten pull, just to force myself to pull for her gear
Tbh i really should pull for her but i prefer to save for kiana and mei gear, ive spent so much time without a general support that im used to it (delusional)
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<@483689649727078400> we were blocked for skipping bronya, mihoyo employee behaviour
LMAO
<:Um_actually:1008018476859932742>
Inukai is the second type
Inukai trying to convince us to pull for Htr, knowing damn well we are stupid enough to ignore him and skip her
Another biblically accurate img enemy  <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
<:FelisGun:1047083413934460970>
I wanted ely
But
I should be happy about that cuz i get to save
I dont like kiana's skin very much
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Damn i wanted Sus spending
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Well that was carv's job
Alright alright, at least is above the piss skin
This new FR skin is the only one i like from her <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
He is freezing
<:FelisGun:1047083413934460970>
<:Dead:998259390605971496>
Its cuz its cny themed, But for some reason they decided to release it one patch later
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Oh it was 6.5, im depressed again
My copium continues to be real
<:yaeseggs:968550030061486140>
I TOLD YOU
So im gonna ignore her
Even if i get her i would get like one or 2 stigs max with nothing left fpr cny
And i dont have enough savings for htr
I want kiana <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
(Someone end my suffering)
<:Um_actually:1008018476859932742>
Yeah and i have phoenix who obv can do her job
But not soon
Im gonna get her at some point ig
Yeah me too
If i have enough crystals
Im probably gonna pull for kiana anyway
Kiana is too simple for me
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

> 上调了SP角色碎片的每周限购次数，由30调整至50。
SP valkyries buy limit increased from 30 to 50
Basically newbies can have pris but only to 50
Pri-arms level limit is adjusted to level 50, level 50 captains can craft pri arms after patch drops
When captain gets to level 81, you can further upgrade it to level 65
Captains below level 81 cannot upgrade them, it can only be level 50
> 6.2版本更新后，锻造超限武器的等级限制将下调至50级，助力舰长对抗崩坏！50级及以上的舰长均可锻造超限武器。待舰长开启等级突破并升至81级后，还可提升超限武器等级上限，武器最高可升级至65级，战斗能力将大幅提升！

Are those words gendered keilo? You might get banned
LMAO YES how can you look at that and actually think is better than the original design
I dont think so, considering i see like 10 edits of tanned charas being darker when they are released

So far mihoyo has followed the rumour of them making desert charas tanned and jungle white
In her HoS era
I wonder if the mobius SpA skin are to foreshadow jackal <:terium:973796767793569802>

A rare sight
Carv on copium
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
When they remember it exists
Yeah like handel was for goemon
Even if they are someone's signature
Yeah but like G4 are like made for a big range of valks
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Wouldnt that be too focused in one character for a G4 stig
Maybe one and a half
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
2 weeks
But what are those little balls in the milk <:life:1001518241610485781>

Eden skin was confirmed bchips ?
I would also remove the veil cuz i feel like it doesnt go with the theme
<:terium:973796767793569802>
Finally

<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
6.0 is making me so mad, first that horrible snek skin and now PE pyramid
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

Tell that to mihoyo
HB replacement?
Someone here said it earlier
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
We still dont know what she does right?, the AE HOH sushang teams was just a troll right?
But is she now
Yeah just get lucky in dorm supply duh
Arc city was my only info source
Back then i was only in wfp
Yeah but this much <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
That i remember
They didnt do this with HoF
Why are people going so hard with their herrscher is bait with ely
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
It didnt specify the DK part but it said something about a new HoR weap
It was in the files i think
Lmao poor Vii
So thats 5 and i have 95 pity wich means i only need 25.2k <:Bedge:990510746238611527>

Thx for the carry <:kleeHeart:997543436456558623>

<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
The old people i know
And my aunts
My mom did
I dont use it
Yeah that too
Means you have to be grateful with gifted stuff and not complain
You dont look at the teeth of the gifted horse or something like that
Similar to what you said

No
N9

It will break my heart and wallet having to spend all my crystals in a mini spending instead of the big one
From summer event side B
Yeah fu hua is free
Or bchips if it effects

Just like ohh summer
Cerulean and Dea skin werent very far from each other
Before it used to be like 3 more or less
Yeah but since then they took like 7 patches to release another one
I dont remember
Wasnt time runner 5.3
Mihoyo takes like half a year at least between new pyramid skins
Yeah
Aponia's skin does have different color arms though
<:PepeSmile:966629532943650836>
So eden skin too?
I thought it was only fu hua skin
Ohh
Wait is that a leak?

Im already ahead on that
80% of the honkai playerbase becomes whales after this
Or else
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
We could never
The man who used to tell me it was impossible to have 2 spendings in a row
<@370438895965306882>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
And now
We used to have spendings every two patches
<:wokege:966623232918712331>

They love making psy herrschers
Pls let ely be a op ice dps
Told you she was psy
Im glad im not an artist cuz her design would be hell to draw
<:huh:966619839307321394>
People are forgetting her
She has been off the main story too long
Im a gacha player
You think i give attention to those details
Shush
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
I said awakened so she cant be nothing else if she is
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
She awakened psy
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Ely died bcuz of her ego
The only reason to cope is apho monsters
Like himeko lost alive in imaginary space copium?
Wait i thought we didnt know what happended to the real griseo
YOU EVIL BEING
I hate mihoyo for this
Wich word
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
Fetus klein?
Not the child
NO
Ehat is that
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
But mihoyo isnt one to hide a lot of skin
A real knight armor for PE would be cool
Vii could be bchips
Unless it has effects i see it has a free one
Its very simple
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
And taking like 6 patches to get a skin
PE and SpA having the same fate mobius had
Istg if pardo gets another one
Halloween skins <:terium:973796767793569802>
6.1 falls in halloween?

<:HMM:966625453194485760>

That makes sense
Lets hope he doesnt lose his few neurons
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Wait i havent seen heki in all day
Now i think about it, if pardo has another spending skin it would really show her nature of owning a shop and wanting people to spend all their money   <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
She just got an spending one so it would be weird if it was
Bchips or spending if there is one
LEETTSSSS FUCKING GOOOOI
Yeah i meant datamined when the update is live

HoF had fischl and nyx before
I have a small brain carv i didnt think of that <:naruge:964203717278715994>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
what if it is the mobius skin
If herrscher is in 6.1 <:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
But what about herrscher spending <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
But
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
How much till beta?
How many hours tell beta?
The ER mods will change again in 5.8?
IDK <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>

Imagine is in the fourth <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
7T third week <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Idk it was some kind of event with mei or someone else i forgot <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
I dreamed of no herrscher in 5.9  <:deadge:975652771082698782>
If he doesnt get HoS next patch im never gonna stop bullying him
<:PepeSmile:966629532943650836>
Tell that to someone that does MA  <:HMM:966625453194485760>
My bke will finally have a use
I hate my collector ass
Knowing my luck they will probably add some 20k asterite stig that i dont have <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I can finally rest from saving 30k asterite for skin <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Thanks carl
Gotta have everything
We know keilo was gonna pull for her either way
It was delayed <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Beta is ready to downland
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
The fact it looks like a nun but then you see how little clothes she actually has is very <:sussge:968897150249484389>
Watch her use something like that
<:huh:966619839307321394>
What would be a summer skin for aponia though, she doesnt leave much space for imagination with her casual clothes <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Let me cope
AE? <:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
NOOO DONT SAY THAT <:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294>

PFFFFTTT
Show your crystals <:sussge:968897150249484389>
Or maybe a boss <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Thats what i said <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
And whats the difference with the one we have now <:HMM:966625453194485760>
New returnee event?
Like when we used griseo in this chapter
Maybe is a history related thing instead of playable vii
Oh oh
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
No forge stig
Mmhh yeah i cant read chinese <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>

BP reveal
<:SeeleSegs:966624134756970517>
I got her one day after she was included in dorm supply
I had SN a life saver
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Cuz it asked to not receive certain amount of damage
Im ashamed to say i couldnt get 3 stars in one of the stages where you fight the plane
Her claymore was so slow <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
The chapters where you use himeko where horrible for me
But they only reduced the chapters
Snow
Would be interesting to see some remaster of the snow location, i doubt it though
I wonder if its Just gonna be those first 6 chapters
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
What about crystals
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:sussge:968897150249484389>  let me doubt that
Bonk
<:concern:966623298639261746>

Just when i thought my phys team was good for now
WHAT
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Uhh what ult
<:concern:966623298639261746>
I dont want to pull for her but she seems good
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
They give her AF and if it takes you more than 15 seconds to kill her she throws her ult at you and is an insta kill
So HoR is free or what
Wait
These newbies get more stuff every time
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Yeah they are fowl for that
I mean you have to farm her core for her to be good
Or is that too good <:HMM:966625453194485760>
I feel like MC would be a better option to give for free to newbies
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:yaeseggs:968550030061486140>
That mei skin is
I fell to my knees

Amusement park?
My friend said the same <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>

I would ping carv but he said no ping
Herrscher  is 100% 5.9?
What is that
<:Lmao:966624069363597362>
We are manifesting
I like raven but if griseo is an off field ignite support like HB raven doesnt stand a chance
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>

UHHHH
He just eats honkai beasts for his 3 daily meals

Wow
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Ik they are both alive is just them finally spliting is emotional <:cryge:966624721611403294>

Its only gonna happen in life or death situations <:Um_actually:1008018476859932742>
She grew up but in apho she still sounds like a 12 years old <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
She is finally the ultimate bird
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>  i have been decimated
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>

Dont you remember when she killed HoDom with the help of her dad
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
LMAO i missed that part what, AINT NO WAY YOU THINK THAT WAS HER MAIN ARK
Like i do agree there was a lot of info in these chapters but i dont see why they would need more chapters  to explain them, do they want them explained with pears and apples
Found it
Idk it was a stupid Twitter take, im gonna try to find it but i saw it like 3 days ago <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Idk lmao
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
And that kiana's reunion with siegfried could have been a whole 3 chapters ark
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
I saw someone on Twitter saying they rushed the ending of part 1 to match with the release of Hsr
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Oh i thought they were in 2018 already
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
You are leaving me alone with heki and diavoros
And if she loses the core would the cáncer comeback
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
There isnt even leaks anymore

Dw they are obv fusions so they are 2 valks in one
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
I thought she was that big
And kiana has the gem of serenity so thats a plus
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Well maybe i did but this one screams HoD a lot more
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
I didnt
Playable Wendy <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>

<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
Last part of ch 31, cn ani live and beta V3
Is that the lore of her weapon?
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
Do you understand now tet?
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
We all know who im talking about theres no need
And looks like bronya
Phometheus is the IA created by DR mei
<:life:1001518241610485781>
But how does that help defeat the honkai
<:huh:966619839307321394>
?
So that would kill everyone with low honkai resistance
And what is project stigma supossed to do cuz i didnt understand that part
violent smh
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Then tell me the truth instead of slapping me
Did she saw it like the only solution but didnt want to tell the orhers cuz they were gonna argue against it?
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
I need an explanation to why did DR MEI only wanted stigma to succeed
Wdym we obv saw dudu and mei fight like in the trailer last time
Yeah duh
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
So the chapter is out already?
thats so pretty
GOD
I thought it was gonna release in friday
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
For what
I forgot about bingo, yeah she could be
Yeah thats why i was wondering if aponia's or eden's could be in spending of 6.1
Or too simple for that
You think any of them could be spending skin?
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Thats worse
Oh
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
But didnt they do it cuz of aponia's discipline?
I understand why they did it but i still think they are pieces of shit
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
Im people
Thx baban
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I havent seen it
Where link
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Did they release the 6.0 trailer yet?
<@218762069338619906> can you answer this lore máster <:wokege:966623232918712331>
Or at least a ultimate version of seele
I wont forgive them if they dont give me HoD seele
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
Wait in the epilogue they said that HoE is the next herrscher cuz the 12th was killed and the 13 was a lie but even if otto does count has binding what aboit HoDeath
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
Yes
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
But i only saw images
Wait wasnt part 2 of the chapter was released today?
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
There is ypur answer
And none of them were good people, the original made sure of that, though it was more like people with a lot of hatred inside than literal bad people
Yeah
And i suposse HoDom was a bad person already so even if it did beat it did not use their power for good, i cant remember if we knew how they were
Carv just said that it only works if you can beat WoH's influence
We still dont know why or how she was born right?
WoH its Just too powerful ig
Well this answers why any PE hershey could beat WoH's influence then
Ana could never
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I get what she did, but i dont get how she did it <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
Its too late
Stop with the mech coping baban
I need it
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
I feel like the music of the cinematic will be one of the bests
Wait is that the trailer?
<:huh:966619839307321394>
KEVIN?
Unless it wasnt an illusion
Uh i think you are right
And the fixed it
The statue was brocken
Or am i confusing them
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
Or are they just lazy to make the original one
But isnt that the new statue that sent built
I cant keep surviving with just random events
Pls i beg
Pls be a sign of senti coming back
When is the second part of the new chapter
I have never heard of that, just thta some universes dont have honkai
How old was kallen when she <:deadge:975652771082698782>
But i would say beetween early 30s to late 20s
I dont think we know their ages
20 i think
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Why is that sus bruh
It corrupted her
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>

HoB believers got clowned
Poor rin
<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
Everything is better than what PE did
So they helped WS?

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Time gated events are both a blessing and a curse
Havent put too much attention on that
And maybe too many events are on phase one instead of two idk
So many people just rush it in the first few days
I feel like thats bcuz their main event is not time gated
<:Um_actually:1008018476859932742>
So im saving my resin for tomorrow
<@416445660443967491> so i got reminded in 1.5 one of the new balls and rope are a supp set

to this day it doesnt make any sense how a mom would love more a random man than her own child, and be okay with him killing her to the point of being the accomplice

<:sitstarege:1040586023740125244>
So luocha goes with daniel
Im trying to organize my teams in my head
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Should i just throw whatever i get to fu xuan
I like him a lot ngl but u wont decide until i get ability leaks
Soulmates/j

but
i actually do use pela
yeah i remember what heki said about a debuffer on the team but i dont have a single decent one
<:peepositfishing:1109291486102691840>

<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>

Maincord really is a circus
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>

Perfect
Im not replacing luocha or bronya for pela
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>

let me check my seele artis
hold on
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
ill take it
the probability of all going to crit rate are like less that 0.0001%
luocha saves my ass every time
idk about that he still carries me
hilarious
should i give him speed or atk boots
wich are mostly mid
and thats not counting my supports
i have my hands full
and both are still in the works
and before that seele
i was busy farming for blade
im throwing myself from a bridge brb
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
still better than the one he has, maybe
3 of these things and not a single one has gone to crit dmg
im gonna kms
<@781539392039682058> <:sitstarege:1040586023740125244>
i think its only gonna give 4

if himeko appears again idk what will i do
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
in standard i think im at 55
idc about skill points
IL works so well with her
<@447218009749061632> your bronya is amazing
himeko being my most resilient hater
if it wasnt for luocha i wouldnt have made it
<@309634550273933314> what is the site you guys use to track pulls
mf barely has 60 of crt dmg
i used baban's bronya has supp and he completely destroyed phantylia
<:huh:966619839307321394>
like
im literally
sorry seele
wow
he has the worst fucking stuff
How tf is he so strong
so i just tried my IL
i dont have enough simulated universe currency for the fall of an aeon LC so this will have to do
honestly i might pull in her banner too, i have no reason to retain my gambling addiction now
<:bejjwithme:1067071883125735446>
those chains
but he looks so good in it
im not interested in jingliu or topaz anyway
i have no hope to get his LC but im still pulling for it in case i luccsack
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
thx heki
also is this LC good for IL?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

75
i actually dont know, but i use genshin soft pity to guide me
how much crystals do you get in the event?
you are seeing me in the news
to someone that isnt bronya
if i lose 50 50
15 more pulls and i get to soft pity
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
you have to kill it either way
i tried
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
idk if it changes something
they are making me decide wether to kill it or let it escape
Yeah urine is like all waste substance that were in the blood
Watersports?
How is that fetish called
Careful he may be into it
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Tet misinformating me
Like filtered blood
Ik piss is blood
I cant tell if this is a joke or true
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Sweat is blood?!
Maybe it smells like sea water
You always have been heki
Fr fr
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
When its women it makes me uncomfortable but when its danheng
That is good
Yes
Pretty privilege gacha maybe, but thats too long
<:sitstarege:1040586023740125244>
Lmao
Ohh
Fetish? <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
He is hot that is more than enough for me
Im too far apart from meta players
I just saw people thirsting for him
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Is that serious or?
I havent hit pity yet <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
I wouldnt survive it
Same
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Its either in 2 hours or like 7
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Maybe today in like 14 hours
still finishing seele and blade lmao
i havent even farmed for him
Looks so good
Jingliu
But
Team wise i need fu xuan
If i dont get IL idk what to do with my pulls
Your blade is built different nini
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
Oh if there is flashbacks to them it might actually be my end
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
If they make an animated short of danheng and blade im combusting
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
That ending
time to farm
<@213811388546678794> look at this shit

<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
bladieee
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
My other charas are there to look hot
Thats what my seele is for
Gresham understands
See
Yes
Yeah
Cuz i like him <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Blade was unskippable for me
I skipped kafka
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
If i had a better second team i could have the crystals from the abyss
For the dragon
I barely had one banner to save
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
You have enough gresh
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
And mihoyo made almost all of them destruction
But i wanted the quintet
I need more supports tbh
Out of my pure hatred
And then myself
Gonna kill her
Im
Again
If i lose 50 50 to himeko
And
I though you said hime
<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
55
Counting reset and all my count should be, 10 + 5 +4 + 1 + 35
And myself for not being able to skip blade
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> i hate you
But she isnt my fave
Maybe fu xuan
If i dont get the dragon (im killing myself) idk who to save for
And seele
Cuz ik i won with luocha
Got clara
I lost in blade i think
Cmon danheng ik you want too
Havent gotten any promotional early
Pure faith
I have 5k and 5 tickets saved for IL
He needs to start learning to choose his fights
LMAO
60 yeah
but i aint doing it with the teams i have lmao
<:okk:1110244301184696360>
i unlocked finally
Actually dont tell me
Again
Wtf did that little shit do
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Ive sent things about my acc at least 5 times
You arent that lucky
I can see that 42 def
still no qua gold sphere <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
still need more rate and maybe atk but at least 2 of her artifacts are trash so
<:peepositfishing:1109291486102691840>
<@416445660443967491> she is getting better
NA still has 12 hrs to go
in Sea maybe
I would throw myself out of the window
was probably the best outcome cuz the lvl 12 buff went to life
this
alright
<:huh:966619839307321394>
what if everything goes to the last substat
now im scared to lvl it up
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
nice nice, i wont trash them now
mmhh, is it better for tingyun than the cowboy one?
does the other new artifact set work with someone?
my blade is hitting 2x what he did 2 days ago <:peepositfishing:1109291486102691840> , wich isnt much cuz he is doing 20k max but its progress
ive gotten every single boot but speed ones <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<@385655541248163840> how much crit rate and dmg do you think i need for blade
mmhh
i thought they were gender neutral, is there more to it? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
i need cdm and speed
im not even pulling for her though
i wonder what set will be good for fu xuan
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
STOP
this would be good if i was farming for supp seele smh
<:sitstarege:1040586023740125244>
999
Its fine i can still use alice's JY
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Hey no need to insult me <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>, im trying my blade now, he still trash but fun anyway
I think its cuz i used it too much, now i have to wait to use it again <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
Nooo i cant use nini's blade anymore <:cryge:966624721611403294>
 ik tiktok isnt the most reliable place for info but they took the info from in game so, ill check myself later the lore pieces
Yeah and it gets even crazier ive seen like 2 videos now where they say danheng isnt a reincarnation like he thinks he is, but just danfeng after he was forced to shed his skin
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
*years
danheng spent his first yeats in prison
Yep
There <@385655541248163840>
My cat scratch my hand <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Im gonna search hold on
I think it was lighcone
Or was it his lighcone
I thought the golden as the sun was from  IL danheng character story when jingyuan freed him from prison (spoiler for carv) <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
It was probably bcuz of her mara posession or smth idk
Yeah that part isnt confirmed lmao
I have the game in spanish
Actually it may be abreviating porcentaje de vida
But its life
I dont have a single idea of what is abreviating
Life
I do too dw, i fell into another doomed ship <:cryge:966624721611403294>
So yeah close friends
We actually, idk if its confirmed but, they do call each other beloved in some stuff
<@385655541248163840> your blade sphere has wind dmg or pv
Poor guy
<:life:1001518241610485781>
I just read blade's character stories
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>

E1 and LC <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>  cant compete
nini's blade is amazing
<:huh:966619839307321394>
but here i am
im supossed to do the same
blade is supossed to go with luocha right
<@385655541248163840>

Im so scared
Im 4 pulls away from pity
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
I think im starting to accept that i will have to skip kafka
She could pull blade for both of us and not flinch an eye
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
<@385655541248163840> i love you so much
fulanito lmao <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

For luocha would it be better plain atk or %atk has substat
<:life:1001518241610485781>
They are so close
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

How old are you cherry
LMAO

Chemistry is kicking my ass so bad
I wish lmao
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
I think im repeating chemistry
I have 2 tests today
I have to check
I think i do
Or mix it with seele's team
Yeah i might send yanqing with firemc healer and asta
Without a second healer i aint doing shit
So i can do a team around him but i havent started
I have yanqing
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Cuz i dont have 2 teams
But i need a healer
If i had bailu i would probably go for SW with no doubts
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
I dont have bailu
Ofc not
Pfftt
I mean luocha
Otto then
Ohh
What is moc
Yeah
Yeah but do you think i need a better healer or debuffer
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Should i pull SW or luocha
<@370438895965306882> question
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<@416445660443967491>
<@370438895965306882> now that i have tingyun should i replace asta or pela
abundance made me inmortal
<:okk:1110244301184696360>
i cleared SU 6 btw
for her
this one?
<@370438895965306882>
WOOOOOOO
I was thinking of giving my seele a  cdmg arti instead of crate but idk yet, i barely have 2 5 star ones so i cant be picky yet
But i forgot the passive already
I think heki had a danheng LC
Cuz i saw heki with like 160% dmg and 18% rate and it got me thinking <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
How much crit dmg is ideal for seele
Wich is not the best but is like my second 5 star arti so is smth
Like 17% crit dmg
Oh today i got quite a decent arti for my seele
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I like Hunt but i have skill issue and always end up dying
Im probably gonna try abundance for w6
I didnt try very hard, i was just collecting some missing signets for the collection rewards <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Lmao i tried to do the second diff in w3 and i barely cleared the first elite
Those abundance signets are fantastic
<:peepositfishing:1109291486102691840>
I completed SU 5
Also
Makes everything fucking easy
He is too good
<@370438895965306882> dont you dare take your jingyuan out of support
I want SW but i dont think i can resist
That follow up atk is just <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
Im starting to want jingyuan
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
And i got her twice
tell them i hate them
<@213811388546678794> <@416445660443967491> should i get any of those lightcones
Mmhh
Jingyuan is an aoe electro dps right, or smth like that
But idk if i actually want him
Ugh i want to pull for jingyuan only to get her tbh
I did play a mission that got me to an arena though, but it was short so i dont think that was the event <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
But i havent seen any announcement on it
The boulder one i have no idea
I want to know their lore so badly
Thats the other one
<@82358863155703808>
The android
The other girl if im not wrong is the one that you find in the luofu campaign
Of her has a kid
There is another one
The girl in her arms is her sister
Read her lightcones, she has 2
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Like 3 months ago
I also thought they were the same person
Yk what i cant blame you
Neko
Should i pull jingyuan (i dont remember how to write his name) or save for bronie or luocha
Question
But hey, at least i got to his last hp bar
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I tried to do it just before getting seele's LC and svarog kicked my ass
But tbh i mostly got it cuz its seele
Its a very good lightcone
<@416445660443967491>
YESSSSSSS
*against
It has some restrictions though, but agaisnt bosses looks good
I was thinking the sushang one maybe
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
And idk wich
But i dont have it yet so i want to lvl up a 4 star first
So the green 5 star from herta's shop is good for her right
<@416445660443967491> i need help choosing a lightcone for seele
The yukong one looked good for supp but idk
bless seele
Kk dont use the phone while driving
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<@213811388546678794> um i forgot how to change the path of the mc
Im Just being clueless
Hey i didnt do anything this time <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Yukong one looks good
Wich
Oh wait
I forgot to change
LMAO
Wich lightcone for firemc
I though the shield was only a story thing i havent used them after that lmao
What is the purpose of fire MC?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I would use tingyun but i donr have her
<@213811388546678794> so seele, nat, asta and ?
Wow
27 crit rate?
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<@213811388546678794> i got to 1500 atk
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
The 2 speed i needed
LOOK
<@416445660443967491>
But my ult would be stronger
The sushang one is good ig but i would need to only atk one enemy at a time
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
I did it like 5 times to at least get the 4 pc effect
Oh and wich relic is good for seele idk if the one i have on her is good
The artifact domain despises me
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
How good is 1377 atk for a lvl 50 seele
Kk
<@213811388546678794> wich artifact set
Every uni student ever
Fake advertisement
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Why are the lightcones with images of certain charas not good for those charas
Anyway
Rather not talk about it, uni is kicking my ass
Hi cherry, long time no see <:kianasmuggers:1092293793614667796>
Ignore the one she has
<@213811388546678794> wich lightcone for asta
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Im at fucking 118 speed, i cant seem to find those 2 more i need
Seele's lightcone is good right
I wont go down to that lvl
*luocha
Or luochq
Or  blade
I want kafka
I want her lightcone <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>  but it refuses to come home

Yeah she deserves better
And killing multiple enemies at once
Yeah she helps with fire shields
But i need mats for asta
I will though
Yeah ik but i cant let go of himeko, its emotional support
Tbh i usually go with double dps lmao
<@213811388546678794> is asta good with seele?
And natasha cuz i dont have more healers
Like seele is always in cuz she is my best dps
Yeah she is good, but im still in the point where idk who tf im supossed to use
Uhhh and that is...
Like makes them take more dmg
She debuffs enemies right
I use pela mostly
Mmhh <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Forgot about them
Oh right
Or at least less stupid
I thought people here were less addicted to gacha
NO WAY <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
You lucky mf
I dont know what speed is for so idk what asta does exactly
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

How the hell is canada
Wait if the US is that bad
That if it was a lot of other birds like seagulls would be dying too
Could be a disease, but ive asked some teachers and they say its not it
Aside from the wound in the second one they didnt seem to have any external thing that could have killed them
I doubt it would, not in a direct way at least, maybe there is something in their food, like its contaminated with some human residues
And that one was the worst
We visited 3 beaches last week
No, if i remember well it was just plástic, that beach in specific is full of trash
We dont know, a lot of sea birds are dying and no one has found the reason
Dont open if you dont like to see dead penguins
<:life:1001518241610485781>
We found 2 dead penguins in the beach last week
<:huh:966619839307321394>

<@416445660443967491>
Yeah <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>, i mean before it was only a theory but in the Last history mission you get to see the traveler from outside the earth and one of the mountains you see is one close to the capital of chile
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<@416445660443967491> did you know the traveler is in chile
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
And that time i had to travel to the fucking mountains
LMAO i havent seen snow in like 9 years now <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Unless is anni or cny
Yeah i doubt genshin gives enough to full pity per patch
I just cant stop myself
But then i have another one that just lost her dog, still traumatised cuz she then had to kill her best friend
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
She lost all her brothers and then she had to see her mother being killed in front of her
The last one is probably the most traumatised of them all
I kinda feel bad for them but anyway they have to suffer
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
You know i was thinking about some of the OCs ive created in my head and they all have the most traumatising backstories
That wasnt even a difficult math <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:wokege:966623232918712331>

Sometimes im concerned of the things you find heki
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Anyway i doubt he is intelligent enough to think of the implications of that, he just said it to make her feel bad cuz im ugly
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

And my brother used to joke his girlfriend and me looked alike

I used to play that one when i was a kid
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I leveled up like 30 lvls a day
Yeah that happened to me quite some times, like last season i completed the bp in 3 fucking days
I also play but not so often <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>, i mostly enter to complete the bp cuz i like to collect cosmetics
But at least they were nominated
I like the horizon games so much <:catblush:963351912235810826>, its a real shame that both games came out the same year with other giant videogames that sucked all the awards <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>

Instead of leaving it empty
Well if it doesnt get here at least i know i tried

<:life:1001518241610485781>
It doesnt let me submit
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
They say to write it in english so i suposse i had to specify those names
<@483689649727078400> do i leave it like this?
Should i leave it like this or turn it around
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326> <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
I think i wrote it the other way around
After the street is the house number?
I wanted to put the neighborhood and then the street
Neighborhood that was the word i think
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
Suburb?
Like the zone, how do you call it in english
How do i specify where my house is <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

I really want the book, but my brain cant comprehend what exactly to write
I mean is not a completely white sheet, it does have some specifics but when it asks for address details my brain goes blank <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Wait you didnt get the artbook?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Wiki how LMAO
I wish mihoyo was a little more specific in the thing you have to fill, instead of just leaving a white sheet and letting you do all the job <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>

Understandable
Only if the phys bronya its true though cuz i dont need other element
<@370438895965306882> should i save for  Ai chan or the rumored phys bronya
The only way i could get into nirv its if they decide to shill HoH mobi and maybe HoF

<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
Yeah her weapon and the useless M stig
<@370438895965306882> what do you think
Ik SuS replaces her but mine will be trash until i get her 2 stigs and get her to higher ranks, wich will probably take me months <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>

He just goes in a spiral of madness
Idk i did like it, it makes everything more tragic and gives his character  more complex kinda, than just being always a evil mf like it was in the book, maybe this is what made him be like he is there
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
The poor arrax was just a baby too
Like obviously both dragons would get out of control

i didnt remember this stig in cn 6.1 <:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
Unless greens die
Yeah i suposse its a good thing that they arent scared of killing people, but my heart wont be able to take it <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
You cant feel attached to anyone
They cant be more than 2 episodes without someone dying <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
The one thing i dont like about got amd hotd is that bad things never stop happening
<:life:1001518241610485781>
There was so much chemistry
I really thought alicent was rhae's love interest when i started the show
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
She would have flyied in dragonback eating cake with rae
SHE WAS SO CLOSE SHE HAD THEM ALL THERE IT WAS JUST ONE WORD <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Alicent marring viseris wouldnt have been nearly has bad if otto wasnt there whispering in her ear
Fucking otto ruined his whole family
I fucking wish criston and otto suffered
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
He is always following her like some kind of guardian Wolf <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Yeah me neither anymore
It did took me some episodes to get used to the uncle niece relationship between daemon and rhae though
Fr lmao
In the book it said she got pregnant at fucking 14 <:huh:966619839307321394>, but they havent specified the ages in the show so
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
You can see the twins she had with him
Did you watch the last ep
Yeah alicent didnt want to accept rae's proposition to marry her to jaecerys
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
Poor helaena had to marry her worst brother
Fr
Yes aegon was probably the one that planned everything too
<:worrymad:987990517453303820> those insults felt racially motivated
Like i felt so bad for him in the pig episode, and i liked him until the vaghar fight
I feel like i would have liked aemond if he wasnt a piece of shit like his mom and granfather raised him to be
He literally was just smiling about a joke of like 5 years ago and aemond starts insulting him <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
YES LMAO
Yeah im not even sure why i like him so much, maybe cuz he took aemond's eye <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
I hope he dies in the most horrible way
And i also hate fucking criston with my soul
Yeah i really like daemon too but idk if he is my fav, i like lucerys a lot too but he has appeared in like 2 episodes so <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>

I was close to only 2 of them, but we kinds separated with time cuz we lived in opposites sides of the city
The problem with mine is that all my women cousins were born like 13 years before me, and when i was born every uncle and aunt had male Kids, so i was surrounded with male cousins
I was the one that chew my barbies hands off
So difficult if all of them were normal
I have like 40 cousins

There is some traditional music i really like
Im also interested on the music natlan could have
Pastel de choclo
Or maybe porotos, i dont like them though
I would like if they added empanadas
Manifesting at least one chilean food in natlan
I dont like the taste
I dont like when my family roasts a whole fucking goat
Fr
And only eat the ribs
Like they do with goats
Unless you take the insides out
<:huh:966619839307321394>
How do you even roast a whole cow
<:life:1001518241610485781>
I wonder if when we get to natlan we are gonna have a roasted cuy recipe
Meanwhile the traveler mocking her for eating slimes
LMAO
That was some fever dream
And i alreadh forgot
It took me some time to learn some of them
I think the aranara names thing is simply cuz they all are named similar
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
And cuz she said some food didnt look good
Ive been seeing a lot of people hating on paimon cuz she said aranara names are difficult
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
Why she sleeping with eye open
Aside from dark cacao

Their larvae eats the poop of the adult ones to survive
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941> <:Despairge:1002519666050211941> <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
I was searching info about fleas in google and everything i read makes them more horrendous
Lice too i used to have those has a child <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I hate these things
I never really noticed her fleas before but now im seeing them more often so ig the eggs hatched <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
And now we are at the beach so we have to wait until we comeback to buy smth
But we havent given her anything for the fleas yet
And now we have been taking her to the vet and stuff
And then a friend adopted her and gave her to me
Her first owners didnt take good care of her
My dog does
They cant leave dogs alone
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Ok but why are fleas the worst fucking parasite

<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
I was playing the sims and i got to the conclusion that if i continue playing for a long time in the same world at some point some of them are gonna end up with blood related people
This is in a worst case scenario where i have to go all the way down to pity
Perfect
Skin
But i want mobi
18.5k

Heki just has bad taste

I took a bite before taking the picture <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
I didnt even cry in my dad's funeral
Or like me
Horny?
I just say a little girl
Who was that
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
It sticks a little
Too much time with aoi
Emo era
Cuz i hide the rest
All my family thinks my only 2 emotions are angry and emotionless
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
I didnt say i couldnt, just that i didnt like to
I hate this event i actually have to think
Maybe you are ace, or  maybe just too young, kinda soon to tell you got time to discover it
I sense lies
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Careful theres people that like that
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
I also have a crush on a friend and i dont go around touching her abdomen fenrir
Why that phrase sounds like something a 1800 person would say
Hacker has no bitches
Thats what happened to me <:cryge:966624721611403294> , but she actually succeded <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I even remember at the start i skipped the horny parts but i got to a point where the curiosity made me read that too <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Its so horrible to think that i learned what sex was from fanfictions
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
YESSSS
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
And the teacher made me sit with a class mate that read yaoi
I remember having a clean mind until i was like 8 or 9 maybe
I should know i was too curious for my own good <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
What infants are too curious for their own good
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Maybe they saw their mom do it amd got curious
Well...
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Like now im taking care of my new pup and sometimes it feels like im taking care of a human child but she is a dog so is okay
I like every baby except human
I thought that was only human babies
Is it yours?
Not without dying
<:huh:966619839307321394>
And even when i explained something 10 times they would still not understand
I had to do that in english class some years ago cuz some class mates where too slow <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Lets not get into that
Wall of sus says otherwise
First time in a while i dont see something sus coming from ruby
Im so bad at taking care of children
Did you kick aster?
Tell that to fenrir
We are such a bad influence <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Uhhh
I imagine skinny people tall <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>

WHY IS EVERYTHING SO SILENT, I CANT EVEN HEAR ULTS <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>

Different server ig

I think i started multi games at 15 <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
Bruh doesnt probably
Who doesnt
<:terium:973796767793569802>
We just need to wait and cope
They could
Mmhh i heard their anni matched with 3.1 release so we still need to wait some time, unless they want to celebrate it in 3.0
But to be fair this would have happened anyway
They should not have said that they were genshin killer back in the day <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Blasfemy
Is that que skinless loba?
Dont
My curiosity made me search the original
I dont even search for it
It follows me i swear
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
And it has a gacha
I downloaded another random game in my phone cuz i was bored
They give me clothes or makeup smh
Not once have they do that with me <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Like currencies or bps
My mom and sister always gift my brother's sons stuff for mobile games
But i always forget
I wanted to comeback to playing ranked
Both <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
You play ranked?
Sniper
P20 <:huh:966619839307321394>
2 kind of people
Uh yeah i think thats the one
I think
Yes
Like 25% and 50%
Also you can use it without it being at 100%
It does like 50 dmg but makes enemies take more damage from your team
Her ult is a sniper
And her ult?
Ricardo
Who is elysia
At least no one uses her
Fucking respawn
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
I hate rampart, she made me leave the game in season 6
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
The character select screen is fucking huge now lmao
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
But i didnt even miss it, my phone just didnt detect my fucking finger
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I missed the last one

<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
More than what you are getting
Ah yes the snake skin

<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Mihoyo has something with making only 2 protagonist amd not customizable
Im a year behind anyway <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>

And even now that im here we still havent lost one to age either, is like a curse <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I get mad every time i hear some of their deaths
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
They were terrible taking care of them
And none of them died of old age
My family had a lot of pets before i was born

griseo's speech was so sad
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
i know what you are
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i have to lvl up this? <@370438895965306882>
how does the atk bonus work though
i neglect all my divine keys
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
so much crit and it doesnt even work
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
is it the S2?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
but for some reason she still has like 50 less atk than BKE
i think i improved all of my mobius affixes
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
k this is slighty better
i have terrible memory
YES that one
oh then aslaug
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
fucking bastet T
or maybe aslaug but i dont think it was there
ok so i ordered them by time and i think i got them in bastet supply
<:concern:966623298639261746>
i wonder why
hey dont compare me to heki
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
aslaug was like 20 pulls and i only got aslaug and some random offrate
thats the only things i remember pulling a lot
or maybe bastet skem
uhhh i think it was the paga disaster in skemsal
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
i dont remember
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
this juan wont do the trick
fuck
<:huh:966619839307321394>
wait the abyss boss is hodom?
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

shut neko
why cant this happen instead <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

I wont stop my pulcinella slander
They are saving the cryo catalyst for the tsaritsa <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Mickey mouse, ah yes capitalism
I dont remember
Dottore i think
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
It makes sense at least one of them is ugly but still
That one
Pulcinella wasnt the penguin guy
If they make a specific model for a penguin
I would kill them
If its a mobius or bke boss maybe i can do something
Depends on the boss
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105> <:deadge:975652771082698782> <:deadge:975652771082698782>

Regrator i think is a person who buys stuff to then sell it for a lot bigger price, specially in times of need so
He is homosexual for capitano
At least sin mal doesnt look like a penguin

i found a treasure map
tet
For some reason the english page hasnt said anything
I can understand that
In my country i havent seen any so i cant really tell why is happening where you live
I know what pitbulls are capable of, my brother's pitbull killed one of my cats in front of me, but its not fair to condem the entire race for the way they are raised
Like i said the race itself isnt aggresive, they are even more docile than to say german shepherds, the thing is that they are physically stronger than most dogs and a lot of people train them to be guardians, so they are seen like beasts <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
If they have a stupid owner though
It pretty much depends on how the owner raises them, they can be very good dogs if trained well
Did you saw it in person or in the news
<:huh:966619839307321394>
is that a scp

Have you tried
one time is alright, 2 times coincidence, 3 times?, thats hilarious
yeah
for most people its cuz he tried to fight some fav charas like danheng and blade, then got his ass beat, so now its like a comunity joke
i dont care about the kid but he better stay alive cuz midyuan already lost too much
i feel like that represents you very well in many situations
If he isnt playable im gonna end it
<:sitstarege:1040586023740125244>
I should be saving but every time i get a ten pull i pull in JL LC banner
I dont need any of the others
I already got bronya LC anyway so
Instead i spend it on tickets every time i get 20
I wish i had that much will to save
Ive seen ruby really going against eli lately
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002> why did i open the chat and the first thing i saw was fucking panties
After resting a whole patch from it

<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

Argenti was erudition right
Hold on
Danheng is collecting all the men
I need his gameplay so bad

<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>

<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Lmao i was right
<:kleepray:963350716901113876>
And if he got another suit
It would be so cool if he was
i dont trust you heki
She just doesnt call me
Ik her kit is good but
Poor furina
For the future
Im taking an ss of this convo
Now its the other way around
Knowing mihoyo is neither and she is fire

furina's weapon lools so good
Neuvillette weap looking more tempting now
So
She doesnt cause any kind of WOW reaction on me
But

I really like being your friend guys <:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>, never would have thought honkai was gonna make me meet new people
This is gonna come out of nowhere but
<:Um_actually:1008018476859932742>
Yeah i never make them look like me, i just make them hot
Yeah i sometimes like creating my character and stuff but i prefer if they have their own story
I just saw the furina leaks
Fr fr
Not the point
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
But you did know i was flirting
<:seele:963352407365017640>
Want me to try?
But maybe
I wouldnt be thaaat sure
Its his lifestyle, hes used to it already
Who
Having characters like pulao is cute until people like ruby start liking them
I almost voicecalled tet

LMAO
No one backreads smh
Read the theories and you will get it
Baiheng and jingliu
Aside from bronseele
Not a single gay or lesbian couple will be happy in this game
I thought she meant she want blade to kill her
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
Its so pretty
Can you give a look at my abyss
<@416445660443967491> are you busy
And the pig
The lil kittens are so cute
I wonder why Hsr beta leaks come like 2 weeks earlier than genshin wich happen at the start of the update
But maybe a different hairstyle would have been better
I do find it cute
I mean if its free ill take it but doubt coming from mihoyo
<@370438895965306882>

Like archon material
Neuvillete splash art its so magestic like fr
Then someone said he wasnt sure cuz his kit looked too good lmao
Wtf is that <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<@309634550273933314>
Hydro catalyst
<@385655541248163840>
Also neuvillete
That was the most unexpected leak ive read
QUE
It will be real one day trust
Some people think he gave blade the heart, but yeah i have no fucking idea tbh
They just needed to give him less face cheeks and he was perfect
Fr
Kafka has to be skipped
I wanted luocha, blade and IL, at least i got 2 of them
it is an ugly ass mf
Oh sorry i think i pinged you jayson
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

LMAO
If its that one i can already smell people complaining bcuz of the color pallete
I spent like 20 mins drawing one of those cell to remember it for the test
Yeah
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
A protozoo
Oh i know what cell is that
I think i saw a leak that said when you fight them you can choose what you want to get
Boss
I lost my liyue cake
Maybe she will get her memories back and *poof* magical transformation
Yeah eileen does look like a 5 star march tbh
In tiktok mostly
He also shared genshin leaks, a lot of them
That dude never even leaked smth by himself lmao, he just took it from other people <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
im taking my time building them
i still dont have a second team lmao
Oh i just saw jayson sent it to cn gameplay lmao <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
And more than one patch ahead
Kinda hipocryte from that leaker knowing he leaked so much stuff in genshin though
Tbh i dont care, like knowing beta leaks is enough for me <:okk:1110244301184696360>
Never would i thought i was gonna agree with a tiktok honkai player <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>

SEELE IS PHYS
LIKE HOF ISNT RIGHT THERE
Ive seen some Twitter people saying honkai's last good design was nyx
Do you have something against black people <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
And you could even see she was going to be like this in the teaser image like 3 chapters ago
There was no reason for her to be black and red unless she still was fused with veliona
Seele has had this color pallete since fucking always
FOR REAL, Twitter and their complaining is starting to piss me off
Oh he is an homosexual fr
They did luka dirty smh
Wait yukong's dead lover is a woman?
I can feel the diluc jokes coming already
<:kianasmuggers:1092293793614667796>
Imagine she has an outfit like the ones she uses in AE stigs
Here it says she built the reputation of the army, not that she was the marshal like hua is supossed to be
Maybe
I dont think so, i mean i suposse she could have been one of hua's first disciples
Jingliu was 1.3 or 1.4
Wait
Wasnt it 1.3
She is really good
Very
She does lmao
Imagine is for fucking VG lmao
The dudu suit i suposse is for PE
Makes sense
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Is HoFin  the one with the shell, the one with music or the one with the thing in the leg
Mei is top right but the other two
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Yeah i get that but wich one is wich
Why <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Or i hope it is cuz it would look cute
The one with the shell could be HoFin
So 4 skins?
Prolly
I only saw her in pela's lightcone
Yeah idk if they even mention lynx in their dialogues
I wonder if its only them 3 or another landau is gonna come out out of nowhere
Like i get the designs and stuff but the kits? <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
How tf are so many kits leaked
I wonder if HoTr and HoFin are gonna get a skin too
She looks FUCKING BEAUTIFUL
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<@&1057190682642628618> <:kianasmuggers:1092293793614667796>
But idk about her stats
Someone sent her abilities im sure
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I tought she was a dps
Thats a extremely big amount of copium
Maybe they changed it
I think she is 5 but im not sure
Ohhh im gonna love him
Star rail's designs are so good fr
Im gonna main serval and pretend she is dudu expy
<@483689649727078400>

<@781539392039682058>
<@483689649727078400>
There was also some kit leaks for focalor, it said she created an área where you lose hp but increase your dmg, smth like that
I dont like how he looks from the front but his side damn
Neuvillette
There is a history here <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<@803575968374849536> here
This was yukong's old leak
The first one appears in one of the cards that i forgot the name
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

She was called alvitr right
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
Im gonna have nightmares
Yeah it would be nice if they were all opposites of one another
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Oh no it has 8 members i think
Alice better tell us about them
At least the harbingers had hints, this ones all look almost the same <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I think alice is gonna explain more about the circle and its members in the event
i think mona and her máster are also part of it but im not sure
Its alice's witch group or coven
I say minor cuz we already knew it existed
Minor story spoiler for 3.5
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
You mean its like inazuma's story or like the world is like inazuma?
Bronya's world?
Finally a honkai thing in the genshin star rail?
Those are very normal cgs for act 2 <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Act 2 cgs when
LMAO THAT WAS SO OUT OF CONTEXT
I dont understand whats the deal with mihoyo and making genshin's beta private smh
Or just a very pretty A rank
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
It better be a skin or fake
Same lmao
Better than kiana smh
She jumped from B to S rank in one ark
I wonder if its a skin or smth cuz that does not look very SP or A rank for me
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I dont mind, ive been expecting a new seele battlesuit since i started the fucking game
Seele, fu hua and theresa? Thats a weird mix <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Oh my fucking god

Took them 2 years to show something about gizhong
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
No literally like honkai releses like at least 2 skins per patch even if they are recolors, why genshin takes so fucking long
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
Apep
Im not sure what is she supossed to be
Dehya in the other hand <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Tbh kokomi was a healer so people complaining for her dmg was kinda stupid

<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>

And evaded talks that involved intimacy
Yeah i understand, i was thinking back to a trans friend i had, he just hid it from everyone new he met, even couples
Mhm mhm i see
So lets say you are a trans person, would you tell someone you are romantically involved that you are trans?
So i wanted some opinions or what you would do in a certain scenario
<:gaykiss:1000428892768714762>
Smooth

The zombie game gresh
<@213811388546678794> <@370438895965306882> still no wwZ offer?
waking up at 7 am since 5 has to leave some kinds of consequence
no lo abras aster
debi saberlo
POR LA MIERDA KEILO
te lo mereces keilo, traicionaste mi confianza, te aprovechaste de mi inocencia
la gente de aqui no aprende de sus errores, debio quedarte claro cuando cai en tus bromas de deez nuts mas de 4 veces seguidas
yo intento hablar de manera neutral la mayoria de las veces y creen que soy mexicana
a mi me gusta, pero en nuestra forma de hablar solemos saltarnos muchas letras, asi que gente de otros paises termina sin entender
no se si alguna vez lo dije pero chile es el pais de latinoamerica con peor reputacion por su forma de hablar, hablamos como la mierda
que otra cosa puede ser
clarooo
tambien en español hago mas bromas con doble sentido
como tu (redacted), mejor no lo digo
sigue y seguro lo hace
probablemente
creo que entiendo eso mas o menos
tambien entiendo un poco portugues, pero solo si las palabras se parecen a las españolas
la verdad en español hablo menos, por alguna razon en ingles hago oraciones mucho mas largas, cuando en español con mis amigos casi siempre son monosilabas
Tres tristes tigres, tragaban trigo en un trigal, en tres tristes trastos, tragaban trigo tres tristes tigres
like past present continous and stuff
yeah maybe, i think it was mostly english media, but i did learn the rules in school
i could speak spanish for a day
or at least it wasnt for me
english isnt
remember cherry isnt a legal adult yet keilo
or so im told
spanish is very difficult for non native speakers i think
mine was optional cuz me and a friend were better than everyone else so we got extra classes on it
like if you tell me to say the abededary im gonna pronounce the first letter in spanish then switch to english out of nowhere
i somehow ended up forgetting the spanish abecedary instead
yeah learning from memory the english pronuntiation of every letter was something
i dont think i can still spell words without reading them like i used to do
never in my life i read that word before
the other day i saw you can eliminate the french from someone
it was basic words though, nothing advanced, everyone else was shit so the bar was low
ohh i got a gold medal in a english spelling competition when i was 13
i like a friend back then, one day she hugged me and that hug and what i felt its still stucked in my head to this day
aww
<:gaykiss:1000428892768714762>
LMAO
specially
dinosaurs
i loved coloring stuff when i was a kid
oh yeah i told eli to buy some more coloring books, some people have been coloring them all (~~keilo~~)
when i was twelve
i also remember having crushes in guys like 5 years older than me
i remember always looking up to the older grades honestly
its in our collective imaginary arc city hidden base house
you can go to the corner too keilo
its open for everyone here, unless you are any of the weird ones
mmhh
its a 2x2 corner with a table chairs and things to draw
go to the minors corner cherry
not that far, just some other things that if i was seeing from outside i would assume its real flirting
im oblivious, like extremely, they can do the most obvious things and my brain just assumes they would do that for anyone
ohh hii lyri
do you guys notice if someone likes you? or are you oblivious
is that so
i cant
but if i truly like them
i can flirt with friends just fine
im terrible
no cuz fr lmao
so you dont actually like her?
<@148145559897636865> YOU ARE MY GRANDMOTHER??
NAAAHHHH i would dig a hole and put my head inside
hold on who is my grandma
<@483689649727078400> where is the rest of the story
LMAO
tet can we get mcdonals
YES
no leave the second
yeah cut the last line
im saving that message
is keilo related to any of us?
i think i got lost in the family tree again
WAIT ITS TRUE
do you want to find a room too keilo? <:seele:963352407365017640>
dont do it in front of me
CHERRY
<:binoculars:1048675942261858304>
putting 2 ? reads like a very surprised or exasperated question
yeah ive seent some carv messages coming from him in twitter
I dont even follow this guy <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
also, almost everytime i refer to someone with they its because i forgot with wich pronouns they identify
i think keilo's identifying trait is being the furry one
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
yeah
LMAO
truly lost media
me too
yk now that i remember, when ruby joined my perception of them was completely different than what it is now, with everyone else it didnt drift so far
this reminds me of our diavoros hate times
alright wtf,  im not a master in english but <:hmm:1012492971884695592>
IT STILL BLINDS ME
your light mode discord blinds me sometimes tet
you can dress them but the competitive is rithymn game

NO WAY LMAO
do you believe aqua over gresh?
well
ohhh...
those are genshin type players
well coming back to your friend cherry, they are absolutely blind and/or delusional if they thought clara was 16
and probably latinamerican countries too
yeah but in clara's case idk if i could assume she is 16 at first sight
uhh
<:wokege:966623232918712331>

Are you free cherry
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
Should i try to get first place in abyss
Is it up to 10 or A
I dont know how the US measures grades actually
Like i was starting to cry before looking, and tbh im still afraid it was some glitch in the system
I screamed
Red
7.0 being max grade, 3.9 and below bad ones
AND I GOT A BLUE GRADE (idk what my note would equal but its a 4.8/7.0
The results are up
Remember i said the chem test kicked my ass
<@370438895965306882> <@416445660443967491> eliiiii
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
OMG ELYSIA??
Sorry to dissapoint you tet but i prefer the nessie

Oh btw
On it
Not ER as you can see
<:gaykiss:1000428892768714762> <:gaykiss:1000428892768714762> <:gaykiss:1000428892768714762> <:gaykiss:1000428892768714762>
THX VERY MUCH ELIII
actually
S2
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
but i havent watched it yet
its very interesting honestly
like edgar allan poe
of books
and i think all the characters are inspired by authors
and so on
one can turn into a tiger, other has like telekinesis
they also have like special abilities in bsd
oh another thing
i just googled it, nah they arent similar
i dont know baccano
so a lot of dark stuff
well uhhh, its not comfy, i mean it has a lot of funny moments and stuff obv but the main theme is a detective agency and a mafia organization
did you really think that <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
or
is that sarcasm
coping like the bungo stray dogs fans after dazai was shot in the head
or two and half (badum tss)
its been like 3 weeks
lmao
cmon eli
one was cutted in half so you know
and half end up dead
<:Um_actually:1008018476859932742>
oh and mei mei but i dont like her
yeah i meant manga too but for me it feels that after maki none of them have gained much importance, like you had yuki i think she was called, the blonde special grade, but kenjaku killed her, then you have megumi's sister, who was in a coma since the start and when she woke up it was because someone possesed her and sukuna killed her, shoko and utahime are still alive though but they havend gotten any spotlight that i remember
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
i forgot wich mobi signets im supossed to use
yeah, but the author doesnt do much with any of them after certain woman spotlight
Dont look at jjk women fanbase
<:FelisGrass:1047083038179344454>
Below
It did burn a little
Cuz
And 3 mins less
Maybe a little bit less salt next time
<@416445660443967491> its tasty
Lets hope its edible
<:Um_actually:1008018476859932742>
Alright the rice is set up, now i just gotta wait like 20 mins
im okay with the first two parts <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
same thing
see, pirating or tying eli to a chair to use their kitchen
who hasnt done something slightly illegal once or twice in their life
you can help me cook tet
im cooking for you one way or another
its not a choice
im gonna tie you into a chair with gresh's help
im gonna force you to eat my food if we ever meet eli
hey <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
but you never know
tbh ive never burned any of the food ive made
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
maybe ill make it plain
i dont know if i have vegetables for the rice though
if i burn my kitchen it will be on you eli
mmhh
opinions
<@416445660443967491>
should i try to cook rice or eat the 4 days old one in the fridge
i just assumed he did cuz we had sherlock holmes and wattson hua
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
YEEEESSSS
Is it the same as uno?
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
Now i want to play with you guys
I played with some irl classmates yesterday
<@416445660443967491> is there a way we can play uno together
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Yeah i already played the dlc ones
dont buy it yet, lets just wait to see if the price gets lower any time soon
yeah, and he is busy rn so we cant play anyway
i play in ps4
it does have crossplay though
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
i wanted to wait to see if the price got lower for someone else to buy it, like gresh and you, but we might have to wait until fucking christmas
gresh checked prices the other day, he was left traumatised seeing that he had to pay $30 in a non gacha game
i think it was free once in epic games
<@213811388546678794> do you have it alice?
<@516591030326525983> im downloading wwz again btw
<:cryge:966624721611403294>

Im obssesed with this game again
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>

And i still didnt get the mafuyu card i wanted
Yes i panicked every time i ran into them <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
In my defense, the zombies left me at like 2 hits from death, it was still humilliating though
Once
<@516591030326525983> so i just remembered that a group of rats killed me in world war Z
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941> i cannot escape that man

They met when she was like 20 and he was 40
Yeah and one of my other friends parents have like a 20 year diff too
They had 3 children in a row right after
One of my friend's grandpa married her grandma when she was 14 and he was like 35

Yeah i think eli poisoned you then
Did you already forget the night we spent together a week ago <:cryge:966624721611403294>

2. Eli was envious of our love and poisoned you
Sick how

Yeah you better
<@416445660443967491> where are you <:wokege:966623232918712331>
I used to stalk a girl in school thinking it was only cuz i wanted to be her friend, took me 10 more years to figure i like women
Thats rather clever for a kid
COME HERE
ELI

True true, i would probably have even more issues though

The fact your first guess was homicide
Alcoholism got to him
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

Gresh isnt related to me
~~irl im laughing my ass off~~
You decide if you want to give me a sibling or a child
Irl im the same
Do you think that works with tet? I have like 6 sibling
Get too close to tet and you end up with child
Or maybe he wants to now
True, but i think he may have forgotten what was tet's goal
I expected it from tet, but gresh <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
For my own mother i see
LMAOOO
Learned to accept it
Gresh has been a discord mod for a while, he is literally god in sols server
You are into monogamy i see, i cant do that sorry
We could be a cube but you are a coward
<:bejjwithme:1067071883125735446>

We were colonized anyway but at least they tried
They tried to fight the spanish
Yeah that tribe was uhh full of warriors
Galvarino i think
This is very out of context but in my country there is a history about an indigenous man who got both his hands cut off and then cameback with knives has hands to keep fighting
Ruby you have no opinion on this
How do i act
Or 24 around that range
Gresh does act 25
You arent
Look who is talking
<:life:1001518241610485781>
I miss them honestly
Wow that looks so good
Well at least they are gonna be related to me either way
Yeah, cuz if we were our real ages it would be impossible
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Its not my fault that gresh was taking better care of me than you
<:cryge:966624721611403294>  but we dont have kids
Even mine? <:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
Yeah tbh the only way we would be friends if is somehow we were in the same uni and studied the same career
I think it would be the other way around
Do you guys think we had befriended eachother if we met  irl instead
Yeah he can use all of them at once
Mf didnt last even a chapter
Oh i saw that one
There is some interesting relationships yeah but nothing canon
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

You can forget everything that happened in the last 3 months
Unless red tide is present
In very very tiny amounts
Just
Is almost everywhere
The algae that i said caused amnesia
Also
And other sea creatures
Like whole 4 months with infected fishes
It can last months too
If you have too much toxins in your system
Diarreah can still kill you
<:Um_actually:1008018476859932742>
Microalgae
Some just cause diarrea
And death obv
And there is one that can cause amnesia
THIS MFS CAN KILL BIRDS
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Well, today my biology class literally started talking about it
The red tide

<@416445660443967491> eli eli eli
And all from those little amongus like creatures
You should search it in google it looks scary has fuck
I mean red tide is a ominous name has it is tbh
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
It can be deadly
When the red tide happens you cant eat anything that comes from it
Yeah cuz
My teacher gave it to us
They use it to Hunt too
Yeah you can
Cuz those little guys are responsible for it
Actually has anyone heard about the red tide
I think thats the english name
Dinoflagellates

This one wasnt crushed
They are translucid
Uhh they arent fluffy tails
And were running around in circles so happily
But they had tails
They are just little circles
I mean they are unicelular organisms
Yeah, he made the microscope go up to the point the lens crushed them
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Splatted
Exploded
Crushed
They were running around one moment and the next
And one of my group partners crushed the ones he was watching
Friday we had a biology lab and we were using the microscope to watch some tiny creatures
And being depressed

In one of the reports
She did gave him an F or 1 howewer you call the lowest grade
So yeah
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
But she said we couldnt kick him out
We told the teacher
I DID
LMAO
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
And i had to correct almost everything he did
He wasnt the brightest
But
At least he started trying to help
Then my other partner changed group amd i was left alone with him
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
And in the first 3 he didnt do shit
We had to do like one report per 2 weeks
We were 3 at the start, and we were stuck together for chemistry lab all semester
Last semester i was stuck with a guy like that
Thats fucking enfuriating
Ugh that too <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
You are right actually lmao <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

i cant even do abyss yet there
like gresham
yeah you are too much of a balder
when a character i wants comes

<:cryge:966624721611403294> its so pretty
Seele doesnt have any bridge animation with her deer?
if i lvl up some abandoned ER valks i can do it today
thats 500
if i do ER
so 3 pulls more plus the focus card from spending shop
4 pulls more and i get a purple thing
but idk what to buy
i have like 214 pink tickets
im just getting the focus cards
you know what
noooo eli
and i dont think one would make a difference
like i dont have a single cezz stig
that was the offrate i got today
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
unless i want to full gear Spa
yeah i was seeing now and i dont think i need anything from the collector card
lmao the difference in our spending currency
i must save to see if i can get the collector card
i have to resist the impulse to get the focus cards
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
oh yeah
i have 13 SSS i think
im not a balder like you so most of them are just base S
and now i have HorB so she is going to the basement
i considered getting Mpe to SSS but i didnt have her bow so it was useless
my method of saving is im too lazy to SSS my S ranks so everyone is stuck in a max of SS2
LMAO
i think i have enough
she is SS2
gauntlests and turg?
me coping with pardo and HB still cuz idk how to use sushang and i only have her gauntlets
<:sitstarege:1040586023740125244>

those sushang stigs evade me like im a plague
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>

i dont have her stigs dw
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
HoTr also came like in 3 pulls
wait now that i remember
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
maybe thats why herrschers love me
not getting to ten cuz i dont use that buff
im only 2 updates older than you
i have both gauntlest and jizo mitama maxed
this would have been done months ago if i didnt slack

Oh
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
If i remember myself
Send pictures of your cheap and structurally sound apartment when you wake up
Maybe i would be if my dad hadnt drank all of his money since i was born <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
I wish i was rich so i could visit those places
Just to see how it feels
I would like to try that
And for me that was huge
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im ngl in my city the highest building was 3 floors tall until i was like 10 and they built one with 4 floors
They arent very interesting pictures but for someone like me that lived in a city the size of a town where the highest building is 3 floors tall they convinced me to visit
Are you black ruby
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I think my aunt sent me some pics of new zealand when she went to visit, im gonna search for them
Me neither lmao
You want to escape from there so i dont trust you eli
Yeah fr, my country is a fucking desert, ive always wanted to see a more green place
Moving from america
Wich is something ig
But there is pretty places
Yeah the world is horrible
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
They speak english there right
Better than América for sure ig
Yeah i want to visit him so bad
I have a cousin that lives in new zealand
Like how much money would i need to save for that
Money
I have but
But is not great either
I suposse my country isnt the worst one
Or América in general
I hate living in latinamerica
Lucky mfs
Its always europeans
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
I suposse there is some
Wich countries have free college?
Also her mom lost the job the month after that so like <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Fr is so stupid
If not more
Like you can be 10 years paying that shit
And now she has to go into fucking debt with some government thing that pays for you, and when you graduate you have to pay everything you owe them
And she did need it
But one of my other friends was rejected the free schoolarship, just cuz they didnt lie and her mom that specific month was working with a contract
Like im not against her studying for free
And her parents arent even divorced or live in different places
They everything but poor
But believe me
And they were clasified has poor
the parent's of one of my friends lied on the documents, they just had to write they were divorced and her mom was unemployed
Info about yur family
Or if they are married etc
You need to fill some documents saying how much your mom and dad win per month
For example
But the definition of poor here is fucking ridiculous
Like if you are poor you can study for free
In my country's coin is like 8.000.000 a year
Medicine is like 7.000 dollars
And thats the cheap career
Per student
Why the fuck do you need like 4.000 dollars a year
I wish university was free on my country
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Though i could stay has a vet assistant for the rest of my life and the guilt would fall on my boss shoulders
<:life:1001518241610485781>
Would i be able to handle the guilt
Like if it died for a mistake i made
But having an animal's life in my hands got me thinking a lot of times last year ngl
Vet didnt have that much math, thats one of the things i liked about it
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
But then the pandemic hit
I was so good in highschool
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Math is gonna be a real challenge though
I hope so too
Lmao <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I havent looked into job options just yet
I always liked the ocean and the things in it so it always was like my second choice if i didnt get into veterinary
If i didnt say it before
Also my career is marine biology
This year the points had fucking inflation
Though im thinking about doing the ptu again (thats my countries way to see if someone gets into careers depending how much points they get)
But i still kinda like it
Though the career im in was my second choice
Yeah i suposse
Tbh i think im not bad at like adding to a convo if i want to, but the problem is to start it
Are you good at making irl friends <@370438895965306882> ?

Being friends with zavala?
What are even the requirements
Cayde was good but for a vanguard boss he wasnt exactly autoritary or responsible
Like are all the hunters really that bad?
Cayde has been in the dirt for 4 years
Why are hunters still without a vanguard boss
Yeah my friends used to talk a lot about lore and i learned from what i heard
Banshee's influence
But im starting to forget
I knew a lot of destiny lore before

His son
No <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Its on the tip of my tongue
Ugh i forgot his name
With his own son no less
Lets not forget rasputin was also a piece of shit though
I think that was left for interpretation
Do we know if the supossed wife and son of cayde were real or was that just his memory playing tricks on him
LMAO
I knew there was a 4 there
Fuck i was close
Well then its a shame he now doesnt even remember the day he is in
Oh

64?
Or was it 2
I dont remember
I think its like 3 digits
He got reseted so many times he now has alzheimer?
How was it?
Oh yeah i completely forgot about that lmao
Oh i thought you birthed it <:Um_actually:1008018476859932742>

I would really like to know if the traveler even has like a brain or smth, like does it even have a reason to do what is doing

<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Im playing the event of green gods and you have to do 300 kills with each character that got a skin
No one here plays overwatch right <:wokege:966623232918712331>

The lesbian to transmasc pipeline
LMAO
Carv came here expecting honkai talk but he just saw a queer convention
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
In 2016 i was still straight
I also have a trans irl friend and i dont think she never migendered him or said smth bad about him
Oh yeah it could, my mom was really conservative about it years ago, but i feel the more sus she got about me the more she tried to look accepting about it
The funny thing is that i have and yet my family is still suspiscious, every time they ask me about a couple they say boyfriend OR GIRLFRIEND like <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I think your family is just waiting for your comfirmation cherry
I think i had crushes in more than one girl when i was a child but i didnt even know what a lesbian was so didnt think much of it, and i also like Boys so that distracted me
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im pretty sure my whole family suspects me lmao, but unless i get a Girlfriend im not telling anyone, and thats never gonna happen so <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
When i was a child i had such and idealized view of the US <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>, the more i grew up the more i realized how bad the place was
I dont know if where i live is possible to disown someone, what does that mean, like leaving them out of their testament?
Everyone speaks english but there is only 3 americans <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
LMAO im so sorry heki
Yeah he never did it to me but i saw my mom taking the knife from his hands twice
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
My dad used to take knifes and rocks when he was drunk, he never actually hurt anyone but yeah <:life:1001518241610485781>, he is dead now dw
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
LMAO
Yeah he only threaten me with a knife, but he didnt stab me
YOU CAN BE SO STUPID
THERE IS NO WAY
And she didnt see anything wrong with that answer?
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I get that if someone is manipulative you wouldnt notice but if more than one person tells you they are repeatedly, maybe you should listen <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
And the hope for a better seele suit some day

Yes <:Dead:998259390605971496> , horizon's dlc being exclusive to ps5 will be my end

I want to pull her myself <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
No its fine, Internet doesnt let me watch streams
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
I didnt know there where hackers in nirv
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Phys its cuz i was very stupid when i started playing and didnt know what to pull so it ended up with a built dps and unbuilt supports <:deadge:975652771082698782>, fire is no AE cuz idk if its worth to pull for her at this point and ice cuz pardo hates me and im waiting for HoH release to build it
WHAT
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
You cant right
Imagine you could get S rank valks by hacking
If she wins then im sure mihoyo is doing this intentionally to make the less likely FC the winner
Thats like -80% less probabilities of winning
Are you guys sure about cat winning?
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Who is she fighting
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>

Im getting turg from bp and hoping for bastet in anni
And my ice team doesnt exist
Now you understand

<:cryge:966624721611403294>

<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Virtual singers in empty sekai are interesting
ah yeah being an antagonist is gonna do that, tbh i think she is an interesting character, like her loyalty to the ipc while still trying to save the planets, but some people wont be able to see that, and will just stay with the first impression of her being a capitalist <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>

I did all the pulls i got when i cameback, wich were like 70 and got nothing
I wanted the 2nd anni ones but none came to me <:cryge:966624721611403294>
The more more jump members are the ones i know less

<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I havent even done ch 1 of that
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Like i didnt make the connection until i saw a picture of both one after another
It took me a good while to notice noan was shrek
The other 2 staying on zero cuz im scared of not having enough for abystigma
Ive maxed 4/6 rosetta memories
The amount of mats ive tried to get from that event is crazy and i still feel is not enough
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
noooo it took me too long to see this
skem
4k for a homescreen smh
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
everyone else 10k
why is bianca so expensive <:cryge:966624721611403294>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
smh
why are liv skins like 4k cheaper
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
im not making it lmao
yeah
how much cards does that cost
<@129446145314258945> that abystigma skin that has like white effects is from a pyramid gacha?
<:huh:966619839307321394>
UH
Im 20 pulls away from S rank
<:Dead:998259390605971496>
Could have more but i did some impulse pulls and build pity
I have 12.5k saved already
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
Uhhh
then Vera
gotta spend them in selena first, he comes second
should i change them?, i dont really undertand what they do
<@309634550273933314> if i dismiss someone their rank resets right
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Dont i need to have him to see his past
What was that
Roland is kind of there but idk
I think Chrome and lee are my fav male characters
I just wish i had empyrea too
I dont regret pulling nanamech though
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Before another chara i like comes
I was checking the upcoming characters and i have like a max of one saving patch
nice nice
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i read something of a S rank weap selector in her patch, or is that paid
so she could go with abysstigma
<@129446145314258945> so you said i had to get rosetta from the next S rank selector
Done <:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
i sent the friend req
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
your friend list is full
ohhh so the one that wins this one goes against her
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
wait i could have sworn selena won last round
<@129446145314258945> what is your uid <:sitstarege:1040586023740125244>
<@129446145314258945> are you in NA?
Does heki still say slurs?
i knew you would
i have the feeling there is a group of people out there that would see this monster with other eyes
And damn abysstigma patch is fucking huge
And i checked on some of the future patches
Curiosity got the best of me
Yeah i have luna, scire and selena maxed
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<@309634550273933314> so i only have to wait now?
<:sussge:968897150249484389>

<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
how much spoiler can it be, its like a 3 letters censor
One day you will have to face the harsh future chapters tet
I want to be aware of whats happening in the story without spoilering myself so i had to speedrun it, even if it brought me enough misery to cry for a week
The New divide <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Ill keep it in mind, also i got to the last chapter
<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
I have to make a confesión, i still dont understand how most events work since i started playing pgr
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
FR i couldnt be more than 2 lines without being on the verge of crying
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
this is literally the most devastating thing ive read in a while
literally me
and crying
ive been like 10 minutes just processing what im reading
<@309634550273933314> i completely understand why you havent continued the story <:gaykiss:1000428892768714762>
never
<@416445660443967491> dont ever play the story
hold on... <:huh:966619839307321394>
WTF alright i cant keep going without crying give me 5 mins
Oh cmon now, whats wrong with this game <:cryge:966624721611403294>
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
How depressing is it
Im gonna start the nanamech chapter now <@129446145314258945>
im sure that after grinding for a month im gonna hate it
but
i mean the event does look fun
LMAO
Been playing for like 1 hour and i have enough to buy 2 frags
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
But its gonna take me ages
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
So technically i can get selena for free
Nice
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<@129446145314258945>
<@309634550273933314> is recitativo di fantasia permanent?
<:gaykiss:1000428892768714762>
that nosferatu skin is so good
mhh thats new
<:huh:966619839307321394> <:huh:966619839307321394> <:huh:966619839307321394>
no but fr this chapter was so fucking interesting
the heavenly principles and the punishing virus are the same confimed <:Um_actually:1008018476859932742>
And i still need another 150
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
Yesterday i spent 400 stamina to get the 5 star weapon shards
I COULDNT PLAY BACK THEN NOOOO
AGGGGHHHH
Im gonna fall into deep depression
Wait this was free?

<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>

<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

i wanted to start playing pgr around 21's patch
ITS SO FUCKING DEPRESSING
yes
<:sajj:1067071714518892584> <:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294>
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941> <:Despairge:1002519666050211941> <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
...
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Its either selena or bianca
I think i have a fav character
But by the time she comes maybe i wont even be playing anymore <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
So i watched some lamia clips and i want her more
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
So she doesnt need more heals?
But the recommended stigs confuse me cuz they are all of more dmg and she is a healer
She is just with basic stuff
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Luminance?
<@129446145314258945> wich chara should i build now
I couldnt come up with a french variation for tet
I wuld if i culd mademoiselle tetresa
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
poor thing was treated like a maid by that fucking woman
WHY IS THIS SO SAD
WTFFF
And cuts her hair
I just got to a hidden ch where she uses lux
Dont spoil
Not
I havent gotten there
Liv is always with her B rank frame <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Has liv luminance ever appeared in history?
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Now i just gotta wait one year and a half for her
Lamia is fucking amazing fr
Is confusing but fun for me at least
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
But i like it actually
The original
I like it
Fake asc chapter is fucking long
She is still a bitch though
I kinda like her more now
I was playing the fake asc chapter and they just said it out of nowhere
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Wait lamia is a mermaid?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Is pgr getting an EN dub?
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
I have to resist for abysstigma but idk if im strong enough
<@171082989046988800> so she can go with nanami right
The one that has like a staff and white wings
Hmm how good is the liv that is on uprate rn, i wont pull but she looks pretty
Interesting
<@129446145314258945> if my ice team is plume, glory and lumi, who do i use with nanami
are they weak?
why is that <@309634550273933314>  <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i just noticed you get the uniframes in one ten pull
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i liked the robots so much
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
WTFF WHY IS THIS SO SAD
Just progressing with the story
Havent pulled either
Im at 79 <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
<@416445660443967491> how is your pgr journey going, have you played <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
i already spent the resources it gave me
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
so im fucking stupid cuz i just dicovered this lmao
now im in the beach chapter
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
and was wondering how she isnt playable yet
i just completed the chapter where we meet her

<@309634550273933314>
UHHH LMAOO <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Noted
Im gonna start building him now that ploom is maxed
I forget i have to call them by the second name <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Glory
<@129446145314258945>  Chrome best build is the one that the game recommends right
Would have saved me of A2
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
I wish i could auto abyss in honkai like i do in pgr
Like from the gacha games ive played pgr is probably the less grindy one, at least in the sense of doing abyss or dailies
Lmao hating a game for that is so fucking stupid <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
What did they do <:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
What why <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Maybe being mobile only went against it <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I really like it
Yk im surprised pgr isnt that popular
Wow
I have 30 pulls saved so far <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
She is so different to the ones we have now
Abystigmatta yes
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
And omg she is fucking amazing
Yesterday i decided to see for wich chara annie told me to save for
Poor thing
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
The narwhal chapter
I got to the first extra story
It is lmao
And stamina
<:okk:1110244301184696360>
Now im running out of mats for memories
So im finally not running out of cogs
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> kk
Yeah
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Soo where do i get a better wep for nanami?
I would go with chrome but i dont have mats to build him yet
Its plume, nanamech and that S rank liv
My team is an mix of everything lmao
Why do i need such strong characters to play story <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
And im Just in like chapter 7
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Im trying to play story mode but mobs are starting to kick my ass
Simulated siege is the guild battles right
Moments like this make me appreciate how much resources i have in honkai
Im so poor
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
Leveling up ploom is sucking my resources dry
Noted
I have her already
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
And the box <:life:1001518241610485781>

<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>

<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Is there a difference
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

Just pray for it to not be pink-white-gold like they have been doing like with 4 battlesuits now <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
