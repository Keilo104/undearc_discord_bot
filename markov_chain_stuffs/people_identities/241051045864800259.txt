valid
I would love to read this as an actual series :O
Interesting!!!
I thought so but you gotta keep em guessing
Now thats smart word play
LOL
OoooooOOOooo
ooooooooooooo
I believe.
Luna, you gotta write it
Now THAT sounds interesting
its worse on twitter, i am so glad i dumped that bird app a long time ago
tho
god, the homophobia in lgbt spaces is so fucked
just let me be in peace.
also let me like women in peac
as a bi man let me like men in peace.
I think that is straight up homophobia
unless that is referring to multi-level marketing
to clarify, I don't mean whatever the current show airing has going on, although I love that series, it'll be very very different
so dont let your dreams be dreams
I'm slowly writing a villainess isekai but make it lesbian
Yeah </3
Maybe write it 👀
Oooooo
I was convinced that they were going to do something with all of the queer coding they had for its characters and then they did basically Nothing with it
I got queerbaited by Voltron llike the rest of tumblr
LOL
it was interesting!
I read a scan of it online a long time ago
Oh yeah that one
tru tru
ack
yeah although when it comes to scrolling through manga for yuri not all that long ago i felt like it was impossible to find a lot of good ones that didnt have a incest in it
I am happy how many yuri anime are getting animated recently
*nods sagely*
I would eat that up
You know?
Like Naruto but actually honest to god gay
I want a Shounen where the protag is gay actually
we need variety tho, first and foremost
I just need more stuff man
*nods*
oho right that one
true!
ugh YEAH
I am already living in a body I hate
Ngl I personally Dont because I will probably die,,, realism just reminds me of how pathetic my life is and also how fucked up reality is
you're valid Lol
I feel like the worldbuilding of bl gets restricted
I want More bl in general, of all genres, I feel like we only ever get a few genres, this is why I tend to just read danmeis these days but
with their art being better
they are actually redoing the comic from what I know about that one
they are simply a bad artist it's okay <3
well sorta? it's,,,, Everyone Is going to have different tastes and some older folks might never grow past liking something for a younger audience because that's their thing
One beautiful exception.
tgcf is once again the exception<3
Some bl artstyles are not pretty
don't watch many of those
unless you are referring to the live actions, I uhm
yeah </3
Depends on the comic,,, but
I am also more used to the chinese abriv
oops
LOL
Heaven Officials blessing
The full novel is out there fully translated
Also Luna, you should read HOB
I am listening.
Oh wait Korean bl ?
Yeayeayea!
It's Heaven Official's Blessing
But it's chinese LOL
there's one airing rn
I mean
YES
Specifically isekai's written for cishet men
this is also kinda true lmao
So you might stop enjoying things written from a younger perspective
As you get older for example, you'll have a harder time sympathizing with or caring about younger protags
but that's still a thing to cater to
True
Yeah
and I guarantee you when I get even older my tastes will change
I watched Awful shit when I was 16 that I would not watch now
Not really ngl
maybe even up to 20?
for shounen i think the demographic is 13-18
Depends?
but thats just in line with exploring more adult themes
although ig most seinen do tend to be a lil more psychological ?
really the only actual difference ngl
thats
Shounen is a genre meant to be enjoyed by a younger demographic, seinen is meant for an older one
Seinen is really just the adult form of shounen
Well, I mean to explain.
like the genre, the,
ngl thats a chad take
LOL
i'm indifferent most of the time
you are what one would call, a hater
youre valid
then again, I seem to only like the bad shounen
idk Why but it is
Black Clover is one of the only shounen that I really actually Like
Musically? I love a lot of Black Clover ops, they just hit harder if you love the series
Most Black Clover ops are banging, I love the series too so I do recognize my bias but like
Might be the one being parodied even
my mouth is on the right track to being fixed
Yes it will
So thats exciting
In 2 days My braces will be finalized (or rather it'll be actually braces and not just the brackets for braces in my mouth)
I think!
good!
Oh uh
that Black clover op is good
Hey
they've switched places!!!
they made red seele white this time and blue seele is black!!
omg
jesus??
inchresting
are you guys talking about
manga
What
Susannah huh?
So
Is my guess
Senti's probably not free
Yeah
Sushang has now become a Danganronoa character
LET NAHIDA SAY FUCK
Right, makes sense
Also, what elements are the Kiana and Mei?
?
And would be worth saving fkr
Is it safe to say these upcoming 3 units will be the most busted units that will be out for awhile
Do
Tf does this Super Time Fracture dk
they've been getting lazier and lazier
I like the outfit but her Hair....
Zhenyi.... finally
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
New bronya kinda pretty
i have villv but no stigs and no weapon
Red
We were robbed
Since I'm casual I only get em to ss
I just use my pins and slow farm
i see,,,
It'd be a pretty bad Spending event skin if there were no effects too
I dont think we've had any showcases of the skin
Do we know how Summer Aponia looks?
Me me want those Ana's
right right
Oh
Is that Villv?
Mpe?
*I'VE WANTED HER FOR SUCH A LONG TIME*
I CAN FINALLY HAVE SN
wait what's happening
So I will take that as a good night message
I do need to sleep
Dsjjsisis
JDKSKXKDKD
We're close tho, as you can see
I get my insanity from my parents
We're a bunch of weirdoes
Which I decline because I dont have the energy for that and murder charges are yucky
Meanwhile, my entire family are emotional recks and my parents constantly ask me to kill them
Damn
You know?
Well, family suicides are fun!
If I die I'm taking my whole family with me
Sounds like a you problem
Damn
Lol, welcome, to the cult
Whether or not I promise to kill others or myself depends on the scenario!
I suppose I'm not one to talk because my solutions to problems is ignore or murder
I
I mean you have the power Aster
You gotta draw Gore too
Y'all, your problems cannot be solved just by drawing porn!
Also
But
Of course, that's worse case scenario
If their parent was a cop tho... have mercy on you, you're probably going to juvy or a correctional facility for 6 montha
For example, you would probably get suspended if they told an adult
They could still get you into some trouble
,,,if they're a minor they could try to send you to jail?
I haven't tried and I'm afraid to
If you can even draw porn
NDJDJEKSKS
Fndnrnrjee
Stab stab
I will murder them
Murder
BDJJDJDJDJD
Yea
Unfortunately, most of my teachers sucked
Wish I had cool teachers
Damn
Nothing
Not like my crystals in any game mean anything anymore
Might as well
Maybe I'll do a solo rn and see if SW loves me yet
Yeah
I think I got rid of it
Or had
Btw
I already have a copy of it
Lol
Yes
My luck is abysmal lately in all od my games, lowkey making my depression way worse
Got... eos gloria
Out again!!
Hit pity on SW weapon banner cause weapon!!!
I get,,, stig or other weapon
But every single time
I want Sw Weapon
Weapon
I want,,, SW
Yeah, Genshin big numbers are way more satisfying
I think ,,,,, In normal honkai,,,, SW hit 1.5 mil in MA
I don't pay attention either
same
I was never interested that much in mlp yea
but like, I think they're cool and such
I find the designs cool, although Idk if I could draw them
then yeah, ig i am
I'd say I'm a furry if it's not by sexual standards
What makes one a furry
Question
Hmmm
I am considered a good one I guess
I like cat girls and the like
I'm not a huge one
Why not
Ehhh
furry?
exactly
that's the bad universe
a universe in which Kiana is kevin and Kevin is Kiana
rerolls accounts and ends up in project sekai with miku,  I can't see the end of the Horizon, HATSUNE MIKU?!?!?!
This is why the venxiao ship is doomed
GOD DAMMNIT
lol
who dies
Also, maybe there's a 3rd friend
that's the secret
because you also become Anemo
You don't die
No
that sounds like the start of a funny isekai, it's obviously a romance too, you romance your anemo best friend
thanks Su
Hell is becoming Anemo
tbh
I'd love to be a npc
GOD THAT'S SO FUCKING DARK AND FUNNY
lol
We should mass report them and hope they lose their accounts
They always have the top gear and no one can compete@
Man, I hate the whales like Elon and Jeffery Bezos
Be careful or you might get banned by other members and lose your account too
pFFFF
Not with that attitude!
there's a chance you won't succeed
Deleting your account takes more effort tho
I don't get many coughing fits anymore but they still suck
Although, I suppose what I experienced was coughing fits, which left my lungs feeling sore, my throat scratched, and me being left breathless
yeah
life insurance
I've def got some kind of lung problem but like all of my medical problems it's undiagnosed!
*pats*
I've had misunderstandings like that and it's funny
LOL
i've only needed an inhaler a few times in my life, like 3, because my coughing fits can get really bad
lol
loo
I want my 4 stars
felt...
I know like,,, none of the one's past 4.0 except for Dreams of Gemina
did bad cause of misclicks and the very many old pv;s
A rank
DAMNIT I SHOULD'VE STUCK TO MY GUT
older ones
I got it right woooo
OH IT'S OLD
lemme try that
ooOOOO
Let's see,,,,
valid
that;s what it's looking like
I think Invert was played during the story
I can tell you right away I don't think so
Nope
Lolol
Apparently
Phoenix
Nope
yup
so the music is more for stpry
Like the patch before HoT released
It's literally the patch before Mei has HoT
I know why it sounds epic
Oh
It is SA
lemme look, but yeah. Prob sa
great
Haxxor Bunny's is grea
yea
Splashing star is Delta's
You think maybe they'll do a reprise of Elysia's first pv?
It's Elysia
It's Fantasy Note
I don't think the track was called Fallen Rosemary
Actually
FR's is great yea
Oh yea, Senti
My favourites are the Haxxor Bunny, Aponia, and Mobius one's
I'm not a big fan of Epic
It's not my taste
yes
tes
yes
The patch pv
yea
5.0 uhhh
hopefully they won't
Although same, PE and HoF's theme wasn't for me either
Who's to say it wont be?
is that in a week now?
Well, still, excited
I see I see
ahhh
oh wait is 6.0 pv music out?
PV music goes hard
I just can't wait for 6.0 pv music
lol
she has tied them down
Keilo can't quit cause of Elysia
lol
poor klein
Yeah, I've been all over the place
hi Taihen, I am excited
I am indeed a cat person, yes
do they know google and other image searching sites exist?
you are living the best life
Really?
Not
Doesn't she not wear s- yeah
shadow knight outfit?
It's interesting how many different designs they played with
In here
So ig stuff is happening
Scary...
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
wouldn't that make Griseo as old as Fu Hua
Then No
If the aliens are her product
Good question
out of context it's incredibly hilarious
I'm sorry that's sad but like
mkpmniuop,[mjnhuijmkol
THEY LAUNCHED GRISEO INTO FUCKING SPACE?
Lol
I wouldnt be using up all my stuff for it so should be fine
With little guilt
So I can buy Memento which will at least give me ER capabilities
Right
For MA
Even use Moonbeam anymore?
Do we
I wanted moonbeam but
I have the will for it
I'm considering buying her and her weapon for ER
if I have left over crystals for the spending event
I mean, I'm getting the Mobius skin that update so
But we'll see how the herrscher is
I mean, I might get Vill-V too
as for me I'm skipping Griseo update for Mobius skin and if I get the skin early I'll try for VillV
insane
So Vill-V looks like
THE PINNOCHIO MOVIE LINE NOOO
Depends on what the herrscher is looking like cause it looks like we'll know the Herrscher by the time this hits
We'll see.
I'll get VillV?
I'll save for Mobious outfit and maybe?
I couldn't get Pardo's last skin but maybe this one?
Sorta
As a Cat fan I'm winning
Oh
seriously
What do you guys have against Kiana's jp va?
yeah
She's too busy to visit Kiana ;;
In apho
Is that why Mei's like how she is?
Ahh
This
Then it's good
I see!
I'll go with that
I'm not sure whether or not to believe you but that sounds better then the other option so Sure
I do not understand this exactly,,,,, Kiana's not dead right?
xcfvgbhnjmkuujnhbg
that's all
I just don't want tits,
I would like to hit the back button on my delolification so I can grow up without having 40H boobs
So I did cave and the cotton candy is sour
Uhhh, Idk
I'm not functional
I said this in the wrong channel-
It is taking everything in my power to not immediately eat it
So I got some cotton candy right?
I'M SAD NOW
FELIS
I'D LEGIT SPEND MONEY FOR THAT
DAMN
halloween themes in general are just great
I want Halloween skins...
OH AND SW SKIN
My fav skins are Durandals green elf skin, Mobius skin, time runner, oh summer, and all HoV skins
I think it looks cool, the effects are nice
I do sorta like the new hot skin we got
any of the drafts
I don't like any of them
may I be bold and say
But most of the time in media they don't make it complex unless they're being weird about it
that's true
lol
or neither cause Nonbinary is an option
Honestly would be hilarious
It makes sense most of them would be female
My point was most archons we have are based off of herrschers
Either way
I think it's obvious to me
Idk
so
also true
granted it's not a 100% match like Venti and Raiden are
like his eyes look like Welt when Welt uses his Herrscher powers
isn't Zhongli somewhat based off of welt tho?
It does make sense most would be female
Well, I suppose but considering the archon/herrscher connection we have going on with the archon's in genshin rn
Lol
Yeah
Women supremacy going on at Mihoyo head quarters
I mean, yeah but still
You think they know how to write male characters?
It's Mihoyo
Yeah, true
We'll have the dandelion sea I think?
But also... Aponia... I want her to save the day
I mean, I do agree it'd be nice if Vill herself was the one to do it
Like,,,,
I can't believe Mobius is dead
This is intense
But is this not the most character death in like,,,, a batch for Honkai?
That like these characters were dead to begin with
I know
Oof
Can we get another one folks??
i dont have himeko
what are good Herta teams
ik miku's in that song too but meiko specifically in jitterbug is good
i like meiko in jitterbug too
asking for... me
also which special one
which bl game
LETS GO
perfect
granted idk if this her best set but fuck it, i'll make it work
like look
poor himeko lc LOL
i almost want a second copy
cool
if I were to seriously try and build her
I can even give her,,,, Wait does Himeko Light cone work better or does JY for her?
I prommy I'll work on her after
can I build Welt first?
but Like
,,,,I mean I guess I could build her
i dont have either </3
i keep getting good fire and ice relics,,,
if only i had a good ice dps
I just dont know what to do with the other two members LOL
I do know that,,,,
Tru
Delay the enemies so JY doesnt get interupted LOL
Maybe I could put Welt with Jing Yuan?
Unsure I how to craft a good team for my dhil,,,
Ikik
I dont got Luocha
Although you kinda need Luocha for that
I could also attempt a mono imaginary team??
I mean I could use him instead of Pela on my dot team
*nods*
I will use him, mark my fucking words
I have No Idea if I have a good plavement for him but
I have his lightcone too I am DOING GOOD
PROUD OWNER OF WELT LETS GO STANDARD
equally balanced
i see
which place
oh wait theres another collab?
i have better pieces to raise rn
i wont raise it tho lol
just incase.

It couldve not rolled into the flat hp but beggars cannot be choosers ♡
Finally have one okay piece on Jing Yuan!
Why...
Ya know?
Yeah but I wonder like how many liberities the en translation team took
In the event
Online chatter
NGL I've been thinking about what the cn text has been for all of the
Wish that was me
I love her
I finally got the gall to play and honestly, guinaifen is such a girl flop
LOL
She's gone and you can really feel it.
I'm not really attached to her much as a character, it's more just the feeling that someone is gone that everyone cared about thats like,,, getting to me
I am emotional,,,,
rfglk mgvkefwlgrvgr
It's Tingyun's funeral...
thanks star rail. i havent experienced tears in awhile
awhile
today star rail has made me cry! for the first time in well
SVSSS LETS GOOO
i guess thats to be expected when you farm literally the day of-
There's so much to farm man...
Farming for Huohuo has been going slow
poor Arlan
yikes
Ig if I want to build Hook LOL
LOL
I dont think I have the unit
Work For
Does this even
THEN WHO
Well
*sobs*
I dont have Topaz.
Why.
Ok!
I think her boots should be hp but?
For huohuo
Also her rope and sphere
Boots be
What should her body and uhhh
Oh
Okay!
What relic set does she use?
I now have a ton of things to farm
GG
OHM
Ik maintenance ends in 4 hours/new banner is in 4 hours but I am already tired of waiting
Ah I see,,,, still it looks like they fucking are doing riddles thats so fucking rude
Should that Not be the phrasing??
Hotel's that only provide breakfast and dinner then???
Shouldnt the phrasing be
oh my god
It's stupid and pointless
This really is just fucking with the person taking the test
OH MY FUCKING GOD?
does that fit
Übernachtung mit Frühstück
ah
Bed and Breakfast?
when googling
all I'm getting is Hostel
If it was the us of a I would've understood more
*nods*
What countries visa are you attempting
Oh,,,,
Seriously why are all of these phrased like fucking riddles
Hm.
LOL
there's also airbnd but
Since those tend to be like,,, ya know
Inn?
if not tell them that the question was phrased like a brain teaser riddle
when i look up synonyms
an option
That is
synonyms
hold on lemme look up
Okay
Room Service
It's literally just
It
Yeah, It
This is a loaded question
That's really just called Room Service
It's both the room and the breakfast and the dinner?
Hmmmmm
that they used?
Is that the exact phrasing?
Hmmmm
Buffet?
Nini, the god herself, speaks
bgrdvbgng
because i need funds and i cant spend without planning
i have to stay strong
i kinda want argenti cause of his va but i
Himeko? /j
*pats*
cause you can use it for qingque too right? unless i was lied to
Stonks.
this is why i pulled for jingu yuans lc
idk whom but yeah
My plans are to save for Dan Heng's lc and then grab another future support
yay!!!
I will!
no </3
i am excited to have a new unit
sounds good then
*nods*
but you do have a point.
and midyuans
I already have Kafka lc
the event lc seems good tho
but that is dependant on other factors lol
if not then oh well
i might do like 1 10 pull and see if i get it
I'll see about it
*nods*
a party buff you mean?
shared feeling it is!
LOL
no sig because idk if i can manage that
Oh btw what lightcone for Huohuo?
LOL
imagine.
imagine for like april fools or something she changed out her blade for a day
I think we'd all riot if she changed it
Lol
Nini's credit funds must be insane
LOLOL
I am not?
EXACTLY
and also heki's dhil
I use nini's blade and tet's jingliu a lot
Btw I feel like it's funny how often I steal your guys dps's even when I have the unit because yours is better
I feel it is too much power for anyone to gift me their account details so I shall not
LOL
but I think I'll build her after I'm done with Huohuo when I get her
I've been meaning to build her
I do!
now would i?
time
Well then I wouldn't use them at the same
Sounds good
so
If you sub in Bailu that is actually my current kafka team
I will get Huohuo
thanks!
I do use Sampo more but one step at a time
*nods*
sadge.
I tried 1 ten pull for her and got a light cone instead
,,,I don't have the firework lady
So Kafka and Jing Yuan teams
ooooo
Yeah she'd replace my Bailu there
Would I put her on a team with Kafka or
Is really good then
Oh she
Ohhhh
or does she only heal
Should I pull Huohuo then? What else does she do other then heal
I do have natasha built but
*nods*
huohuo or silver wolf?
is huohuo better or silver wolf
anyways heki <@781539392039682058> and whoever else is willing to gift advice
I am only pulling for supports
Which Is Why
DPS
And then realized later on that they were all
I just pulled for who I liked
ngl
I don't know
I
I want,,, both,,,,
You tell me wgich one i am missing
Account
Sc my
I will just
I have no idea which would be better
Should I pull Huohuo or Silver Wolf
KJBHJTGNKJBLKJLKBT4????
lol
Cause Mihoyo really does like to make things More complex, which Isn;t bad necessarily but
What it'd look like
I wonder if you could Hoyoify her outfit
Mimi's design came to me in a vision so she's def one of my better designsed characters, her and her outfit
That Mimi is still my tumblr icon
You can attest to that having drawn my characters yea?
I'm good at character design tho ✨
Idk if I'm particularly good at it
lol
but
I like designing outfits sometimes
I can sort of do it
and unique
i aspire to be able to come up with designs as plentiful
Luna's designs are pretty top tier
Actually yeah
Surely you've got something else in there right?
You did well enough with Genshin and hi3 skins
Better.
Mihoyo this is fantasy china again, you can do
Not that Bad but also like come on
Like it's
Yeah they do, also similar-ish sleeves?
I do think I'd like to see a different top neckline
It's not but I sort Of see where they are coming from
Hanya is so pretty? wtf?
*Lan Wangji*
LAN WANGJI
oh okay thats fine then <:IchikaThumbsUp:1022873681627709461>
are my own words being thrown back at me
I say as my own taste is also really strange
you cant trust her for taste in fictional characters
heki's taste is weird
huh, well anyways now that im lvl 60 im in grind hell. kafka, you are my first ascended
lol
right
(Although Fu Xuan is good? Support? Ig?)
Managed to grab a Lynx with a 10 pull and not get Fu Xuan which is good
now
i'm lvl 60
oh
thank you
ok
yes
oki
dps
i am using my dhil as
*nods*
yeah
she uses space sealing
oki
i am just trying to get kafka rope
essentially
normal su
world 3
you.
<@781539392039682058>
fuck it
who do i at for help.
do i continue to use path reso of remembrance for su
i've elected to put it on qq for now
*nods*
ive used your dan heng a few times
you are hekisaru ye?
we are friends??
GOD ROLLS ON THE WORST SETS
I ALWAYS GET THIS
lol
can you read
I know?
i dont have anything else
Cause
This is what she gets for now
Oh okay
Ive
The only set
What *does* tingyun use then cause thats
Maybe for now I'll put it on Kafka cause I really cant get a good set
I see
I mean i might put it on tingyun if I felt like letting her do dmg cause I do think
Well its an half atk set so maybe for future use
Oh sadge
Is what i meant
Who do I put it on
Obvi
What should i do with this...
rip
He needs to be in pain.
or maybe I should focus on trace leveling my healers/supports...?
Looks like it's relic hunting now
Blade's traces are pretty much max now,,,
Phantylia is annoying to fight
*morning it's time to farm for blade*
I think Nini has her blade on support?
I can put him but he's not good
Or an aeon I havent unlocked?
I think Blade's supposed to use hunt maybe
🙏
I have abundance blessings because I had just unlocked them
I dont think i know what I'm doing
I fucking thought so
I see
What do I do for her
Now for Pela
right
LOL
ig next time I pull I'll keep that lc
or is carve the moon better
?
is it optimal to always have that on her
huh
I have e3 asta
Anyways
I saw that fen-
MKPMuniom
mean
what does vonwacq
cog?
what's on her
so now Pela
so that's some? extra energy
plus carve the moon is on her
energy rope set and stuff should handle that?
Maybe I'll build both and change depending on the scenario]
right right
ig stacking def on her is the way to go LOL
you're right you're right
I mean
*pff*
just to stack def on her
is that really optimal?
it's never your turn asta
LOL
oh the spd set?
*nods*
blade uses the new hp set, jy is the lighting and ty is musketeer
nat and bailu obv use the outgoing healing set
The only two I'm not sure on are Asta and Pela tbh
yea
Ik jy and blade use the same orb/rope set
Some actual confirmation is good
I wouldn;t mind
Down on everything
I think I know what everyone's sets are but if you wanna run me
I am *focused* on that
Oh no dw
amazing, I think that's all equipment settled?
I'll put carve moon on Asta then
Cool
what do you guys think
maybe I should put carve the moon on her tho and give tingyun planetary rendezvous because that's si 5
Asta has dance x3
~~i have himeko's lightcone too, whenever she comes home ig~~
anything for him <3
tingyun's got carve the moon, geppies got day one
I splurged for Jing Yuan so uhm, he's got his lightcone <3
Now I should look at equipment
OH
Fuck mihoyo in general tbh
He's mine.
Rerun tho?
Luocha
I had to cut corners </3
you don't need Nat
Well you have Bailu and Luocha so
I WAS GOING TO PULL FOR LUOCHA BUT THE UNIVERSE SAID BLADE KAFKA DAN HENG BACK TO BACK TO BACK
I'm only lvl 47 so knowing my teams this early on is good
I now know what to farm
thank you guysss
could use more
she's at 3k hp,,,,
I'm going to need to hyper invest in Bailu LOL
true,,, I'll see
or well, farm when I have tp LOL
time to get farming
perfect
does this work?
right so blade team will be asta pela bailu blade
currently jingyuan team is uhhh ty, jy, nt, geppie
what order should the blade team be in?
got it
oh okay Asta
Should I put Dan Heng with him to be funny
I wish I had Bronya
or sampo
,,,Maybe a dps?
final slot for Blade team?
Okay so Natasha for Jing yuan then
Natasha or Bailu?
who to put with Blade other then Pela?
I'd like two separate teams if possible,,, with maybe some different coverage if I can afford that
I can worry about equipment after I know which characters to put together
you can see what characters I've built up there
What Teams to make
anyways, Teams
there;s been periods where I was either too depressed to do anything or too busy
I couldn't play much during the beginning
Bad Luck.
I have fermata, eyes of prey, and good night sleep well
I do not have Luca or Tutorial
what do I put on instead
Oh okay
I do not have Yukong yet
I'm logging in
GAH
gimme a second
show you guys what I have and ask for two different teams
I might phone everyone here for help
tbh, idk what to do with my teams

Understandable.
Are you coming after me?
Oh Yukong is a Seele support
:thumbs:
Who is this even for
On a scale from 1 to 10 how good is this
Oh okay

I only prefarmed like
I'm going to do the best I can for my Blade

relationship with food
I have a complex,,, like
yeah,,,,
also <:worrypat:986461060104081508>
due to the fact that my taste buds are weird,,,,
Unfortunately, I need blander food
Pain
I'm just,,, All I can taste when eating spicy food is
You guys are so valid
LOL
I don't like spicy stuff,,,,
Ahhh
So
Gepard
I *have*
no no
And also some preservation cause gepard
Cause Jingyuan main dps
I just use Elation
So all you'd have to learn are the ropes
I'm a mostly experienced dm.
*pats*
rest in peace.

I need to start playing more
And Dan heng.

In other news, I'm at 120 pulls for Kafka !
She was being mean and I need her

Guess who bought tingyun from the shop!
DRAGON DAN HENG
>:(

I
OH
Went with Harmony ✨
Now, if only I could get Tingyun...
I might go harmony then thanks
Whats the best,,,, Battle Pass lightcone
Kang Woojin....
Minecrafts a large game, there's going to be some weird speedruns
besides, messy people and love is so much more interesting ✨
It's unrealistic for me to ever experience something non toxic so I'm just preparing and filling myself with things to make me feel better about that
<---- Fan of Toxic love
You like wholesome stuff
I see I see
?
Even if it's gay
PFFF
do you want other manhwa suggestions
so valid
twinisies
It's that mangago too
Yeah that ones good
Ooooo

It means you're bored.
Congrats!!

I had upgrades left!!
I wanted to do more business management
So sad

*I like them all....*
turns into
I like them all!
the curse of good gacha games
i wonder between Kafka and Blade who's first
agreed
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
Either way I can't pull for Luocha
either way,,,, I need bronya LOL
Luocha's img remember
LOL
Yes
but
Luocha isn't wind
I WANT HIM BAD BUT I CANNOT AFFORD
I KNOW
maybe a healer
Blade's a dps tho so ig I should look into supports
We'll see
maybe.
I think I'll use Kafka with Jing Yuan?
Idk what teams I'll put them on but
Understandable and yeah
*nods*
idk who that will be yet
good point
who should be my support
when I get Kafka and Blade
LOL, anyways
GO DO YOUR SCHOOL WORK!!
GIRL
YEAH I WAS GOING TO ASK
as support
I'll keep my Gepard
i can't wait for her hp to get higher
mines just lvl 50
2329 hp
I wonder how much healing Bailu does now
boss farming currently
heals
can't wait to make my bailu amazinh
as soon as possible
well
I will relic farm
Soon
lol
i think that set can only currently be used on Herta?
yea
unless I'm stupid and that is the def set
for shielders
Isn't gep on the def set?
I'm perfectly fine seing the full thing
I *have* seen it but not in full
all I know is that I think Dan Heng is pretty
same
yea
bottom
<:cree:1112899496599375893>
cause he's 1.4
<:CryScream:622899979404574755>
ugh
NOOOOOOOOOOOOO
NO
1.4 PLEASE OR I GO TO MIHOYO AND CRY
PLEASE
FUCK
NO
I'll need a break too, my wallet will not handle it.
1.4 at least...
I will break down crying, I'm pretty sure he won't be that early tho, he's prob 1.5?
<---Delusional
It's for my Dan Heng
I need Kafka and Dan Heng's bf
*high fives Tet*
<:ichikaconfused:1089112603307024505>
idk what to start with
I have so much that I need to farm
RIP
Of course you do Heki
Dragon Dan Heng *will* be mine
Kafka and Blade me want
I'm going to die
Btw, Who else is going for,,,, both characters in 1.2
Oof
Hope for qua healer or shielder soon
Nope
Bailu hp is at 2k hp
IT'S UP
Checking
Is it?
Those suits are not the right size for them
I,,,,
HEHE
BAILUBAILUBAILU
BAILU
I don't see the connection
not particularly maternal to me but then again it might be that she doesn't like like my mother so
I think Tet talks like an adult
yea
no not rly
hehehe
also
I thank tet and her bailu every single day
oho
```ansi
[2;31mRed![0m

```
Well, I intend to be
I am
hehe
whenever I play
Oh I've also been using your Bailu tet
<:UmiYay:357343797140652042>
am I blocked
Would I be considered one,,,, iwonder,,,,
<a:confusedbaku:1032541936814391327>
<a:BronyaConfused:933189861337358436>
????
Why tho
WHAT
this is good
Okay
Yeeees
Slightly
Is this better?
And I'm Svarog- /j
Hook also !
Idk, she def has Nea vibes
I think?
Oh! Clara
I need to edit this layout, gimme a second
it's like, what character is the most like or basically you
hehehe
So anyways, you're both saying you love me ? <:MizukiJii:1005155199540805633>
I think Serval's closets to you
So ig I'm herta
too
I recently got kinssigned Herta
Late to the party
gimme a second to take it
Star rail quiz
Oh wait
I don't think Nea wants to do that
so many Herta;s
preferably one that's not gepard
I want another 5 star
grinding to lvl 15
finally playing some star rail
Lol
now I can but honestly I probably shouldn't cause I have something really concerning going on medically
,,,Yeah </3
I wish I had brain cells
Man....
play yet
I haven't had the real chance to uhm
It's okay you're probably ahead of me
I wanna play star rail but I have to conserve energy for tiering...
i find it hard to believe that march takes up all of the aggro
so
tbh, if there wasn't innate aggro in clara's kit and if march didn't help with clara's aggro then clara would be trash
Actually, looking at team meta, March is still used with Clara
m7 shield does in fact make enemies target the shielded
i keep forgetting yanqing's a character
me too
I want Bailu or Bronya
Welt's a support? I think
ahhh
what are y'all talking about
Tbf! I don't think you were intentionally trying to
yeah,,,
yes.
but it wouldn't have made me as upset
I mean If I had known I'd still disagree with you
no but you should be aware of it at the very least,,,,
Cause pink and transparent icon
LOL YEAH THO
It's all about timing I think...
that too
cause to me it sounds like you hate it
i really can't tell
is it tho...
idk
your entitled to your opinions
I mean
Kei, You were just going on about another thing you didn't like about the game.
,,,
It really is
And they would not listen to me about anything.
I have ended a friendship over someone who did that to me once. Like I was sharing my passion about Vocaloid and like they went Oh, this actually fucking sucks
yes.
That *is* what you did Kei
You see, that's an asshole thing to do. You don't just... tell someone who is happy about something Yeah, but I don't like it
This rubs me the wrong way, this is bad, they haven't Earned any of my affection
Well yeah? I don't
and you have been going here saying
kei you're being very pesimistic and rude to me when all I initially said was I love this game
the metaverse is zuckerberg
with the way you're phrasing it!
Kei, honestly I really don't get your opinion here
That.
Yes
ugh
i also don't know what the fuck you mean by Earn it, like when it comes to jokes you literally cannot just
ig
we have very different perspectives on these things
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i think the basis for story telling is actually to tell a story
ig?
i mean good for you?
that's a very limited way at looking at media
it's a not got a serious tone for the most part
I feel like you're the one not letting star rail be it's own thing?
that's just not right
or something
need to earn it
you don't need to enjoy those kinds of jokes but also saying that they
well that's fine
that's normal?
yes
y
These are perfectly normal game jokes
Kei
....Yes
or less
5 minutes in
most jrpg's I love and play make jokes like
2 hours in
Oh yeah
or whatever the fuck you're talking about
i didn't bring any baggage
like
yeah?
even if you haven't?
like
no
I think it has?
cause like
you're being very mean actually
y- yes have you played others
cause you really don't
we have very different opinions
okay well
That's funny tho...
these kinds of jokes are like normal for jrpgs?
Idk kei
we called paimon emergency food 4 minutes in?
like
you're acting like Honkai and Genshin didn't start off with a lot of jokes
Is it really tho? also
Yes, it's it's own story
yes and no.
I mean
i mean you're entitled to your opinions but
how?
yes yes luna
it's supposed to be a bit funny
this is also a spin-off?
i mean
I wouldn't be this attached if they hadn't started joking around
no
respectfully.
kei do you play a lot of jrpg?
I wholeheartedly disagree
ehhhh
The instrumentals are banging tho
dang.
we're getting a concert already??
like sure it's extra still
If you pay attention, Bronya's clothes and everyone in that area don't have the style that the mc has
Oh well I mean
like
A color would play a big role in that tho
they don't look like they're a group
I think the issue might be the color cohesion between the main three? which is something hi3 had an issue with too
Our main character digs around in trash cans after all
Yeah
I've always liked weird off beat things like this\
ig
I love the weirdness of it all?
tbh
True
I mean it could be that you haven't adjusted to the weirdness inherent with a spin off like this yet
hm
idk
like,,, to me everything is very identifiable
but you know the same thing is with hsr
idk how to explain it
i mean,,,,,,
yeah
like i think genshin's designs are more messy and all over the place imho
really? i think this games look is very cohesive
i think they just haven't clicked yet for you
lmao
i like wc now but both mei and bronya's initial designs are fucking ugly
and bronya and mei don't look like they're from the same series
kiana and bronya are okay-ish?
like mei sticks out like a sore thumb
they don't really look right to me
it's probably going to be the way for them too
later designs
they don't really look cohesive together until like
i mean. i don't think the trio of hi3 is that way either
ehhhh?
I love this game, actually.
i love this games trio so much
I love this games mc so much
I can't help but feel like he's the kind of guy who's always lying but is also very bad at lying
Sampo's voice is very funny
And I went to Fight Club
No but Sampo has knocked me out
Going at a slower pace then y'all but I've hit trailblaze lvl 12 now
I played star rail for a bit
RNRJRKFKFK
I need Bronya then
Okii
So Pela?
Any recs for a Qingque team?
Well I'm early game so I'll keep Qingque until I get a healer
*nods*
So Dan Heng, Gepard, Asta and a healer?
Like a Qingque team and a Dan Heng team
I meant separate teams for either of them
I mean, yeah No I know that
Gbdjjfkfd
I haven't either lol
what would you guys recc?
I wanna separate Qingque and Dan Heng
When I get to do the two teams thing
hmmm
I don't have one yet
I wanna main Dan and Qing tho
I think I should probably fix the comp a bit...
what do you guys think of my current team?
Gepard, Dan Heng, Asta, and Qingque
btw
yis
she's a great support!
HFHJRDKKD YWAH
I love that there is like,,, 2 different convos happening at once
Human's arent really that clean cut lol
Yeah
i'm very pale as well thanks to my irish blood
just a guess there
those exist the further north you get iirc?
lighttoned asian
most slang these days comes from aave
yeah yeah
white
I did in fact mean them specifically but no, it references anyone who's skintone isn't like
did a whole sahara desert thing LOL
now that I read that, I think I phrased that wrong
people of color
so the words they use and the way they say it isn't in line with english you'll usually hear
most queer slang comes from poc queer people
it's really unique indeed
I wonder how good the buff's are to pick them up in the first place...
It's like queer slang
It's very similar to slay yeah
for Cunty
I think
It's like calling someone cool? but like,,, in a feminine way
It's a bit hard to explain but essentially, it's similar? to uhhh
Hmmm
hmmmm, you heard of the phrase she's serving cunt?
Do you want a Pela
I can trade.
who do you want
I'll take em
gimme her e's
I like her skill mechanic
she's vry fun to play imo
Tbh I don't either
idk how good she actually is but I'm building her
cause I like her.
All I know is that I've been using Qingque
and also why they're saying it
tbh
depends on who's saying it
Nea Nea did you send me a friend req yet?
Lol
Finally accessed the friends menu
Yes
i wanna make star rail ocs
can someone help me come up with kit ideas and yes tell me more about kafka
hm
i just assumed she was just some mysterious gal
oh wait really
LOL
did they confuse Kafka with Kefka?
i don't think she's a villain....
v- villain?
INDEED
Great Hitchhiker reference
I laughed when I could answer to Herta after a long thing about like Have you ever wondered what all of this means?, 42
I feel like this is really what Hoyo can do when they aren't bound by other things
it'll be half baked
so
any changes will lose sales (in the ceo's eyes)
I think Genshin's not allowed to be a ful creative game full of passion cause it's a cash cow
imo
RIGHT???
same as honkai
oho
for characters too?
Oho
then again it's launch is probably going to want at least a bit of money cause profits dictate whether the game stays
Imagine spending money immediately lol
Oh boy
so lazy
I gotta lvl to get friends man
Also...
lvl
is lvl 50 the max lv;?
I do want my Dan Heng kiss in general tbh
Which I've put off
In order to do that I need to order something
I need to play more but
Indeed
I wanted Bailu
yeah
Kei sent me one a bit ago but idk if it's complete
very small cases
unlike in genshin except for like
and people respond to what you pick
like purpose
The dialogue options feel like they have an actual
YEAH
THEY GAVE ME THE OPTION TO SAY 42 TO HERTA
I wanna say this game is the funniest hoyo game
like
The dialogue of this game is actually so funny
Oh
fire?
The Main Character but
Who is fire mc
Dan Heng is actually so pretty wtf
I love that
KLJNHBGUHVEFKDVRBR4
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
So
I just got Gepard
ingrown hairs in that area are the worst
yeah I was kinda curious about that
mid next month I'll be 20
I'm turning 20 soon
femboy ely....
he loves you
Something I want to talk about is how cute everyone's phones are
ACTUALLY
she's a 4 star?
idk if it's the writing or not but I do like these characters
she's so interesting
I want Kafka
Himeko's ult was fun to spam when they gave you her as a trial
i'd like march a bit more if her skill didn't keep causing me to accidentally use my ults
I like dan heng tbh
I can always count on you
thanks Keilo
tbh
Gepard just screams ml from a fantasy novel to me
Listen I thought I was getting spoiled okay
IJOUHYBHIJOK;
Oh
HUH??
WHAT
WAHT
it would def be nice to do exploration
if we do get co-op
I'm betting it'll be a guild thing
I'll just make it work
it's fineee
don't feel like rerolling
i hope he's useful
idk how to feel about this
I can't sc but I just now got gepard
Aye Aye Captain
yes
show show
<:pika:517283720458403841>
it's not like I can't pull on standard so
idk what for but
I might save too
have no energy
I have one more 10 pull to do which I will grind later
wait is it the other banner you're talking about?
So for your guarantee on the
Wait it literally says 5 star character
Wai
God the writing in this is so witty
this game has a hitchhikers guide to the galaxy reference too
I haven't got the 5 star yet but I must take a break
I got one of the 4 stars they give for free early lol
Almost hit pity on the one banner
but idm who i get ig
I want Bailu the most i think
I wanna see who I'll get
I should go back to playing huh
Logged off
I dont feel like redeeming them in game rn
Where can I redeem codes on the site
Also
Yes
I just picked girl cause I like her design better
The beginner warps are marked off and give a 5 star so
Starter warps time!
Hoyo you've done it again
GOD THIS MUSIC THO
I really do find it interesting how  haxxor bunny is her own character in this
I really like Kafka's eng va
Genshin
It's a lot better then
Kinda nice?
The English voice acting is actually
Hm
What is this opening animation
Oh okay yeah
Lemme convert
That amount of money could literally buy you a new switch WHAT
I was like
KJNJGTKJGRLK3G
YEAH OKAY THAT MAKES MORE SENSE
ah
OH
or is that not us dollars
At that point would it not be easier to just buy new joycons ??
,,,
That looks so incredibly painful
*pats*
Holy shit? That sucks
Sorry took me a second
I have a picture of what they look like if anyone wants to view (will probably show it in my channel)
Not yet at the very least so uh
Not typical braces
My braces are unique/are like
yeah, i am bein careful
of course I have something weird going on <3
I have retainers too because
*pats*
Who knew that yesterday mightve been the last time I was going to sound the way I have,,,, for awhile,,,,
Oh dear god this restricts my speech a lot more then I thought it would!!
The braces are fully in
It
Fixed kf
I love it when my computer does this thing called being a total bitch
No
the best way to tell socks or not is to look at the feet, if it;s all connected then boot
But it's still just a boot
Yeah
where are you getting this
No???
ykiujyhtgrfeejut5ityj
LOL
This takes the cake for dumbassery I've seen this week tho i think
Genshin players are fresh from the womb so of course they lack knowledge
It's okay.
Heres me attempting to eat a bagel
for now I have two brackets and soon I will have a metal bar in my mouth
i am being eased into full braces
yikes
oh dear
It feels so interesting
*nods* I am already adjusting~
cant wait for it to be not great
So far I am kinda likin having metal in my mouth
oof
So far I don't mind but also all I have rn is metal in my mouth
lol
in a weeks time there will be metal bars in my mouth
the starting stages to braces have begun
i keep forgetting to mention this but there is metal in my mouth
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
i knew canada and maybe britain? did it but-
Understandable, wait other countries do the trick or treat door to door thing?
vgvtynyhbtgybtr
happy halloween!!!
So tired.
I cannot get you shoes for free
Shows
Depends on the kind of shoes
the more voting restrictions put on people the less people vote and the more people who vote republicans
Did you just post the full barbie movie and the full openheimer movie
kjnhbgvyfbhjunkml
the reason it's bitter is so children won't eat
the part that would be most likely to get damaged is the metal part anyways, you don't lick that part
cartridges are strong
Not really? if it's only once
you only do it once!
you hear it's bitter and you go wait is it *really?* and then you give it a tiny lick
So that's just a thing everyone does huh
I havent been paying attention
Idk lol
I think so
wait for the chapters to come out before coming to conclusions?
why don't we just
Fjfjdjjdjdkdd
Not rlly
Hi, don't be alarmed, Shama is me
Nice.
Ohhhh
What is that-
It certainly took a turn
I see.
*pats*
some will go to tumblr, others to instagram, and maybe some to the dying reddit
honestly, saving grace, the death of that site
Yeah
Right..
Cow?
C-
That sounds insane
hello
I have not heard that tha
WHAT
lol
I mean, they don't have enough braincells to not immediately notice that even though it kinda looks like it
true
Therefor it would be strange.
beforehand
Like, reading
My sibling also thought for a second that he could be blind but then remembered he was looking at paper
However that is definitely a scene that can be misinterpet
Yeah,
Unsure about that
I do think metal uses more basses too?
Metal drumming is really intensive
Heavy drum beats are super super common in Metal
and I believe the vocals
It's the drums?
they keep making new bands <3
ugh
I like the designs but that's about it
Afterglow imho has the worst everything in bandori
D4DJ HAS BETTER COVERS AND THEY LITERALLY MAKE EVERY COVER INTO A DJ VERSION
To do that!!!
Did you manage!!!
How!!
You have the good instruments!!
You have the vocals!!
Like!!
They fucking mess it up so bad a lot of the time
the last roselia song i remember liking is fire bird
yeah...
the songs and covers are just suffering
but I swear as the franchise gets bigger and goes on for longer...
That's partially a joke
Has any bandori song been good?
no clue
yeah
Anyways, a better Denji pick would've been Tsugumi or Masking
but the eye color is the issue
Tbh the hair looks the most like Yukina
LOL
but the bangs doesn't fit sayo
it's so hard to tell tho
Makima might be Lock?
Actualyl
yea yea
she doesss
pretty sure
That's Rimi
Ran as Denji isn't the best pic ngl
Lemme look
I think?
RIMI
Yasss
LOL
Lol
ASTA
me wannnnnt
what the fuck that looks so tasty
PFFF
yelan's the snake
are you talking about weekly
or
they dont?
# let's go
OH IT'S BACK??
juhygtfrdews

komjnihbugtyuhnijok

MY GOD?
That sucks tho
*cracks phone screen* Surely this will show up on a screen shot! *doesn't show up on the screenshot because that's not how breaking the display works* <:pika:517283720458403841>
Why.
,,,,,I suppose there's not anything stopping you
Why must you phrase things that way
I am not normal but also am, schrodingers guy
Let them know that there is one normal person among this server. /j
What's going on
Poor Asta...
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
It's mine too, it's okay
Asta is an amazing character but if they aren't a Lesbian or chill about it I do not trust them
There's just something about Men who are very clearly insane and are losing it....
This guy is the biggest red flag in the world.
YOU DIDN'T NEED TO CALL ME OU-
ALRIGHT OKAY
Big ass w-
As a former lesbian, I would like to fight. (idk what I am now)
Murder.
Murder?
<--- I cough after laughing most of the time
like me with my coughs
KMONJUBHVGYUBHOKMPL
that's a nice feeling indeed
I think they just prevented their feet from spasming
or it's okay to like having fat even
but also think it's okay to not want to lose
I say this as a trans guy who wants to get rid of fat in a lot of different ways
And those who can't should also be accepted and given healthy options for transforming their bodies
YEAH
and for being happy about losing weight
Like, yes, accept and think fat is beautiful but don't shame people for wanting to get rid of their own
oh I also hate it when getting skinnier/wanting to be skinnier is seen as fatphobic
those are the veggies I like
I'll just always eat them
and carrots
I'll be fine, I just need to figure out how to get beets normally
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
so
I try to eat a balanced diet but unfortunately my body really fucking hates food
Gomen Nea
yeah
vbytgrfedw
it's not that bad, but like
Anyways
it is indeed good
I'm not together
both of them actually
hak
or
is was fen was saying
think that but for something else
My belly fat blocks the view of a lot of my feet
like uh
Nea, if you do just know you have been warned. It's not like,,, bad? I can describe it without describing it
I mean, if it bothers you yeah, just exercise a lil bit more
not sexual in nature tho
still nsfw LOL
but it's like
It's not bad
def not
Oh no
ahhh, I had that with my feet
*wheeze*
KOMNIBHYUINJOKMLCVFEDWSBVF
KOIJNHUBNIJMKO,L;
reason is the uterus is there.
even if they're ultra skinny
that pokes out
to clarify, all afab people have a stomach
i don't want b but it's preferrable to a
hoping for any but A.
you mean you now look more feminine?
Oh dear
hehehe, it comes with my entire family being physically disabled and such, plus me being curious
I know way too much
just let me know
if you have anything fucky going on with your health
all you guys need to know is that
<:kanadehug:1099498043008630896>
but I can't stop shivering like I am
like I'm not cold
ik I have it because of how much my body overreacts to a lot of things and sometimes my body just shakes
my entire family has fibromyalgia
,,,,and malnutrition
Oh no I just probably have fibro
No <3
I experience this a lot
some chronic illnesses can have it happen to
yes
sometimes it can happen with dehydration tho I think?
cause that happens when your blood sugar is low
you should tho
How's your blood sugar levels
Ohhhh
I do hope you find something tho
I have not, and will not read Act-Age
aight
y'all are so horny
running out of cans soon, Will be using crystals
I'm tiering on KR Proseka
lol
they should try something like I am Hero if they think that's dark
yea
Probably is
messed up yea but that's just about par for the course i think?
it's definitely a dark story but idk how dark others are saying it is lol
desensitized is the word I'd use
You will be missed hak
You gotta get me to say it naturally
Maybe.
Idk
Lol
how
I think not a single one of my messages has ended up in the censored hall
oh of course
Oh boyo
whom?
it's not working for me tho...
nope
# h
am on pc and unless I haven't updated...
yeah that's what I'm curious about
### this is so cool
OH
# wait does this really work
May 11th!
I want to say mine but
I wonder what kinda co-op/purpose friends will have in this game
I've stopped for today but tomorrow me grind
Na!
I'll have to join a bit late cause of food
Then again I live in a mostly cold state
It's raining here so it's a bit chilly
I send as much cold air as I possibly can that fucking sucks
good question
lol
tomorrow I'll probably go through the episode
makes a bit of sense
well it's a still image from the ed
I might go into the episodes and change it cause it doesn't work well with frames lol
I mean
So?
She issss
for star rail
I'm playing on na
I believe I live very far from chicago unfortunately
I think also there was more build up
Yea
It was more shocking in the manga tho
I think both had their merits
Hmm
The scene?
Cause she's dying and they have stars in their eyes for narrative reasons
🥹
and I can grind primos
He's a 4 star
fine
but it's
It cost me everything for Kaveh
....I went for her tho
OH NO
would take longer but you'd have more control
You could try making it?
*nods*
what places were you looking btw?
get fake booba
Breast plates exist
Luna...
She's a Shrine Maiden lol
Yae Miko cosplay too
/women in religion cause
Ig I like cosplaying Nun's!!
I KNOW I DIDNT EVEN REALIZE THAT UNTIL MUCH LATER
Long story short, still waiting for Aponia to be shipped but now my full Rosaria cosplay is on it's way
So
So the customer service said Let's transfer your order to something in the same size, I figured alright cause cancelling was becoming difficult
I didn't know what to do with that order
However
So the one place I had ordered Aponia from no longer contained my size, which not deal breaking cause there was a backup
I'll mention it here, update on my cosplay stuff,
Pardo core tho,,,
STONKS
felt
it's your ship
omg
I do indeed!
Of course they wouldnt replace muse fnnfnff
OH LOL
Do you remember Love Live beforr Aqours?
God tet
I better get good enough rewards for sif2
Yeah
I liked the two in one cards
Oh but you know
Where is it???
Wheres the cut in half magic,m
I like I found a lot of the new cards pretty but
YEAH
Yeah...
I wouldnt have gotten into any of the games I'm into now if it wasnt for it
Love Live was my first gacha game
Ik I'm being a bit dramatic but
*sobs*
Yeah...
In a long time
Itself
Love Live hasnt been
It's not the same
I understand
*pats*
Yeah that one is
It's not exactly the same but youre right ig
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
,,,,,,
I deleted Love Live today
I
I wish Love Live too
Looked it up lol
Yeah, nope, that's not real
I think that's a joke
Yeah, a lot of games are being shutdown as of late
For some this is a reboot, for others you can end up with something like Blue Exorcist, where like, you have to completely ignore the last 3 to 4 episodes and move onto season 2
Animators will come up with an anime only ending and then when the manga finishes or if there's high enough demand they'll go back and start making the anime again
ALTHOUGH, sometimes
As for movies it depends, it could just be like an extra long episode containing an arc of the manga or it could be filler and non-canon
Usually for anime it'll just stay half adapted if they don't finish
i'm asking a rhetorical question
i know
What is that manga
Oh my god that's just actual writing wtf
I zoomed in and
He should deal with it
I locked my cat in my room tho
Twas buzzing and it sounded large
Unidentified bug
In my room
What happened was uhhhh bug
Not quite </3
FJrjrjejdsi
Help
Proud of you
I always believed you could
yes
Wish I had all of her stigs, I just have 2 of em
Sushang is fun in ER
I played honkai actually for the first time in awhile....
not a fan of puns?
LOL
all of the classics
ahhh
ooooo
assign me a playlist too
what
*blinks*
Inchresting
pls
of manga
the full name
Ichinose?
I kinda just do daily comms these days and then yeet
lazy
i'm just
I should be doing the event
But he doesn't divorce Cyno
Tighnari is like I want a divorce
Incorrect, do you see how he fucking talks?
He is far from Taylor
You cannot tell me he doesn't have the edgiest taste ever.
My man would listen to Emo music
He would not.
You think Alhaitham would listen to Taylor Swift?
IS THAT SMALL 3D AICHAN?
*wheeze*
I dont want to
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
And eat
Gotta get up
I
but idk how to use that search engine
I know other sites such as pixiv are good
and maybe include wallpaper or art
use tags
also twitter
tumblr?
I don't really feel like making her better so just take what you get
Mihoyo really just said
Hoyo....
sowwy
Oh
and
they're referring to this sticker
Homestuck.
What are you guys talking about
annoying fucks
those fuckers should just go die somewhere
God
doesn't apply
they just can't do it lmao
Mentally ill people don't procrastinate
....I don't see suds well enough.
Oh, also I've also not properly washed a glass and then the water tasted like soap
So.
And I bite my hands a bit sometimes
As for how I know what soap tastes like? Sometimes I don't notice that I didn't wash all of the soap off my hands
That was just soap.
Fruit
There were these fruit flavored peeps...
soap
and then
Tbh, I feel you on the nastiness of eating something you were excited over
50% off was kind of full of amazing jokes like that
reminds me of 50% off but
yeah
it truly was
Funny
But I don't think they knew how
They probably did
I'll buy soup at the clothes store too
L,KONUBHYNIJ
I swear my brain just reads things wrong on purpose
i read overseas as omegaverse
*narrows eyes* my brain isn't working
Maybe they added cilantro
That's depressing
yeah...
But the issue is the everything else
Her gameplay is very fun to me
Rather then the Aloy state she's in
I mean, it'd have been something.
Yeah....
Maybe even make her burst a convert type like Raiden's so she can use Yelan and Xingqiu
But it'll make her competent.
SURE this won't completely fix her
and make her internal numbers higher
Make it so she can jump during burst
I mean, I'd say change her Skill's proc from 2.5 to 1 or like every 2 to 3 hits
I keep thinking about how if they just changed one or two things....
*and* damage boosting
She needs a TON of qol changes
*sighs*
But also I want the cis male organs
You know another.
i feel you
just know
yeah, you're so valid
I wanna look feminine in the way men do
like butch lesbians
Idk if it;s this way for you but I think that's just wanting to look masculine in the way cis women do
Ohhhh, I've felt that
I have too much boob to compress and I've got too many physical problems to bind safely
Oh I'm going for one <3
cause I don't want to lose my singing voice
I don't want my voice to drop much tbh
ouch
At least when I'm able to go on
I'm going to go through puberty again though cause of T
yeah very true
whatcha talking about <3
I'm not mentally ill<3
That's totalllllly not applicable to me <3
hahahaa
Granted I'm 20 in like.... 2 months
although I'm just 19
Felt
or use that one image
Simple, die
Idk what the fuck is going on here
*sighs*
Then.
So.
I believe for my sentence up there it was a time thing
I was talking about my sentence, I need
Okay
Then? than?
She will get the melanin between Dehya and Bennett lol and then call her dark skinned
She's going to be meh
I'm,,, so concerned about the future state of 5 stars.
God...
That sounds so pathetic
Pfff
....She couldn't beat her own trial without him...
Bennett buffs Dehya
Hydro Archon will either be extremely broken or extremely useless
meanwhile Dehya....
And Alhaitham's also just really good
Nahida's an archon lol
but Uhm
Sure he's not as good as Dendro Keqing and Nahida
Tighnari is a decent dps and has a lot of fun comps
I'm also genuinely mad about Dehya tbh
Shenhe
I want Ayaka c2 too but
I'm pulling for Shenhe on my side account
That was one of his buffs
Lol
oho
I have some more spreadsheet gaming to do before that (cause of the card section)
We can listen together and maybe I can help you write up your dnd character?
LOL
LOL
you edited that .
She's very pretty ngl!
Which is one of my favourite anime's
I remember cause she shares the same name as the protag from Black Clover
Because it's not?
Asta
It's
Yes.
You mean?
Asta?
-
All I see is a car.
I searched up Astra gsr and
I think Astra is very cute and fun to say
So valid Keilo
So I'm using it more then Aster
Yeah, they're trying out Astra rn
Cause apparently to Cherry I'm just non descript american
Question Astra, do I have a particular voice in your head?
nkmlcmcesw
Aight.
ALSO, Cherry, to me you sound like Amber rn
I'm curious about my default voice too...
Cherry is a fruit
oki
Appearance settings, there's a mode called compact
Also, how do you make the discord colors different :O
I know a friend who does
I'll have to see
the +2 gives it four
cause if you refresh it at 1 then it just has 3 uses
nono it does effect summon decks tho
I like that more
OH
can someone explain better
I don't quite understand this
thank you
Does anyone have the png for <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
*nods*
Hugs are usually for comfort.
I see.
Yeah
It's not needed but you want it.
But you might want something tastier then water.
You need water to live.
Needing something and wanting something is very different
But does Maria *want* one
Just cause there's no stress doesn't mean a hug isn't good.
Would you like an internet hug Maria?
*nods*
Is that who you are?
Maria?
Either Astra is like,,,, Really stressed or that's a different personality
I think no.
3rd person....
Aster, are you okay?
I'm going to destroy your parents
You envy people.
I'm so distant cause I can't exist properly.
Granted... I think mentally I just don't feel anything is really... Real.
Well, I understand that in part
There's also the fact that you're probably very.... upset that you have to have those high standards but no one else seems to have to
I mean, I understand why you do
I trust you Astra
or about myself.
About how I feel
Idk I think I lie because I don't know the truth
I mean, you don't always tell someone that you can't stand them
Idk
or that I'm likable
And I can't help but feel everyone lies to me when they say they like me
I can't learn to like myself
so cuteeeeeeeeee
jealous
Aster art gorgeous
stop manifesting evil into the world
Maybe.
I am not in the right mental state to take this quiz but I bet I'll probably end up being scored a nice person based on this test
Yeah.
I MEAN
PFFFFF
Thank you for not including me in Bullying, I am mentally weak.
lol
That's all you need for Tet
Horny (derogatory)
All you need to call Tet is
WHa
I will talk about gay sex all the fuck I want
LOL
Fuck yeah
Finally people will soon shut up about attack on titan
Idk where I'm at
Nice
You think he's got a giant snake?
OOO
KONJIHBUINJOK

But
No gear tho
i seeee
Oh maintenance on na isn't done
i don;t think I'll get basically anything but you never know
I will try my best
You know what you're right
I mean, I suppose not, I recently fell in love with a fictional character because 2D is safer and no one irl is going to love me
On about
What are you guys going
<:kyoukaconcern:967581142641430580>
and they picked the worst one
No
N
Elysia's just killing honkai
You see, the difference is Madara wants to murder people to obtain that
so so valid
OH Soul Eater too
Honkai? maybe?
and uhhh
Try Proseka
OH hm
that might help!
I reckon if you wanna make your eyes more fancy/find something new to add to them
Not tracing them but like,,,, Coping the style to the best of my abilities
I drew my eyes in other art styles
Mine is in 3 months
Not yet

Bad word choice

Is
Sorry
tbh, Jean can still be really good
Oho
I bet you'll raise Jean tho
so valid
Lol
The most Unfuckable man csuses problems again
My taste in irl men is almost non-existent
Lol
Why did I assume it'd be human
Is so much fun to sing
TRICOLGE
maybe that's it
My room is pretty cold tho
,,,,I fucking *hope* not
yo,,, why the fuck my nose so runny
Both are pretty bad but like
....I mean
Oh
My Hetalia phase was worse
Oh that's not bad
I agrre, Cartoon Network best one
As always
and roleplaying
Genshin
All I know is current hyperfixation is
*nods*
I have never watched it but I agree
which phase?
I can't break from it
I'm forever in my Anime phase
Oh shit TMNT is good tho
*I have no room to judge*
You didn't see my Hetalia phase
Listen
Oh I don't judge
*high fives with the ADHD*
himbo's are male airheads
same thing
lolol
I could be called a Himbo
*gasps*
I'm so bad at language and coherent thought
too
Y'all make a lot of the mistakes I make
tbf
LOL
it's okay
My english also sucks
What the fuck
Wow
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
that was a spittake
Yes, dw
;l,;,l,MMMllerrvf
ahhh
There's no way that's true
I agree, Carv is good taste
going through some things
I've beeb
Check my channel
LOL
NO
lol
so probably shit
i like them insane
I think my taste in men (mostly fictional, idk if I've ever liked them irl) Is like all
lol
hewwo
good luck
i see,,,
that sounds really scary
oh boy
I WANT HER
ANNABELLA
Pozemka from Arknights in the middle row
SO MUCH PINK
Who are all of the pink gals in this?
I need to get io and shower
Morning
NICE
Not me cause I dont use any social media with a for you page
Yeah, I think the pose is Fine but the shape of the dress is really hard to pull off
that's not exactly the sleeve Fen's going for tho,,,
Hmmmm
<@468680026162724864>
it's not pleated after all
that dress when sitting like that wouldn;t be bunched up enough to do that
Like this maybe?
what kind of style are you going for ?
Hmmm
Hi hi, whatcha having issues with?
Like how I wont shut up about proseka/genshin
You like something and you cant stop thinking about it all of the time
Special interest is like
When i hyperfixate I dont feed myself or use the bathroom until I'm done or until I can find a suitable break point
Yeah that's mostly correct, Hyperfixation is essentially you cant stop thinking about a task and you cant stop doing the task until you're finished
Hm
I also wanna go there some day
that's an insane pull
I might go and read it then
Oho
that's an interesting name- is the manga good?
Yeah but I dont think it was intentional
Thanks for the information
I will remember that advice for any future leg cramp, Hakcer
Can y'all not be weird about it-
aight
Oh I see

chorry/
Neo pronouns are funny and cute, i wish my brain would allow me to use them smoothly
PFFF
Gimme britney gendrr
BOCCHI

I have autism, I organize things so I can find them easily and stuff
No, not really
Oh I do but I dont like using the folders
I mean, I always have a tab with the youtube homepage open so I can refresh it and open videos I want to see on another tab but....
And, yeah, there's usually never a set of words that will fix everything
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
I care you
I care you Astrr
*pats*
*sighs*
Elon musk doesnt deserve to be rich but he is
Yeah, there's no cosmic force out there giving people what they deserve
....no it just means you have shit luck
You deserve better
*hugs*
Sounds like people arent having a good time there
Both are good but maybe try side first?
They arent worth it
Of course I'm sure it's sad to see a friend like that go but
Not like you have to deal with that
*pats* Yeah, that sucks for them
Rn
They sound like they need therapy more then friends
You dont need to
Ah
Also, yeah,

Nope, pluralkit is specifically for people who have did
<@482139585355448333>
tai's on
Ah, okay
What are you guys talkin about?
right
I don't
idk
What
KOMNokl,gt4mkbt55
The models do most characters such a disservice
Yeah, he's way bigger in drawn art
Neither of those characters can be considered that way
This however is
True, Although I think drawing fanart of Itto and making him buffer is not a crime or thinking that he *is* buff
I see
Yeah, that's how I feel
Yeah, there's a bunch of body types in Guilty Gear
Either way, Guilty Gear def has beefier characters but I honestly don't get why people are like this towards genshin men
Lol
I don't think the joke was funny
But the npc's and enemies are bigger
Sure, he's the beefiest Playable one
But also,,,, That's also not the beefiest bara male in genshin
That's not the skinniest twink in guilty gear
I mean, I guess I could, I'm just not sure If I'll be crazy about her gameplay...
NIJOKPijmunbhinomp
I don't, I'm lacking a lot
I lost 50/50 lol
What should I go for?
Here is what I have
yea
Cause gmc buffs Itto more iirc
gmc for Monogeo
lemme log in and take screen shots of my account
I do
yeah
So,,,, I do have a good atk stick for her
I do have Vortex Vanq
Maybe...
Like, to save my guarantee
Idk how long I can wait for rerun if it's going to take awhile....
So I do want her
And I have Nilou
No, I do not
Should I show what I have and maybe y'all can make suggestions?
Maybeeee
I lost 50/50 for Scara so I'm trying to figure out on who to go for next
I was not expecting that-
y- yeah
It's hard for me to go outside a lot because of the fact that my neighborhood is a bit dangerous
Ye
OUCH
Summer sucks for many reasons, that is one
if I don't wear pants
I can't go walking for long periods of time without my legs chaffing
If you want to see fat thighs look at mine
Yea
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
you're human
but like
Well, then you'd need to be a bird
Remind yourself that when you look at that
You have powerful legs that can kick your enemies to death
Aster, having meat on your legs is good because it means your legs are strong
still smaller then me tho
a stick and somewhat tall for their age
Aster is a bean pole in my head
lol
a slight more tum
Body type wise I'm the big booba characters from harem anime with just
I don't have a character comparison I think
*smacks you with a copy of aster's paper*
BAD
NO
Tet looks like Lee
A person of interest? the suspect?
If I wore heels I'd be 6 foot
I'm 5'10 to 5'11 and I look it
Tall
Like
I think
I look big
I believe
idk who I look like tbh
I
I don't think so
It's been awhile™️
yeah
can't believe Tet remembered
I did indeed do a face reveal
be careful with alcohol Luna
It's so good
A whole ass newspaper
Holy shit Aster that is
I have just woken up
I
Oh a news channel
The conversation I wake up yo
Is this
Why
I mean, yeah, That's just the worst case scenario
If All else fails
Her
You should be able to spark
Anyways, she put her entire town into a deep sleep
Also not Miku
So while Miku
She's apart of the universe Mothy made
That song
Oh, so she's from the princess of sleep
I hope you like what you get then
I see
Anyways, tet, just have what you want
Just,,,,,,
Maybe it's because when he did that one thing he's done he's not done since idk
Idk maybe I just don't see him saying anything about race lately? Maybe it's because I don't see him talking about it as much as you seem to think he does?
Do you
Do you find pride in roasting people relentlessly?
Baban, do you listen to Anyone?
*sighs*
He's not
you know with how much Heki talks you think that he's making them every single day
And you don't see much progress for awhile
It's hard
It's slow
No
Some sort of miraculous thing that Completely changes everything Heki does?
What does ~change~ look like to you then?
And you won't accept any other position.
You've decided who he is
You aren't listening to him
No, you don't
And you both need to fucking stop.
You both make mistakes you both have lives
Stop acting like the other person is a Super Villain
You're both human fucking beings
Baban, can you stop acting like the person in front of you is a Monster
This is just ridiculous
Baban..... I don't hate you?
Then how about you both block each other?
It's Free.
Baban, the block button is free
He is
You say he's doing nothing to fix himself but like
You can say that in ways that Aren't that
That his crush is stupid?
Like that he's an Awful person? Or that you think he's not worthy of love?
You are Straight up just saying harmful things
You were just saying that Heki's actions even as a joke are harmful
Like
Baban, just leave him alone, It's not worth it and you're Being Incredibly awful
That's
I know you don't like him but
Baban, please stop
H
You can call him with evidence a racist but That's
Okay, that's just rude
this
Eli, Are you having a bad day?
Yeah, it does
*sighs*
Fine
Not going to listen that's
alrighty then
Ah I see
Why it's not better then I can
I think Tet could explain
Indeed
I can say I hate all white people and that's not racism
It's not
No, Eli
?
Trying to figure out the whole situation
defending him and more like
It's not exactly
I guess yeah
People will say stuff like hating their own race online as a joke
*pats Heki*
,,,,
In terms of race
This is getting a little heated, Also, what is Heki
Especially since he was responding to you
Ye- yes?
Moiunijmofvnvrr
Clearly joking?
Wasn't he
He's just a whiny horny kinda annoying person
I know he's said slurs before but he hasn't willingly said any recently? Like I know that's a bad thing to do but-
What's going on?
Heki
So
And Idk about the racist talk because you always call Heki that
I don't think that's what happened
Can you guys chill for a second and tell me what Happened?
Is Heki okay
iirc
Sucrose just infuses the first element it picks up
Sucrose shouldn't be
Traveler's the unique one
No, every Anemo character but Traveler has the same prio
Beautiful picture!
That's a lotta spices
To talk about cafe
Come to my channel
Tet, tet
Oh?
Tet, peace at last!
:)
Did you know that if I block you I can't read your messages anymore?
Anyways
No, what you did was Explaining something different and gross
I'll try to ignore it for now
Yeah
Can't trust you
We Sort of
Plus, you have a history of not being normal around fictional children
You Lost Your Point faster then we did
Like
But instead you went on to talk about how people finding childlike features attractive is totally fine
You could have said that it didnt used to be that way
Like
The reason why is because you kept defending Weird fucking points
No matter your personal feelings on the word, how it's being used current is how it's being used
Tai is Completely right
Also, Yes,
You fucking morom
It's the only lethal method that does it as fast and as almost unstoppable as a gun
To kill people, Especially minorities
If people didnt have free access to gun's then they wouldn't use them
No, Ruby, I would, because gun's make it easier to Kill
Bruh, I dont think you're getting it but whatever.
No, I'm more disgusted by your gun control thoughts
That is all
I have no pride, I'm just disgusted by Ruby's pov
They're beyond help
Tet, lets ignore Ruby
THEY SHOULDNT HAVE ACCESS TO GUNS IN THE FIRST PLACE
You fucking Asshole
You have Not Had to Live through a School Shooting threay
**Fuck off**
*If you did not Live in this Country during School then you don't get to comment on Gun Control*
Just a small question
Ruby, question, Do you live in america
Ewww
OH MY GOD
Oh my god?
,,,,,
This is why tr*p is a slur
GUN CONTROL IS GOOS
YES ACTUALLY??
This is what the people are like on the internet
This is how it's used
Huh?
Where's your argument
So
But,,,, That's what the Loli tag was!
Not even drawn
It was infested with actual literal cp
Which he was right tondo
Listen, I know this originated by elon banning loli and lolicon
There are Slangs that exist that aren't used by people who see children as sexy
It is,
Yeah,,,,
OHIO ASS DAY FJDJDKDKD
You know it's bad when Bruh is not on your side, Bruh maybe a degen but clearly he has morals
Well
Not
Can we all agree Ruby is
<:creepysmile:996838443827073105>
Especially men
The instant someone says I'm into younger women I get so grossed out tbh
Enjoy that Fucking Jail Sentence!!
Like, Holy shit what if someone Lies to you about their age
???
THAT WAY IN PERSON IS EVENNFUCKING WORSE
Also
RUBY YOU CAN LIKE PEOPLE ROMANTICALLY AND SEXUALLY WITHOUT BASING IT OFF OF LOOKS HOLY SHIT??
^^^^
Ruby,,,,,
That's very sus
You Immediately Jumped to that
Also this
Literally be Normal about children for oncd
You know when you're argument hinges on that it's not a good look yes?
Saying it's not Illegal over and Over and Over again
You are,,, Being Very Very defensive for something that we're just calling Gross
Cause clearly you're offended
And
Also, Murder and This are different things
It's just Not Convincing
This is the same kind of argument that cp artists make when they draw and say they'd never act on it irl and they hate children irl
Why would you Like and Describe a Childlike figure like that if you're not into children as well?
Listen, Ruby, you're not very convincing
Such a large difference
Ah yes
Idk, you're the one who chose to die on that hill
And nothing you can say at this point will make me think otherwise
I do!
Yes!
Shudan is a nice person
Especially with someone like Ruby here
It's not a pleasant conversation
You're so valid Aster
Very,,,
Ruby was being
BFJEJFIIDJFCK
That's fine then
Oh okay!
True
True, he should look it up a lil further to really get it
He asked nicely
But like
Yes, Heki should look it up himself
If you know it I dont think it's bad to tell people
Because it implies trans people are trapping straight men into sex or a relationship by tricking ghem
Loli is similar to the word t*ap I said it
....It's not???
These are the usual users of Loli and how they talk
Yeah
Also still legality because holy shit if you're that attracted to Child Like features you might end up going after a child next
Also yes, that, thank you Tet
Yes! By definition they are! And no, they don't
I know
Ruby, children are not a fetish or a kink.
And even then, To say Loli used to be not sus is inco-
A words contextual meaning can change within a year
Yeah, I mean,,,, Words change and things happen
Ruby, why are you willing to die on this hill?
Why does this make you feel old Carv?
,,,,,That's not
Literally?
No. By definition it is?
Yes!
Lol
Lolicon's
Cause it.... I believe started from how they call pedophiles
Loli at the very least
I'd argue it's always been a controversial word?
And tbh, again, the word itself has,,,,, Dubious origins
True
People aren't to be trusted
The issues is
But
Words are words
Correct
I mean,,,, If the origin's of that word is a shorthand form of a nickname that a pedophile used for a child then that word is Already A Bit Dubious
You're right
Originate from that
In facr
It does!
Night night Carv
Not really
It just has.... Bad vibes these days
True, but still yeah
Cause most people would just say, Short, chibi, or child
Because what places do you freuqent that you have that so deeply inbedded in your lexicon 🤔
I think it depends on the person using it but I have a hard time trusting people who use it often
Loli.... Does indeed have baggage
oh god
,,,,I'll ask Eli
Do I just ask any of them or
Oki,,,
Allow
Would allo2
The mods
If
Ig I could have a general advice/tcg type corner
....anyways
LISTEN, I'M FUCKING COMMITTED
,,,,,What if I learn the Genshin tcg so good that I'm the tcg champ
What am I good enough at to obtain one
I want a special channel
A violin is shaped the way it is for sound purposes
I mean it's cool looking but
I think that violin wouldnt sound very good
KFKFKFKKFKF
We played Jenga at the boba place
Twas very chill
Ye
Free shower <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>  /j
I am drenched tho, walking around in the rain without an umbrella...
👍
Date went well
I became active
*lies down*
Yeah, Oceanid is broken
lol
probably underground
welcome back, enna
Oh boy
I do like dendro indeed
Cause I went for Nilou's weapon
I do have her best weapon too lol
yeah
I need to build Kuki...
in that case
I think I'd sub in raiden for fish
I do...
oh okay
Fischl, Zhongli, and Flex...?
You're joking right
*What are his teams*
Now
I got Tighnari before I got Mona
For Wanderer, I've decided to find every single Aranara
What is wrong with Aichan
explains the growth
I hope so too holy fukc
I want pistachio ice cream
lol
I love Nahida's design too, top tier
Sumeru is my favourite region too
(ig there's some others but Kokomi is just,,,, yeah)
tbh tho.... The only character that's really appealed to me in a deep way design wise is Kokomi
Jean's very pretty yes
I think he's neat, and it's about the same for Alhaitham
Omg so hot kinda way
I like Itto's style and how he looks but like, Not in a
lol
that's all I've got on them
Kaeya's an interesting lore character
Itto's funny at the very least!
I don't get the appeal of Itto or Kaeya either, sue me
valid, you're so vali
Out of the Anime Men I like Only one of them has muscles and that's by chance
At all
Muscle
Like
I don't
I legit don't get his appeal that much?
And he's not my anime type for males
I'm a lesbian
I eat long carrots like bugs bunny
I've been spelling it wrong-
Per se
Oh it is
Meh
if not
If his kit calls out to me I'll consider pulling
I just think he's kinda cool but that's it
I don't think he's pretty per say
no you're valid
I also want to see his splash art
felt
But at what cost
I woke up
what's the 3rd card?
Makes sense
Oho
Ganyu, always broken
She seems strong,,,,
PFFF
Timmie?
Applied
You kinda just have to be
To be fair, there's not a lot of elemental defense in the tcg
PFFFF
OH WAIT REALLY?
We'd have to wait and see tho
Yeah
Like, including accessories.....
Yeah
probably if you'd want to play what you want
I mean
*cries*
They'd need elemental die and probably also need some sort of damage board for stuff
I wonder how they'd sell it...
I'd love to buy it yes
That would be cool
:O
I have no money/
I want it
I love it
BOPPERHEAD
Even better
Wait
PARDO FIGURE????????
...I have a feeling I'm going to be the advice person on the TCG in the future
Her burst, as always, is high damage
Especially when you get stacking on her buffs
Ayaka does a shit ton of damage also
?
Maybe a freeze team/
and you know what you're doing
She's great for survivability if you have two really high damage character cards
From what I read
A lot
Mona too
I've noticed Xiangling be in pretty much everyone's decks...
In terms of Who looks good and useful, Xiangling, Xingqiu, and Maybe Barbara seem good
Yeah, that's really useful
I think I'll work on getting Xingqiu next, he's annoying to fight against
Frozen I'm unsure about but I think it's fine too
Anyways, Melt, Dendro, and mayyyyyybe vape (cause of card compatibility) all seem good
rood
Okay, Didn't read the fine print
Ahhh
Maybe it just doesn't work against slimes and Rhodeia
Oh wait really?
Frozen.... It doesn't seem to freeze cards and make them not work tho, which feels like a let down
Yea yea
Survivability seems to be important but also damage.... Dendro seems broken tbh
Yeah, I've been struggling on team comp
I see
Ohhhhh
Not together
talking in general
Oh I'm jjust
Yeah!
I sorta wanna go with Mona or Ayaka but I'm unsure what's smart
I've been thinking.... Mona, Ayaka, Xingqiu, and Ganyu seem really good
*nods*
how many can you put in a deck I wonder....
Yeah. those ones are broken
Oho?
I don't claim to be good but...
I've been having fun learning
I'll play against you!
it was in spoilers
Hm
Wh
I do
I might like it more then Genshin
Genshin tcg is actually pretty fun
To tof it is
I tried going to bed and couldnt so
Lol
And other stuff
Otherwise I wont be awake for DnD
No, I cant
Lemme clean up my desk a lil and grind
You know what, I'm not sleeping
Like on the one page
Arent there different modes?
,,,,,,Building it up ever since I've been playing ig?
Since I've been playing
I havent gotten a lim weapon yet
I'm at 72 pity
I should be grinding in tof too
So valid
So that's why I clarified JP
I remember hearing you talk about his cn va
I know you are
Hate farming his mats
I also
Okay, I cant blame you on that one
I can't not like him
Scara JP VA is Natsu
Heki, you really cant make a decision
Today's always been the update day
Yes
My sleep schedule is fucked and
Bookshelf is good
Up
Has woken
Guess who
Np!
There is a lot of ads, warning
Okcupid! I told ya
Hihi Shudan
You're so so so valid
Nice!
Jrsikeoes Okcupid
I'M FUCKING WINNIGN YES
<:cat_eee:1018349140863877182>
She called me her type I cannot handle this
👍
Cute girl complimenting me 24/7? I tjink I will die
I'm glad I managed to sign up for that dating app
Hey, I just wanna say
*lies down*
I don't like where this conversation is going/
are you guys okay
If it doesn't count loops just means that's the song I clicked on and searched the most
well, my top song was apparently only 57 which
I see, So I'm the only one here who prefers youtube to spotify
Lol
I
Out of curiosity did it tell you how many times you listened to it
YOU'RE JOKING
MONSTER HIGH THEME SONG?
Ahhh
Tf does a Spray do?
So really,,,, He's a hybrid me thinks
Although this tentacles only exist on a squid
Actually
Yes
This is why people call me smart sometimes,,,, I obtain weird and fun knowledge and it impresses people cause I remember it
I love looking things up and finding weird information
Inchresting facts
Either way
You're so valid
was the first one I saw
It's banned in Iran
Nah, these were full countries
Lol
10
I counted like
Yeah
And also, there's actually a lot of countries where Alcohol is still completely banned
btw, The highest drinking age I saw was 21
It explains why it was listed like that
So,,,, Not as bad
or drink below that
but it's not legal To Have
It's just you can't legally Obtain it until 18
But in Private you can consume at Any age
18
It's not as bad as I thought
OH I LOOKED UP COMOROS CAUSE IT WAS BOTHERING ME
Bring something to mix it with
You're going to be disappointed
Alcohol lol
I don't like
Although
tbh, 21 just means I can go out and buy alcohol that I want to try
Yeah, absolutely
For most countries with a drinking age under 18 there's a * next to it, meaning it's Only Kind of legal
I'm not sure what is going on in Comoros but
So uhm
1
Have the drinking age at
....I did see a country while looking through some lists
Most countries the legal drinking age is 18
Okay, So I was remembering Italy not France
Oh, In Italy the drinking age is 16
Lemme look it up tho to be sure
I think it's like, an absurd number too
Yeah!
I hate alcohol though
I know this because I've had drinks before at home
You have to be 21 to drink in public in america
It's that way in america, And only when you're 18
I think Hakcer meant Legal
but only for Wine
I think?
France?
In general
being higher
It's 20 in Japan so I'm just used to it
I mean, tbf
Ohhhhh
oh
CHERRY YOU'RE?? 16???
*screams*
,,,,I only have 1.5 years left before I can legally go to bars
,,,,,I'd become a kitten if it were for women
I said scammed, not robbed
You know what, all this says is that Ruby's easily Scammed
What the fuck
She's hella shady
In my state they id you before you can go in
I still question how she got into a bar
Makeup is a fucking wizard
It could have been worse
Indeed
Senior in high school too, most likely
Also, that's 3 years????
tbh It's not Ruby's fault for not knowing
Why the hell was she At the Bar at age 17???
ohhhh that's messy
Imagine dating people irl
That account wasn't good to them
Aster isn't using it because they wanted to reset
I think it depends on whether or not you care for him if you felt anything yeah
I think he did do a good job but I think JP va did better
At this point
I'm sure he will
Yes
They literally just based a character after a Queen song
In it
There was an actual line from Bohemian Rhapsody
Mhmmm
Aster, I am going to murder your father.
lol
uwu
I get have Yae's on side
exactly
I'm pulling Scara because I want to fly
felt
ah
hewwo aster
Valid, who are you planning on going for then?
....Kokomi might be banned in competitive play
Yeah, in Yugioh... Pot of Greed is seriously a busted card actually I didn't even think about it-
But I didn't remember that pot of greed was one of them
banned cards
I've got an expert Yugioh player as a friend and they kept telling me about like
I started playing Yugioh recentlyt
OPIJHUYGHUIJO RIGHT
Asterlao wants Ayato
2 days before christmas
It seems that I'm not in on a tcg reference
pot of greed joke?
Very true!
I am not joking
Idk, I think Kokomi's card ability is pretty good
lkvmvr4mv4r
yes
Ye ye
That's a nice pair of eyes
I dont hate Scara
Lol
Tet is soamazing
Maybe I could draw Raiden being a good mom to Scara /hj
hmmm
I suppose yea
Hmmm
CAN TELL IMMEDIATELY-
PFFFF
They are not a coomer man-
There wasn't much of one...
well, they like Scara more I think but I can't draw men
I entered a secret santa and the person likes Raiden
Genshin, I mean
Raiden Shogun
ANYONE wanna help me figure out what to do for drawing Raiden?
Maybe I could send my youtube one
I dont use Spotify so
And yea
Youtube rewind is too expensive to make and the site is less of a monoculture now
Huh
Wrapped now
Oh youtube has a sort of
I've learned not to question things
I don't know
that's what I'm thinking
yea
still a lot but maybe she's on the winning team
So, an entire seasons worth
Libero's do occasionally earn points
so maybe it's just added up?
Then again, it's for an entire season?
That's a good question....
Interesting
I see
She's funny
I9UH8YG78UJ9IK0OPLOIKJU
Yeeeee
I could grind to get her
I have a relatively new account...
I do have a little bit of crystals
Oooo
I FUCKING LOVE THAT
IT HAS FUCKING CHRISTMAS LIGHTS
and HER BAZOOKA
I want her fit
wait the top ones really cute
ye ye
yeah lol
yea
She doesn't work too well with Geo though, I guess
So, most hydro units are pretty good
Hydro's one of the most flexible elements
She works well with vape, dendro, and Freeze
She's just universal
Everyone
I believe
Then Freeze team! go for it!
To make the ones you do shine
Even if you end up pulling for characters you don't
Then Build around what you do like
hmmm
I have all Hydro characters except for Mona tho So I'm biased
I have her
Yelan's great yea
A given character will have multiple comps
If you want to make them strong you can just look for comps that you like
Genshin isn't too hard so pull who you like
this is also true
tho
dendro traveler in unironically good
so valid
but she's not a requirement
I mean, Nahida *does* make all dendro characters better
You don't need Nahida for that I don't think
he's sorta my best built character
Poggers, I need to invest in a burgeon/taser team for him
True
ye
If Fischl/Yae
Probably okay in Hyperbloom too?
ye ye
Not too good in freeze iirc
He's good in reaction teams
Ayato is flexible
Yeah
Xiangling?
it does
good point, I'd say just wait for the day and figure it out from there
uwu
THAT'S JUST HELL
yes
I mean more primos means you might be able to get others
True, but Maybe still save? just in case
yeah....
yeah...
Hu Tao is just painful without c1 and Homa....
I'd love to play with you
I've benched my Hu Tao....
Valid,,,
Why pull Scara when you can make strong team stronger
I'd say save your guarantee for Shenhe thne
So not her only function
With ttods and tenacity she contributes a lot of buffing
She makes Ayaka do more and is the Thing that allows freeze
If we're talking support then Yes
Kokomi with clam set does 10% but if you have her full support it's more like 5%
iirc
Shenhe and Kazuha's individual damage are basically the same
the damage is like this, Shenhe/Kazuha does like 30%, Kokomi is 10%, Ayaka does the rest at 60%
Shenhe does like,,,,
That's incorrect?
Uhm
true
yeah
ooo....
If I don't manage him I'll go for Raiden cons
On main I'll be going for him
Dude can fly, Exploration has never been this easy
Amazing
Top Tier
Exploration Meta?
I will mention tho
Although, I think it'd be funny if people, especially Scara fans, called him trash because of this
But not Meta breaking'
Respectable and powerful
Ayaka or Raiden
Then like
in terms of dps
Yae or Yoimiya?
Scara is probably just going to be like
But still
Now with Dendro and other stuff she's gotten a lot better
She had stricter team comps, you're right
I imagine it's the same for Scara
SSS tier
compared to
S tier
Miko's pretty good though, but she's just like
(X) Doubt
One of the best dps's in game?
Over Ayaka?
But
I think Scara will be a very good dps
thanks !
My EU holds so many favs...
I'M SO HAPPY
I GOT YAE MIKO ON SIDE
Oh dear,,,
right
People,,,,, use spotify
Wow
Pffffff
figured
Lol
....Although I do love it like it's my real name
Mine isn't Citrine
Yeah, Is your real name Bruh?
hm?
I prob will
Yeah,,,
And,,,,,, HRT really means something else to me-
Association in my brain very strong
Okay, I know HRT is just the new Bronya's acronym but
I'd like to think this is a mix of common sense and being a coward
These are usually Mutuals
Anyways, I am A loser and I see other lesbians on twitter and such going around saying how they want a gf and I very quickly imagine asking them out and maybe dating only for me to realize that they probably would not appreciate if I said anything
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
yeah kinda
I've not got a lot going for me in terms of dateability
I mean, I like stable relationships and I try to form the baseline of a stable relationship quickly probably cause I get fixated obsessive and also because I'm painfully aware that People are more likely to leave then not
Yeah,,,,
It's always messy trying to enter one
They can....
Naruhodo
my idea of fun
I want to do things and have fun and that's sorta
Like
I am a whole person but
I mean it's not that I want to fill a gap necessarily
*sighs*
Perhaps that's a fault...
I just want to act couple like always
I just always jump into things And Immediately want to do the whole shebang like nicknames and all of that jazz
I just get attached easily I think
Yeah,,,,
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
But it's probably not that.
Wondering if the Problem is Me
radio silence
Every relationship I've had ends in not receiving any kind of messaging
Not like any of my partners have necessarily been bad but
I'm starting to feel you I think
To find one irl, out in the wild.
I don't have any place I visit enough.
Good for her.
I see.
Hmmm
Anywhere has only gotten me a broken heart, Heki
Anyone know where I could look for gf's?
Not when you have the worst luck
*sighs*
Are very compelling
Naps....
Unless,,,, Hmmm,,, I mean
I shall not sleep tho because I need to be awake methinks
And why I still want sleep
Which makes my recent coma make more sense
I've gotten taller
So yea
Another thing is that I've gotten skinnier so that also makes me think that
Cause I definitely grew looking at myself I believe
I might be taller then that now
Well
And we're both 5'9
Turns Out My father has shrunk
5'11
So I've thought I was 5'10 to 5'1q
Which btw, I'd been using my father as my ruler for height cause there's been no other way to measure myself
Height
My balance is Usually better then that lol
Including me Toppling over nothing and almost falling completely over several times
Unsure tho but all of the signs are there
Although for me I think I might've grown again
Just blame the weather
I mean, I blame the weather for my shitty health so
I see
It's that it's suddenly cooler nkw
So I dont think that necessarily it being Hot is whats doing it
Extreme changes in weather tend to be what actually causes my energy levels to sink
Extreme weather conditions do that
I think I've contracted sleepy bitch disease
Lol
That was it
To eat
I was awake for like an hour maybe around 4 to 5
I accidentally fell asleep at 7 am and Only really woke up at 10 pm
Straight through it
Like
I slept during the day
Hahaha
Sup, I'm up at the hour that this server is mostly active But Not any of my other servers
So valid and have fun

Goddamn it
OH

KLMJNHBUNIJMKO

I have no say in this because I just think improvement is nice
Jesus christ-
MOJINHUIJMOKL,VRVR
Just study Musical Theory
even if I sort of know what they're doing
myself
I just have a difficult time Applying it
Yeah,,,
right, I was thinking more,,,,, dark souls? in terms of color and vibe?
Like,,, His art is very Ink and black and white
Then what I'm looking for,,,
That's a different vibe
Hmmm
horrifying, ig
I want to make my art more,,,,
like colors and certain things?
anyone here know tips for making art creepy?
It's not a film at all-
Yes
yea
Thanks ;;
I want a gf that will actually love me <3
Elysia, can I have a Love Life Luck blessing?
CUTE
That's really good!
DANG
Either he misremembered a title or is in on the bit
All you need to know is Martin Scorscee like, just accepted that he made the movie that doesn't exist
I don't have the time for that
I should do more Research but alas
The history is hard to track and that's what I've heard
Anyways
nibhyugvyubhnjikl
N-
that got accidentally printed onto a shoe
It was like, a frankenstein of things
I think
Which was a miss spelling of Gomorrah? Which is like, a tv series from way before that
Uhhh
Goncharov comes from a shoe
Okay, so it sprung *from* a real movie
It's not real at alll
I WANT
Nooooooo
Anyways, Stan Goncharov 1973
not entirely sure
I think I never made them
I did too
Yeah
that you were incasing them in stone?
And I don't wanna pick it up again without my old account
but then I had to stop playing
I played Dragonvale for a long time and I was a really high level
LISTEN, YOU GOTTA BE AWARE OF THE JOKE TO MAKE IT BETTER
LPOIJUH8YG7TYUHIJMKL
Tumblr made it
It's a made up movie
Goncharov isn't real
Abandon the joke real quick here
I will
Heki
,,,,
So
KOJNIbhunijmkl,
This bitch hasn't watched Goncharov
I am apparently Masc as hell
Honestly I almost feel that's accurate Tet
I can make it when he wakes up <3
NEXT TO THE KITCHEN
WAIT I CAN'T IT'S ALMOST 3 AM AND MY FATHER SLEEPS IN THE LIVING ROOM
No, but I could  make it
I am now
I am not Italian
AWWWW YEAAAA
sadge
then again, maybe that joke was made after this quiz was made
aw man they don't have my favourite goncharov quote
Fics
572
There is, actually
There's 800+ That Reference Goncharov
like, Oh wait, there's less because of how I filtered it
hyes
No, I do not unfortunately
I know it exists
Yes
or wait, that's not enough for a masterpiece that's been out for like 50 years-
there's already almost 1,000 fics
What is it with people and Goncharov?
DAMN
Tbh
I'm so invested
SHOW SHOW
kojuHYBNIJM,;
the others don't seem to be references tho
naruhodo
ahhh
I can totally someone 100% making this from nothing
like they aren't exactly specific enough to not be the kinds of shots you'd see in other movies except for the last one I'd say
Although, they could actually just be normal movie shots
Yea what movies-
JN HBGBJNK
THOSE ARE SO GOOD WHAT THE GFUCK
DANG
hBJUNKMLJNHBKL
Maybe then I'll do something and feel less bored
I want some sort of hysteria to fall over me like those who created Goncharov
Kinda bored
I am alive
hewwo
Tohru...
maybe?
they mustve fucked with the perms?
*pats*
so sick
playing anything
felt like

I know I should be grinding for Kanade and Ena rn on jp

gimme free food
I would not object to that tho, I don't have money
i think they mean rescue you not take you out for a nice fancy dinner
today's a day for glitches huh
mean aster is canon but lying aster is not
why in the world would aster lie about that anyways
I think discord is just fucking up
I don't think Aster;s lying
??????
but rather discord doing a fucky
Not aster's fault
So
Of the same gif
Aster only has one copy but it keeps sending different copies
I think what's going on is that discord is Hiccupping
,,,
I'm sure you wont
Noooooo
oof
hey aster
Cant love if you're constantly in finacial stress
Is it bad that I recognize the art that they used? (Well, it's a fanart and I dont know the exact source but-)
God,,, fuck prager u
When it comes to cosplay I've kinda always wanted to cosplay Durandal...
Got Layla \o/

Dead*
Do your parents want you die?
I am going to try to sleep
I hope Heki gets okay care
Oh boyo
I've been sick my whole life tho
Some mild ones when my body is weakened by other things
I'm experiencing the small oncoming symptoms mainly
No end in sight and generally It gets much worse
Nop3
It'll just be there until I die!
So it wont kill me
Also, Chronic isnt Terminal
Why do you think I'm going to the doctor
Then it's Like, 80% that I've got Fibro
Then when my health is this shit and I'm experiencing some of the symptoms
Well, I'm pretty sure I do, anyways, If my Dad has Fibro, my Mom has Fibro, My Sibling has Fibro
This is all to be expected
But yeah, I have a chronic illness so
But I dont think my lungs have gotten the memo
I would like my Lung's inside my body, not out
I get them like,,, almost daily
God I hate coughing fits tho
But I understand
,,,well, do not
And forget to take them
Although I'm A Dumbass
Def
Daily pain meds help
Oh yeah
Cant be In Pain if you sleep

*blinks*
Nyaruhodo
Hei seems to be fine,,,, not as insane as some other people around
League reference?
we;re in the same hunger game district
ye, you're cool
uwu
Clearly, I like Aster
jeez thanks
I don't mind talkin to you more, Heki
<:catblush:963351912235810826>
Do you like me?
I go by citrin pretty much everywhere but,,,, Some places I go by Chisa
cute!
I say that but I'm merely normal compared to the insanity that is other people
Anyways, Hello, Lumi, I'm Citrin, one of the most normal ones here.
lol
Lumi is a popular name
tru
FUCKING FELT
Methinks
Not going to ask further
I'm
I seee
,,,,,
H
WHAT
Get it right
That's actually being xenophobic
In terms of my actual twitter I'm a Fu Hua/Bronya mutual
Rude
I plan on that account to roll for her c1 on her next rerun
Anyways, My side account really needed Nahida so I'm glad I got her
No
I see
Hgjdjekeke
On my EU account
I've been grinding primos for 4 days now for her
I do not understand the emotes being used
*sobs* Finally
I'm doing it for Nahida
I just started the Aranara quest on my side accoint
So cute
HUIYUE
YASSSSS
y'all forget condoms and gay sex exists
No Tai
no nono, it'd only stop reproductive sex, wnich sucks for those who has breeding kinks but-
I believe we should stop producing bad people
I'm talking about this rather then primo farming lol
but not honkai lol
We are talking about the Word
But In General they just tend to have people treating people down on their luck like lesser beings
For example, the stigma women have against men on dating apps tends to make them more cautious and has prevented deaths
Only if the stigma just so happens to be a logical one
Not,,,, Exactly?
Sorta, but they go hand in hand
A good example of a Gay stigma is that They try to turn others gay by flirting with straight people
Gay still is somewhat of a stigma,
even if you weren't
true, but the stigma against the mentally ill is still in play
I'd say so?
*nods*
Although, it's rarely logical
yeah
even if the teacher goes through the years of prison and is out and reformed, people assume the person will rob again
yeah, pretty much,
and people will distance themselves from you if you have that mental illness
It's like,,,, If someone has autism the stigma is that they are stupid and hard to deal with
yeah
yea
I know people will hate and do hate him lol
Oh yeah, that's fine,
what does this mean? <:wokege:966623232918712331>
Yeah, pretty much
Is it bad if I like scaramouche as a character and like his kit but don't lust after him? I just think he's kind of neat...
Yeah, pretty much
Yeah,
It's purely negative as far as I'm aware
Nope
yeah
No
in that meaning, social stigma  isn't rly a meme btw
it has a similar meaning to stereotype
genshin is driving me crazy, just give me my Nahida
I am at c3 bennett and by the end of this I think I will gain c6
I think I will snap and murder someone
There's no end in sight but I do know that eventually I'll get nahida if I keep at it <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
This close to a 5 star
I'm starting to realize Hell is grinding the piddly amount of primos chests give to get a solo to get nothing but a blue when you're just
Going insane grinding primos on my side Genshin account ♡
Is that c6 Bennett? Also, no Nahida yet, I see
I knew they probably wouldnt respawn since they had no reason to but lol
I checked it once, the chests
Oh noooo
55k hp with a lvl 20 Key lol
All I know is that I got Nilou to lvl 90 today
Yeah, not every character has tgat
For now, my focus is on Nilou
I'm pulling for her on side, tomorrow I'll be grinding a ton of primos on side for her
I shall get going
Congrats!
Still lucky
Tho
Sure! I'll be completely mutef
*hugs back* Dw, I'm not in active pain but I'm exhausted even after sleeping a ton
Morning, I feel absolutely trashed
No more spending for a bit
Oh well
I spent like, a week farming primos
This was at hard pity lol
But I persisted
I got 2 5 stars before this
I ended up whaling for the last pull
I'm also missing B
not shenhe being pretty
this, I am referring to
Idk about that,,,
All I know is that I'm Legally obligated to pull him because of how me and my sibling are doing our accounts
I know multiple people who, unfortunately, are into that
me me want my nilou weapon
been playin genshin a lot,,,
Finally beat inferno, lets gooooo sw
\o/
Cause she's hiding and repressing her dark emotions
I'm not asking at this point
genshin just give me Nilou's weapon
a lot of them
*lies down* I need primos
Ig I should work on er with sushang...
Sushang, miss, I fear I've been too harsh on you, Please let me dedicate my materials on you
ON SUSHANG BANNER,
I FINALLY GOT SW'S WEAPON
My life is good
raven's so bad that even though she's more recent she's the one getting replaced instead of an older valk lol
when I finally manage to get all of ae's gear it'll be when she's fully out of meta i bet lol
i see I see
,,,,na
en has another hour I bet
sea?
Man,,, imagine listening to english popular music...
I don't really think that's in order but aight
Nfjekrke
Also, Please understand that they're about the same and none is more superior then the other
Lol
Yeah
It doesn't make More Sense then the American way of doing it (not just american's use this, btw)
Not with the numbers thp
,,,,,,,
The date ordering
It goes up, then down, then up again
Month stops at 12, days go up to 31
If you're talking about the numbers
It's really not
It's not?
Honestly, I dont think day monrh year makes more sense but I will say that's just influenced on where you grew up
Night tet
JSJJSKSKWKWW
This person must be 9 or 11
JFJDKKRKRKD
I see
Is there a non chibi version of that, and why does she have that expression?
Just whatever you think would fit me personality wise!
<@482139585355448333> assign me a fate outfit to wear
Also
Twas not
No
Celine? Christina? What are you talkin about?
I cannot smell but my lungs are weak so I dislike being around smokers
so valid
yikes...
He probably wants to die ngl
oh boy
Which is vry accurate
The funniest thing about this tho is all of the results told me I need therapy and are mentally ill
I see I see
I like that
Oho
My vibes are pink and thoughtful?
Next one...
Yae....
Ooo
Which one fits me better I wonder...
Kiana, Mei, and Yae Sakura
Last one
I'll take the last one now
KiaMei lovechild, I am
That was sent
For the first quiz
I know you are not the same person but damm
I HAD A FRIEND NAMED CHERRY WHO LIKED KANATA AND WAS AFRAID OF DOGS
Oooo nice
What is it with people named Cherry liking enstars btw?
I know his personality sucks but he's cute
That's the lil pink fucker
That I kinda liked
Eden had something iirc
Yeah, that's my feeling too
Valid
I never became interested in it
But the Music is Awful so
The characters are great and I feel like I would've been obssessed with it if the music had been good
And Mayoi
I also like Hajime and Tori
The queen herself!
I got Mao
I could never rly form a fav, I suppose it's Arashi tho
That's tatsumi and Kanata ye?
Omg Enstars?
Dont go there
No
Griseo, what's that Red paint made of-
Now that's quotable
JFKDJFJDJFD
Yeah
And it's illegal for the Doctor to talk to your parents about that info cause it's a breach of their contract, Heck even police tends to not be able to get patient records from doctors
But, in America, you can req parents to leave and your Doc to Not speak to your parents about the visit, even if it's not sexual stuff
Country*
Idk if it's this way in your countries
Gos
Literally wouldnt
They
18?
Arent you
Yeah,,,,
Oh yikes
Uti's.... yeah
Ye ye
That are not good
Cause things can happen down there that's Not stds
But you should like, once a year start to when you're 18
Only if you're sexually active
Probably soon
You will have to at some point
So what kind of treatment i got idr
All I know is that I dont remember a lot of my childhood because my adhd dropped my blood pressure so low that I got memory issues and shit
It's also humiliating to have blood drawn and then throw up afterwards
Ahhh
Tet, are you immunocomprimised?
God, you know what tho??
Yeah maybe
I also havent
THE FUCK DO YOU MEAN??
TET EXPLAIN??
WHAT?
One inch will cause me to yell cause if I gain a single inch everywhere I will cry and scream
I will
Dw, I'll make sure you live until Baizhu
Lol
I wasnt as sexual and I was just always on the verge of straight up leaving all of my servers of prob a bit dif from most teens. Was worse lol
All I know is I had more breakdowns as a teen so
Prob
JNRKRKDKD
Lol
<:HelloFbi:977468843884691456>
Are you implying Garfield and Jon Arbuckle are going to fuck?
,,,,
I try vry hard to be understandable
Lol tru
Lol
That's a good thing considering the quality of these quotes
Then again
Man,,,, I'm just not quotable huj
I see
Djkrkekee
Why does heki have so many quotes...
Heki...
Looking good
So
I think I only have one quote towards me and it was when I was absolutely hysteric cause of fear
Then again, that's cause I dont undedstand people well irl so I sorta have to ask
So
Well, I generally have always been blunt about how I feel about things
Felt
Felt
Fenri, just communicate alright
Indeed
I mean, thats cause you're pan and gender doesnt mean Much to you
Cause most transmen wouldnt date a lesbian
A lot of trans men I also saw on these posts saying Honestly that feels vry validating to me
If you still like that person romantically I'd say that you're either not as lesbian as you thought or Not thinking of them as a man
I've heard a lot of lesbians say the same thing
Yeah
Like, I'd still like them as a friend but I'd lose romantic attraction instantly
That's the way it is for most lesbians
I would not be dating them anymore
If a women I was dating became a transmen I would lose interest in them
I mean, I think Lesbian as a label as someone that doesnt like men isn't too strict
Cause I've been saying this While Including trans people into my thought
Does it tho?
Tru lol
That's just not right
Or calling yourself a lesbian while knowing you like men
That's sort of the deal
Exactly
Yeah
There's a transition of labels that happens
Yeah,,,, I mean, I called myseld bi before realizing that I wasnt
I mean, then that's a transition label, as long as you arent dating a man while being lesbian thats fine
Ye
That is true but I dont think anyone would in good faith call themselves a lesbian and be into men
Yea
Sorta but again, There's a sort of, You do need to comprehend what it actually means
Yea
Lesbian is one of those
And Ace
Like Aro
Yeah yeah
Yeah
Why use a strict label anyways?
I mean, If you're a fluid person I personally think there's better labels for you to use
Genuinely!
It is
They just *aren't* valid
So like
Irl
Cause that's in actuality how I'm seeing it being used
*and* excluse transwomen
Cause it's a sneaky way to say they're only attracted to the genitals so they get to include transmen too
That's also actually what people are using the label for
Like
Some people are using the bi-lesbian label, in fact most people, are using it to be transphobic tho
*Puts a blanket over you*
Men
Men do not get involved
Who is a lesbian
A demigirl
Yes, They can be because they've Never excluded Nonbinary people and *I'm*
The Label isn't fluid Kei
*vomits*
Like, unironically, I've seen people use that on Lesbians
It's disgusting
I've literally Seen that on Twitter
*Yeah*
*And Lesbian is not one of them*
That you can use!
There *are* flexible labels
Yup!
That literally is what's happening here
*sighs*
And thats fine
When they aren't interested!
Once again, Men are trying to make women into them ♡
*YOU GET IT*
Okay, Keilo, so when Lesbian means that people still think I like Men it means that Men will flirt and try to get with me and be gross towards me when I told them I'm lesbian and they'll try to get with me
The Labels themselves need to be
Which, also, I feel like you're not listening to a Lesbian about this, I'm literally in a lot of lesbian circles and groups and Bi-lesbian's, straight-lesbians are Super invalidating to us
Yea
Keilo, It's *not* the same issue. Lesbian's have always been Separate from Bisexual women. And also,,,, If we don't get lesbian then *what* do we get?
Same
Tbf you Started this off with an Insane sentence
Which is why I listed 2 things before that
Yeah
They aren't, people in the bi-lesbian community are saying they're valid
JUST SAY YOU'RE BI, SAPPHIC, OR QUEER
Lesbian's (including myself) Are so Fucking done with it
That's the issue
Yes
*PEOPLE ARE SAYING YOU CANNOT LIKE WOMEN AND BE LESBIAN*
PEOPLE ARE SAYING YOU CAN BE A STRAIGHT LESBIAN KEILO
Yea, Lgbt idenities can be Messy but in that case dont use a label that's specific!
Well, they aren't, and the issue is is that Lesbian's wouldn't have a label to describe their experience if Lesbian's can like men too
THATS COOL
I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THIS BOY
She still seems like an awful person, with the Lesbian thing and the Dating someone whos that much younger then her
HEKI??
Tai, I hate to tell you this but your friend seems awful
RN
SHE NEEDS TO GET AWAY FROM GIM
NOPE NOPE NOPE
If Bi women start calling themselves Lesbian then,,,,,
That's the issue
Lesbian do not like Men
THIS
oh, no the problem is the stealing of the Lesbian label too
Oh?
Also, that's an 8 year gap
They should break up, I'm 19 and I would not date a 27 year old
OH MY GOD NO
yeah, tell your friend to no longer go out with him
PFFFFFF
Yes?
UwU
That's true, but I have a Dps Barbara so I was pointing that out lol
Just steal it, she's a lesbian she doesnt need a boyfriend
I don't ♡
Can't Bi people just Say They're Bi
H
Lesbian's don't got boyfriends?
I'm just waiting for someone to point out who has what weapons on my account cause its a mess
Damn,,,
So I need the boost
I pull for weapons cause my artifact luck sucks
The amount of pain in this list
Jesus
My acc on main is better but I've got a lot of copium going on
Uh
So ug
My EU sux
You should friend me!
Just coming back
Oh
Are you starting Genshin?
His weapon is at lvl80
Now
He has 87cr and 205cd
And yeeee
So valid
Unsure About That but I'll be attempting a lot for her
I put it on Ayato because I've been hearing that you dont need crit stats for Nilou
JADE CUTTER
it was worth it tho
I got ice cream cake for two birthdays and ended up feeling incredibly sick
You deserve both
cause it's in May
at least you dont have to worry about my birthday for Awhile
all I can say is is that I hope for Aponia summer outfit to fall into my hands
the more tired I am the more vague I get
Although that does sound like me
Lol, I'm glad then
so I barely remember what I wrote
I didn't get a good look at all of the outfits before I submitted in mine half asleep
Oh, there's someone in this server named HoSHaver
I see
DID YOU MAKE TWO SUBMISSIONS HEKI?
WHO IS HEKI THEN
who's heki 2 btw
Or diff Kei?
Keilo?
But I doubt
UNLESS IT IS GRESH
I doubt it was any of them
Although, Luna, Gresh, and Evn are all missing from that list
I have a feeling it's not a person who talks often
daniel could be a lurker
Prob dont have enough but I'll try
Aponia skin...
As long as Gear That I need exists ig I'll be fine
And see what's there
I'm just gonna wait for the new update
It is lol
Human pet guy.....
Dang
You're awesome Tet ily
ROOD
lol

i can be stubborn but i sure as hell don't work hard because that's hard
I have Dogge?
maybe
oho
More crystal farming time ig
Ic
Anyone know when the next Honkai patch is?
So glad that my screens never seem to shatter
Lol
I draw with a computer on my touchscreen laptop
Toxic air
Must breath
I, No longer
Too*
I would go insane if I was let into the beta toi
We will miss you
Rip Boo
Ndkskdkss i see
Listen to me
Go home!!
Do 1
Lemme change to 1
Oki
Oho boy
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
actual homophobe?
Oh Marisa's an
:(
what the fuck
Lol
It's that simple
I got it guys, enter the marisa server and try to talk about g*nder but censor it/try not to use the word and you wont get banned
Including actual babies
Can use baby for anyone
Damn, these bitches in the marisa server stupid af
It's literally the lack of one lol
Agender isn't a gender
Yeah
So
Well, idk, his name has color
OHO
I mean I am now, i need to eat
oki
ye
ic ic
do it
Uh- huh, sure,
Ahh, so that's why there's Nazi imagery
Little Spee?
I- is that?
I see I see
Or a termite
That looks like a tick to me
Huh!
Kronii is genuinely insane methinks
Then again I have trash artifact luck so </3
I've got 200 crd and an em goblet but there's only so much I can do with half wanderer and half electro set without his weapon
I need to figure out his best team
I thankfully had 2 other people's worlds to steal from
Scarab's...
UEAH
JDJJFJFJD
So valid
(I also dont make bad decisions elsewhere)
(Granted, I dont make the best decisions either but I'm casual so it's all good)
There's others that are worse
Heki's trying to prove that he's not the worst decision maker
JTIFKKFD
Oho
Heki watching other people make bad decisions like Hey, I thought ***I*** was the bad decision maker?
That's one good thing about that
So
At the very least, Heki's not involved
Then that.
High school students should,,,, be,,,, more careful,,
Essentially
Soap Opera drama
It's like
Part of me is sad that I never went to a physical high school and part of me rejoices that I'll never have to be met with such intense stupidity ♡
My condolences
All I can say is I don't want to be in 30 feet radius of either of those people
A LOT
That's
Yis, well, it will be soon for me
I just ate but I'm still hungry
Oof
Jesus fucking CHRIST
But I love the kanade
not as pretry
I have that entire set
fuck yea
I LOVE THEM
JDJJEJEJSS
It requires you to do it *lot* thougj
It can!
you should eat
*fuck I forgot to do abyss*
True
Oh well
Haha
*I probably wont have the money to buy this until it might already be gone if this is limited*
Of course
Thanks!
I don't imagine this will cost more then 35$ total but we'll see, at least when I buy this I'll probably be able to afford it
Mostly cause I'm not getting something like, heavy or something that will weigh like anything lol
Air shipping is preferrable yes
I'd love to check out actual product price but too tired and sleepy to figure out site completely
Alrighto
Less likely tho
12 to 15$'s maybe? Still might be 20$
Still expensive but
It's a small glasses case
Shipping probably wont be too much then
I see
I'm aware lol
I mean, yeah
Hopefully the case isnt more then 10$ and shipping is only about 20 at most
I probably wont
Ye ye
Thank you
Huh
I see I see
Ahhh
FOR IT
MOSTLY BECAUSE I ACTUALLY NEED A GLASSES CASE AND I'M FUCKING GETTING ELYSIA
Case
When I have Money I am buying the glasses cade
Oki!
Aw shit, do you need to have a cn ssn to buy this :(
HTANK YOI
Someone tell me idk where on mihoyo's site this would be
Is the Elysia Glasses Case, How much money is it
Much Money
How
GIMME
I WANT THAT ELYSIA GLASSES CASE
Going on
Whats
CYNO AND CANDACE OBTAINED
I'll have enough for the dorm supply spending event
The monthly shop resets soon and the the version dorm cards...
4 dorm supply cards for 6.1 owo
it's okay...
Even tho,,,,, Seele,,, has been forgotten about by Mihoyo....
I mean,,,, Let us Cope aight?
you mean
Seele holding Bronya for the last time
,,,,It'd be funny tho
Wait, Seele with a claymore
Seele with a Catalyst
Seele with a sword...
Hydro Archon Seele
Probably
(Let me cope)
It'll be here just in time for Natlan
ye ye
Not Himeko
No no
right right
a pale brown but
I mean. the Murata in the webcomic was brown
SHHHHHH, LEMME COPE
I am pulling for him (sort of)
true, I like his kit
We haven't seen a Single Natlan npc, they're just hiding the melanin in the closet (aka Natlan)
I have Hope
The character in Natlan's demo looked darker then Xinyan and Kaeya
*praying that they listen in time for Natlan*
KOJUNHYBGUHJOMKP
The mishmash isn't *great*
Yeah, I think the biggest sin is probably the skin tones tho
lmao
Inazuma,,, being mostly Japan until you suddenly have Greece underneath
It's not even just Germany
Mondstadt is a Frankenstein of Europe tho
Agreed!
other then that it does seem to try to treat the material it works with with respect
My biggest criticism of Sumeru is the general mish mash of cultures instead of picking one or two and the lack of darker skin tones
It's a Persian Dancing outfit iirc
Yeah
The persian outfit just generally has less stomach showing
The outfit is too
Incorrect
Yeah, it's at least to the point that persian people are saying that her outfit looks persian
???
Nilou's outfit *is* Persian???
Night Aster
Good!
Heki, you insult or say anything mean about Aster and I will destroy you
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
*This is why being broke sucks*
So you could get Ganyu
I'd comm you
Aster, if I had money
But ya know
Also dnd session
I must obtain Candace
Candace and Cyno
**Today**
*wakes up*
Posts like these make me think Sora is back :(
Heki, please be quiet until you learn to not use slurs
I hope you get a good grade
Good luck with Calc HW!
I see
Baban, do you need help Bullying Heki?
Nice!
someone needs to be positive about your own life and if it's not yourself good fucking luck bud
lol
It just makes life worse
I mean, if you're negative all of the time,,,
yeah
yeah,,, I can,,, see
Lol
Heki: I'm not racist!
Heki: But I do say the n slur
So
What?
And Racist?
Not okay?
That's literally
Heki
Gaslighting you
So? We're not
,,,,
Now I'm confused
Did you actually say one?
Acting the part?
We wouldn't say it if you weren't...
Heki, why do you have to say that so often
~~we don't talk about mona~~
Am going for ☆All Hydro☆ characters because me like water, slurp slurp
Might attempt Cyno too but that depends on how long Candance takes
So I have a large amount of crystals for her, thankfully
I 100% all of the events tho
I still have like, 36% of Sumeru like,,,, exploration, I havent done much of sumeru
And am at 25 pity
I have 9k crystals for Nilou
Thankfully, Genshin is going a lot better
I'm just doomed
I couldn't get mobi skin because Of lack of crystals...
I would've gone for her If I didn't priortize Getting the valks I own their Gear
*cries*
*sighs*
Maybe when I can get an actual income...
I have 1.57$ to my name
And my valks in turn are missing gears even If I have luck getting them
I can't pull because my funds are small
I can't save because my accounts not good enough
This is why on the outside it looks like I only make bad decisions tbh
<:rozano:963353554532319252>
I dont have any weapons, I only get stigs I dont need
*at least give me the weapon's*
I am Not Getting all of the gear I want But I am going to try ☆
I am at 5360 crystals ♡
Either wah
YEAH I GUESS
Because Honkai hates me
True, I Don't make the best choices but Also the Choices I make are trying to gear what I have and Failing Miserably
Same ♡
I only get off rates
And I *still* only have her weapon despite pulling for her gear ♡
That's when I had saved a bunch when Mobius came out
: )
I have gotten 6 copies of Starlance prime pulling for Mobius gear
Is the thing, I'm just gear unlucky
I'm just extremely unlucky with gear
Also
What valks are necessary anyways?
I might start trying in the future when I have hof or something
Yeah, I don't mald
I'M NOT THAT BAD
At that point
Or Mobius
....I guess...
I guess I'll rely on abyss crystals...
*sighs*
Which I'm saving for
Which is next patch
Until somehow I can get the gear I need
So I'm sorta stuck
Which is why I dont use her
Idk
Not in ER apparently
SW just hates me ♡
The biggest Bait Of All time
I don't need them
I dont pull for Valks I know I can't gear, you know what, I think my biggest regret was fully gearing my Raven and Spina tho
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
MY CRYSTALS ARE WASTED ON DUPE GEAR
I DONT KNOW HOW
And I Keep Getting Them
I only use the tickets
I rarely pull for valks
I'M ONLY MISSING HOF
I GOT APONIA ON A SOLO AT LOW PITY TOO, LEAVE ME ALONE
Instead.
The reason I have no crystals is that I pull for SW's weapon every single time it comes back and I keep getting her stigs
Anyways
Lol
Unlike Heki
At least I got something out of it
I mean
I wasnt building pitu
I just did one for the fun of it okau
YEAH ONLY ONE
I did not intend to get VillV
I just did 1 solo at 98 pity man
I have No Skills
I know you can Literally beat ER with Mobius with no gear
I mean, isn't that really hard?
....Lol
I don't have crystals for that
And...
....I'd need her gear tho...
Is that the only option?
I've been keeping up with abyss tho so there is that
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
But I *can't* get er crystals
I need ER Crystals
There in lies the rub
Next patch
I'm skipping this patch to Actually Gear My Valks
Thankw
I didnt have the crystals by that time due to ER difficulties
Maybe, I haven't spent anything on hoh
I GOT HER ON A SOLO
I have all ER Valks aside from HoHE, HoF, SN
This is my gear and valks
Valks
Lemme show my
Uhh
But I know that if I have the crystals for next patch I'll be able to make it easier
I'm having trouble getting past ER with my current gear
I have a conundrum
sure, idk if I can join call atm so... uhhh, do we have a channel that we can put screenshots?
Well this is an interesting conversation to wake up on
So I'll have to get back to you on that
There's several things that could be but my brain is Malfunctioning
Maybe prsk servers are down?
NOOO
I play too many games for my phones storagr
oki
*pats*
mushroom...
oho
what soup are you having?
I have no idea
oho
Yes, I would love it
so valid
You have gotten the closest to the truth then anyone else has
I've probably done about the same amount...
btw can we have a Aster praise channel? cause they are very smart
FUCK SAME
I am no longer asking
Give me your weapon
SW....
I Feel you with that
THAT'S THE WORST
RIP
are you pulling for weapon or stigs?
oof
for the record, 1/4 fish, 2/4 Eden, 1/4 Aponia
sinful 3 lol
but I understood the rotations
although the lack of gear made my score bad
very easy
sushang is def tailor built
Lemme check
her paralyze was easy to apply
Well, Eden was the mvp
even with that fact I got 3rd
she only has one stig
speedran the abyss with my 3 star weapon aponia lol
that's a lot
Damn
Sure
?
I just have fibro
NOOOO
NOOOI
My coping is to Ignore my problems until I don't feel anything anymore ✨
I'm unsure if I want to listen to something like that
But that's just my current situation
Sure
Listen, Is it as painful as my Will they Won't they with someone who doesn't know if they like me but wants to try it but still isn't really in a relationship with me so I don't know what to Call Our relationship?
nyaruhodo
Jesus, y'all are quite a lonely group of people
That's cute
Oh! Baban has a lil crush on someone?
like an irl person?
who?
and then that ominous role name...
I was wondering why Baban was suddenly red
what am I
Tet can be your god-mother?
Baban can divorce Heki
You know it's simple
I can't handle some graphic content,,, I just watch video essays these days
yeah
so I imagine Heki couldn't click away on time
Things on tiktoks fyp just auto play
ohhh wait what the fuck
Say what exactly?
ah
whoa what happened?'
night tet
Tbf I was doing a few things before fully joining
ahhh, I didn't check chat lol
well, I left for a bit because you were gone and I thought y'all had moved on to smthn else
the only one tho
I was there!
but I think maybe only 4 people are
I mean, I'm willing
oki
if not drink water
So that might help a little
Lemons are natural anti-nausea fruits
if you feel nausea maybe think about having some Lemonade?
good idea
Take deep breathes Heki, don't open that again
That's...
Oh god, Yeah
that's
Heki, I'm so sorry you had to see that, brain's are uh,, very,,, not pink inside the head but yeah
fucking YIKES
it scared the hell out of me last night tho cause I wasn't ready lol
I am for the most part
Thanks
It Will cause a lot of pain and limited ability to do things
But uhhh
it won't kill me
anyways, i'm good for this I think
both my parents and my sibling has it and I'm showing all of the signs lol
Tis what I've got, very likely anyways
Chronic illness, Fibromyalgia
i'm still recovering from last nights Fibro attack but I'm good
sure
Gotta go back to sleep
I guess i just
Yeah
Jelp
I woke feeling cold and nauseous
I feel paranoid and sick
Your art looks nice tho :O
Oho, sounds wonderful
But still, if You need any help, I am willing to offer it
So I'm sure she'll love it, dw!
Yeah, exactly!
Cause I know I get emotional when anyone gives me anything
I mean, fact is, you did something for her at all
I guarantee you that she'll love it even if you dont feel like it'll be special
Feeling
Get over that
Sometimes it feels like your messages or gifts are lame or not special in comparsion to others and its hard to
That's understandable
I mean, I can help like, on wednesday
*pats*
You sure do draw a lot :O
nice
or well
Kaito looks pretty in this card
i'm fine with it
dang
Agreed
Yes
This chat is a Mess
....
Hooray!
Christianity is fuckin weird
Fucked up right?
Hard to describe... they're like, things that can be a figure and a ball
You know the Weirdest thing about Communion Wafers tho is that the Jesus part isn't exactly incorrect because it's technically supposed to be a part of jesus? Or like god that you're eating
Or like, the patch after that to get VillV
No, instead buy pulls for hoh
So
They're officially called Communion wafers
Where everyone goes in on sunday to do worship and then they get a wafer and go home
Worships?
Anyways, the reason why there's so many of them is that they're handed out to everyone during sunday like
They're legit, the best thing at a church
Yup!
You're so right
Omg same thought Cherry
The Amen implies this is the church biscuits
I'll see if I can think of any more events....
Thank you!
Yes
Specifically a Crab but I'm not picky
I would like an event where Elysia gives some helping supplies
it's not as simple as just getting another PE
Do you have the money for SS?
I was just playing Splatoon 3 man
OH MY GOD??
I am average
Everyone is very smart and good at honkai impact
RHE SHOULDERS LOOK GREAT ASTER
HOV IN ER
Oh Rigjt
I'm even saving my dorm supply tickets for 6.1
I believe
I can do it
30k crystals for Aponia skin and I have 3k rn
I am missing a lot
damn
Aponia, VillV, SW, and some others
Which I don't have the weapon for
and probably expa supply
it's anni patch too so spending outfit
6.1 patch has gears
I am not going for HoH because I need to gear literally everything else I have
hoh in 8 hours and i don't get anything but update crystals
any game
i have a hard time sitting down and actually doing story stuff for like
i've been busy and lazy
damn
honkai
*sighs*
I am having a hard time comprehending the map and getting places and I think all of the rewards for doing the story is disappearing soon
can someone do and finish the story for me <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
I believe in you
good luck aster
This is why I dropped out of school /i'm joking
Damn that's dumb
damn
I am simply a depressed bitch with no will to do a thing
I do not know how I appear or how I act
my head is empty so often
I don't even really know who I am because I cannot think well so I do not have stuff like that <3
Then it's a good thing!
So valid!
System is essentially the term for people who have multiple selves
Are you a system Taihen?
You can tell when people draw if they like men
they are neat!
*pats*
There is Technically another But He is Actually just me
the only men that have made me feel things strongly towards them
Yes, they are all emo
DOUBLE POSTED AKUTAGAWA WHY
These are the guys
komefvmovrv
For the record, The only guy in genshin that gets Close is Dainsleif
You'll see a theme when I gather them
Absolutely not
There is only like 5-ish fictional men that have ever made me feel the same way women do
Y'all are valid
you are so valid
<:fishwow:963697747473604638>
Just a guy!
I think Venti is a cute lil guy, he's just a lil dude
Me? :O
yea yea
uwu
sry
Not Romantically!
I am okay with every other gender <3
Either way, I'm a lesbian but in the way that I do not like men
Transwomen do not
I think the difference from femboys and transwomen is that Femboys do take the fem off
So rather then just dating a trans women you're stilling dating a guy
Femboy's are still Male
Not exactly
Bi people love everything
don't like how I look so I barely have any pictures of myself, woops
I
you shoulddd
indeedy
So cuteeee
sure sure
i'm not a fan of masc style anyways
I physically, cannot look masc
lol
well this is an interesting convo to walk in on
oki doki
I need VillV and Aponia gear tho
I have all of the flame chasers, currently
I have Aponia
Probably going to be bettet
And also the gear is
Should I save my crystals for 6.0 stuff (like if we're getting an expa supply) or for 6.1 for a chance at getting Summer Aponia outfit
Yeah
I dont think mihoyo would risk running their staff thin
I mean they do have that many games but i dont think they'd take up that many projects if it'd effect their other projects
So it ends up becoming a mess that is hard to watch
The lore is cool and so are the characters but they Don't know how to present it at all
Either way, I think they way they've chosen to do the story in genshin feels very half assed
Small indie company
I really feel like if they wanted world building over anything else, they should've gone the dark souls and Hollow knight way of telling the story
But it's really taken *this* long
Sumeru is a big improvement from what we've had
Pick one!
That's character focused!
They aren't!
And the issue is is that they arent focusing on world building in the main story!
Npc's dont need the attention they're getting
Because people will just pay attention to the characters
And because of how the story *is* nobody is getting developed and the world building isnt paid attention to
This is literally a problem
Genshin's story telling feels too disjointed. We have so many characters and it *feels* like they're supposed to be important amd Our traveller is literally the main character but they're placed on the same lore relevance as each other, heck, the npcs might get more
Genshin's world building Does Not get the Attention thk
But still, my point stands is that genshin lacks depth
Sorry
Lol
Oh i misread
I dont expect this for all Gacha games but this is *literally* mihoyo
All Genshin has is some Flavor
I think the thing is is that Honkai has juice and flavor to it's story and so many of it's side charactees
Just work with the genshin team
I didnt say take over
Maybe but also beginning Honkai is not hard to read
The dialogue would become so much more bearable and better
Why can't the people who write Honkai save the Genshin team?
I have a *big* issue with how they handle the story
GOD yeab
Wh
This ia about hating how Mihoyo is writing and treating the Paimon Traveller duo
About not liking Paimon
This is *not*
Tet
THEY REALLY LIKE MAKING PAIMON SOUND STUPID <:rozano:963353554532319252>
Yes yes
It gets grating over time
But the way she speaks and her voice is *not* good for exposition
I LIKE HER
LISTEN
I am Tired of hearing Paimon
Yea yea
The exploration is fine but the story....
I just think Genshin would be better if we could have a better story system and let the MC actually fucking talk
Yea yea,
Ahhhh
Genshin feels.... way more hollow then Honkai
...is it wrong that I kind of agree?
Hungry
I merely followed along
also, it's just Aster's request
valid
color the sketch
don't lineart
simple
Literally *no*
NILOU AND TESLA???
What
H
huh
things got better when I covered my ac unit and now the air purifiers has completely gotten my air ways to feel better
we've got the air purifiers out now \o/
but I breathed in a little too much
i didn't realize there was smoke in the air until I breathed in quite a bit, my windows are closed now
so the ash is flowing from there to here
There's a fire in the mountains, where I live
it's from breathing in the smoke
god my head hurts
lol
JhuBGYBHUNJIMKO,L
It's the Queen's punishment
Of course her baby is the Queen
Trisha is famous for lying
it's not volcanic ash so it won't be pompeii
yea yea
and the ash from the fire is raining down
There's a big fire in the mountains
Fun fact, there is smoke and ash raining outside
Change my mind
Minori is just lesbian Komaeda
Give An credit pls
But giver her some credit!
I mean I voted Elysia too
But
I mean, yeah, I suppose An isn't a literal god
Yes
Who is a women
To her partner
An literally says I love you
Only in our memories...
hrm
as for english artists
in terms of artists like me
Tuyu is probably my current range and sound
sure?
I cannot sing soft or normally
I think my range is quite varied, but I can only sing powerfully
She has a very specific style of singing that is not my voice, me thinks
Taylor is very much not my range or style
Then again, that's probably because I might have cough variant of asthma
My lungs fucking suck on a good day
I probably need that
how?
:O
They don't work properly
I think for me I need my Lungs
I'll be figuring out money soon
lol
I am the proud owner of a 1.38$ bank account
If I can get the money myself
I suppose I should instead, wish upon you the money to buy lessons
They are gay
and that kind of note is hard to hit without training
I wish you luck on that, you might need formal vocal lessons for that tho because they are *really* high
Alternate Reality Game
HUH??
Elysia is flirty, Merciful looks calm and elegant,
As well
Different eye color
Why are we bullying Aster? <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Dont mind me, just spamming elycrab to help my mental state
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
She's a parasite
JJFJDKDKDKDKDKD
warriors are your colors, or at least the one I associate you with
?
lol valid
That sucks
Tho
Yeah, we are taking our time, I do want it to advance
That's rhe relationship I've got
It's in the Dating but unsure if the feelings are quite there yet so we dont talk about it unless its with each other and for jokes
I am in a semi similar situation but We're also still kind of actually dating?
*Pats*
We'll see <:wokege:966623232918712331> my overbite is fucked
That really sucks man
Bbfjdjsjdjdjd
Unsure if I need that much tightening, I think the thing that will kill me is that I've been told that they might need to put a metal thing in my mouth to bring my jaw forward
OOF
You dont gotta but you're valid Keilo
Well, whenever I get braces <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I see...
Lol
Aight
Lol
Idk Taylor Swift but Blood Moon
Oh well, It'll be fine
My teeth are already sensitive <:kyoukaconcern:967581142641430580>
Only some every now and then
This is why I dont eat many crunchy things anymore
It is, actually
Yeah, I understand that I probably cant have any or many when having braces
A noble thing
because chips literally stab open wounds
yeah, i have to eat certain things slow or my mouth bleeds
oof
I really need to check, I think my current thing only covers cavities
tho
I can look around for it
I don't think so currently
<:kleeHeart:997543436456558623>
even if retainers suck
so I really want braces bad,,,
my teeth are digging into the roof of my mouth
oof
<:fuckingwhy:963697607690055711>
I bite my tongue constantly because of it too
I am Rating my attractiveness with the fact that my teeth are literally hurting my gums because of how fucked up my face grew in ✨
Not until my face is fixed with braces
and I have to wait to get that fixed
unfortunately, horomone's and puberty Fucked my teeth up
the only here that is unattractive is me because my face got fucked up while growing up and if it hadn't done that I'd be the prettiest bitch here
correct
Yes
plus naked? naked+mud, you're getting sti's
The Mud part is weird
Norse God's are cool
Yeah
Hot people problems
exactly!
agreed
tru
unlucky
You should look for more women then, I know a lot of women who aren;t horny
besides, fuck saying straight and cis is normal
lol
same here
remove the ugly part but yeah, there are unfortunately a lot of transphobes
being in a romantic relationship is really all about having a really close friend
who's to say that you can't meet someone that you fulfill the emotional requirements either
I mean, yeah I suppose, but That's not a You problem and not everyone is like that
If they end the relationship because of it then that person is trash
This is not hard
This reminds me, someone who is ace can enter a relationship with someone who does want and like sexual stuff but that person can still accept the ace persons wishes
yeah
People who want you do deliver yourself on a platter like that are wrong
There is nothing wrong with that
You are just a person who is slightly flirty
Can't meet what needs?
I mean, literally that is part of clarification tho
what comes afterwards?
Just make sure you level with them that it doesn't mean anything beyond friendship
You can flirt with friends
As long as you clarify that you're not looking for something deeper I think it's fine to do that
There's nothing wrong with not wanting that or not really feeling up to that
Also, being aroace isn't a bad thing !
You don't need to be Normal because what society says is Normal isn't always healthy
don't rush things
you can take things slow!
exactly
tru
I'm not sure what Love really is as I've never really experienced what the media explains it is
I, too, am weird with romantic relationships
And you don't need to figure everything out immediately
It's fine to feel the way you feel
also, Keilo, it
yikes
rip
?
I am wishing you a very hoh on the first pull
I need Money so I can have a life
For Gear
I need more crystals
in the gc?
Fen, are you being clowned on
i love this image too much to change it
sowwy
I'll just sleep away existential crisis
It's cool tho
I dont know who i am tbh
I
That is a whole ass year
7/11/2022
Of course, I understand everything now
Then I heard that Kiana was a clone so then I thought Kiana was Kallen's clone
I thought Kallen was Kiana's sister very beginning Honkai
They need a crab
This person.... rip
What does that mean
My Armada has a Low Fame warning?
:(
I've been wanting to watch that one
Oh that is sad
That's the Spirit!
This is a rhetorical question, no one prove me wrong
It's a Elysia, can anything Elysia be bad?
Obviously
Yes
I hope it spreads throughout the Honkai community
I think we have caused irreversible change to this server
Ye
I think I will eat and then tomorrow my schedule... there is a lot on it
Indeed... thanks
Maybe when I get a normal/regular doctir
Maybe it'll have a different effect
True, my sibling also mentioned that I've been off them for a solid 4ish years? My body has changed since then
Or I'd be taking them
Too bad adhd meds literally leave me like catatonic
It's something I've got to work on with my adhd
To all of that lol
Yea
Art is usually worth every penny
I need to learn to motivate myself so I can do comms quickly too, which is a good thing to learn
Thanks!
So valid
We all start somewhere...
Yea yea
Which is always good and nicr
Set*
Aesthetically they're cool and learning that would expand my toolsey
I mean, I wouldn't mind
Mostly because people in the furry community are just nice
Furry artists get paid well
Maybe I should learn how to drsw for the furries
I *really* gotta figure out my com situation
Yea
Yea
Currently, I'm worried about the lack of personal funds, my frailness, and my eating issues
I'm sure I'll find something for myself latet
I feel this sentiment right here
Ah well
I swing between whether or not It would've been better or worse
Maybe, but it wouldn't have been the same and yea
Nice
Sometimes I wonder if maybe I would've lasted/been better at a physical school
It was!
Didnt think that through
Hm, idk
Legit woke up like 10 to 5 minutes before going to school lol
That was me during school
Oh nice
Oh I see
I would've tried biking at that point
Oh fuck
NNDkkkdkdkskss
My apartments on a hill so <:grisob:975016058928914452>
My legs still hurt from that walking
It got solved when we came back, thankfully, but things were rough
JFKDKDKDKDKDOD
I was outside because of things that happened with my parents
Ye
Things have gotten a bit better, now that I am not outside of the apartment
Yea
And this has cheered me up
No Joke, I've been having a somewhat bad day/time
You have crafted my favorite image
Thanks babn
Here we go
Ely
uwu
So I'll figure it out for ya
Nah, I want to figure out how to stream my switch anyways
I do have new leaf but it's been.... *A long time* since I've touched i5
So that I can walk around and you can watch!
Then I'll figure out how to stream it?
Oh!
Then maybe sometime soon I'll let you come over
Well
But anyways, When I'm closer to finished with my island... <@148145559897636865> would you like to see it?
Good good
Oh !
Yet
Thing
Ban
I will soon, I'm on mobile and Idk if discord has fixed the dumb like
And my island is.... 20 or 30% lol
So far my house is like 60 or 70% complete
So I've been remodeling and designing it
I never really actually gave my island a proper like,,,, anything
But yeah!
But yeah, this is funny
Oh this artist has given me many existental crisis over ac
I've been working on my house and my island
I'm playin rn
Funny you guys are talking about it
Oh AC?
Soon...
Oh tru tru
Do I make it my pfp?
Yes
I think that image is my new favourite image
I love this sticker
*rolls around* I hate Waiting
I will spoiler it tho, because it is bloody
Oki, lemme post it in art city then
I want her gear
Aponia is great
I will have to send in the dms cause idk if Aster wants to be spoiled
I have finished drawing
*stretches*
for something for the dr proseka server
I've posted a fun thing in <#977588577720467546> and I've been drawing like all day
<@964806731471405086>  morning aster
AK?
It's LE
If we're talking about leader skills?
They should collab more yea
LE?
Crusher-P and TLT didn't know each other when Crusher made og echo
I believe that one's also the remix but yeah
it says so on the video
That's a Remix
Og Echo is on Crusher-P's channel
they did not make the og echo together
yeah....
this entire chat is a complete mess
twitter ai dumb
they are computer
the algothrims can't tell the difference
Carv's just has really odd timing
Carv does talk
No, I was in fact, raised pagan
Because jesus christ
for most sane
I think it would potentially be me
are you guys okay?
Me no like stiff rice
It is very crunchy
Mom accidentally didnt put in enough water for the rice
lol
vfbhnbvecw
so I didn't really have school friends
It's just I was also off putting so no one at school liked me
I was a loud and friendly kid
I had a lot of friends when I lived in a house that I went outside to play with
I learned like, when I was 6 or 7
if I could do that
maybe i'd get into a slightly better shape
i miss my bike
i miss my daily bike rides
yeah...
i don't think I'm ugly but I'm not cute and that hurts
And my face sucks too because of how fucked my teeth are so I cannot win when it comes to body image problems
*sighs*
last time I was checked I weighed like, 250 pounds
*pats*
I do mostly the same
*pats*
i am dead in spirit
no motivation
yeah,,,,
I want my bike back and to live in a neighbourhood where I don't see actual drug deals during the night outside of my room
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
*sighs* it's okay, it's probably just because I don't move basically all day
I don't really eat a lot and stuff but unfortunately I am still fat
lol
I can imagine
but when your body hates you this much it's all you can do
instead I go to prepackaged microwave food which is probably almost as bad
I can't eat fast food because it's expensive!
but that sounds pretty good,, actually,,
i would probably prefer it warm
pain-peko
My body hates food
THAT IS ME WITH MOST FOODS ELI, YOU GET IT
what is that?
chicken,,, fish,,,
sounds great
lol
And I already have acid reflux
almost everything I eat is 100% acidic tho
maybe that is for me
interesting
yeah that'll do
but paste?
because I don't like chunky tomato sauce
maybe I would like your countries cooking tet
I don't like normal tomato
Tomato sauce is great
??????????
WHAT
ASTER DOESN'T KNOW WHAT KETCHUP IS?
I wish my body allowed me to eat all of the cool things in anime and stuff
If I could eat normal soup I would...
i can just make spaghetti using bought spaghetti ingridents
rice cooker rice? yes, that is premium eat by itself rice
but like
i put prepackaged rice in ketchup tho
same
well, I haven't tried sushi rice but
Every other kind fucking SUCKS
JASMINE RICE IS BEST RICE
then again, that's just because my stomach is a little bitch and it settles better like that
kinda
I like it more porridge-y kind
I hate rice at restaurants
in america at the very least
there is microwavable prepackaged rice
find it again for me pls
ren and stimpy
cosmo and wanda?
although I've discovered rice cooker rice is wonderful
I can only have a specific prepackaged rice
which is odd but you know, I've accepted my tastebuds are not normal
the cake is usually what gets me
I will eat just frosting
Which is why I don't like chocolate that much anymore
Chocolate gets me sicker quicker then anything else
You can handle this?
like
They constantly ask to have a little bit of what I'm having and are just flavor blasted and shocked
Granted, I can handle more sweets then the rest of my family
OH OUCH
it's like, Oh the first few bites of this is nice and now I am sick
same
ew
I only lost it so much as I can't really eat as much of it in one sitting
equalvent exchange
give me your sweets
i give you everything sour of mine
be careful, eli, you could've blinded yourself
YIKES
Sour is my enemy
I handle spice way better then sour
Like, It's not like I die
for spice
Yeah, I also need a lot of water
WAIT THAT'S NOT RECENT THAT WAS DURING MY BIRTHDAY LIKE, WEEK AND THAT WAS A FEW MONTHS AGO-
and that I ate my salad and stuff
My grandma was recently impressed that I could eat beats
kvokefmvr3pbbt
Other then Pain
Taste like anything to me
it's just that it doesn't
I think I actually handle spice pretty well
You throw up now
It hates spicy and even if I want to like most foods that aren't simple and bland it goes
I have the worst food issues and sugar is one of the only things my body tolerates
i would like store bought lemonade then-
champagne is also bad
however, beer, wine, and vodka all suck
so it was not often in our house
I'm 19 and my parents were not very strict with alcohol, then again, it's not like I could buy any and they personally don't drink it often
maybe
Alcohol Makes me feel fat and Bloated
it has a really good cotton candy flavor
If I want something to fuck me up I'll just drink the base boosted energy drink Bang!
It needs to be Cotton candy flavored
or well
Fruity Cocktails is probably the only way I'm liking alcohol
I see
it was Bad
a sip it
or well
I have too
then again, I hate alcohol
God that looks disgusting
I need like a ton of flash drives
on my pc rn
the only thing is is that I don't have room
roms...
Finana Ryugu?
wish I had the money or the pirating skills to play fire emblem
so valid
I just know the Amalee version
I wish I remembered the lyrics directly after that
my brain does weird things in shower
back to serious, that sucks
sorry-
yeah maybe
my heart has felt a bit irregular lately
I've been having a few as well, actually
The Thought I had and what I still figure is that they either forgot that I existed or forgot I was an artist
yeah...
Like, I feel like I have to constantly remind people of my existence
I always feel forgotten
Idk
I suppose it just means I should draw more?
It Really Hurt
Like I know I don't post art enough but
That really hurt
i always feel forgettable by my friends tho, like someone did a draw in your friends style and this person didn't put me on even though we've been friends for a lot longer then one of the people they did add
yeah
I never feel good enough or well liked by other people, I always have to remind myself that if I went missing my friends online wouldn't just forget me and would be worried
Decent
of my abilities
I am just somewhat decent at everything and that is like the height
I never feel like I'm good at anything
*pats*
Like a mossball I just exist and do nothing
I've just always been floating by
I like, don't care half the time
I do not have motivation
I see someone better then me and I do not blink
High School
High school, Eli
And I will never probably be able to hold a job
I don't think you understand, I dropped out of school with failing grades
so dw
Out of all of us I think I'm the biggest disappointment
I see I see
what happened to wfp?
<:fuckingwhy:963697607690055711>
Me?
OH
I just have no thoughts, I talk to the people in my family because we are close and things are okay right now, I choose not to think about how fucked up our relationship in the past was
It is partially connected to the medication I took as a child which made me a zombie and fucked with my memory
I really want to remember things but like, I just can't
Whether I want to or not
My Brain Just does it
Oh no, i don't rely on it
When disability benefits get a lot better and I actually get on disability I will have a chance at living alone
I am unfortunately still very dependent on my parents because I cannot make money for myself
Because my method of coping is to Forget
granted, I don't really remember half of the bad things my parents did to me
Man, all of this sounds fucked up, my parents were messed up but in a different way and I still talk to them because they are a lot less fucked up now
lol
I need to actually play the story-
yipee
If we hacked into the game we wouldn't need to trade in the first place-
if there was, it would be an easy trade
Of course, there isn't,,, a trading system
I WILL TRADE VILLV FOR SW WEAPON
I'll trade you villv
Give me
THAT IS WHAT I'VE BEEN SAYING
I AM MISSING HER WEAPON
and her gear
I have her
weapon
I don't have sw
No.
the gear?
Use what?
I love sw
I don't like hor's playstyle
I don't have hor weapon-
so
I mean, I already have sw gear and her aside from weapon
I shall save and earn crystals for villv, aponia, and sw weapons
godddd
kmojinhubgvyftbguyhi
and for a long while she was The Most Needed Valk
not enough relevance HoFS still is useful?
Imagine doing things
lol
Also Aponia's gear
Oh good point!
I'll grind up some crystals and see what I can do
I'll see what I can do for gear because I've not got her gear
T and B? Alright
I probably wont exchange it yet
Which stigmata is her best one?
Time to figure out gear ig
Lol
But I dont have enough pity or crystals for guarantee
I mean, I'll try
Yea, Herrscher
I am probably not pulling much for hoh
WHY DOES THIS KEEP HAPPENING TO ME
I WAS AT 90 PITY
I JUST DID A SOLO FOR FUN??
Yea
Lol
For awhile leaks were like, a few hours before they were live but we've been getting them now a day or two ahead
Np!
Tomorrow if it's late
My guess is late today if its early
It should be today or tomorrow
These past two events have been earlier then usual
If you're talking about project sekai
They do
H
However, that particular example was bad
AK has more diverse designs then Genshin
Then Heki will be in Nirv
When Heki has a bottomleds wallet
dude's an idiot
Do they know what a 1 million$ concert looks like?
especially when I'm 100% certain that that concert cost Wayyyyyy more then 1 million are you kidding me?
what tech people actually recommend is taking your phone to a shop or trying to turn it off completely and taking it apart to dry
It is! If the phone still works then it dried well
that's a myth
oh putting your phone in rice doesn't do anything
I'll be 20 next year
then me I mean
only a year older,,,,
lol
Heki what's with your new role color?
I shoot shoot people with ink and they die, end of story
I play games, it's called splatoon
tru
lol
Oh nah I am jusr checking other things
I have Aponia
She does not
I see
At all?
???? Have you cosplayed before?
Neither of those cosplays would be hard to get out of
The only thing I'd hate is showing off my stomach
I have the chest to show off and I'm not really shy
For Prom I wore a very deep v and had an open back
Yes
Also, that is a large amount of money I dont have
Honkai clothing takes a lot of sewing knowledge to craft on your own
Or Aponia
I'd cosplay Elysia
Yeah,,,
I wish Honkai cosplay was in my size
Yea, lets move to genshin
Blank's edit is nice, was Uba like,,,, getting mad about that edit?
I dont want to
Star Rail?
SR?
So, What exactly happened?
A lil medly
The credits music is nice tho
We're still in credits
Maybe the fact that they had a concert at all
You dont know that!
I am also waiting for credits
CONGRATS
1 (one)
i have one bastet
I'm not going for hohe
I have less crystals then Heki
are they?
however, If I tried Calculus I believe I'd be better at it then Heki
I never did calculus because I dropped out of school
I've gotten a 5 star at literally 88 pity before
I either get 5 star's really early or hardest pity imaginable
I don't think so?
you don't even have to touch the chasm for sumeru
Baban, you're good
Lamp.....
You're welc
if that doesn't help flip a coin
Look at the namecards
America amirite?
I don't get to eat it often tho cause fish is expensive
best fish
I love Salmon
Salmon....
*pats* I just know cooking
however, I do think chocolate gives you more creative freedom
indeed
definitely better then
Oh, interesting
Fondant is okay-ish
It probably doesnt taste too good ngl, depending on the amount of fondant used
I now want cake
In other news
People are insane
NOOO
,,,, 30 primos
but in a different way
I am too
Tet is a degen, we just gotta live with this
All is right in the world
And a lil cat
Lil rat
I was just noting quotes being added that's all
Omg
It's not quite time yet
Well
Cause I Probably cant get her weapob
If that doesnt work on her
Or like
Enough weapons
I have
I hope my extra summit shaper will be useful on her because I dont think
Well, either way
I wonder what Nilou's namecard looks like...
True, I mean, she would
I havr all of the lims
I must obtain Nilou for my all hydro goal
I want primos for Nilou
Na still has 15 hours
I'm speedrunning as many precious and luxrious chests as possible before the event ends
They would not shut up
The fischl island quest is annoying
yeah
i sorta noticed myself but...
you're right
it;s very slight
tet, how does it feel to be one of the funniest people alive
in this one channel
So much going on
There is
So
LKJHU3FIJOGR
is a big step for mihoyo
Any percent of the melanin
i mean, they should've made her darker but the fact that she got
Elishua's name is literally Elishua right?
if enough people did then I won't give hints
Who all here remembered my legal name?
Right, Does it have to do with your name here?
Wait, who's name are we guessing
if you remember, you remember
I believe you guys have learned and guessed my legal name
My name is greek and I do not live in Greece
Oh, fen, mind if I dm you some questions and such?
like small details cause I'm not great at that
The batik patterns are going to be a great exercise in drawing details
And I'm comfortable, with what I've looked at, to try that
true, There's no saying that they won't release a Sumeru region that's like Indonesia
Right, that's fine by me
or something
Like, East Sumeru
Then Alright! I think it's close enough, we can say she's like,,,, further away?
okmvinomrvr3nrffr3iom
Just making sure before I go forward with it
Well, still, would Javanese be appropriate for an Sumeru oc?
right right
I'm not sure, the photographer did something weird
Idk
and I'm so using it
this is Really pretty
this is what fen told me to look for
Huh!
,,,,bruh's ace confirmed?
But that looks nice
Idk
OH MY GOD?
I WANNA SEE BUT OH MY GOD
I'm seeing a lot of black and gold.... Geo element
The colours.... And the fabric they use is shiny.... Good suggest, Fen!
Oh, Javanese clothing is really pretty!
I can work with this
If I combine the suggestions
A Javanese Seamtress who's like,,,, 50?
like, face wrinkles
best I'll give you is gray hair and some old lines
Traditional Javanese... Interesting, I'd have to look into it
nice Eli!
Any suggestions on concepts?
I should actually make the sumeru oc I've been thinking about making...
it really should've been a seelie with her tbh
The only things I like about Dori is her sunglasses and the fact that she doesn't fight with her own hands
Yuuuu[
yea they did mix things up a bit but it's def supposed to be persian
i mean, any rep is good rep for that place
it makes me feel good about pulling for her
Most are happy about Nilou
yea
yeah, you're wonderful tet
not all of course
Nilou is pretty good, I think if her torso was slightly more covered, not even fully, we'd even have people praising her completely since Persian's are about that light
Sometimes beefing helps relieve stress!
you aren't an obstacle but we care about your mental well being
because, not the time dude,
i, myself, had to keep my response to aoi to myself
:(
likely a divorce then...
ah
That's either going to be marriage counselling or a divorce
Jesus....
you have a good neighbor, I'm glad he helped.
Yeah, I can imagine, you have a good neighbor
which, it does sound like that's what they're doing.
I hope they manage to resolve whatever it is non-violently.
*hugs* That sounds really stressful
Be prepared for things but try to keep calm and be safe.
okay, good, then calm down while you slowly go back home alright?
Is he yelling at you?
Tet, you're not in your home right now right?
Oh no, yeah, don't call yet
But it's breaking a lot
Yeah, I'm looking it up and a lot of people are saying it's Sorta okay optimized
Meanwhile my pc handles ToF just fine
without crashing
Literally cannot fucking run the higher graphics version of Genshin
My computer and phone
Then again
I think ToF looks better then Genshin half of the time tho....
wh- what are you talking about
Like it's pretty but
it,,, it really isn't
yeah, small indie company that made like 15 billion dollars
people have gone on record to say that genshin is poorly optimized
They could, instead, learn how to optimize their data better
YEA
I want Male children, I want Buff women, I want a fat women model and a fat male one
I want more models'
It's gotten to the point where it's annoying
HONESTLY THO
Honkai Star Rail needs to hit up the Genshin team
MIHOYO HAS A CHARACTER WITH SKIN THAT DARK?
It really doesn't,
Who's this?
SEE, PEOPLE CAN BE SHORT
Like, People can be short
I know someone who's in their mid twenties who's like 4'11
Short people aren't fucking 15!
He doesn't, He's just short
Xiao's fucking NOT 15 he doesn't Look 15
it's called teen but it's more short
yup, also Razor?
Either way
She's 14 max
women generally don't grow in height that much after 16
Sayu mentioned that she's still growing
That person is trolling
Also, Sayu's around 12 to 14
Most of the short girl model's aren't kids
Ayaka is literally fucking 20
No?
N-
wait Is Nilou 12?
I was with you!
I've heard no one complain about the Music or the Scenery, which is great
The environmental stuff all seems to be good
From a business standpoint, We really just need to make Sumeru sell well even with it's flaws
Listen
Yea
Agreed, Nilou is great and I love her
The problem is, things like this are tricky.
We don't know yet
but It's at least not fully on hate, which means Mihoyo didn't fuck up that badly
Which is not good
Although, at least it's not complete and utter hate I've seen more of from that culture, just general disappointment
But most people from that culture don't Exactly seem to be
Like, As long as the people from that culture are happy then it's a win
I just wanna have more diversity and for minorities and people of that culture to be treated with respect
i mean, I'm not complaining for clout
You see, that's my hope
well, sorta,
This is the only reason Genshin's world is at peace
incredibly based,
I mean, still probably shouldn't have been white but like, People are upset about Candace?
huh
Oh they are?
but i don't think they're based on actual people from history
which historical figures are they whitewashing tho? I mean, like, it's not great that the region doesn't have a ton of non-white characters
because I forgot that what I needed was g1 and not g2
And I'm out of mirage tickets
I need like 26 ice g1's
i am experiencing a hell without release
felt
Exhausting
That sounds really uh
Since it is Monday
Yea
Such a nice looking preview image
Yes
Cyno and Nilou are the 5☆'s
Nope!
Rejected
I've reloaded Genshin's twitter and no Kusanali
I believe
This means Kusanali isn't in 3.1 then
Mostly cause I only have a single 10 pull rn
I sorta hope her banner is the second too tbh
That's a good point
Tet, My hydro
So I can profit with my hydro goal
Candace should be on Nilou banner
And I also just plain like the language
So regularly hearing JP is good for learning
Mostly because I'm also trying to learn Japanese
I prefer JP
Peeled Aster
highkey?
lowkey?
sounds abusive
That uhm
ig
Alice has deep pockets
DAMN
not really no
well, irl, there's def solutions but thinking about it media wise, she looks like a 12 year old and is made that way on purpose, there's no reason to think about it if she was real because she isn't therefor, she will always biologically be 12 unless they change that in story
like himeko did
especially cause that means she can't drink the pain away
must suck
although that does mean for herself that she will never be legal
yeah
i just woke up
oh night tet and eli
I do tho, bruh
FUCK YEA
Nice!
5:53 pm
It is
Good morning
Lol
It is 10:30 am
Btw
Good night guyd
Oracle time less go
Late
Oh lemme frab my ticket then
If you eat too much of anything it'll effect what comes out of the other end, I'm pretty sure that's just basic biologu
I see...
What shade is pinku and pinkuiro (i'd grab the katakana and kanji but I'm exhausted)
So then it's shades?
WH
From what I've seen
I think the katakana one on it being erotic heavily depends on the context tbh
Sometimes Katakana just denotes a foregin aspect to it
To be fair, I can sorta see it
Ohhh, really?
Since multiple people chinese people have called out the huge mistake
It's unlikely
Sora you're literally Japanese
H
Its the exact same energy
I still need to look up all of the different radicals and memorize them <:rozano:963353554532319252>
Huh, interesting!
At least in the context
They both read as Ao tho
Yea
<:rozano:963353554532319252>
Because for the longest time those two colors were considered the same fucking color in different shades
In Japanese Aoi can mean both Blue and Green
...
Still, he needs a confidence check lol
Probably but
I could swear more but I am absolutely exhausted so this is non functional brain
Maybe something like that?
So, did you just forget that Chinese is contextual or are you just a fucking moron? Did you hit your head this morning or something? The absolute stupidity of this sentence is atonishing, I seriously can't believe it. Go get your head checked.
Let's see
I haven't slept,
Morning Aster!
I can't guarantee it to be great but I know how to insult
Would you like my half dead tired brain to come up with a colorful insult, Tai?
I only claim to be an expert on knowing some stuff about idols
Because I obviously don't know everything
Instead of declaring myself right
Like, I'm probably in a similar ballpark with him at Japanese but instead of assuming I know everything I try to learn and ask about things I'm unsure of
I bet this guy doesn't even speak Chinese and hasn't learned enough to read at a grade school level
Yea
Does this guy know that in both Japanese and Chinese combining characters can sometimes have something mean something else
Is, is that someone very clearly being wrong acting like they are right?
Damn, bruh you hit that on the nail
Tet, I love the difference between our reaction
Oh a Murder mystery!
Probably cant go
Oh irl
What kind of server event?
Oh the day after my birthday
I think the list is accurate
I'm like a normal freak
Anyways, I know I'm a degen but I'm not cunny I think
So glad i'm not on there
Lol
I am so tired
You're good at Tof
It's okay
*pats Heki*
It was meant to be a hug!
But it really does look like a kiss
Cause it's meant to be a hug
It was an accident
To be fair for Heki
I've literally gotten everything else I could have possibly gotten but her weapon
I beg
Please
Give me
I like sw PLEASE
At this point it's not even for meta
Sw's weapon
I need
I want
I'm looking at the sw banner again with tears in my eyes
I wish
Well, it's a good thing you've grown
Okay now that's a little bit too fucked up
But not because i wanted to hear the meow or anything, I was like,,,, I just wanted to hug them very close
I sorta did that at 5
Well, you were 5
That is rough hugs but yeah
You mean you gave them rough hugs and pets ?
An expression
Ahh
Aight, I am not letting my cat near you
But yeah, Aster is a flower too
But also you're just as bright as a star
My guess is that it's because Aster as a name is star related
Negligence but I also dont fucking sleep at night
So many things I'm the herrscher of
Even tho I am also the HoN
All I know is that I am apparently HoCS
Jdkdkdkekss
Damn
You're not stupid with that game
Yea
Honestly?
JDKDKDKKDD
But I think Aster said it as a joke
You mentioned noming on one
Haachama does scare me
Well, there is that too
Oh
I mean, I would do anything for them
Aster is my weakness?
Yea, alright good
It's august... 27th?
We have a week until the concert yea?
Fen you're so right
JFKSKSKSKSKEKKSSOS
AjjtjskKkndkdKdjksksks
Charge it maybe?
Yeah...
Of course that is after the 30 pity
Perfect!
Right Meryl
Then Meryl?
Yea
Which, I am 100% set on Tank
Unless you think it'd be more beneifical to get Meryl
But we're leaning towards King
And so before that I'll get to 30 pity and see what the results are
Tomorrow I'll be able to get my ssr selector
Remember what I said about that?
I haven't
I'll save my red orbs for saki
Yeah def then
I see I see
Ahhh
Between those two I'm leaning towards Marc more cause that's more of a support tank
I'll keep it in mind
Neat!
It's def an ice focus weapon
Yea
Cause it increases ice with stuff
It's like, an Ice pair weapon
Or a Cocoritter/Nemesis?
Saki is def a Meryl pair weapon
Yea, I'm seeing
Lemme look at the info on them
Oh, two tanks upcoming
Alrighto, thanks
I wanna view the upcoming characters
What site is that?
Sound good?
If no ssr, King, if ssr it will depend on the ssr
But yea, 1 more 10 pull on gold and then we'll see
And good
Oh cool
Before I commit to King
One more 10 pull for the gold banner (not event cause that's red)
I'll get
Hmm
That's around there for me as well
Damn
Oh really?
I should save for the next tank
Right
Oh really?
I think I might go for Nemesis banner now
Lol
Both actually!
Lvl 30 recently
And I'm like, not very far in the game
Uhhh 20
But shiro looks cool
I'm just scared I'll end up not getting Meryl and she's semi important to tank teams but King is probably the better choice
I'm figuring that too
Yeah
And it's Huma, Meryl, King or Nemesis
Ig the reason I'm having issues is because I've looked at the tank teams
Right
Yea
Mind that she is at 1☆
Oki good
Uhh
I'm not on pc <:deadge:975652771082698782>
And I've looked up tank teams
Yea
So I've committed to tank
I just figured that I like playing supports but Idk if I want to commit to full healer
I wanna be the ultimate tank
You should try it
I mean, why not
Am listen
Oh?
I might switch to it but the next time I play I might be able to get King
Hilda
Yes
Right?
Terminator... that's Hilda?
So I have to use an sr
I mean, I dont have any other ssrs lol
Ye
The ice hammer
Rn
With huma and ene
Because I'm using cocoritter
Lol
I guess I'll be balanced for awhile
King...
Hmmm
I see...
It
I see
OMG YEA
I would love to know why
2 huma's and 2 cocoritters
Btw, I've gotten like 4 ssr's within my like 120 pulls in the like both the sr gurantee banners
Right
I play Tank
Suggestions?
Whether I go for King or Meryl
I am having trouble deciding for my ssr box
I have cocoritter and huma
When is morbmaid on the NA server?
...when I have a consistent income
I am going to whale at this point
Because fuck getting sw's weapon amrite?
Unsurprisingly, getting neither
I was going to go for her but then I didn't play enough so I used my crystals on sw's weapon and villv
Congrats!

You want to speak a lot of languages aster
Sense
Araki has an interesting naming sende
Seiya...

Lol
Too lazy
Yet
I have yet to get to the gacha yea
is this extra? yes
i have made my character
Yea, texting grammar isnt ever really perfect so it doesnt feel like
You do make a few mistakes here and there but it's not common
Your grammar isn't actually all of that bad
I mean your sentence structure seems perfectly fine
Well, what parts of english are hard, prounication, sentence structure, a bit of both?
Oh damn
So you learned both growing up
Ahhhh, bilingual
English or Japanese? (This is probably a dumb question)
Oh boyo
Yea
To download?
Although youre def better at english
Hmm, well, yeah, I mean, it's very similar with me and japanese (I know the rules but I don't understand them fully enough to apply them)
I can also help
Would you like to see Nene?

A bit of a pun
Which was another reason
Also, hokkepokke also kinda sounds like the hokey pokey
Inbetween the hokke and pokke
There is a _
Bfjdjdks
It's my twt username rn
hokkepokke is the MOST recent for me, uhhh, It came from liking an Enstars character Hokuto, his nickname is Hokke and so I just added Pokke to it cause it rhymed
Whenever I use it
So, i just misspell it on purpose now
As for Catknigt, it's from the same game, I was messing around with the main character creation screen and made a Catgirl who I was going to give the knight class so, Catknight, EXCEPT I DIDNT HIT THE H KEY RIGHT AND IT BECAME Catknigt
And so I just sorta,,,, go by that sometimes
Angel_Gear is actually what I named a character on an mmo game (now defunct) And it came from Angel Beats, an anime and the fact that I wanted to give the character a steampunk theme
Angel_Gear was the first out of all of these, if memory serves correctly
Or names
If you want
I can explain each tag
Catknigt, Angel_Gear, and hokkepokke have all been tags for me on games
<---- Identity crisis
Lol
I have like,,,, 3
Cause I have a few
Name
Depends on the like
They've done a lot of plagarizim

Oh the Manga ended?
lol
understandable
They definitely aren't boring but I understand if the idol vibes aren't exactly your thing
cause if you think that's boring you have not watched most idol series
and their designs aren't standard either
Especially if you consider other idols
I mean it's fine to not like them but they are not boring
They are not
unfortunately, we won't know shit until mmj event done!
So I just have to roll with the punches....
Either way, sports Kanade is keeping me to my current account

Listen, if Baban's a boomer then fen's ancient
younger then me?

How old are you Baban?

Soul Eater's a classic
My first anime, watching it knowing it was anime, was either Soul Eater or Tokyo Mew Mew
Lol
I'd like the romance to be highlighted more
Yeah, fair
Sadge,,,
Also, that fuckinf sucks
Cause I'm an emotional wreck
I'm like,,,, these days rn I've been looking for things with minimal romance
Yes yes
Those that are need to die in a fire
Harem
But villainess or like I've reversed time or reincarnated ones tend not to be
I hate those too
Tru
Yea yea
So it feels different by that nature
This is why I like villainess stuff tbh, cause at least it's women protags
Man, I've seen this before male power fantasy no. 1359277
Like
Yea yea
Unless it's bonkers in another way
When a Manga's trashy it tends to just be boring ngl
Yea
Yea yea
Manhwa's are mostly trashy in a fun way
Either way
Yea
Lol
I mean, we aren't, that's the point
Yeah
Listen
Why does that have an actual plot
Like Dear Door
That is way too complex
BL smut
Also, I feel like you guys forgot about one genre of Manhwa tho
Although, I am the type of person to eat up the villainess manhwa's, guilty as charged
I dislike Harem manhwa's and manga's too
Lol
Lolol
My usertag has citrine in it <:rozano:963353554532319252>
My nickname never changes
H- how

In ER tho
I've gotten a 6mil with SW I think
niiiiice
you must've accidentally selected the wrong language at some point
vgr komvvr
All Stars has different servers tho
yea yea
the only thing you need to do is select language
The app itself is completely global now
just to let it be known, SIF aka the og, The servers for jp and en are the same
ahh
which has nice 3d models and cards but I don't really like All Stars
yeah, I'm guessing you got All Stars
which game?
Love Live?

I've had alcohol before, you're allowed to drink some starting at like... 16 to 18 in America at home with parental supervision
Yeah lol
So, Heki, have you bought Alcohol?
They card you when buying a drink
I mean, Bar's don't really card you much at entrance
It's not that big of a crime
out of all people to place in quarantine....
that's a bit...
You Fen you really don't gotta remind them
i suggest we put carv in fen's place
They're already unhinged
???
LOPIJUHYGTUIERO
impeach
easy
make him no longer admin
I would love to do it myself
how do we kick him out actually?
y'all's minds
oh my god Heki
all I know is that I'm sad about Sana's graduation
understandable
I'm looking forward to hearing more about them
I see you are rather happy with HoloTempus
I see
i
we should def let him out soon
Yea
so the combo would be more pastry like
I suppose but pizza dough like that is soft
that's disgusting
now, Boba pearls on a tomato pizza with cheese
that's not really disgusting or shocking
it just happens to be pizza shaped?
a weird combo
bread, butterscotch syrup, and boba together isn't really
a pastry
it's more like
as long as there's no cheese or tomato sauce, is that really a pizza?
i mean
It's always just one good...
NOOOO
cause you miss your chance
if you never release it tho it never gets better
you did indeed
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Diavoros does indeed, not have value
LOLOL
Hatoful Boyfriend?
Like
lol
I don't feel the appeal,,,,
I uh,,,, I'm not too interested in this kind of stuff myself, I'm not a fine of Otome games
I think Aoi doesn't either
good for them?
hog wild huh
anyways the boys are going
for CN it's definitely on the line

You pray to the gods you've got the right context

aside from Aster ig
it seems like everyone's personal lives are quite busy huh
indeed, things have happened
or even all that much outwardly
i mean, there's trans people who don't transition medically

PFFFF

Lol I suppose
Idk I don't think it's bullying
Well, either way, am happy
I

kmvvrrbbtgrbtrr
PFFF
There wasn't a good time!
2 days ago,,,
I have a gf,,,,,
If we're talking about sweet things,,,
I mean, all he'd need to do to figure out what you're in for is to literally just ask that
All I can say is that definitely,,,, You need a new therapist
lol
The Therapist is not
But the Therapist
For a Blood Test that question is important because they're looking for things that make be wrong
I've been to therapy before and they are not supposed to ask about it unless it's related to your issues
That's a red flag
See?
They do not ask you
Unless you're in there for sexual trauma reasons
It's not for therapy
WHHHHHHHHHHHAT.
WHAT/
WHAT?
MY GOD
OH
i mean
hm? are you talking about the have you had sex question?
:(
eva huh...
honkai is still available to Fen, yayyyy
lol

Disclaimer, I am so picky that it's at the point that it almost could be considered medically and eating disorder
alcohol sucks

I guess the app is just down then?
*sighs* I see
Call the bank

why can't you?
freezing your account won't cost you money
I know you didn't, freeze your account, that could be fraud
Yeah freeze your account

But like,,,, Its not like China has angry mobs

i will move to to horny jail
you are dying huh??
Partially cause I am a women enjoyer
i agree but my reasoning is that i don't like how speedos look
lol
the only kinds of people at my beaches are children and old people
lol
lol
and I'm not pretty enough for dating apps
they are all taken or non existant
it's more like i've not found any in my social sphere
well
I wanna date a girl but I've got none in the area
either way
good!
nyoooooooooo
I blew it is what I'm saying
we haven't texted in a long time
lives in a different state
So I could've asked but by time I knew we had drifted
i later found out they were pan
i wish I had the gall to actually ask them out
,,,,you know there was this girl I liked and like we did a lot of sort of dates
,,,yes?
ever
I haven't properly dated anyone
haha
my mom would not care about any of the women I date
if you celebrate christmas
It'll be like a christmas present at that point
Understandable
nice!
Lol
IT WILL BE FINE
I mean, just don't say anything if you don't gotta,
Okay not like that
power through all instincts and become-
but
what do you need? I'm not tet
especially bigger spiders
I'll die now
yeah, no thank you
like
I think If I found more then one spider in my room that I would take my own life
the one I've been too lazy to play
Ah
I
where is this emblem from
wh
It does also sound like a pasta
Ahh
lol
Anyways, yes I'd like one Arlecchino, large, extra sweet
it takes a second for my brain to connect lol
Think What drink is that?
cause sometimes I'll see it and just
or a drink of some kind
,,,Is it just me or does Arlecchino sound like a Coffee
Plasma is the 4th
congrats my friend
hov augment
Showering really takes a lot of me sometimes
Man

oof
damn

Congrats!
LOL
YOU GOT THE AN
THAT'S THAT CARD
the one in which she baby?
you mean
CRying AN
Did you get anything?
OHO
LOL
owo profile
yeah
mihoyo does not literally
Jesus christ-
that:???
said
diavoros
but like
no no I'm aware
what
h
Valid
When you finally relax and think a medical problem is finally done...
Mantra Hujan is def outside of my range I'd say
When I was little I was a bit tone deaf but as I've gotten older I'm no longer tone deaf at all
to really figure out my range
tbh
I would like one too
Oho
Your range is def high to mid but soft Aster
soft
damn
Oh actually this *is* in my range
Oh this is Ghost in the Shell ain't it?
I can, if nothing else, mimic sounds
so I sorta know how to make some of the sounds
Fun fact, I used to use Russian names for my alts online
RUSSIAN
Ooo
I have to change my voice completely for Really high songs
I can do mid low and mid high
HMMMMMM, it's hard to say? I'd say it's mid
good point, then just practice singing songs that are in the high pitched range
you think that bothers me?
Oh no it doesn't
Hmmm
Ahhh
maybe tag me with songs you think I could sing
?
Sora, you've heard me right
that would prob require a vocal coach
that is something you can do
then lower them when you sing
damn
Then you should practice those songs
Mori huh,,,
afterwords
Your voices must be destroyed
JAM PROJECT
i imagine you should just feel around to where you feel like your voice feels comfortable
Also wifi outage
So gimme a second
Oh? You think I can sing like that? I say but I haven't listened to that
rather then vtubers
he sounds more like normal streamers who use their face
that's slightly surprising
Taihen has
there's a slight accent but that's close to the Hollywood accent
oh yeah, that sounds about right
I can see it now
oh her singing voice is actually somewhat similar to mine in certain aspects
see if her singing voice is similar
ig I'll listen
i'm not a huge kronii fan so I haven't heard her sing
does kronii have any songs?
Kiara hololive?
I see I see
I've been told that a few times actually irl
or that I'm high
lol
cause when I'm neutral or just not all that excited i've been told I sound sad or depressed
it's funny but I do think y'all have only heard when I'm like in a good mood and absolutely bouncy
I still have 4k crystals for Emu birthday so I'm good
uwu
I got the new Akito
I FORGOT TO TELL YOU
OH WAIT TET
Oh damn
Lolol
Theater way
Loud not in a bad way but like in a
I think Taihen would sound loud, that's the only thing I can think of
Tet I'm sure your voice is beautiful
I see I see
Huh
Handsome?
or pretty
is my voice cute?
is
I LOVE PIZZA BAGELS
I DO
also, incorrect usage of Fearmongering
Ahhh, well, those people are actually rarer then you;d think, there's more vegans who think consuming any animal product is a sin greater then murder
ig, it's not the most rare from the american's i know tho
Lol
I don;t think that word means what you think it means
hot pot?
Boba
which means they have more control over the ingredients so
Although, that's not to say everyone in america eats unhealthly cause there's a lot of american's who home cook
You get me
THAT'S EXACTLY IT TET
YES
Also The Grease
yea
if you look at them
Burger's themselves don't contain anything too unhealthy
Sorta
Kinda
well that's a different thing entirely
It's a common fast food combo in america
Like, for example, do you think all american's eat out?
There's nuance to it
Not exactly!
No-
You can eat
Which is one of the most unhealthy things
The food itself isn't unhealthy, it's the way we prepare it and the fact that a lot of products have high fructose corn syrup
Well, not exactly
Yea, also the carbs+cream
I'VE DONE SOMETHING SIMILAR AND OOF
it's good
fries+ice cream is a very normal combo in america
also
wait it's probably project sekai
which one?
I'm excited to see him in game
idk, i think he's cool either way
of course thats usually an highschool elective and I never really went to highschool
I wish I was able to take language classes when I was in school
yeah
Not many things actually make cramps worse tbh
A lot of things aren't recommended for Pregnant Women to be fair
Then wouldn't it just be not recommended for Pregnant women rather then Girls?
No we got the Regrator
Understandable
whatcha thinking about
that is a joke btw
wow, can't believe you think
people are being haunted?
yeah
despite it being the correct answer
yeah
Mihoyo....
Aponia's not that confusing and yet
this question is just incorrect
Yeah I guess
This was ages ago Mihoyo
Hello??
????
Oh well, tomorrow
I should watch the pv for 5.9
Lol
FUCK YEA
Niceeee
lol
aren't you a mod?
She sounds awful
Hahaha
Yayyy
Well
What'd they do
Damn
I have taken care of myself and everything
I am alive
Hi
It's an anime
Solution
I predict that they'll figure it out and it'll be a Take this, this and this and get some rest
Well, probably wont
Aha
Is a possibility
Which
If I don't need surgery
That is
Excited
Soon I get to go to the doctor and then I'll be able to drink water and eat
It's fitting rn
I'm sticking with my nickname
Sadge
I am not happy to be awake
I awake
I like watching youtube videos
I seee
It's 4 am so both apply
Lolol
Yea
I'll try to sleep through my 10 hour one, it's a lot less then yours but also my body is actively failing me rn
Congrats
I feel sad and pathetic but I know that I must if I want the doctors to figure out whats wrong
Felt aster, felt
I already wanna drink water
am not all that happy
hello, I am 8 minutes in no water or food
I think Dendro reactions cool
I'm fasting for medical reasons
Well uh
i see
I see
OH
Ohhh
oh you should probably eat
in like,,, an hour I won't be able to eat anything until my appointment 🥲
Nice!
the pants lines aren't correct I think but everything else looks great!
could very well be
like I said, looks like a mid action pose to me
no, it just blends in with her scythe
right?
if she was going to spin/swing it, it'd be resting cause it's gonna need the underneath support
it looks like she's going to spin it upward and around
like notice how her top hand isn't holding the scythe properly but the other hand is holding it at an angle?
It does to me seem like an in the middle of action pose
it's the same pose but true, it's easier to process
I thought Baban and Heki were married
jesus-
it looks to me like she's going to slice upwards
which may be why it might look awkward
it looks like it's in the middle of action
it's not that bad
Imagine havinf the energy to plah honkai rn
Lol
Not feeling well
I'm just
Sorry
Theorectically if I die I don't need to deal with the pain right?
Yea
I didnt feel the need to point that out
Well, of course I do
man, I am bored but I can't move much or do much without major pain and I'm hungry but getting up to get myself food will hurt majorly is it even worth it
then again I am very much not involved with the genshin or honkai community all that much
I only recognize wfp
imagine organizing your servers
Also might be hungry but in too much pain to tell
I wanna sleep but need to take anti biotics
night
Lol
Bye bye
Huh
H
No wait-
Felt
Felt Heki
I'm so tired man
OH
Suo! Nice name
So it's a neat time to meet you
I'm experiencing one of the worst medical happenings in my life
I'm Citrine
Nice to meet you!
Yeah
I don't believe we've met before
Is that your name
Is
I dont think its very nice to call... Simp? Dead
So they have good taste
All I know is that they like Aponia
Thanks
At least it's caused me to finally set more things up with doctors and the like
Truly
Love this medical journey I'm making
So yeah
But it wasn't painful persay
Last time I had a yeast infection the cream did nothing
To be fair I should've known
So uh yeah
That cream has made the pain and the issue worse
So they prescribed me a cream
Turned out it was a yeast infection right?
My belly button
The thing that's been bothering me for the past week/s
Going to need to go back to the doctors
Yup, looks like I'm indeed
Uh where
So, looks like I'm probably going back to the doctors
Well, Yeah, was expecting that
man out of context
Isekai is very diverse and that's why I like it
LOL
I'm sorry
But it's very few
Well, to be fair, there are wholesome mpreg things out there
The first time I saw an hentai was 10
I shall cry now
I want more cold treat but me no able to get it cause pain
Anyways
Ndkskskd
California is a Low Altitude State
Citation needed
So am happy camper in my room
I got my own ac
Recently
You kinda need to
Meanwhile, washington during the summer,,,, you're lucky if it hits 100
Lol
California during the summer is so hot and dry that it regularly lights on fire every summer
Which is 48c
I went to california during the summer once and it told me on my phone that it was 120 degrees outside
Yeah that explains it
OH
60 is 15
Lol
Fahren
Our usual is 60
So
I live in Washington
I'm aware
I'll think about hot to convert to c
My room is 80 degrees which to those who live in hotter countries that's probably nothing
Gotta love life
And I'm still in pain
Its hot even tho it's fucking night
I have had like two popsicles but I want more
Hi
Uh
All I can think is it's fucked up that America asks stuff like that
to help?
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I can karaoke in a bit I think
Oof
of course I can't but you know
my cat is very cute, i wish to cuddle him for all eternity
damn
Ouch
Oh that song
Gimme
Not being able to swallow most food due to my gag reflex
I like food in theory but I end up
Ouch
Well, also dense bones
Lol
I have some muscle and a lot of fat
I am indeed, Thicc
Cm
Granted I am like 5'11 which makes me 180
Fen what would you do if I told you I'm 116 kg
And I just converted it into kg
Recently found out my actual weight at the doctors
Also I
Wait how much do you weigh?
I trip up over speaking english more then when I try Japanese lol
Like specific
I mean, it's my mother tongue, there's a few words I have trouble pronouncing myself
I can teach English
That's the romaji version of Japanese lol
it is
Yea yea
I'm sure there's others
so far we have fluent JP and CN speakers in this server so def those two
Yea yea that sounds great
Oh!
i have a suggested name even
?
can we get a channel or learning/speaking other languages
<@468680026162724864> I have a small req
lol
that was very explicit nsfw even if things were blocked
yeah horny jail tet with that
lol
Fuck yeah Kanade lvl 53
oh def
*sighs* am lazy
to draw things
I need
So talented
Insane
Wow
You made that?
Cute
Oho
Me like
Your art fluffy
God I'm not sure what genre it is
Also your art reminds me of like
Rabbits do have noses
Oooooooo
<:fishwow:963697747473604638>
Wait you drew that
Any of it
I wanna see
Tbh
I don't think I've seen Sora's art
It's a lot of work
Some of her older voice banks suck
Or the voice bank
That's mostly the fault of the producer tho
How dare Heki
She's the queen of vocaloid
Heki needs to not slander Miku
Djsjsnskks
Misc things?
I did
Also Hi I took a nap
I also need to learn
i can
mine isn't that long but yeah
it's only helpful if you know you're going to be playing for awhile
yea yea
if not then no
if you have the money for it and plan to be playing for awhile then go for it Sora
4 star select ticket
it's a bit expensive but that's a guaranteed 4 star right?
maybe?
ahhh
:(
that master is a 31
oh fuck
maybe don;t?
i mean whoever did they have balls but damn
i wonder who
hurts my ears as well
baban is saying Neko's done worse
all is good
it's okay, you didn't know and you've apologized
you can just call the those genshin characters femboys or just state they're incredibly feminine
so, it's usage and such have always applied to trans people and the meaning behind it is incredibly transphobic due to it being the it's a trick to get you interested in men! when most people who crossdress or are trans do it for themselves
lol
it's a slur
the inbetween is nice
this
I think I would put her as a femboy but like,,, Hunk fits her personality better I think
I mean, Personally I think depends on how you see Elysia?
I mean if you wanna try that design I'd say go for it?
Elysia?
Correct
On an easy tho but still pretty impressive
Yup
I mean, amazing but also I am so sorry
LOL
Oh no
Yea thank
Does anyone have the png for Terichew?
Although lower speeds are generally harder
Yea yea
Like, I played enstars for 30 minutes and then had to turn up the speed and now I can clear 29's
For some reason playing enstars fixed me
?
You know what I did
I mea
I actually play at a 9.5 now
yeah, we need to be on the same team
Well, just incase you do continue
Oh right yeah
we're on that team
pick baseball
Am jealous
Congrats!
that luck tho
I love the fact that I picked her for my S rank cause I haven't ever been tired of using her
my beloved <3
I am most certainly being carried by Karenina Ember
it's working!
my team certainly isn't functional but hey!
felt
I'm rank 79 but like only cause I used my daily serum lol
I have so many resources I have not tapped into
I mean, My account is pretty grindable
alright
might as well pull a little and then save for 2b
do I try to get her weapon then?
right right alright
where do I get A2? log in bonus?
Thanks I might've made a bad decision if I didn't ask
Oh damn okay
OHHH
Oh
?
to get the s rank
which box do I pull in?
although it also means some pain
it means lims can be rotated faster which is nice
That's fun! tbh
glad they fixed that ngl
the lim 4 stars have hair styles tho
oh, all 4 stars well, most 4 stars do
Lolol
LOL THEY;RE NAMES THO
now
oh ig I should go pull in the banners
like the initial stuff you get
besides, there's a lot of card lore within the other stuff
dw!
you should have a simple time with it considering a lot of the time they go untranslated
and while it's not in the game there are resources to find the card stories and read them outside the game
Yup yup
Okay so cards come with Lore but this one comes with event story lore more specifically
oh lol
Even if you don't manage her right now she will eventually get a rerun
including her initial one
I got 4 copies lol
I also have dupes
oh sad
priorities am I right?
Despite not having HoF
lol
I have a 4/4 raven
Proseka is a game that's easy to be f2p in
so not necessary
although tiering is easier with event cards but on global I managed a top 4,000 without any event cards
and mostly you can get by on event tiering and stuff without spending on every banner
this game doesn't really make you feel like whaling unless you make dumb decisions or don't farm crystals properly
the gacha pity is harsh but the rates in this game are better then most with pity systems
generally, as long as you plan wisely and have mostly dexterous hands you should be able to have fun and get what you want
it's not that harsh
Also, it's really fun to play, even if I mess up often on the flick notes
I should listen to is more often
Hana wo utau is a good song
oooo
NICE
i mean yes but no
NO
It was a nice attempt tho
and failed
pray for my fingers
all 4 stars btw
I'll use my all healer team
well here goes nothing
<@309634550273933314>
you think I should try?
tet
at least not yet unless...;
I am not playing it
I unlocked this madness
Oh another pride I have
So it's probably as simple
Her song should have the same note amount
Why not
Actually yeah, I'll work on that soon
I have to hold my phone in a really specific manner
Tell your world is hard to fc with thumbs on master cause of the note placement
These are my prided I think
Idk if I've even fced that one
DAMN
AP MASTER
I bought Kanade
it's the one's without the black line on them
oho
I bet you did the easy in one try
I see I see
all perfect on potato hard huh
How am I still missing two inital 3 stars?
My question is
area upgrading starting to get expensive
I might start doing them soon for the coins tho
I don't too much effort and they don't give crystals
*hands them over*
You need 4 right?
Yeah I mean
Also, I wou-
So close
and also there's quite a few experts I can't fc and a few masters I can't play
I don't clear easy's or normals lol
not like mine is uniform tho
I believe
the yellow diamonds
you can go and fix them
I think that is the health one tho
oh yeah
yeah, that's what I meant
yea
Instead of Beat eater?
Also congrats that is lucky
use her]
I was gonna congratulate you but then I remembered you can't
Lol
also that slider at the end is scary
Damn
IT'S ALWAYS JUST ONE MISTAKES WITH ME
sorta
I am with that one sort
one mess up
that;s why they hurt
Oh I forgot to stretch my hands
LOLOL
LOL
im tired lol
It's so funny that Heki is using the bye stamp to sticker to say hi
I LOVE PLAYING THAT SONG
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
my finger genuinely slipped why
fuck Am sorry
NO
ROOM NUMBER
MY DINGER SLIPPED
SO CLOSE
I think I unlocked master tho
MY THUMBS HURT
OW
GOOD LUCK
finger
lol
oh yeah
they are are you looking for Heki?
oh but I'm not there
remember they're nameless
what help do you need?
are you okay?
you did a good job aster we love you
yea, sounds good
almost fc too
I haven;t played in awhile so I messed up during that
ye
yea
And we're in a match now
LOLOL
HEKI
oki
I NOTICED THAT
LOL
like my Kanade btw?
yea
at all
you can't leave the game while in there
aster
no
not always
Tap that and input code
There's a door
easy lemme show you
MY GOD YOU KEEP SAYING GREAT THINGS OUT OF CONTEXT
lolol
I can
we're still setting things up so you should be fine
oh good point
Solo those frags
FUCK YEA
LOL
How are you gay
I like tennis the most of all sports tho
I've played before and I liked it
Baseball is funner
I mean the question was which do you prefer to play and during baseball I'm less likely to get kicked in the shins
hella
Same as you Tet
I'm baseball
lol
you can't even do co-op lives without choosing a team
You can just not during this event type
it;s okay
Yeah
I answered before you could even at
Lol
Oh sekai
You're so valid and I wish I did
I find most things a pain
I wish I liked doing anything technical
That's just called not wanting to admit you aren't straight
what are you talking about
Life sucks
this game is competitive
but like
I mean, abyss is hard yeah
what
just save your crystals until another 10 pull
understandable
you can unlock the outifts
Dupes are fucking great in proseka tho
it's very common to get nothing
ngl
that's actually a good ratios
LUCK
the pity system in Honkai and genshin allow for it
Soloing is just shooting yourself in the foot
Like, remember how there's no pity system in Proseka?
Please don't do Solo's they give you nothing
but what are you going for?
Solo's aren't great
Am going to sleep
Also night night
Oh dear
Whay
League of Legends?
Requires so much effort
I gotta sleep I think but I also need to fill my water bottle beforr doing that and that
I learn fast but I make mistakes often
I wonder how long it'll take for me to be semi okay at Japanese
Yeah
Ahhh
Oh that's a lotta small っ's
Yum
Katakana is used a lot more then I thought lol, looking at it now
Oh man, obenkyo is insanely useful actually
Oh you must be talking about nightcord yea?
I wonder which character isnt clickable
Proseka?
Ahhh
Which game?
Proseka feels inuitive to me
Yeah
Wait the last two tabs are entirely katakana huh
I should use the games I interact with on a daily basis now to practice reading Japanese
Simple yea?
Second is to train a card
First tab is lvl up
From here you press training
You can spend your event points to buy score sheets to lvl her up more
Well that's fine
Blue button is the ok button
From here it's pretty obvious
Lv. 50/60
The button next to the level you press
You press your desired card
You go into your card inventory
First way
There's two ways to do it
Oh well then let's show you lvling first
Or well, for starters, your card needs to be lvl 50
Alright lemme show you
Train them you mean?
The difference between small and not small isn't very big with proseka huh
Fixed
Now to fix my proseka
もうがんばってますってば!!
I'm going to have this phrase memorized now which is funny considering the phrase
Yeah Right
Reverse the su's or
もうがんばってまっすてば
Or keep botj
Then?
Remove the su
That's it?
もうがんばってますてば
So
Right
Or is that still not correct
So still should my message be
もうがんばてまってば
Ahhh
And if they're small what does that mean
Are those all of the small letters?
I've already added u
For proseka
The message
So do I just use っ instead of す
Right
Ah
Wait it works for つ but not す?
OH I JUST TAP IT
Where bottom left?
Double tapping is doing nothing
google
hm
Oh lemme try
How do I minimize letters
Lemme go do that real quick
Lol
Oh whoops
Oh well
Oh true
Lol
Nobody will know I'm still learning
Stealth
This context works?
Right one more t to that tte
That's how that's read right
Mou gannbatte masu te ba!
Wait wait lemme right that out in romaji
OMG THAT'S SO CUTE I LOVE IT
Text box
Like
I am tempted to make that my proseka
YEAH THAT HAS THE DEFEATNESS IN ME
If you were to add another like descriptor word
YEAH
Yeah I can imagine
Ahhh
Way
In a sort of I am fucking fighting for my life to do this
Usually when I say I am doing my best I say it while somewhat crying
I see
Unless I didnt understand you right
Right?
Since that is past tense the lighter translation is more I've done my best
Ganbarimashita?
I think?
Right right, cause of how short and simple it is right
Well, it's simple so it'll def sound like a child
Which I believe that sentence is I am doing my best
So overall made some mistakes but I managed the sentence well enough that you could tell what I was saying which is a good start
Yeah
Oh nooo
Unless that's not needed
I also missed an ん too
I see I ser
What makes it ha?
Also I see I see
NOOO
Are you proud of me
I messed up with a sentence in grammar but not structure Sora
Hello
To even make a grammatical correct short and simple sentence
I still have a lot to study..
Why is it written that way?
I forgot a letter lol
Yeah ywah
I see that now shoot
Yeah
OHHH
OH
Oh
Was it Te?
true btw
oho
I am going to need to find a free dictionary and study huh
Hopefully that is legible enough
<@309634550273933314> did I sorta do it
I don't think I did it tho
I fuckin tried
わたしわがばるます!!
in Japanese
I'm gonna try to make a sentence
But I think I learnt a lot
I can always help with english
I wish I knew french more then I did cause I'd love to help you back
lol yeah
it's relation is to the speaker/reader
even if that is a past action
so it is Wo
You are taking action on the book
Ahhhh
the is more like a title anyways
but like
Not that the book is a verb
right?
it's like a notation of verb
in this case
Or have done it
Ahhh
and I understand you put those things after the important word
then
Does Wo general mean the?
Righ right
Yonda is past
Isn't it?
Yomu is the doing rn version
Ahhh right
I think I'm wrong
is that the translatation there
Hon wa watashi yomu?
Ahhh
So is that just a feel around it kind of thing?
Ahhhh
Question, how interchangable is kanji and Hiragana?
That helps definitely
Mhmhm
if I'm picturing it right lol
yeah, irl it sounds like you hate that person
that's understandable I get it now
like it's less pleasant
Yeah that def sounds more dramatic
RIGTH
Yeah
Oh oh
I think I sorta understand it but not quite
so things must be connected
right
like why are you talking like that
so it's a bit fluid but not like insanely so
ahhh
am braining
2nd
not third
wait so what does that third mean?
thank you
oho
which I need to do
def does
how does Japanese sentence structure work btw?
Ah nvm the first few were just the one's I remembered lol
I actually remember it a lot more then I thought
Honestly?
I'm relearning my hiragana
That's an easy one to remember
Lol
Oh cool the N sound look like an N
Yeah I think the other has way too much sound in it
that's great
Oooo
Katakana is more spaced out from what I remember
That's Katakana right?
OH
:0
Cause it'd be fun to use that when I'm playing jp games
Wait can I has an Japanese written name out of Citrine?
I never got to learn another language in school cause I dropped out
LOL
wait aren't you literally Japanese-
damn
might as well try it
that means study lol
right
Obenkyo is an app to help learn jp if I remember the chat
so like
Wait
Dumbo I am
I see now
AH
Lol
I didn't realize they translated0
I had no idea lol
Ahhh
Sora know Chinese?
Does
I can hook you up with my grandma
I mean
Lol
Kanji is a hellhole I'm not excited to learn
for whatever reason
I can always read Ru
I remember a small amount of Hiragana
the power
then chinese drama's should help
that's what you wanna watch
chinese right?
Anime, even like slice of life tends to be overdone
When I speak Japanese I try mimicking jp streamers I watch
Oh yeah
I imagine cause of pronunciation and cause of that word being taken lol
this is sorta how I've learned a few spoken phrases and words
then you can learn off of context
well, first you learn a few words and memorize them
also watch anime unsubbed
duolingo and Japanese friends
Lol
Lovely words
And then put an o infront of that and you get toy
Funnily enough tho and put it together and you get Mocha which is Coffee
Mo cha
see ?
Macha
It does in Japanese as well
Cha does tend to mean tea
You might've remembered a bit wrong
lol
Duolingo?
Like you sure don't bud
If someone said I am not speak English to me Irl I would die laughing
LOLOL
lol
if you read them together it sounds like your friend or lover just vented to you and you're reassuring them
so ig that's tru
not written but spoken
I mean, I do know most naughty/swear words in Japanese
Well,
LOL
or maybe it's me? idk I don't think I look very pretty tho
no one
and that it's hot
cause I have very direct family from swizterland but like
if I put in effort
I could obtain a Swizterland citizen card
yeah that's sorta how I view it
that's a lot of effort
I should probably be learning french or german if I wanted to move to Swizterland or something but like
Lol
cause that's a very specific identity
like how asian-american exists
which is asian-australian
well, there's a kind of label for that sorta
Ara Ara
tbh
don't worry about it
I don't either
She's just chilling and so am I
Honami
I'm just chilling
God I love this pfp
Yeah
lolol
LOL
I see I see
ahh
easily
I could become Swiz tho
yeah
It's a Nationality
I mean, I don't like American's but I'm still American
Cause Australian usually just means you live there
Does it
Do-
LOL
only matched by Mashiro
is like my fav in Bandori
Funnily enough Rimi right there
Rui is the purple gay from wxs
Kaoru likes calling her fans Kitten's
I think I'm taller then every single bandori character
NOOO
also, anime games tend to make characters smaller
I have European genes, specifically Swiz and Irish
Yeah
lol
cause that's 5'11
Oh no, I'm as tall as Rui
wait
I'm taller then the tallest character in this game if I remember correctly
so that explains some of it
yeah, Kohane is a first year tho
Kohammy is powerful
It's really funny cause it could absolutely be hetero but it's so not
In an area convo her and one of the males from her unit he points out all she talks about is Kohane and then she points out all he talks about is Toya (the other male in their unit)
and she's always talking about Kohane
An is constantly calling Kohane her partner
lol yeah, those two are really tied at the hip so it makes sense
yea tomorrow def
when will you be home tet?
we can
I see I see
Oh
can you show me all of your 4 stars?
Azusawa yea
You guys should look at mine
Are you talking about the picture on the right or in the team part
Here!
5331731633086475
I should have mine
wait
it really tells you a lot about her account
it's so many pages I like it
I'll show off mine in a second
Naaaa it's cute
I'm download pgr update so It'll take me a second to switch games and friend you
yea,
I do but not yet on global
I should grab mine too
oh wait which ones
you've gotten used to the jp version now Heki
Oho!
<3
Oh!
yesss
it was 200 crystals I think?
uhhh, it was somewhat close but it was enough
western
If you wanna tier it's insane
Oh yeah
it's still 300 essentially but it's a lot kinder
on non lim banners it's 200 pulls basically, also cards over a year old will show up in the shop where non lim sticker cards can be used
And that's only for Lim banners where it's that hard
Especially in that many pulls
You're rarely that unlucky
also
that's the guarantee amount for Genshin lol
this is the reason there's a lot of people who prefer a global or en version cause it allows easier planning
as long as you play regularly that can be accumulated in about,,, 2 to 3 months?
not really actually
cool
right right
Also just to be clear we are not counting birthday cards?
like the l/n or vbs are lims right?
group events for this month
oh btw none of the like
lol
lol
Yeah
SHE WAS THE ONLY ONE TO NOT GET AN AKUNO
OH
wait she totally does
Miku might have three
Yea I believe so
yea yea
if nothing else, to get more cards so your teams are powerful enough to give you more crystals
I think you're safe to spend a little on this banner
yeah
that'll change my plans
Well, I'm saving for Emu's birthday rn but if an Emu lim or a Honami lim comes out soon or god forbid a Kanade one
Lolol
maybe anni?
yeah
She's not due for any lims
a bit away isnt it?
Kohane's next 4 star is...
yeah
according to leaks
There's a vbs event coming up soon
HAHAHA
THAT IS THE KANADE
PFFFFFFFFFFF
Although, in Love Live school idol festival there's the sticker shop
But yeah, There is NO pity in llsif
yeah, the rpg's are dif
Bandori is 300 but I think in certain places it;s 400
Mihoyo games are weird but it's probably cause it's not like
yea
yeah
once you do 300 pulls you can buy your desired card ye
and number
next to the pink circle
Open up that tab at the top
At least on Lim banners anyways
so to Explain
Okay
there is no direct pity system in proseka
i know right
Proseka is not easy and it can take awhile to get used to
Prob not
FUCK YEAH
It's unique shape should make it easier to find but I am legit coming up empty
I feel like I've come across it before but the more I search the more I feel like it doesn't even exist
I checked some older gacha games but like this currency is a legit phantom one
it's not old enstars currency or show by rock either
no, I think someone else would've recognized it
Blue Archive?
I even dug into I-Chu and Uta no prince sama
It's seriously bugging me
those are the only imas gacha games
Nope, million live has a hexagon, Shiny colours is a circle, sidem is also star shaped, and poplinks was like, something else as well
if it's that hard to find
but Like, my guess is that this has to be a defunct game now
This looks older
def not
I have no idea what that Teardrop shapped gacha currency fucking is
So I literally have been searching and
actually this is better for searching better
so maybe f2p ones are
I think these are the paid for variety
Yes
This one is Azur Lane
Okay
I'm fine with the variable note sizes
I def have seen this one to
I feel like I've seen it
what is this one tho
I'M AN IDIOT
IT'S IDOLMASTER
OH WAIT
Oh yeah
This is Bandori
lemme look
Are they?
The pink hearts are love gems from Love Live, the rainbow stars are bandori and I think the red diamonds are love nikki
Bandori
Fire Emblem
FGO
Love Live
Genshin Impact
Arknights
Grandblue Fantasy?
Love Nikki?
and then there's one I full on don't recognize
Or more like, how many different game currencies that is
I wanna see how many of those I can name
exciting
17 mins
I g
sorta
looks like a school bus
yea
nice
oh I just realized, most of the fireworks have stopped
Iida Tenya?
Noan is cute yeah
I mean
whagt
wha
who's shrek
shrek?
s
oho
When the Nier collab exactly btw?
I wanna max sleeper's dream and mobius weapon
How to get that much pri arm mats
rip
ugh
although I'm mostly recovered from that but my belly button...
well there's that too
oh just my same old same old these days
anti-biotics start doing your thing
Ouch I;m in pain man
lol
man
I hate the 4th of July rn
same
seriously, LK is so much fun to play in er
lol
once I have Hekate's gloom
I'm excited to use an sss LK in er
I've been focusing on getting my LK to sss since my raven is there
oh they were one of those people
rest in peace carv
instant noodles
it's like making tea
I do know of people who don't
actually
I mean, anyone can do th
Heki seems like the kind of person to know simple and easy things
Heki might know how to cook simple things
I used to only know scrambled eggs for awhile too
plus even with my semi eating disorder it's one of the few foods I love eating
one of the few foods I know how to make
I love making spaghetti
it's cause of how the noodles are
Oh true
ye
as long as there isn't too much seasoning in the sauce
but a little is fine
too much is bad
I love cooking spaghetti
Ah
Or maybe gluten problems
Anyways, Italian spaghetti all the way
Tomato is usually acidic so mix in different kinds of sweeter tomatos and sugar with other stuff
Yeah
So like it's basically a different fruit
It's a different kind of tomato apparently
Yes
Sweet Spaghetti usually has different sauce
Although I personally prefer it with just tomato
With like, extra stuff of your chosing
Then it should be tomato sauce
If noodles pasta
But likr
Unless the noodles arent pasta
Sweet spaghetti sounds wrong
Also
Yea
I was like Oh Spaghetti!! And got myself too much
My stomach hurts I ate too much
Stuff
Are you okay Rebooting?
same problem
same time zone
Lol
Morning
M
So many greats tho sad
Doctor Funkbeat fc
Yeah
Mobius pretty and I focus on ER
who cares
I realize this isn't the best decision but like
I'm using f2p crystals for it
Oh no not really
yeah, cause I'll be going for the skin
cause it's still in beta
I was gonna ask what stuff is alongside the Mobius skin but then I realized we don't fully know that yet do we
FUCK YEAH GUILLOTINE GUILLOTINE
I think those mc's look nice yeah
At least those are exceptions in a lot of states now there isn't any
Although, I suppose these days we can play the fun game of Is it a gun or Firework
WHY ARE Y'ALL CELEBRATING THIS AWFUL COUNTRY
LITERALLY AMERICAN GOVERNMENT JUST DECIDED WOMEN DON;T HAVE RIGHTS OVER THEIR BODIES
WHY ARE PEOPLE CELEBRATING ANYWAYS,
THEY'RE LOUD AND I'M AFRAID THINGS WILL BE SET ON FIRE
It's not even the 4th
I keep getting spooked by Fireworks
in which case I'm sorry
Everyone shpuld be glad they aren't american, unless they are and the live in america
prepared for every scenario ig
lol
FUCK YEA
Fuck yeaaa
Oo
I suppose I can wait for more info
I mean if I assassinate the enemies in those 10 seconds it's like it's offering a big boost lol
I've been using Mendeleev B so far
You don't use charged at all
But in ER she prefers ult
I see I see
Well
Lol
What 3*?
For B I'll probably just use Issac Newton
Does Marco T and M work?
I started during the Haxxor bunny update
I don't think I was playing when that came out
Oh
Which event stigs?
Uhh
That much
I'm a newer player who didnt farm
Yea I didn't
I have Marc M
Well
I have Dante B <:cryge:966624721611403294>
That makes so much sense and is easier to get
MICHELANGELO
OH
Oh that's charged focus huh
Any other good f2p stigs?
So Kafka?
Kafka or like
Also, I could level her priarm
What stigs do I use for her in ER?
Lol
Of course Griseo is added to er lol
Yeah I was talking about Delta
Lol
She seems fun
Yea
To me she seems really good but I could be missing something
How good is she in ER generally?
Kevin, Griseo, and Eden signets seem to be really good for her since she spams ult
I FORGOT SHE WAS BEING ADDED
ROZALIYA IN ER
S rank gacha valk I mean
came home at 12 pity lol
who was my first s rank valk
nyx tho
I got Senti twice in one ten pull at 40 pity
I wouldn't know
Ooooo
I might
I see
I am good at this game now
I hate American holidays
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Also, I can't get the medication my doctors prescribed to me cause my pharmacy is closed on weekends and the 4th
That's just heavy depression
Yea
It's so pretty
Sumeru looks really prety
The second you see Sumeru and then it rewinds
Lol
The stream is so fucked
It's my luck shining down on you
That Kanade tho
Yea
The higher the stat amount the prettier the card and the more powerful it is
Oh the stars are rarity
NICE
lol
there's also that
Lol
They were annoying
I used to get yearly nosebleeds
Oh oof
I hope it helps her!
Physically we both are not well huh?
Oof
Mainly, retry a song after a fail might be a good idea so you can practice that part and the beginning part until you have it done
Well yeah, but it's still good advice lol
So she should practice some songs she's almost got and do it until she can
Practice makes perfect
Also
Even if it's a slight increase it might help
I play at that speed
She should try 9.2
I have indeed been resting
Anyways
Blood test
So
I got my blood drawn and threw up after that
Yea
A lot better then before but my arm is sore and I still feel a little weak
For fingers... I don't play with fingers often but they should be fine as long as they know their fingers wrll
Oh turn that speed up a little
Secondly, thumbs or fingers
What speed do they play at for starters?
Oh I can give some tips
I wish you a very safe travel
That sounds dangerous
I feel better
morning tai
Time to play project sekai my ranking has probably fucking SLIPPED dramatically
Fully
I awake
Also a Leo/Need event but I'm not sure if Miku is a feature
I believe we're gonna have a pure event soonish
That'll be helpful in the future
Nice!!!
Yeah still man
I see
Oh
That's not a new player
Weapon
Pri-armed
Fully
I wanna say they're new but
This person isn't very smart
But am alive
My arm hurts
Noooo
But jesus
I'm fine now
Really bad after my blood was drawn lol
Yeah, apparently i looked
You def should
So great
Got my blood drawn and immediately threw up
I'm back from the doctors
Hi
But yeah this entire process is so slow
I'm just so tired
To be fair I guess there was 6 people ahead of me I think
Yup
Going to kill myself at this rate
I have been waiting for almost an hour and I have yet to see a doctot
I am on NA
Yes
I see I see
I meant at higher ranks
Yeah obv
Lol
I'd test it myself but like,,, griseo rank A
Is Griseo with Sa's weapon and gear better then sa with that gear?
I wanna sleep
I'm tired
I've been waiting in this stupid waiting room for way too long
Same
I wanna go so I can get back to sleep
Man, when will my mom,,,, be ready
Yea yea
Yeah, don't make em gacha
Honkai should stay all women, we have other games for men
I see more toxic players talk about how they want men tbh
I don't
I'd say you're a new account so just pull there and see what you get but usually it is wise to save until a set you really want comes out or for limited cards
The box you're on rn or just save,
I'll wait for another method in the future
Yeah
Maybe not for old logins but for new ones?
The cn one? No, it requires a cn id now
For Kanade I will go to any lengths
I mean this is true
Lol
Me want...
Luna
At the very least
Well, I'm better at it then my sibling
But also, You're right I'll die from not taking care of myself
I've had food semi recently and I snack frequently
I'm gonna eat dw
Also, looks like I'm taking a nap and going to the walk in clinic tomorrow cause the thing I thought was getting better was not and it's getting slightly worse
this is why it's important to grind in games lol
so Must no spend frivolously unless planned the hell out of
And we are close to losing house
other shit cause my families poor
and like
Also I don;t have the money to order food cause I gotta save that for Splatoon 3
What else am I supposed to do with my time?
I'm a shut in with no job
Also, I don;t play too much I mean
I don't think I will!
No!
it's just having to g-
I have food here at home
Oh you see it is 5:46 am
Do I though?
I also am not playing any games currently
I don't pull a lot you know
annoying
but like the thought of getting up and making that food?
I should eat probably
man
Including Heki
To discover my Arashi 5 star 🥺
Valid, I recently recovered my JP account
Enstars...
Finally managed to fc the hard
Yeah, me with the EmpError
CONGRATS MY FRIEND
looks like it
yup
I didn't use the app to login this time tho
yeah
now what
<@482139585355448333>
okay
heh
it won't let me
oh oof
lemme try again
I should've logged in from the 3rd party
lol
was a bust
looks like that
I don't get why there has to be this complex process anyways
I think at least
Looks like I'm one of the few that's been hit with it
uh oh
almost managed to clear it tho
Forced to play Don't fight the music expert
yay
I have a cn honkai account
oh hi Tet
and see what I should pull
When cn is fully out I'll look around
lol
I might stream my beginner pulls
FUCK YEA
:(
oh boyo
much like my english even tho it's my mother language lol
my cn is none existent lol
also yeah you speak pretty fluently
I've always wanted a cn account, pog
FUCK YEAH
am I in?
let's see if I did this wrong now
58%
I believe
yea
games like honkai and others are easy on emulator or pc but rhythm games cannot be comfortably be played
rhythm games on pc are insanely difficult
The game Aster wants to play is way too difficult on pc
Lol
Apple
LOL
Maybe...
LOL
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
CN Honkai is downloading
Oh damn
look into tutorials and see if they know workarounds
you might be able to skip that or just use your actual number
Are you sure it's that complex?
I'm sure you can look up tutorials
there's way to get jp sekai through apple
cn Honkai will be pc honkai
lol
Am using my pc for this
night baban
I got it
I think
Can anyone help me with getting a cn honkai account?
do i have to use my phone number/
for the like huawei download for honkai
hey
I am good at this game
I'm grateful I wasn't one of them
Yeah, it shows the amount of patience you have
I wish only the best of luck to you
Good luck
that should explain it
Tet is not
I am talking out loud
I'm dyin
Lol
pff
lol

Thats the right one
<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>

I believe
Dw
You'll get it
YEA
We all have Kanade

Also, this means I'm prepared for the next l/n event
Satisfied with this
I suppose I'll start saving my crystals
OH

I'm gonna do a single 10 pull
yes

OHO

oh hmm
right, so are you just playing sololives or cheerful?

I'm gonna start working on my 2 stars soon

That's what that is
Ohhh
idk special event going on
That's why!
It's Daily!

Hmm, I think that's for setting up google/making a transfer code

You have been Cleansed of your daily sins
it seems that Aster couldn't fight the urge to be on the internet
Felt

Taihen's got the mod tag and the... FGO icon?
night night aster

like a mermaid?
it will rise again
Rn my state is experiencing a dip in temp but I know soon
Oof
she could get in real trouble
tell her that she shouldn't do it again
Yeee
there's so much room for improvement
and you're 13
Cause your arts already pleasant to look at
I'm sure if you keep at it, Aster, you'll be drawing really beautiful art
like that griseo?
I'll friend ya
So global!
Lol, yeah sure
When you do, what server are you going for?
It sucks that you can't download rn tho
i'd say your parents suck but you're not quite 14 so that level of stuff is mostly fine
or is it the server
Would you like some help with Project Sekai?
oh?
or your fav project sekai character
Draw Kanade
<@309634550273933314> wanna event grind together?
But I did
I freaked out for asecond and thought I didnt have mine linked either cause it asks for you to login

Will start grinding for her frags once pardo is SS
Got Griseo in low effort
Using the cards they gave me
I'm so tired

Lol
Also hi
Yeah
I believe I've done that
motivates
Oho?
Lol
Even looking at that site gives me brain damags
I'd send you my old fics but I'm not visiting Wattpad again
Lol
Like Why were you so edgy bitch? Go outside, get some help.
Me with my old fanfics
I think being alive and eating should be free (aka shelter/clean water/clothes) but you should have to work to get luxuries like pulls for gacha
JFKSKKDKDKS
My sibling sometimes asks me to misgender them in public cause they don't feel safe
Understandable Aster
Huge cave you say?
They/them for you now, Good folk
Oki
Ooo
Understandable, what pronouns do you use tho
Keilo will feel appreciated and afraid at the same time, sounds great to me
Lol
Just to make em feel appreciated
Say, Keilo's the greatest in the world, they can do anything
Oh
It's at times like these I wish for nitro
Eyy, i'll be waiting then
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
You'd be good at it
You should make a horror series
On purpose
Aoi, you are the furthest thing from scary- wait nvm you do know how to creep people out
Cause they deserve all of the right pronouns
I will gender Keilo the right way and make them feel nice
I will put on a one man show for you aster
Thank you
Angry, don't do it
<:catblush:963351912235810826>
WAIT I'M FLATTERED NOW

Overall tho? Meh
In terms of cleanness I can keep it kid friendlu
I do suppose I am somewhat obsessive huh
Oh cool, I have one
understandable
I just do
Idk why
I just like Hydro
kovfmofevmref
Fuck dendro I don't really like the designs and I want every hydro character
My genshin planning is getting Thundering Pulse for Yoimiya and saving for Hydro characters
Emu
Cause the voice is a little deeper then
It's more of a mix between Emu and Nene
She doesn't exactly sound like Emu
Anyways
Oh oof
She's the pink haired girl from Wonderland x Showtime
Emu is one of the one's who sings this song initially
You should play project sekai
Been listening
TONDEMO WONDERS
Must stay strong for skin
Kill me

I think I found it
WAIT
It's Java!
do I have to install a certain mod?
it's not working with any
Which 1.18.2
Yeah
All I know is finding the exact previous version your server is on is a bitch

well, All I know is that I'm taking a break from fcing songs in Project sekai

Things are pretty easy here
Well, I guess I'll just have to play more frequently if I want Mobius skin
Yeah
So
You drop automatically for forgetting to do abyss
Lol
Not playing
This is what I get for lime
Yeah
Cause I don't try
Real far lol
Down
I just don't play for like 3 weeks and drop
I guess this is what happens when I put in effort

エンドマークに希望と涙を添えて <--- This song will kill me

The help I need is hype

I need emotional help
I think Baban deserves a vacation
Lol
I'm fine

Tomorrow I shall spend time dying in Project Sekai as I grind out my last full combos

Oh, heyyy 28k crystals
Soon I can stop farming in pjsekai
I hope you'll be fine
my big computer is the one with minecraft,,,
I'd have to turn on my pc lol
Although some 19's might give me troubles i doubt too many will
I only have 4 really hard songs to fc and then the rest should mostly be a cake walk
Am on fire today apparently
Are you well my friend?
welcome back?
<@964806731471405086> yo?

And see how that works out
I have an actual account so when I feel well enough I'll join via my account
I'll dm you me code as well
oh yeah
I'd love to watch you play sometime
Valid
For either game?
<@781539392039682058> how's Project Sekai working out for you? What does your JP and Global/EN accounts look like?

Tet tet
You're on
Tet
Oh wait
Nobody trusts me for support
Lol
Also priortizing SpA I suppose
*checks the game* Not playing the game
The only dumb decisions I really make are
I'm glad I only make very small dumb decisions in gacha
Epi is just afraid of other people's skills
So not that smart
For one
I did need help tho
uwu
OH I GOT IT
Oh is it Fenri for the last one, I can se Fen being some
Who'd dislike Keilo?
One of
Keilo is the most helpful and nice person in this server
I doubt it
Nicknames matter then
I see
Epi
I don't know anyone else who ends with an I
Heki's one?
If I may ask
Who's the other three?
Lol
If they specifically ask you not to that's not really bad
I mean, I guess as long as they're fine with an It it should be fine
I don't think I've made any migraine inducing decisions yet
Luck
AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
IT
I FUCKING DID
MACHINE GUN POEM DOLL FCED
I DID IT
FUCK
hahah
I got a 800 combo on machine gun poem doll and then I failed

On that page

Am going to kill discord

Phone's not letting me see the messages in the vc
Later
I will continue this
Right so!
Tank
Thanm
So I'll have to go do that
I'm gonna give it 2 more shots and then I think my dnd session has started
EVIL
YEAH
It's difficult
For the record, most experts in this game range from 23 to 26
It's a 23
I'm fcing it
Hard
*sighs*
I am fcing baldinh
Watch if you want ig
Am sharing my pain
Yeah
Is Keilo up?
Oh right
<:TeriGun:973793149992435752>
<@244423082045997057> Do you know how to shut the fuck up?
you'll get everything you've ever wanted that wayu
wait for double rates
No more pulling
granted there are some differences but it should be easy
It's the same there
cause like
Or like, study the Global setup
It's essentially just intuitive
I can help if you need help tho
You don't/you look at the en version and memorize where everything is
on the 30th we're getting a free 10 pull and a dupe piece
you're in luck too
Yup
For JP?
oh nice uh,,, nickname, Taihen
morning-
where are you at?
oof
I wanted Luna but I didn't grind in PGR so
nice
i don't dress my best when I go to the store either
valid
like, a 7 year old dressed by a grandma
not exactly what I meant
hush
but also, I;m sure you look great
maybe a grandma dressing a 7 year old?
it won't fall out the window
My ac unit is still making me anxious but it'll be fine
Good Luck Tet
Not very easy to stomach
Btw, putting an ac unit in your window while you're essentially on the 5th floor is
<:kleepray:963350716901113876>
I have air conditioning this year <:catblush:963351912235810826>
Oh well, that means I gotta properly save and play
Maybe october lol
I'm excited for Splatoon 3 but it's sad that cause of it and budgetting it means no more swiping until like
I see i see
What was the og song again?
LOL
Vovaloid producers used to be more insane then they are now
INSANE
FUVK THAT SONG
That sure is a song!
We have gay rights for now lol
NFJSKKDKDS
NFMKDKDKS
There needs to be a maxium age in which you can decide laws
SERIOUSLY THO
LOL
I want to fix the error that is their life
TRULYYYYY
SO MUCH
I LOVE MY COUNTRY
IN PRIDE MONTH
Oh yayyyy
truly
KMLJNHUNJKMLVBGRF
This is not a good time for Roe V Wade to have been overturned in that case-
VFRCDFVGBHNYJHBGTVFRDCXS
MOIONUBHY;.'/
OH ABSOLTUELY NOT
I don't really know what sense of painmPFFFFFFFFFFFF
I have been told Hernia's are more painful but like
That's relieving
Yea yea
clean it with alcohol tho just incase right?
i see
oh?
so they've been piling up
I believe I haven;t seen an actual doctor in about,,,, 3 years
Well maybe I should think about the doctors soon, It's not like I don't have other concerning health issues
but man,,,
would explain the sharp pain
so it could be an like an injury that's like infected
it feels like there's something inside there like, something sharp ngl right now and like there's a weird sensation around my stomach in that area too
yeah
I'm not even sure why
No
ahahaha,
And it's been on and off
maybe the past week
I've been feeling pain there for a bit
but man,
I will
Ahhahaha
Without Healthcare?
In America?
So A Hernia is when your organs realize there's a way outside of the body through your bell button
I do both for Gacha, I sell my soul for gacha
So it;s either a Hernia or a Belly button infection and I don't want to consider the first so I'll just clean and use alcohol later on it, it's fine
Uhhhh
well, time to ignore that
oh There might be something seriously wrong with my body rn
yeah seems like it
for example Mobius and Klein
not
they tend to release things that work in tandem then like
It'd make sense to release with the Herrscher rather then Vill-V
Exciting
New Ely Elf should be Ice right?
I should have enough coverage elsewhere
I'm fine with that
yeah
I hope she is cause ahhhh
finally
Oh I'll have A HoF replacement?
my qua teams are not looking too great tbh
Since she'll have the same thing sw has it's not a bad plan
Then if I manage to save a lot for Mobius skin and I have left overs, plus during that patch I'll probably go for her
Right right
In terms of meta and stuff
Anyways, how strong is Vill-V?
Alright that's pretty funny
LOL
only if you do a funny dance
I'm gay until I go to hell
Anyways, I'll never straighten up
I'll act like there's a hack in the mainframe if you wanna mess with others
aight aoi
But this does mean I can change up my theme again
I'll never stop being gay
why
You're right, Camu does have some crotch physics
Oh
I
NOT KAMUI
CAMU
OH
Oh
This Kamu?
<@781539392039682058>
I am logging in, I play NA
this is what this means right?
Aoi do you have your account back?
Do I have it
Do
WHAT WHAT
WHAT
CROTCH PHYSICS?
Heki turns to the light side
for PGR
Anyways, I don't play the CN version so I guess I can look forward to all of that, yeah?
I feel like I'm being punched in all directions
So much is happening all at once
WHAT THE FUCK
THE MESSAGE IS DELETED
YOU LIKE DIDN'T JUST GET YOUR ACCOUNT BACK AND ARE TROLLING RIGH-
HELLO?
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Battle girl Highschool was a Colopl production
I missher
I want to see her again
I feel like shit, I just want Battle Girl Highschool bakc
could be more
Anyways,,, I am once again mourning a gacha game that like,,,, went out of service like maybe 4 years ago,
LIKE THE OLD ONE?
I NOTICED THAT DID AOI'S ACCOUNT GET HACKED?
YEAH
Aoi-
?
KMFOTTBR
Anyone wanna watch me lose it over attempting to fc Machine gun poem doll on hard?
what
Human body stop being in pain please
Ugh
Maybe I've been squinting too much
I fed myself tho and stuff
Maybe I forgot to do something
I haven't interacted with anyone proper in 2 hours
Why do I have a massive headache?
I  can see it
That's honestly not even all that impossible
Aponia be event or I cry
Me when ER dropped: Oh cool, new characters, probably won't be as invested in them as the main girls though
Me now: I will sell my soul for Aponia, Pardo, and Mobius
I WANT SO BAD
APONIA SUMMER OUTFIT
Excited, I will save for Mobius skin
Idk if my Pardo is good enough to do that
Does that work...?
I mean the first portal should be elysia yeah?
Should I try to get 3 elysia signets to start?
Oh eden ? Okay
Will work with what I have
Lol
Dont
If I have it
This?
Oh okay
Someone said Hua tho
Oh, btw, what do I start with? Eden and her stuff?
Oki
What buffs do I pick for Pardo
NICE
hahaha
I could potentially get another 20 with other things I haven't factored in yet
I need 120 pulls
Lol
USD
This game is too expensive for that and to guarantee what I want with the amount that I can conceivably max grind,,, that would be like,,,, more then 100$
The problem with that method is
So
I have been doing math to see what all I can obtain in gems for project sekai and It looks Like I am falling short in every conceivable way and I am losing it
so I might have gone a little insane
so this is where your luck goes huh
Did your sickness get that much worse?
Oh no, What happened Tet?
It's what I've always wanted ♡
I see I see
Lol
I'm not even close to boomer age tho
Lol
that read first as a stomache medicine, I think I know what you're saying tho, kind immature, then again you're not an adult
I don't know what kinda direction I wanna take with my art sometimes cause I feel like this kinda art requires lil, super thin lines but my lines when I draw are kinda thick even when I try to thin them out
amazing
god some people and their skills with art
I want my art to look that pretty
Oh that's some breath taking art
It's actually easier to get when reading it faster
Ahh, wait I get it
I appreciate the effort tho
Yeah, If that's a haha funny gotcha joke I'm still way to tired to get it
I have no idea what that means
what we up to?
I am foaming at the mouth, please end my suffering
if I get another quote I hope it's about my sanity slipping
Your wording is what terrified me
I didn't
Bruh, you terrify me
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I don't know,,,,
btw?
what does Cunny mean
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
if you want
How much Sekai do I need to play
How many songs do I need to fc
I'm feeling the slow but sure descent into actual madness
ProZD, I love that guys sense of humour
this is my current mindset rn
LOL
same
When I open up my paypal and finally accept comms
I'd pitch in for it
Yeah
The great thing about Minecraft is that it's not subscription based like other games that are like it
Oh like for this server?
lol
I bought it in 2013
I have Minecraft
I hope you get him
Oh that's a great birthday card
that makes sense
Ohhh
is that why you're dying?
not fully
She has not choice
Kanade Colorful fes dodged me on global, she will not escape on Jp
Time to grind and farm like my life depends on it
I might need more to spark actually
I have like 50 of the 200 pulls I need
Now
Nice
Sound good?
And we'll play tomorrow
then when you're ready tomorrow at me
I'm fine with doing it today I suppose,,, but I do have farming to do in Project Sekai, I have to get like,,, maybe 200 pulls by the 30th
Thank u
NICE
I mean if rn I don;t mind
especially at me
at each other
If anyone wants to play multiplayer games let's like,,,
Anyways
oof
I'm open to it whenever
Whenever the perosn with Jackbox wants to play
Also
Nice
Well
power outage?
so I can get into resource management games
I got really into Stardew Valley for a long while
but I'm open to it when I figure out where to pirate it
it does
I think we could manage
sounds nice
Oh lol
It's not a p2w game either
yeah
I've seen gameplay, looks confusing but fun
yeah
lol
LKMNJBHVBJNK
Anything I can do for you
Therapy?
Would you like some ice cream??
but clearly not
I'd ask if you were okay
Anyways, Tet
I'd love to pirate Factorio with you Keilo
I'm already there, looks like Tet;s joined
Yeah
Malding in honkai?
I just know there's Kanade on the horizon, and that she will be pretty
No
am I sane?
I'm doing this for a card I've never even seen
I am becoming Joker because of my beloved game, Project Sekai
i do
do you ever feel like you're losing your sanity?
Yeah, You know when you farm gacha currency/grind in games?
Valid
Ahhh
Oh what's going on here?
I think I am going slightly mad
if you wanna see more of him
I believe the gifs from Brooklyn 99
go to sleep!
valid
my life is weird
I don't have Nanami Pulse but I have her 6 star weapon
she seems really strong by herself
I suppose on my standard banner I can set her
Vera, she's the red headed gal yeah?
I have been going for Luna, actually
well, I'm on na cause that was the default for me
should be NA
nice
she's lvl 71 but yeah
5083 bp
oh did some upgrading
oof
I see...
I wish I had their weapons tho,,,
Oh nice
yeah
is,,,, is that bad?
my first gacha s rank was kamui
selector I think?
yeah
in the game that I got
First S rank unit
Yeah
All I know Is that I've geared up my Karenina Ember
nice!
yeah
I mean,,, I don't really have much anyways,,, I play very casually
aight
so don't stress out over it too much
I see
where
when
Who here plays PGR?
Rip
To actually use them but you know
I probably don't have enough of them
Where to use this?
I awake
Mornkng
i see...
apparently happened
which
or he licked his own armpit
I thought I was allergic to Pineapples but it turns out I was forced to eat expired ones when I was little and now the smell of them triggers my gag reflex
Lemon with sugar is heaven
Unaltered
Like. I enjoy Lemons but not when like
OH FUCK SOUR THINGS
true
I however, cannot
If I could enjoy the flavour of it I would probably enjoy spicy things
I mea
y'all really enjoy spicy things huh
lol
I don't really like bitter stuff but
I've never had a Bitter gourd
I, however, can basically eat nothing for a few different reasons
my sibling would if not for the fact that they have really bad stomach issues
no
I would love to try one without spice
korean fried chicken?
If it burns I dislike it
I hate spice-
I'm not
Like meat and such
I like sweet and savory things
I love seeing neat cold drinks
oh that looks kinda good actually
if you guys want you can give this a listen
also
so it's not tasty in anyway, just pain
that spicy stuff brings
as usually I can only taste the pain
cause of my stupid tongue not really tasting much I don't like spicy things
valid
maybe I should share this one
and I was thinking like,,,
I've been listening to this Homestuck track
Well not exactly what I meant- but I'll def give it a listen
anywhere I can recommend music to listen to
That's so cool
WHOA
Fish are animals just not land ones
the fuck
You are, and I'm proud of you
You always seem to be improving
I love watching you draw Aster
I would!
it probably won't put you into the kind of coma I had the other day tho
HEKI
I didn't mention it but,,,
Yeah I noticed that I couldn't find Taihen's main here like a bit ago
Indoor cats live longer too
That guy is the only thing keeping me here
I think I'd kill myself if I lost my cat ngl
:(
Is that one of your cats?
You shouldn't stick to her for that reason...
Not unless you confront her
Cause if you think she'll change her behaviour for the better she wont
People can just turn into people that are just not compatible and you need to let her know to either cut it off or to cut her out
I had a friend who was pretty nice over text but then irl she was awful
That doesn't matter
She isn't a good friend if she constantly makes you uncomfortable
I'm going to say this
Where the bad guy got drowned in the lake and is now seeking revenge
Isn't that the movie franchise with Mike Myers? The summer camp one
plus, if someone's uncomfortable they are uncomfortable
lol
then don't play it
uncomfortable
yeah, like if someone's like
yikes
make it all new as well
no, make it all incredibly needed gear so we all suffer together
lol
well I woke up to something
All of the songs now
I could buy
Well
I see....
***??????***
<@309634550273933314>
lol
valid
you seem to be normal income
I'm aware
Lol
I'll take a lesser amount if tax is real bad tho
I've been lazy and I haven't set my paypal up yet
paypal probably
Sounds good to me!
I make a lot of my own icons, although my quality isn't top tier lol
ooo
I think that's doable but I'll need more info
I'll need to get a bunch of things set up
oh uhmmm
I'd say you either then get upfront payment and or don't show the drawing unti they've paid
:(
I haven't taken commissions yet so I haven't figured out my actual comm price yet
25 to 30?
Oh uhm
and more plump as well, although I've done it in sketches I've not had an actualized drawing
Cause, I really should learn how to draw more masc body types
Like, if you could give me some buff drawing people tips
If you know how to
I could  learn tho
Well, Not at the moment
Serious.
Yes.
I actually will
Yes
I'll even draw
Legit
Anyways, Tet, just tell me if you really want oc made, I will make it
it's a unique name
Ngl
I think the name Question is pretty nice
Like, if you really think I could pull of a design and oc like that
if you want me to, I will
that's a nice name tho
He looks exactly how you'd picture a normal white dude to look like
That is an oc I've made
Chad Chad Smith, who is a Chad (Chicken Dad)
Named
Is a guy
Although, my favourite oc I've ever made
I managed to stick to some of my ocs names due to attachment
valid
Cause of it
I developed a big complex about my name when I was younger
But still, it used to be that not a single part of my name was read correctly when I was younger
names are just hard everywhere huh?
oof
big ood
And yet
There is not a thing in it that would make it sound like Bright
My last name is consistently Read as Albright
Like Yeah, it's german but?
No one reads my last name right
it's similar here tho
oh rest in peace
Naming in Japan seems so much fun
oho
Shiroka.... I'll probably name a character that in the future cause I love that name
I LOVE THE NAME CHIAKI
too much Fate
But I do not touch Fate
I see the hot women and acknowledge them, then move along
I actually don't want to, that series seems like hell
imagine liking fate-
Would you guys like to hear about my oc who does Taxes for fun and accidentally proposed to her wife without being in an actual relationship with her?
Thanks everyone for pitching in for my ocs name
valid tet
I will make note of that!
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
I just realized all of my Ocs or at least most of them have names that start with M
,,,
I need to learn Japanese more fully
Lol
That's cute I love it
Miyu!
I mean, I like Mifuyu, It's not all that long in how it's said either
It is Japanese names
This is a girl
Girl names mainly
help me name her
Her name could be Mifuyu Kori?
it's not like she's only got one name slot
I mean
Hmm
Ko,,,
Fuyu would also work in that context
Although a bit childish
But it's also not an uncommon one
It does lol
Mii would be an easy nickname to say
From the Mifuyu
Then couldn't her nickname be Mii?
Oh good point
Like, give her more inazuma like clothes and such
I need to redesign some of her aspects tho
I think it fits her more then Koyori
Mifuyu,,, I do like that
THAT'S SO PRETTY
OH
for MIFUYU
Ain't that just Red snow?
or something to do with her red eyes...
?
maybe a name that translates to winter blossoms or white winter would be better/
I can look more around
For her name?
Koyori,,, maybe?
honestly your questions helped a lot
you're totally cool
Should I put her in mondstadt or inazuma cause her name will change depending
I guess I'll come up with one
Hm
OH YEAH
These are pretty good questions ngl
Yeah-
she can learn new things just fine but for some things it can take her awhile to get adjusted to them
she doesn't always state her intentions or her ideas
she's mildly okay with that
pretty good but she'll sometimes go off on her own
She'll make a friend if they reach out first
I can see it if they wanted to befriend her
Between her and the one that does taxes for fun she's not that well prepared in comparison
Although she can make mistakes every now and then
yes, she's always prepared
probably
Probably commissions of a sort?
But maybe more on the side of the latter
I can see both for her
Hmmmm
Probably an orb
Oh!
She's a catalyst from the genshin sense
hmmmm I imagine her as a support in a team
And it's the one who does Taxes for fun
Oh, fun fact, tho, only one of my dnd ocs have common sense
It does but it's a honestly a good oc question, the answer is most of the time
Hmmmmm, that's where I'm unsure,,,, maybe she'd like fishing or some hobby type of thing?
yum indeed
Maybe salt baked fish?
Hmmm
salty veggies, meat and seafood
I can see her liking Salty things
Hmmmm, I'd say don't care but maybe Salty?
yeah
but saving in general tends to be smarter
true
saver, she seems smart in my minds eye
Country? if it's about preferred
ooooo that's hard...
alone, def a lone wolf
I wasn't entirely certain
lol
Oh no that was me answering
Forgive?
tp cause she can still be useful
I have my Rozaliya at ss
oki
nice
so can be
dangerous if threatened
Patient
I think she's the kind of character you never really get to know
Hmmm, probably more mysterious
oki
She was supposed to be a calm and collected person with money tho, I believe
I made her a year ago with head half empty
Also I totally forgot her lore
Oh wrong at
it's just the ones I wanted to show off just so happened to be
Oh yeah, I don't do that all the time
hm?
Maybe a snowman?
I did think about a snowflake...
totally og
It's not
So you mean lighten up the colours more
Ahh
White design?
so I gave up
I originally had one but I didn't know what kind of hairpin to give
I do agree for the hairpin
Yeah!
The first one is,,, kind of what I imagine Kiana and Mei's kid to be
I think it balances the design a lil
I am a big fan of it
that is me art
I drew
taihen, what do you think about ocs?
I think the design itself is good
in terms of age apperance
At all
Your oc's not bad
Yeah, alright, in dif drawings
Ohhh
do you guys,,, like me ocs?
anyways
but def longer legs
Wider shoulder isn't always an age thing cause people with wider hips then shoulders exist
if your doodles are consistent that means your style should be consistent
4th one... I think I named her but I forgot her name too-
I don't remember the top or the second ones names but the 3rd one's Mimi
Here's like, 4 of em
granted, I haven't really drawn many of them
if wanted
I can share some of my oc's too
!
its a good oc
For it to look a lil less like a kid
I will say tho, the proportions should be a tiny bit longer
We can stop shaming them for their art style being cutesy
There is a thing called art styles yes
My ocs are all women aside from the twinks and ocs I can't draw
but like
I think if the legs were just a lil longer maybe
true
rather then the exact body type
It's more of the vibes
That is Baby vibes yeah
Yae Miko!!!!
sure
I would love to mald in ER rn but it's closed lol
na er closed rip me
when I can lol
well
,,,,it's closed on na
I do have a signet guide but sometimes they mess with me
also the signets I should be going for
what difficulty should I set it to?
oki
just no t
and b
oh wait, nvm, I misremembered, I got an extra copy of m
anyways
i think
actually
full set robert
will use ras t
yeah, dont have the mats to get scott
well, if I can't get scott I'll do ras t and b
full ?
so def hav the b
Yeah I have full set rasputin
Ohh
so scott t robert m and bastet b?
Lol
so Verne T does nothing
Pardo does Combo right?
Lemme see if I have any scotts
I see
scott!
Should I use any particular stigs on Pardo or does what she have work?
tru
I don't have her Priarm high tho...
I was not aware she could do that
Oh
....
I suppose.... I should try then
So Mobius and Pardo could do higher difficulties?
Aight
I think
Well, I could priarm her If desired
I do?
I
a recording?
likw
I am working with massive amounts of copium
<@482139585355448333> these are my best geared valks
But she confuses me and when I tried her I couldn't score higher then when I did SpA
I... Do
I'm not gonna trash weapons that I don't have copies of eitgher
I don't have the currency for it anyways
yeah
Unlucky as hell
I've tried for both
Nope!
Here's sw
unsure if I'd really be able to top my current gear
I can show you what I have
Well
She's my best geared valk lol
I'm just free floating with SpA
Imagine being able to clear the harder lvls of ER
Project Sekai has taken all of my interest and I'm not good at multitasking
all I know is that I've been slacking in Honkai lately
cause the last one I had I outgrew
Which reminds me, I recently got a new swim suit top
same
Unless you've experienced issues your weight is probably fine
metabolism
my siblings also underweight despite doing the exact same things as me
it happens
You're good at rosemary
Damn
I should learn some home exercises but they've never interested me that much ngl
I know a few yea
Ohhh
I've recently cleaned my room so I should probably be doing that but I've never really
Maybe
and I think it's cause I'm not active enough
but it should increase enough cause I noticed my stamina really decreasing over the past 2 years
I mean, my stamina prob won't increase that much, I'm aware
rest in peace
*sighs* I miss my bike
But then I moved and I haven't been able to use it
I loved it when I could leave my house and just ride my bike for like an hour
Running is a no, I'll stick to biking
I love swimming
If I had a pool I'd swim
NOOOO
I ended up having to find places to rest all of the time
I wanna be able to run around a con all day and not be that exhausted
really
I need more of that
YEAH
Yeah, That can't happen again
so I'm like
But yeah, I almost died last time I went to a con in april
Gamers (derogatory).....
I dislike that part of my reason for wanting to get back to riding my bike is too lose some weight, although a bigger reason is that my stamina is so fucking low and if I wanna do more cons I need to be more active
I'm still working on that tho
Exactly!
Personality is definitely it
When it comes to other people? yeah
Being fat doesn't make you ugly.
Cause I wanna tell them that unless they are destroying their body on purpose that they're fine
Well, anyways, being fat is complex and I don't really like it when I see people put themselves down for gaining weight or being a bit chubby or fat
Lol
yeah...
Maybe it's cause you were insulted so much as a kid that it turned into one
Lol
So I weigh a ton
My bones are very dense and I'm tall
In my case I'm just naturally big in general
with the both of you but, I'm sorry you went through that
Yeah exactly
valid
so they're still fat but starving
and they never lose that much weight cause of it
Eating disorders among fat people are common
yeah
There are people who could benefit from losing weight but thinking everyone who is fat is healthy and a gluttonus monster is not okay
I'm fat and I'm mostly healthy
I mean
But, yes, sumo wrestlers are a good example
They only cared about how fat they were
and they die from the disability cause the doctor didn't care
But there are people who are fat because they are disabled
there are healthy fat people
Not what I'm talking about
People have died from it
they'll ignore actual issues cause your fat
Just like, don't base things off bmi cause that shit is like toxic and fat shaming in the medical industry pisses me off
that's fine
but if you just wanna become strong and fit
it was made by white eugenicists and stuff
Btw, BMI is total bullshit
do you mean something else? Mbti is a personality thing
why did you do that Fen
but man,,,
I think both of these people are a bit,,,, Well, The og poster probably said all of that cause they related to Aerith
yayyyyyyyy /s
Citrine is not really a common name and I just so happened to see it
Every time I see my name in a comic or thing I'm reading my immersion is immediately broken and I'm taken out for a ride
I was probably asleep
Y'all played jackbox? then again
lol
lol
DREAM?
kovdsmvvevwevw
yeah
feels a little too close
it uh
I don't like that word
hm
lol
prob a mod
I mean true
huh?
Aoi you sure like phrasing things in the most nerve wracking way possible
uwu
YOU'VE GOT THIS
MURDER IT
Ace that FUCKING TEST
GOOD LUCK
but like
I get violent tendencies with my sibling too
lol
yay!
can mine be a spaghetti soft taco?
I'm glad you think of us
That's nice Rebooting
tbh
or love live
play enstars and you'll get used to it
damn
my sibling's 22, about to be 23
I mean I am too
lol
lol
cause I'm not living past 40
can't wait for my midlife crisis at 20
but not quite yet
I am starting to feel old
then again a year isn't really all that much off
that's where I got Aoi's age mixed up
maybe you mentioned when you were turning 16 maybe?
I need to setup getting a cn account
oh nice
yea we have adult chats
Aster we love you
nooooo
Daycare center yeah
I can be full of vigor but man
Anyways

OOO
They know I'm not jp-
They know
have formed a circle around me
Of the JP players
I'm in a virtual live waiting room and All
Submissive enough
He's cool but not
From Angel's of Death?
this is the only man I've felt anything towards
Listen, there is only one brand of men I am attracted to
lol
Howl's better with black hair tho
blonde men 🤢
and it's the same
replace mosquito with Vampire
like
tho
This is just A Vampire story
WHY
MY GOD
my cat doesn't like eating anything but dry food even tho we give him wet food
wish my cat would eat bugs
nice
STOP
STOO
CAT'S WILL HUNT ANYTHING
YES
yes
neither do bee's
mosquito;s don't like me
well
yeah, thin fabric will do that
Yikes
lol
underwear, maybe?
honestly
both
you will be missed
Rest in Peace Cherry
I think you might be right
maybeee
I don't remember it tho
I think another word is more common
but like
I mean, real systems use the word singlet
noooo
Then all of the alters must be white lol
doubt it
I, uh
Didn't you mention that they have racist alters?
like
mentioning that fact at all
Still
Lol
about 300 is a lil much
also, systems generally range from like 5 to 100 alters
just not likely
but I suppose it def can happen
it's generally impossible/not likely
neat
and most systems treat their alters like siblings
usually there's only one or 2 that come close
they're less real people
if that makes sense
cause they;re made for protection they tend to be ,,,, childish?
most alters aren't even fully formed personalities
but there are cases but like
most systems don't know they even have the disorder
I'd say no cause most of the time from what I've heard they can't interact
Also, I'm so glad I'm not a tiktok user
I kinda wish I was but
MY GOD?
KMONHBGHUNIJMKOPL
happens in early life
yup
yeah
No, those would be ocs
It's the word for the other people within a system, people with multiple personality disorder
Alternate Personalities
which, that's built in lore
Unless the alter is explicitly a Character from a show
I have several friends with alters and most of them don't have fucking Lore about their alters
damn
my god
Man, I am just not on Tiktok
true
what
jesus christ
for reference
I am not on tiktok
Unless they're like, spreading bad dangerous info
Like, I don't get mad at them cause they absolutely have a mental illness
tho
this
Like you know so fucking much
I fucking hate it when neurotypical people try to speak over us
this
And, it;s not like those kids are the majority!
people who are sure about it
We're talking about people who have literally researched
Most people don;t have the goddamned luxury to get a professional diagnosis
Literally
Like, in the UK it can take a 3 year waiting list to see a therapist with a confirmed suicide attempt
Plus the amount of people living in countries where to just see a therapist you paid for takes a year or 2 is so much
Goes down so fast
Also, the likelyhood of being diagnosed when you're an teen much less an fucking adult
That a lot of poor people don't fucking have
Like, have you considered getting a diagnosis costs fucking money?
that's just a bad take,
All I know is that I crack under pressure
it's also impossible to get diagnosed in countries where mental illness is stigmatized
i did, ouch!
yeah
Kids will self diagnose even if they didn't think about it
Those are generally kids tho
that's just factually wrong nini
It can be
No
but I always scored really high on tests I never studied for
I'm still really smart in a lot of aspects but I was never able to do my homework in time
then I stopped being able to handle things
I was also gifted when I was younger
rude
He was a really shitty therapist
Like, I told the guy about my groomer and he was like oh that sucks, moving on you can't do anything a normal person can so maybe try not being a dumbass
Even though I have a ton of other fucking mental issues that guy didn't wanna even speak about them
I've only had my adhd and autism confirmed by my shitty therapist
Our brains work differently so interacting with other Normal people can be hard
Generally, Autism is just having a differently wired brain then neurotypical people
it's like, a lot more common then people think, says a person with autism
Autism is common tho
not liking physical touch is often seen in people with autism
do you have adhd or autism? cause that sounds a lot like my sibling and they have autism
That should say something lol
I gag when I think about irl men that way so
Valid, my siblings the same way
I'm also touch starved,,, And no one is there to touch me
A lot
maybe? but that doesn't really mean much in the grand scheme of
yeah
or just a funny thing to do
You can literally kiss another girl and have it been seen as a phase
Like
Cause any kind of affection between women isn't seen as actually gay
and Women aren't allowed to feel these things just as much if not more then men
being a lesbian isn't really accepted tho
When I joined tumblr
yeah
as well
and totally gay men will
And so bi men will repress their gay feelings
experience
Internalized Homophobia is a thing that a lot of men, even men nowadays
yeah
with yourself
there's a thing called not being honest
like that
Totally straight men do not think about other men
Also
Cherry you're incredibly funny
I
during camp one time in girl scouts during my period I cuddled a girl for so long that the camp leader knew I had a crush on her before I did
reminds me of me and my friend before I realized I was gay
that's so sad
oh yeah, Straight
bury your gays troupe irl?
sure
I want that ;;
in my close friend group there's these two guys who are basically married and I feel both happy for them but also jealous
anyways, I'm not really rushing anything but like, still feel jealous
and single
I'd be open to online relationships,,,, wish I met people online around my age and also lesbian
lesbians in seattle area should be easy to find but here I am
yeah
covid is a thing
well, I go to cons
I do
I just don't have that rn
but it's also a good place to meet others
I know it does
so I haven't had any opportunities meeting anyone
I never went to high school
so maybe this makes sense but like
well, i've been 19 for a month now
thanks
I just don't meet anyone that has potential
been bitchless for years man
I mean, I haven't been rushing it but like,,,
I'm jealous,,,, I just wanna a gf
I'm confused but happy for you, i think
Heki is this your way of saying you got a lover
Currently, I'm working on Pardo to SS, considering my ice team is my only good team rn
one
the huh
What is this image from anyways
<:huh:966619839307321394>
ASTER?
NICE
OH
this chat is a trainwreck
what the fuck
Also
nice
I'm a lonely lesbian
No
Anyone know any girls looking for a relationship?
I, however, am
they get bitches
doesn't tet literally have a bf?
I mean, Birds have smaller brains
so?
Cauze they're birds
Use they them when you dont know pronouns, it's just easier
Also disgusting
I don't even have the thing that would make it jarable
NO
Nadeko Sengoku everyone
oki
She's one of, if not my most favourite character
fun fact, The character the bot;s named after, I have a figure of her
Nadeko,,,,
it seems to work
... hekiexpe
My sibling is telling me I should probably see a doctor
was probably longer
Actually
dw
I did
but my sibling and my family wondered where I was the whole day lol
I woke up a bit ago
Yeah
I, apparently, slept for 18 hours guys
HUH
It still hurts, how does she hurt more then the other cats? She's smaller
Glad she didnt
Although she was almost stepping on my boob which
Is all I can say
Rest in peace
Like I appreciate the love but you are bruising me miss kitty
When a cat steps directly on your ribcage it really hurts but my mom's cat knows how to make it hurt worse
So if Vill-V replaces her I'm good
I have all of her stigs
Thankfully
I'd make a jp server account if my phone had room
Rude
That's not entirely incorrect tho cause some people have different romanji
Already did
Heatstroke, if I am
Idk maybe
I'm jist a bit wamr
That hot
My room isnt like
I am but I think I could drink a lil mode
But I'm still tired lol
Funny thing is is that I also went to sleep after I got home
Well, I could drink more water
Ive done all of them
Why must it be sunny
Why cant it be overcast and a bit chilly
Absolutely
Yeah
I've taken pain killers but man
Well, my body feels warm and sluggish and my head hurt
Hi, It seems like cause I went outside and got sun my body is not rebelling
Aka one of the most popular and well known english vocaloid producers
Guys, I share a rank page with VocaCircus
Was at the beach
why
rn
so, I;m on tumblr yeah? and like, every single letter N in all of the posts are just gone
oof
yeah, you're not quite at the age where you'd have your own money
yes
nice
I think that's what it was
I used to do this on my ipod
yeah
it shouldn't ruin your phone
Sadge
I had HoT on that account
I'd still be playing it if it didnt take up so much room on my phone
I mean, Sea's a good server
Oof
Yea
Heki
Qooapp is andriod only
It's apparently easy
Like, make a jp apple account
You can change your region on Apple
Ooo
Yea
I promise it'll be fun
Heki, please do so
Yes
Project Sekai... soon I can take a break from playing it seriouslg everyday
Anyways,
Cause last day/hour grinding is when you find yourself really displaced
Cause I'm down to 20 and I'll def need to use more
Hopefully before the summer event I'll get enough energy drinks
Man
Tiering is hard
I wanna watch
Also I do
That's a fun screenshot
That's just being a realist which isn't negative
That's not how it works
Everyone I've met with a negative mindset has been severely depressed
It's not really
It's just not healthu
My dad has a similar mindset and he's miserable all the time
But a negative mindset does actually generally make you depressed in life
That's all I'm gonna say
It's really reductive and negative to think that way tho
Heki does learn
Heki's just a bit compulsive
Ndkendkekdkd
That's such a negative way of thinking
Cause no one is
Also, calling people hopeless is really fucked up
There's also the fact that some people think they can fix others
The latter doesn't mean you'd be a bad person
That's only if you're being complicit
I usually think that means the other is what you'd call a bad person
But when you say shitty
I suppose
And if your friends are kinda shitty then you are too?
If your friend seems too perfect that means they're better then you?
Well, it just reads as it
There's not really such a thing as a good person or a bad person
You'll just end up hating yourself
If you continue to compare yourself to other people
Honestly
That sounds like a shitty philosophy
Ajdjsjdjkekdjdjdksks
Thomato is my ship and vibes
Same
Ayato's really fruity in general with all of the men tho
That's def kinda gay
Yeah that's accurate
Valid and true
There's also only one fictional male character I'd wanna date,,, maybe two if I squint but the other man I have a really strong ship for thay I wouldn't wanna interrupt and then I have quite a few women that I'd kiss under the moonlight
Damn,,,
Bug eating
Ngl
They're all kinda mid in terms of dating material
There's none for Genshin yet
I do have a few characters I sorta wanna date but like
Like, yasss, Childe, give me all of your money
My genshin ship is me x childe's wallet
Itto is so dumb it's funny
They fight Onikabuto
Zhongli: I appear to be missing my wallets, I'll go find them.
ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES
LKmjnhubgyvhunijmKO,L;.'
I think my favourite ship in genshin rn is Kokosara tho
I'd watch them carry out like,,, a heist or something
They're great
Yeah, we do have a canon line of events tho
....Ayaka
but seriously,,,, I've heard people claim Ayaka is 16
Gorou and Itto are a great pairing I think
true!
Klee isn't an actual soldier
They're great
Because it'd be funny
I headcanon Kokomi to be 32
ALTHOUGH
yeah
To be real here
Xiangling's probably 18 or 17
Fischl is like 15 or 16
certain smaller model characters are somewhat debatable but yeah, there's not that many minors
I've looked it up
B is literally the average cup size in most countries
This isn't even like in Genshin in where for certain character's it can be debatable
SHE'S DEFINITELY NOT WHAT?
Listen, My chest size might be around Aponia's to Himeko's size but barely any women have that size of chest
my god
She has a pretty noticeable chest
It's not like Fu Hua
Like she has boobs
too
Barely even flat
Mobius is like
and she's not even that short
yeah
but she still looks like an Adult
Like I know she DID shrink
yea
Mobius doesn't even look like one
HOW
we literally play dead characters all of the time
zero brain cells
Aponia's like, entire first half of her trailer would like to fucking speak
none
No Herrscher hints
Heki,,, please be a little more responsible
poor Heki
Hekiii
oh no
I won't bully Heki dw
Bad time?
Hm
CAT
Oof
I could try to contact your friend on wfp?
If you remember their info
KLMMjbhunjkmljnhubgy
SO MANY
Jesus CHRIST
we're friends
no but uh
So you at least have that
I mean you have us
Well
that's def one way
valid
I remember them all cause they're something I can link to interests
and I write them down
I just have a few rotating passwords I use
So, I'm slightly older by a few months
I had my birthday May 11th
Ahhh

Wait what's with the naming scheme
I'm not sure what Saving is
I'm just trying to make my Karenina - Ember good in Pgr
I managed
Something
No Idea how good this is but it's
Lucky indeed
I can do that
So I just need to make M?
I got this from dorm supply the other day
It's this yea?
Thanms
Okay!
Haxxor Bunny?
Oh btw, who do I set as Leader
I'll show my score later
Well, I'm just gonna try my best
Uhhh
Is JST
Btw
Well, I can hope
Yeah...
I def will now
Yeah true
I'll just get it on an offrate one of these days
It's okay
I've tried so so hard for her weapon
I figured Avo would work on her cause you usually use her weapon actives ans switch out
She's trying her best
Oki, this is my ice team which I see being used
By Okay I just mean a score that does not completely suck
Lemme show what I have,,
The MA boss
Does this mean I could potentially get an Okayisj score on husk?
Wait
I'm happy
Yeah
Oh
My Haxxor Bunny
Yea
Good good
Okay
I'm trying to figure out what would be better to get from the Collectors card
Would that be Wise?
I could get both T and B like this, yes?
This is what I have
Lemme show you what I mean
Two pieces
I can buy
At all
I have no Turg
I don't
No
No, I have a box to select a Turg piece and I can buy a collectors card
Cause from my understanding those are the most important pieces
So I get Turg T and B??
I do need account improvement
Yeah, I want it but
me?
Cause I have the Turg Box
With that card?
I should buy Turg T?
We buy the Collectors card yeah?
Night night everyone
Yeah
Toast is terrible without butter, I'm realizing
Well, anyways, yea
Nods
These tones can be hard to parse online
/lh standing for light hearted and /j for joking, even /s for sarcasm
Try thinking about things just a tad bit more, that's all, tone indicators have also been made for a reason if yoh feel like your tone isnt got across
Happens
I'm not someone who holds grudges
As long as you apologize and try to be better its fine
At the very least
It'll make me happier
I hope he dies mad about it
Good for yoh
Yea
Cause the only time's I've been asked out was on a dare
It's honestly one of my trauma's
Try not to say stuff like I'm not worth of love or somwthing
Just
I should just let people know but I've been called stupid for doing that
But then it causes outbursts
I let things go under the bus cause I don't want people to think I get easily offended
Properly
I'm sorry for not showing you the signs then
Aoi wouldn't stop being an ass to me
I'm sorry
It's stop treating me like shit
It's not your turn cause this isnt a fucking vent pass around the microphone
I was setting a boundru
I wasn't venting
Done?
And I'd appreciate it if you'd stop treating me like I'm stupid or trying to hurt myself for being mentally ill
Not cause of some deep seated hatred of recklessness
I'm fucking neglectful cause I can't tell when I need things until it's gotten too bad
No
Like I do it cause I hate myswlf?
Could you not assume I'm doing it on purpose?
I'm literally fucking doing the best I can. I don't have fucking control over my stupid very mentally ill brain fucking asshole
Thanks for trying thk
I'm not mean to people for fun like you seem to be
No I don't actually
No one else here does
Oh, well to be fair you deserve it
Question, do you think if I could actually take care of myself I wouldn't?
I imagine death so much it feels like a memoru
Also tired!
It's cause I'm hungry and he was being an asshole
Since you don't have a brain
You guys
You do, and honestly that act is getting annoying.
You deserve the death penalty
Aoi
What a shame tho
Unfortunately I am unlovable
I wish there was a person I lived rent free in their brain with
Jfjdkdks
Please tell me you didnt cube them
Aoi
Use all of the coins
Lol
What if you got 1pc swords?
Amd 3 gluttons
I have 2 newts
I recently bought mei beach party
Lemme see if I can find it
Actually
I have hos s1
I have HoS
I remember you helped a lot during my early days
i do
Aoi, you okay?
I'm in wfp for the leaks and to occasionally lurk and read the other chats
wish I could do that
the only time I'd purposefully get banned is the YandereDev discord ban speedrun
I've never been kicked or banned for anything and I don't wanna post something harmful
thank god
okay
Don't have porn saved in my pc
I
Hi definitely not Aoi
<@605258215185186816> I'm sorry I'm not banned please please don't rid me from this server I just got to know and befried y'all <:cryge:966624721611403294>
I've never been banned before how the fuck-
I can't
I
I'm not banned...
Hrm
Oh
KEILO YOU REALLY SAID SOMETHING HILARIOUS
THIS ONE TH9O???
MKOVNJIHMOKCL
it's so bad out of context
btw
The asshole in question was my cat
If you see that you'll get the worst out of context I've ever said
Now, my search and browser history on the other hand
maybe some viddy games
My computer is pure picrews, transparents of gacha art, and art that I made
I think it's cause you don't have anyone plotting against you, Rebooting
all of them are at the bottom
The correct term is actually jail time
Didn't know you liked babysitting so much
imagine liking anyone that's not an adult
for ref
what does piece 69696 look like?
Dick brick
valid Tet
I see I see
Ahhhh
is it really tho
anyone wanna tell me what that means so i don't have to look it up
Well, it was a suggestion
perhaps the world wants you to suffer for some unknown reason?
Good question
I'd love for someone to do it for me
Going through the story in general is hell ngl
:(
I am
Yea yea yea
I can fc a 22 song but man I'm tired as hell no wonder I messed up lol
I just completelt didnt register the notes at all lol
That'a how you know I'm tired
Forgot to hit thwm
I just
Stopped fucking hitting the notes
And the miss and 3 goods at the end was cause I
One good was cause I stopped looking at the notes for a second
39014
no
39012
anyways
could be misremembering tho
which I believe they won on jp the first time as well
it seems like the western side is winning
bits of it before I sleep
if you stream I might be ab;le to catch the first few
?
why was it that hard to find opponents?
wow
got it
?
like after the next one
oki
76070
my phone;s dying and it's 7 am
one more time
never really thought about it, ngl
but most of the time on it
Maybe slightly above
like the middle
on it
you mean where the notes hit the line
The judgement line?
I've devoted my entire life to Kanade and all I got was this shoe
sup Fen
we all have mostly different playstyles
valid
my eyes glaze over and I don't feel like I'm looking anywhere when I'm in the zone tho
of combo, my teammates in co-op, the notes, my life, and my score
I like keeping track
my eyes dart all across the screen
ahhh
thumbs*
with thumps
anyways, I play sitting up
second was just me making a mistake
the first good was cause of lag lol
Yup
I'm sad
two goods
I mean, There are definitely reasons not to
it's okay
73620
the room died cause you can't wait in a room for too long
especially in co-op rooms
This is the standard for rhythm games
course not?
of
Did it crash or something
?
Aoi?
48759
Are you leaving the game at all or is this just being rude
This many times?
I swear
53156
lol
I think that one was the other team
Gotta love that
rejoin maybe?
especially the sorry sticker
Learned that one the hard way
btw
spamming stickers can cause people to leave
27476
watch, I'll fc the next song we encounter
80937
oh oki
there's such a thing called top form
it's not the same
those things actually get in the way when I play
also
you don't have giant boobs to get in the way
I need my arms to be free
oof
I was laying down so I kept getting goods lol
Congrats on the fc
You weren't the only low level
not rly
oki
Heki join us!
27819

I'll get everyone back into it because if I'm in hell then everyone needs to be
yes
I joined the room but no one's there lol

the tip is to not make the flicks too dramatic
thank you
hella
btw, I got that Carpal Tunnel achievement I wanted :)
send me your friend code
Taste
OOO
if it's the latter, I balded all day to not get Kanade so felt
In Honkai or in Project Sekai?
That's pretty lucky!!
Yeah!!
You got the Limited Rui
So

In a year
Well, just know that when that gacha ends the next time you'll maybe be able to obtain that 4 star is
That's a Lim
Wedding Rui!!!
CONGRATS
I've made it so discord doesn't pop up when I'm playin
All of the outfits
Those are just like
You logged in for the second day yea?
You did not and that's normal dw
I get it now! The pain is neverending!
Morning
even if it's shallow end cause of how fun I find er
I like playing all the of valks on er every now and then
Well, valid
Especially for ER?
I'm honestly just waiting for SN at this point
cause I have full set Allan Poe
Is it still Allan Poe?
What's SN's bis stigs btw?
lol
i wonder how many hours that one took
that is def high skill
damn
then maybe I'd be able to do Jizo
If only I had Abyss Flower
I have Dudu Elf
Fuck Holmes
Except Holmes
yea
Anyone wanna impart the feelings of doom on Heki to make them not
So
I can be talked out of it if I'm told what a bad idea it is
Heki, you're like me and when it comes to spending money sometimes
maybe sleep on it
Heki,,,
is it really tho?
Nyaruhodo
Ahhh
you mean overestimating?
What else did you expect?
herrscher of Negligence here
it can be both
AT THE BOTTOM OKAY?
I SAW AKA
wait
or
Oh we're on week 6
you should retain it
Unless you have a really unfortunate line up
most of the time no
yup lol
I'm forgetful lol
I demoted from a3 cause I don't play the abyss a lot
And while I am semi fucked it's fineeeee
That's what I did
I play for ER and ER only
Got no turg
Yup!
I can't get lower then this
it's fine
I'll just stay at like agony 1 or something
Thankfully
I'm in pain
Imagine having AE lol
You guys are funny
I'll be looping it until I die
First Lower and now this?
Nightcord gets all of the best songs
The recent JP event song has cemented this
Felt
oof
valid
:(
I receive it gratefully
Thank you....
indeed
but man...
I'm thankful she's colorful fes so I could get her later on
It's very likely I'll only be able to get one more 10 pull before the gacha goes away
Thank you
OOooo
Kanade hasn't come home yet tho cause she hates me
To be fair I've been farming in Project sekai like no other
valid
ah
read anything interesting lately?
good!
you okay fen?
Morn
My head feels like it's being compressed which means I definitely need sleep
Go to bed now
I'll uh
Well
Lol
If I do it'll be once in a lifetime
Fcing might be
Hopefully
I think
Not a dream
Still
I see
Oh
Which means that my dreams of clearing the disappearance of miku is possible
Cause I do too
Right so thumbs actually, good good
Well, there's a different between playing with two fingers or thumbs
Do you play with Thumbs?
Aoi
Btw
Oh
ABSOLUTELY NOT
And it's generally what trips me up rather then the flick notes
That's still hard
But still
True
Of Disappearance yea?
On the master difficulty
You've seen the note spam vomit
I mean
True but not always exactly for project sekao
If my memory serves correctly
Like, maybe 30 or 50 out of the 1300+ notes
There's one with minimal flicks
I think
They all have flick notes but
And 29 to 31 expert rangr
Fun fact, every single cosmo@p song is in the 33 to 35 master range
Like in the cosmo@p songs
As for me, stream taps are fine unless I can't comprehend whats coming at me
You did good at those
Stream taps
Oh
But for you things went downhill the second you hit a flick note
You did a few
Hold and flick?
Rest in peace Carb
YEAH
And that song always fucks me up
6 or 8 small hold and then flick notes
But there's a song where it's just like
Cause they give breaks
Perfectly fine
Like for some songs?
HOLD + FLICK SUCK
Glad I don't play at 10.5 speed lol
Damn
Oh
For me complex note patterns really get me
Everyone has their vices
Which, valid,
Yeah, you're real bad at flick notes
For not having played in a long while
Not bad
I can see your rust but honestly?
That song's just straight up hard
Yea
Rest in peace
Rest
Lol
USING CRYSTALS
I believe that Kanade cards a Healer
Oh wait, Kanade's there now
On that team
No Healers
Considering that you have lile
You did great
But they do mess me up sometimes
I'm fine with flick notes
Take my meds as well
Yup
Ig
I went to handle my before bed time like,, rituals?
Last one
I can watch this
Not yet
oof
You'revalid
Will need to do more not for improvement sake but rather I need fucking crystals
thanks for watching me mald Keilo
I need to sleep
Alright
hella
i think I'll go to bed after this next song
like buying em
Or are you talking about redeeming songs?
Event, playing enough songs, and reading stories
I think you've proven to me that you can play tho
Yeah, I see the rust
Hitorinbo Envy?
I'm 100 pulls in and no Kanade
THAT'S SO LUCKY
OH FES MAFUYU

malding?
well, comprehending beatmaps is def something

Also, I'll stop streaming for now and watch yours
Aight

:(
Let's try a master I've fc'd the expert for
before
which I;ve never really been able to do
I did just clear a 27
but
idk if that's easily
wel
Weird indeed
FUCK THIS NIKKORI SURVEY TEAM
sure!
tru
try
yea
those are also usually harder for me
actually
Lemme try a 28
This map is supposed to be hard
Obviously
Yea
or, let's try 8.6
I think 8.5 is my sweet spot
Yea
Bu 8.5 seemed to carry me further
Okay, 9's too fast, I think I'll try an odd speed
I'm gonna try 9
lemme retry
actually
oh lol
Ye- ye
AOI HOW DO YOU PLAY THIS FAST?
WHAT
ASTER PLAYED AT 10.6?
HOLY FUCK
I'll try aster's spped
Aoi plays at 11 speed but
want me to try machine poem doll?
Think I have?
I
I just played the Intense Voice of Hatsune Miku
I'll try that one tho
No, I was playing Machine Gun Poem Doll
Here's another hell
I'd have to clear that song with 7 or less *goods*
also, not even the hardest that song can be
there's more hell
Did you see that?
<@447416864084328458> Are you ready to witness hell?
I will use an all Healer team
Machine gun poem doll
yes
Ah yea
haven't bought hell yet
Ah, yes
'ah
hm?
who's?
I can find a way to do so
if not
Lemme see if I've bought the song tho
Hell
but
I'd have to switch to jp for it
wanna watch me play hell?
Goose?
Gimme your guys friend codes when you can!
knolkvmlkgrv
Syudou songs are where they're at
valid? ig?
Oh lol
TSUKASA
Valid
tell me what you get!
the rates for getting a 4 star is 6%
Yes
oH
take a screenshot and show me what you mean
sorta
which one?
Look at my crystal count
Unfortunately
Well
but it also means I won't be able to play well
wait means I should sleep soon
I'm starting to get tired
And I'm currently giving up for now
I'm trying to fc expert Hello/How are you?
I'm not that good yet
No
it's insane
yeah
messing up on that spot?
Valid
33
no
My jp is lvl 60 and my gbl is 32
I literally play both
Both!
I will go insane and cry
but yea
oh if you don't want to save jp has more songs
plus colorful fes going on rn
either one, global might be better for being able to confidently save tho
I'm gonna cry
Oh boyo
oof
I'm doing this for Gacha funds
Oh no, I'm not doing this for improvement
Aoi
again
Also, I'll believe you if you do it
I'm going to go insane
I keep messing up in the exact same spot
<@447416864084328458> are you seeing this shit?
their voices are great and beautiful
I wish they had more unique and interesting songs
I love More More Jump's story tho
Yeah they do
They're all Nightowls
Their band name essentially means Making songs at 1 am on Discord
then yes
if you're referring to the name Nightcord
Nightcord also doesn't but that might be cause that's my taste in music
valid
in terms of music
Vivid Bad squad like, Don't miss
but I have a big bias for Nightcord
I love all of the units, except Leo/Need who I'm learning to love
Go with MMJ
but you said you liked Minori and Ichika yea?
Well, it doesn't matter too much
!
Oh@
yea/
the most distracting thing
yeah
ye
cause there's 5 different versions of her
Miku in project sekai is great
idk, it works well enough, it's hard to lose an account like this
Night Aster!
Google play works well
Ye
Account transfer
valid
You like them?
Y'all need to keep better track of your things if you lose the code
which is easy??
you just need to not lose it
The code works
Understand account transfer
Do not
Y'all
No?
It's pretty good
yea*
YEA
I REALIZED I'M SHOOTING MYSELF IN THE FOOT, MY TEAMS NOT A PERFECT LOCK
ALSO
it's also easier to get large amounts of crystals
and the f2p lifestyle is also recommended cause not only is it more rewarding but like
It's also really easy to not go for anyone but your favs
important in project sekai tho?
Gacha isn't really
FUCK YE
Oh, question, Can you guys hear my game audio?
lol
but usually you can clear cache to help keep it small
There's extra data to download
FINALLY
ALSO
5 at most
def not
or Global
and yea
Currently malding on en
I play on both!
Alright back to malding
YEEE
Get qooapp
NOOO
cat
My ca
join the stream to find out
And now I'll get back to Malding
yea
I'm not struggling
I clear and fc songs
so what?
My close friend who's lvl 108 plays on bluestacks
It's my most comfortable speed
8.0
there's a thing called bluestacks
if you have a pc
or like
you should! when you get more storage space
I'm going to spend a long time on this aren;t I?
NOW IT'S TIME FOR THE EXPERT HAHAHA
a good question
thats
I'm so so glad this game has a retry button
my love
This is all for Kanade
many more to go
First one down
HA
let's start with the shortest song in the game lol
Ahh, valid and thank
Keilo
and get at least a hi combo on the experts
I need to fc all of the hards
so, in terms of what I need to do
have fun
ye!
can you see my screen?
<@148145559897636865>
I'm forgetting how to stream mobile
oof
I think
going to start streaming my combo effort
I'm
oh oof
Oh yet this, It's for getting a combo over 1,000
I want it
there's an achievement called Carpal Tunnel
oh fun fact about project sekai tho
I do
valid
maybe work up to 30's...
I need to work on being able to clear 27's better
I have some skill issue but I can do and probably fc 24's on expert
I wouldn;t mind
I mean
Yea
I need to grind full combos
I could play project sekai for you guys
If you wanna see me bald
to both of that tbh
oof
oh so this is what malding looks like
kjuhygthij
Mihoyo's great at this kinda stuff
Like, the way characters move and the physics are all super well thought out
yea
Mihoyo's design team is incredible in coming up with cool and believable designs
Honestly
Same!
she has an extreme Mermaid dress
Mermaid dresses are infamous for extremely limiting leg movement
Well, I can imagine why it'd be hard to walk
Then again my Barbara is DPS
I have Kokomi too...
Sadge
If you use her!
C2 is nice for Barbara!
Well
:(
YEAH WE ARE
Ah, well, c3 Qiqi isn't bad
I saw the gold and wished for Mona
Lol
Also, I had a standard banner wish
Finally
Obtained...
Yelan
lol
I guess I tried for HoF
Hm
valid
negligence still fits
nah
then what is the word?
it was Cherry flavoured
You'll love this Cherry
the bagels I had were 3 days past the due date on the bag tho so If I start dying again I'll know why
I had a caprisun, tasted good
I ate
I am
revived
do it often
I can crack my neck
oh your knuckles?
<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
chronic fatigue I have as well, I think
And I've showed some of the starting signs of being so as well
They both have Fibro
then again, predetermined to be weak, both of my parents are intensely chronicly ill
damn I'm weaker then I thought
that requires having the strength to get up tho lol
and maybe when I've eaten
when it's cooler
I'd need a mic tho
maybe
get a program to edit I might do cover songs as well
when I uh
you should
cause I need to not be experiencing anything my body hates
You'll hear me
on a cooler day
I would've recorded myself but lazy
sadge
I don't think you did...
Aster did you get to hear me?
valid
honestly tho-
I'm the exact opposite of Aoi, huh?
Cold is def a good way to describe Aoi's voice
oho
well, exhaustion is just something that follows me
can't tell
I wonder if what I'm feeling is hunger or just my body being exhausted
LOL
Like, you sound like you're knowledgeable
Just everything
I mean to me you just sound like someone who knows a lot
Like Sparkling cider?
Anyways
We Both Know
We both know there's worse and weirder
But I do have dark humor
I don't have that weird of fetishes
Like a mouse?
I mean I'm happy I'm associated with positive things
a hug...
anyone I remind you of?
I love Maccha flavouring
Me want
bathbombs are a little expensive
Ye
I've had Churro Ice Cream
CHICKEN WING?
Never such a thing
heaven <3
so sweet
So colorful
Lemme show you what it looks like
It's called Fairy Floss in Australia, apparently
Oh then you know what I'm talking about?
?
Oh wait you're Australian right/
yes!
but I like Vanilla too
Cotton Candy
but it tastes best in summer due to it being a piece of heaven in hard times
I love Ice cream whenever
well
lol
lower then that I usually wear pants
I don't usually
Skirts are so nice, I love em
Yeah
with nothing covering my legs
I'll be wearing a short skirt in like 5 C weather
I don't get cold easily
I wear that during the colder months too
oh most of my clothes are probably more considered spring or summer but
Yes...
YOU'RE RIGHT
YOU FUCKING GET IT
YOU
yeah, Washington State is cold, and I like it that way, could be colder even
the average temperature of Washington state is 36 degrees Fahrenheit
let's consider this
well
ye
spring season
or was it last
the name of an anime airing this season
my room can reach 95 to 100 degrees in the summer 👍
I live on the top floor of an apartment complex too
yea
my room is the only one without one
I don't
no
I'll do it later when and if I feel better
these might sound like excuses but I'm not lying
also my back hurts cause I was sitting up
I think I almost actually gave myself heatstroke
I don't feel well rn
Listen
I'm lazy
no
how the fuck will I do her lines if I don't know her kit
Not until I've done the redesign
you use the gun emoji a lot
but oki
Not exactly what I meant
you like guns huh?
ah I see
Extremely
I've heard it before and it's neat, I wanna see the character drawn
noo
I was gonna record it today if I had thought of any but I didn't
I barely remember her backstory or what I had going for her
It's been a long time since I've worked on her
I don't know what she'd say
,,,
FUCK YOU REMEMBERED I GOTTA HIDE
Itto is one of the best
Idk?
so uh
my oc would have my voice Ig
Average?
but it's like
It doesn't sound terrible aside from a few
But I feel like a lot of them are middling and not really great
For example Itto is great
Certain characters in EN are good
It does not suit Xiao in the slightest
tbh
His EN dub is so bad
Lol
Sorta
Emo?
You cannot hide your emo self
How dead your voice is?
How dead you describe your voice as/
have you heard the way you talk about things?
It's the truth
you might be more Emo then Xiao
Baban,,,, what did you think about my Yanfei lines,,,
I do
it's good
KMJMNHBUGYVFBUHNIJMKO,PL;
JP dub voice is also Kirito
cn is almost calmer from what I've heard
listen to the jp or cn version a little
<@447218009749061632>
I WILL HAVE ORDER
you did great
oki
perfect Evn
<@447218009749061632> do you want to hear it?
I did Yanfei
Yes
It's more stern
He doesn't really
Why was my window closed??
What the fuck
I hate life and everything in it
Oh I understand now, my window wasn't fucking open
My favourite Tuyu song is probably actually Damonisch
your brother deserves to be set on fire
You took that the worst way possible huh
Man Aoi
ye
understandable
with a link
hashtag p
either works!
or put in headphones
you can play it on the bot?
thanks
Yeah
It'll fuck me up
I can't
you might have the bots volume too high
WHOOPS
I'M NOT WEARING HEADPHINES
Well, I was just checking if everyone was okay with it
Would you guys like to hear my voice?
Should I sing once?
Well
Ah
makes sense
Bye bye aster
Awww
Your voice is so smooth
Fuck yeah
I'm not sure if I'm good at it
I've tried Befall
Rubia's also really difficult for those without high pitched voices
You're so valid
Have you checked your volume?
Happens
Damn
Hm
Oh Taylor Swift?
Oho
Herrscher of Music at this point Evn
Ye
Cause I've looked around and I don't understand what people are talking about
If you know any good self help sites or books for teaching to read sheet music I'll take em
Also
We hopping in the vc?
And I am too
Every single person I tell this to who's a music major is so baffled
Cause I couldn't play my instrument cause they didnt fucking teach us how to play
I transferred to choir half way in the year
They also only properly told us how to tune our instruments once
They didn't hand out any self help books
And you're playing an instrument
Of middle school
Like first year
That they didn't teach you how to read sheet music
I remember when I joined band in Middle school
Oh?
Oh, uh, thanks uwu
Teach me to read sheet music please
Jealous
Right so insanely talented
You should!
Damn
Parallel universe version of course
Even more fitting, sure you're not Eden herself ?
I hate humidity
Your Eden icon feels appropiate now
Yikes
55%
Lemme check
I hate heat, and I hate sweating
Is greay
Snow and rain
I love the winter cause of it
As well
Preferr below 50
I do too
Yea
That's correct
Yea
Yes
On
I have a window open with the fan
It's 86 degrees in my room...
It's only 64 degrees out? That feels wrong
That i exist in
Oh no, actually it's lower
I survive in cold climates
Context, I live in Washington State, very north Washington state
I exist comfortable in the 50's to 60's
No
I'm too miserable to care
I know I spelt that wrong btw
I melt in anything above 75 degrees farenheight
Understandable
Ye
I wish it was cold here
On a scale from one to ten how much does everyone hate summer
It is too hot
Hello
Lol
you guys need to stop being entertaining for 5 minutes so I can close this chat-
I must
Sleep
anyways
I'm so curious to how this bot functions
or male
It just automatically goes for female based on the wording
<@244423082045997057> guess my gender
hm
the bot thinks all humans are male
wrong
Hm
<@244423082045997057> can you guess my gender identity?
<@309634550273933314> Diagnosed as Trans by the bot
I guess I'll sleep now
It had to rickroll me first I see
<@244423082045997057> May I go to bed?
<@244423082045997057> have you stopped ?
<@244423082045997057> I'm sorry, what did I do to deserve this sheep?
YOU LITERALLY JUST LIED
<@244423082045997057> if you rick roll me again I'll cry
<:HuDisgusting:966924145902370866>
<@244423082045997057> what's the rest of the lyrics
OH OKAY
<@244423082045997057> No, seriously, should I sleep?
thought I posted the rest of the rickroll
I think the bot
I
...
<@244423082045997057> It's 7 am and I haven't slept, do you think I should go to bed?
the answer is yes
<@244423082045997057> Never gonna say goodbye
<@244423082045997057> Never gonna give you up
<@244423082045997057> I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
<@244423082045997057> A full commitments what I'm thinking about,
It's 7 am, who needs sleep lol
:)
I'll just play games and never take care of myself
I don't need anything
Can't wait
What's next!
I can neglect that too?
I don't have to sleep?
Oh!
<@244423082045997057> should I sleep?
bot overload
oh uh
cold
I found where Keilo's coins go
WHY THAT SONG?
HOW THE FUCK
.
Do you guys have an idea on what negligence would do?
But I can def see harm being done
My powers,,, abstract
also that
using money to hurt people
stealing money
Y'all can keep the horni down except Taihen cause they're literally the herrscher of it
it's fine
we don't have one of boobs either
probably actual frightening powers
Keilo's is pretty good too if it was put as it is, Poverty
all I can say is I think I came up with a good thing to be a Herrscher of when you consider that'd be your powers
I mean, you can change it to that when that's revealed
Hmmm
*pats*
Bruh you okay?
OMG
It's funny too cause only two of those look like actual Herrscher names
I'm not asking nicely
he needs to give everyone in this chat 100$ rn
Genuinely
I want to rob him
Does he have an endless fucking wallet?
did he really?
did
Lol
Fruity
you mention fruit a lot
Herrscher of Fruit
I don't really get it either tbh
Aoi is just like that
it's okay, they don't hurt me if I don;'t remember them
Or Bidets yea
Snowcones?
or
Herrscher of Blue Ice
they have excellent taste in favs
nah, tet's the herrscher of good taste
I also neglect everything in life cause I forget my problems exist
daily
I know I picked my name cause I neglect myself
maybe something about whaling?
sadge
Oh around the same lvl in bandori jp
understandable
valid
yup
Thumbs
yup
never full comboing them tho
I've played a good share of masters
Neither do I
most people who play this game do not play expert
that's a pretty good score
You don't actually
compared to the whooping 15 to 20 genshin is...
maybe 3?
it's like still around 2 gbs
not that big
sadge
oh
you suck :(
ah
hand them over
both of you actually
anyways your friend codes
MMJ is very cute
Cute
OMG
it was Chord
I thought since it was music
oh it is apparently
I like MMJ a lot too surprisingly, I just wish they'd get more unique songs
if you're referring to the test we took at the beginning of the game i don't remember
Well my favourite group is Nightchord
Ahhh
Project sekai or?
Which group?
Hm?
THAT AIRI SO GOOD
also taste
oh?
hush, I like the concept of your character and you delivered them pretty well
lol
That's my main
In that order I think
As for my others, Emu, Haruka, Saki, and Akito
obviously
Kanade is one
Saving requires to log in every day
I would really like it if you played it again
that is a joke
I will force you to play it
if so I want your friend code
you play? casually I mean
you do?
you
Kanade is more important
project sekai farming more important
I'll do them tomorrow
as for me
Lol
Less lively then I
looks a bit more
Although my oc
I should too I suppose
oho
You probably shouldn't stress your voice too much then
I'd say
Like a different character?
It's not Diluc but it sounds interesting
lemme hear
vfbtrrv
valid
I am still waiting for your lines if you're gonna post em
I need Colorful Fes Kanade,,,
someone save me
*sighs* I need to farm so many crystals in Project Sekai
that's fine
oki
send it in
ye
line
I love that
I mean, Yanfei's skills are really quick too
just do two ults then
oho
if you wanted me to
I mean I could try to sound dead
Wdym
Your voice sounds more lively then you give it credit for
honestly not bad
you def did that
holy shit
You literally did his death line
Oh-
Will you
Will you risk getting a Holmes?
Good question
Maybe later
and has a lot of tone shifts
Is really long
It's just Yanfei's idle
yea
I can hope with f2p stigs
Perfectly easy for me to save this entire next patch me thinks
Oh yeah that's not great
rest in peace
Also, I give up on the JP lines
Yeah, I think
oki
I keep tripping up on the first line
I keep tripping up
Her JP idle lines are a fucking MOUTHFULL
Fuck ye
thanks uwu
I did not need to embarrass myself like that
Cause I didn't listen to them back
did they sound bad?
Did anyone listen to my lines
Anyways
No one forget
Yes
you smart
Coward
I can assign you a character if you can describe your voice
Eli/
Do you wanna try too then?
Oh?
a plus
everyone is asleep in my house except for me rn
understandable
lemme do jp too
honestly
A good question
that's
Yeah, I suppose
Lol
cause I'm lazy
I did this in one take
Maybe?
Yanfei might sound a lil more animated
We don;t call him grandpa for no reason
He always sounds like that
What do you mean
ADORABLE
Osthmanthus Wine taste's the same as I remember, but where are those who share the memories?
KM;NJHBGVUTFYH
to remember
Long lines
Yanfei has
I had to find me phone
fine@
That's ine!
Ultimate, Skill, and Idle
I suppose I'll do the same?
Alright!
And I need you to shout I will have order
Zhongli
maybe?
Sayu?
But I could def do senti's ult for fun
genshin
What character do you guys think I'd fit?
,,,I suppose I can try?
Lemme look around
Then I will
OH I CAN USE THE JP LINES?
Even have the english lines downloaded
i don't
I say a lot of the JP lines all the time
Ahhh
Does it have to be in English?
Oh!
I really wanna karaoke with y'all
I'm sure you do too!
scroll up
It's the perfect voice to listen to when you're sleepy
Cotton Candy soft
Like
Aster your voice is as soft as clouds
ANYWAYS
forget how to spell
I uh
Yes
I will digiliently listen
Oh!
I think
I'd need to hear your voice to tell
But it's mostly used for Horror writing
Cause SCP is a lot more
I can go more into it
I'm willing to die to hear Cherry
SCP is an online horror writing group essentially
I would love to try to hear your vpice
<:catblush:963351912235810826>
Y- yeah?
actually
to delete it
I forgot
Well
Reposting it
yeah that's a bit accurate in terms of the clip
I can post the file again
KMOPKmp,lfrrfr3
Aster, did you hear my voice?
I think they probably use their discord more
Oh yeah, they don't speak often either
I think everyone speaks spanish in
I'm in a armada that
Ah
Blustorm?
especially when people chat a lot
at least in my experience
If you don't want something to get lost it's better to dm
Aoi
Send it to Aster via dms
I am sorry
yeah
Very different
but like you sound like one
Well not an actual one
It's true!
bye bye
Aoi recorded like, a day or two ago
The voice lines
That suits you for some reason
I've been told my voice is perfect for Customer Service
Well
Does Keilo's voice sound like a professor ?
that's high balling it a lil
Then that's a good judgement
But if you have
I haven't heard them before
Oh voice wise yeah
And are smart about a few things
Probably cause they speak with proper grammar
Keilo sounds like they're in their twenties, I'll give them that
Neither, a fact
2 years older huh
No, you're a Bidet
,,,,
You're turning 17 in like, 1 to 3 months right?
I remember
ASTER I WILL HAVE TO PROTECT YOU
OH MY GOD ACTUAL BABY
Oh
You don't have the minor role so I'm assuming you're an adult
How old are you actually Cherry?
I'm not asking for your Social security number
just give me the ball park
Absolutely not
I'm 19
REALLY?
ARE YOU 12?
<@964806731471405086>
**12?!**
I am not explicitly furry shaming
Innocent Aster strikes again
You have a smell fetish, ON TOP of being a furry? Pick a struggle
probably lactose intolerant
what do you have a smell fetish ?
Please tell me you can't smell the rot scent I have
LOL
CHERRY OUTTA CONTEXT
JNIHBUGYVFTGYBUHNIJ
damn....
I know I smell bad,,,,,, My stupid armpit infection that won't go away
There is no talking out of that
You took notice of her smell girl
Are you sure about that?
hmm
that sounds not straight
thats the wrong emote whatever
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
I agree, can Queen Elizabeth die already?
That does not happen in the west
Fiction
I thought that was
JESUS CHRIST
Marriage Interviews actually happen in Japan?
*sighs*
It feels eerie hearing this from someone other then my sibling
You cannot
But wow!
I mean it's accurate!!
WOW
truly
Yeah...
In which case you'll never need to talk to people ever again
Unless you plan to live as a recluse making money by somehow doing something with 0 human interaction
Unfortunately
It is
this
People
Although you shouldn't Judge
Not everyone benefits from the same things
That can be true but that's not the same for everyone
Aster doesn't want that, if it happens it happens
That's an extroverts mindset
Is that where your wires are getting crossed?
You do not have to be friends with this person
But Aster
I don't think we should force her
Dude,,,,
Nor can we force Aster to try to interact
We cannot force Aster to like a person
That's frankly, not Aster's problem
People need accommodations
Is it tho?
So talk to the teacher and see if you can do this solo
And because of that you're unwilling to open up or try
You don't like people
Because the route of the situation is
if your issue is you don't want to deal with people the only solution is to tell your teacher that
hmm
what games does he play?
I mean, I suppose this is why I'm commonly typed as an extrovert but I don't have a particular issue talking to people
lol
There's certain barriers that can be broken if you're like a person and you share a common ground of some sort
It's probably cause you're both introverts and because you both have a common interest
That requires having a friend with a good business sense
starting your own business requires you to do the networking yourself
That actually makes it worse
Also, Getting a real life job will be way harder if this is what you're having trouble with
really tho
I never really got to do group projects as I ended up switching to online and then dropping out before they became prevalent
big oof
good!
For your grade in school
you just need to do it
Absolutely, if text is easier then text
I understand you might be afraid of speaking to people but you really need to talk that kind of things out
Also you can tell him that if you guys cook food that you're not comfortable eating food other people made
this
Peculiar in he's strange even without that
Peculiar cause you can't figure out what he's saying cause of the language gap or
also that
My suggestion?
Kinda
I'm similar
Maybe
I see...
ah
I could maybe help with your project?
Oh dear
with what?
first s rank gacha valk
I did like the update after she came up
Valid
are most people asleep I wonder
oh rn seems to be a dead period
sounds like a party
But it's true, death is just sleeping forever
Well this is an interesting conversation to read in on
From what I understand yeah
only fictional twinks tho
I like women and a twink that I can break
due to not really liking men
I'm most certainly not a shotacon
🤝
yeah, same experience
My god
shakes hands in fictional are okay
but Fictional men are an exception
I don't feel like my identity is too fluid which is why I'm comfortable labeling myself with Lesbian
so valid
Valid
KMOJNIHBUGUNHIJMKO,LVFVR
<3
I just think that women
understandable!
whatever helps you sleep at night
I couldn't comprehend
like
my first realization I was gay rather then bi was like,,,, looking at irl men and trying to see what was attractive about them
No, I'm lazy, fuck off
they are
WE ARE
oof
you're feigning ignorance and innocence I see
All of the convos
I'm not assuming, you've already proved that to be the case
also that
you know too much to be pure
Lol
Sweet Summer Child
Aster, you are not old enough to understand this
*I'M SO FUCKING SORRY*
I'M SO FUCKING SORRY
THAT WAS YOUR NSFW INTRODUCTION??????
FUCKING VORE?
VORE?
indeed
And got tricked
I was probably 8 or 9
It's not a great memory
N e v e r
Never look it up
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
my first experience with nsfw was probably boku no pico
Dear Lord
Oh
Worse
or like
fan service?
like
Nsfw are we talking
How
OH MY GOD?
Inside was?
for the longest time
in my room
I had Hetalia posters
I fucking remember them
I remember all of their stupid fan made human names
*intense crying*
Idk if I should be happy my first animes were Tokyo Mew Mew and Soul Eater
For cringe, How about an intense Hetalia phase?
yea
rip that person
For cringe
someone actually confessing?
is that
what's the context for that?
For Angel Beats
You should at least listen to the soundtrack
But yeah
It was based on Angel beats
And tbh I still like em
My prev online names are Catknigt and AngelGear
Even seeing it online I cringe inside
There is only one anime I cannot ironically or not enjoy
I like it despite it being hot garbage
SAO's not all that cringe
I have a gamer tag that's interesting now that I think about it
It;s a nice reference
I think that's pretty cool
ngl
Embrace it
You're a Frail Maiden
I actually kinda love that
OH
Yea, give us the scoop
LOL
I like thinking it means Thousands of Cherry Blossoms
Mean's a lot of things cause it's a Japanese name (had a friend online pick it for me cause I didn't wanna name myself) But generally Cherry Blossoms and Thousand are a theme
Okay so my irl name that I use now
Lemme look it up again for the exact meaning
Daw
<:slapbaka:974814370817273876>
I don't have a dick so I wouldn't know what that feels like, also
do we want the name I threw away due to hating it or my current irl name?
as for my actual irl name
That's it babyyyyyyyy
Citrine's a fucking rock
It's a literaly mineral
Well, my name here is a Rocj
,,,
So *you're* the fish
Lol
.....I have two big floatation devices built in for it
I actually pretty naturally float
I can swim
NOOOO
rest in peace
I like riding a bike
Not like professionally but
I adore biking
also
I like tennis and badminton
I've just been slow
even when I was skinner
for some reason despite always being tall I've been slower then everyone
I also, am bad at sports
2 years away from buying drinks....
next year I'll be 20...
valid
Ahhh
FUCK
wait that means I let a 16 year old bully me,
Makes sense
Ahhh
I know cause you mentioned being 12 in a past tense
you are not 12
How old Aoi?
good luck then
I have strong european routes so me being tall was expected
Well
then again I haven't checked in awhile
for Asians
I thought the average was 5'5?
I don't think logic can be applied that way
you should probably stop-
depends on the person
but some stop growing before that
I think the usual stopping place is 20
but in terms of height....?
you don't stop fully growing really until 25
God I'd look like a giant next to you
smol
3 cm if you're lucky
like
I'm sure you'll get a bit taller
but it's happened
only in places with really low door frames
I sometimes hit my head on door frames
Unfortunately, I am bound to reality
I'm 180cm, remember?
there's definitely not enough room for me to do that
probably die and wait hours for someone to find me
and crack my skull open
big time
I would slip
I am jumpy
I feel like I'll turn around and a murderer will appear
cause even though I know it's impossible
but seriously, sometimes I have a hard time showering
yeah
I usually sleep when the morning light has already come
Although
yeah
with the light on
outta the question
bathing?
so
I'm sorry my dumb fear riddled brain can't let me sleep in a completely dark room
???
what are you a bat?
do you bath in the fucking dark?
yeah
but uh
I mean, if my bathroom wasn't so small maybe
i see
we do not have the room for that
huh
what's a foldable bathtub?
foldable?
i'd love to use bathbombs
I wish my bathtub worked for baths man
Taking a shower feels good but also,,, man I'm tired now
you def need sleep=
it was that image
that
anyways, if that's the new mobius skin I want it
Ahh
i think it's cn update?
you should respect that
Yeah if someone explicitly says that they don't want leaks then
is that real?
Thx
night night
dman
head to bed?
guess I'll uh
but yeah
It's not like I'm running on empty!
So
I woke up at 5 pm
to be fair!
anyways
wouldn't the other three work to support Yanfei?
.... fuck it's 7 am tho maybe I should sleep-
that's a great team
?
already
oh it's 7 am?
,,,
for you
I wish
Yaoyao
she looks fun
tbh
I'm very excited for her
I promise it won't make you lose your fanbase
make more dark characters Mihoyo I'm begging
come on
but also
yeah
I mean
nOOOO
I do hope we
I find the hangout events so mind numbingly borin
Anyone wanna go through my hangout event quests
I'm still trying to get Yelan on main
it will
yeah
been focusing on my main account
just
oh I've played a shit ton of genshin since the new patch
I have a 5 star weapon for her
Play more
I should
on my side,,,
I haven't played that much since I got c1 ayaka
also
like Kaeya?
Name's Vitrus
<@309634550273933314> friend req sent
Kurukuru
Every time I hear Asta I think black clover
Right, there's an Asta in Star Rail now
oki!
:(*
:*
I think
ar,,, 48?
I have a well used eu side
I do not achievement hunt
yup
felt
I'm only ar 57
Despite playing Genshin since October 2020
man
He has work
also
he's been playing for a year tho, sorta
well, an honorary uncle
no, but I have an uncle named Kevin
no-
Also, guys, guess how old my dad is
Not current wow in his opinion
Honestly Based of my dad
For Genshin
Like, imagine stopping your subscription to a game you've been playing for like more then a decade
ALSO FUN FACT ABOUT MY DAD, HE FUCKING STOPPED PLAYING WOW FOR GENSHIN
he has Yae Miko and Ayaka
He's ar 45, probably actually ar 50 or 51 but he's not ascending his ar until he's strong enough
Lol
so
Well,,,, He plays Genshin now
his taste isn't the best
his favourite anime's are 7DS, Arifureta, Shield Hero, and Slime Isekai
no, he just isn't as into it any more
My dad watches anime because of me
Actually he was into Kantai Collection because of the fact that he saw some of his favourite ships in it
he's super into them
my dad actually has a shit ton of models of war ships and shit
my dad knows a fuck ton about battleships
lol
I love romance too
lol
cause they make it their entire personality
and don't like talking to people who really like those ships
but I also don't like certain ships
I don't care about the discourse either
that's valid
my opinion of an artist never soured quicker
And then the accusations of terf and homophobia
I thought Not my ship but the arts nice and the dynamics cute ig
I REMEMBER SEEING HER VENLISA ART EVERYWHERE
ABBYSTEA MAN
also agreed
right?
Abbytea
and Homophobic
oh not just that, they're a terf too
LIKE FANDOM CALLOUT POSTS ARE EXACTLY LIKE THOS
KOMIUNHYBMKOPKOMJINHUBGTHIS IS SO ACCURATE THO
most of the time it doesn't tho
I watch some of his stuff like every now and then if it looks interesting
I've become numb to Teccy
doesn't make em minors!
just cause they are short
PEOPLE
MOST GENSHIN CHARACTERS ARE FUCKING ADULTS
???????????
ALSO WHAT
WHAT
YEAH HOW CAN CHERRY HOG ALL OF THE CUTENESS
Traveler's like def an adult
But like
I remember the drama about Traveler's age
GOD YEAH
And it's like Oh fuck? For real?
And sometimes you'll hear some genuine heinous shit
YEAH
HUH
I love knowing about gossip and drama from communities I'm completely detached from
I need to know
WHO IS BIRDIE
OKAY
oh i've seen her around
LIKE
GOD IMAGINE BEING OUTED AS A STALKER?
IT FUCKING WAS
anyone remember Creepshow art?
art community drama was also a mess
Joji does music
yeah
he apparently keeps getting banned from twitch
valid, I like Tuyu too
Ironmouse is pretty fine
I don't remember them tho
I think!
Tuyu's a problematic fav?
Until he was exposed to be an Alt-Right guy and racist
I Used to be a Jontron fan
FUNNY YOU SHOULD MENTION THAT
I wanted to murder them so bad
I could *not* handle the characters
I read it
YACHIRIN BITCH CLUB?
No
when it comes to my problematic favs
Mine would have to be Sekirei and Rosario + Vampire
problematic favourite anime...
valid
the anime ?
which is why I've moved past it
Same
yea
I don't think he was much older
it was a long ass time ago but basically he dated an 18 year old with mental health issues and it got bad
Like, I've accepted Maretu as my problematic fav
oof
to be fair I've accepted a few people as my problematic favs
hmmm
maybe it was just venting
Cause he drew cp on his pixiv but it was in comic form
oh really?
wait he did nfts?
this part
And I stopped listening
Kikuo,,,, I used to listen to his stuff but I've heard some really bad things about him,,,
HONESTLY SAME
ONE OF MY FAVOURITE PINNOCHIOP SONGS
THAT'S LIKE
DUDE
DUDE
APPLE DOT COM
that is if you haven't already heard em
If you do I might have some recommendations
yes
Cherry you're amazing
It's just they hurt my brain/eyes
I know they're not bad
I know!
might give it a listen
Mili did a cover of Komm Susser Tod and it sounded great,,, does the Eva version sound good?
super cis yeah
It's actually hilarious
People just straight up die in Yugioh
yeah
damn
in the manga
He straight up murders a guy
Not even sent them to the shadow realm?
Like
Did you know that Yami Yugi actually killed someone in the manga?
I've read the Yugioh manga
I don't like watching old anime
I haven't watch Evangelion
To be fair
In the og anime I think
Oh isn;t that Asuka's death scene?
Love Angels
I do like that fuck
YEAH
Not after what I'd do to them
I fucking love Angels and Angelic shit and like
I FUCK with Angels
I love religious imagery
good point
yeah I love the bible
probably one of my worst decisions
I watched all of Jujou Romantica cause it was gay <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
UNDERSTANDABLE LOL
I vibe with Homura too
Super canon
Yes
Homura is insane, and we love that for her
Lol
Honestly, still not convinced they aren't
did too
i uh
*pats* don't listen to the haters
I however, Feel no shame when I think about the few Fictional men I feel attraction to
very
Fictional men are different
so
but I've gagged at irl men when I've seen them in sexual situations
I find fictional men attractive
same for bi women
there's no compulsive element there
it doesn't apply to bi men cause Bi men *are* attracted to women
true
It's just more common for Lesbians
it can
valid
Essentially you felt like you needed to like be into men
Yeah
For SURE
OH I HAD ONE
LKJNIHUIJMOK
MKOJNIHJMKO
which is valid!
that sounds like some genderfluidness with a lean towards being a girl
KMJNIHUIJMKO,PL;V.EFVE
Could you turn down the settings a lil jeez?
Like sorta right but
IT'S EXACTLY THAT
YEAH
It's me tho
valid
I mean the pride flag in my icon is Lesbian and Demigirl
I'm just void with Left girl
nor do I really feel gender dysphoria
But I wouldn't transition in any way
Not cis
I am
probably some kind of transed gender
Aponia's probably actually a G or an H
Btw
The average boob size is a B or C
Oh yes
bra's won't fit otherwise
yes
if anyone doesn't know how big those are just look up that size online
Seems to be the actual size
40 G
uyeah
I actually need a new/better bra cause my true size is a cup up from that but a smaller band
my bra size is 42 DDD
I got my fucking wish
To be fair
Well
Not even look at
Feel
To like
GOD WHEN I WAS YOUNGER I WANTED BIG BOOBS TOO
i'd look up the game in incognito
honestly almost same
Yeah...
,LKJHI KMOFRVR
oH NOO
Def was one of my lesbian awakening series
God
LOVE LIVE
then again my mom's bi and polyamorus
my parents reacted lightly to my coming out
yeah, truly
cause I thought I was bi at first but turns out I'm lesbian
man,,, I kinda wish I remembered when I realized I liked women and when I was a Lesbian
MIUNHYBGTYHUNK,OPL
you're so valid Cherry
I don't remember when I realized I liked girls
god
i love that
true, something as hard and fun
Do want to fight a boss in Genshin that's as hard as Husk
I

DISCORD
KJVLVRVRRV
thank you
I wish you a very Stygian Nymph soon
*cries*
Turg loves to avoid me
*sighs*
Yeah...
I might
I've been told not to use it until I have another turg piece
I wish I had another Turg stig and the one I do have rn is the box one
yeah valid
but wow
Everything about Honkai
Not like I understand
I see
Huh
tru
next-
Cause Newt B is better
OF THAT BITCH
THE AUDACITY
AND THEY BACKSEAT???
YOU'RE LVL 81+
IMAGINE THO
Valid
KMJINHUBGYVBUHIO
win win either way
either my audience will kill me or solve it for me
I'd let people backseat
I def would interact
true
I'd love to do actual covers
I think I can sing a lil
maybe I have practiced
I mean, I do ramble in my head at all times talking to an unseen audience
I could git gud
Wait am I interesting tho
You are!
MOKNiomojni hnokm;
how'd it go?
My first vtuber design was a Dinosaur
I've got a few idea;s
well, I'd probably draw my own design
tru tru
it's more accurate to say it's a .5 vtuber
That's not exactly a png since there's minimal rigging
Which is why Pngtuber!
yup
well, streaming would probably be a hobby since it wouldn't be a job since I wouldn't be in an agency
I'm guessing they preferred the same for Nijisanji
Hololive requires you to be a content creator beforehand
I wasn't even for consideration lol
I didn't get an email back
I've applied to Nijisanji
like Hololive and Nijisanji are the only one's I see
Unless it's Vtuber's and nijisanji lol
Then maybe Twitch?
I see
I mean I could stream on both platforms?
yea
Thanks!
Oh!
I'm not sure which is friendlier, youtube or twitch
yeah, that's a good question
the problem is where to stream and how to hook up my switch to play splatoon on stream
that way I could save for it with streaming money
Oh that's a good idea
it is
I've recently come to terms that if I want to be one tho I'll need to make my own model I think
I've wanted to be a vtuber for awhile
true
Do you think people online would listen to me if I started streaming?
OH HI THANKS
is that comic about boobs?
is
It makes for an interesting voice
Aoi the fact that you can say that with a deadpanned voice is hilarious
close to Canada
I live
oh really?
owkmoervre thanks?
I am
thanks
Like a microphone
Mic!
god this is kinda embarrassing-
Here
Uh
I'm not sure what I should use for my voice example
any kind of greeting line?
not seeing anything
Looks like I might have to
Have any of you heard my voice before?
now that I think about it
I kinda wanna try it too
I wonder if I have voice recording on my pc
One Hit K.O.
the line's silly tho
It sounds perfect
MOKINUYHB7UHNIJMOKL,VFE
Friends deserve to be complimented
I can inflate it as much as I want
idk
God Tet you're fucking hilarious
KODMIOCMOIVV
Maybe you should come up with one for me,,,,
You're hilarious
Tet you've killed me
OMINUJHBYGVFYBUHI
No, definitely not
PFFFF
Not particularly but your voice sounds like it
The one that you'd know nothing about until you dedicate yourself to his route
I'd say Aoi fits the mysterious character type
come up with a one liner that an Otome character would say
I dm but my entire campaigns are entirely adventure with jokes thrown in
Got nothing
No, Thought about it
but sure
It'll sound like a joke
I've been told my writing style is comedy mainly
Absolutely not, I do not write serious things well
OH UHHH
Like,,, dark in a sad way
No kind of sexual content but maybe some dark content
It'd be a dramatic one
Not yaoi!
Maybe something more modern
Fantasy?
You know?
All male casts
Otome games
You know those dating sims?
Lik
you sound like a dating sim character
send all
jkjk
Say it in a British accent
I'm not feeling murderous today so I'm letting it slide
Would you have preferred that?
I wouldn't know what it's like cause people are constantly telling me I need to turn my volume down
yeah is it?
I'm sorry
Idk you give off the impression you'd be louder
you just sound quieter then I expected tbh
Your voice sounds great
You're fine!
nah my volume was down, although it's still a small bit quiet
unless I've turned down my discord volume all the way again
it's very quiet
is that your voice?
20% img dmg...
since I'm not afraid to show it off anymore
I mean I've stopped thinking that way about my art
True
Lol
they're online
cause we've dmed before
I mean I could tell Fenri to look at the chat
thanks
Yeah,,, I suppose I really shouldn't even consider their opinions
A good point
that's
So I get insecure about a lotta things
calling it ugly
I've had someone be really cruel about my art
people online are mean?
Irrational fear?
Idk man
I mean I'd do karaoke but I'm afraid of people hating my voice so I've only ever done it with close friends before
That might be cause any food I don't like I end up throwing it up
then again
I just can't imagine it
I'm not shaming per say
HAHA
they're disgusting
Imagine liking banana
thanks
aight
the fire or ice side?
what side do I go on?
thanks
oki!
or really anyone for shield breaking
I don't have any gear for Carole
what supports?
but alright, use Nyx?
not that I'd have any of her gear but
maybe I should switch gears from getting crystals for Silver wings weapon and go for HoF
I've been meaning to get HoF
I do not
no
Do I bring
Who
need help
I uh
so I should be fine
and my HoS has her weapon, and her B stig
I have a mostly fully geared sa
and I could potentially get her weapon rn
I say I want her cause I have full set Allan Poe
well
luckky
I want AE or SN
I'm coming across my s rank guarantee from the dorm supply
man,,, I need AE
Just cause it's light out doesn't make it morning, me
Yeah
Lol
Then I remembered that I woke up at 5 pm
I was gonna say Oh it's evening for you guys?
,,,,,Morbius?
Morning
But still expensive
Less then I expected@
Oh nice
Probably more then 500$ per night if you say you can't afford it
?
How much is it
Oh that looks fun and nice
It's been like more then a literal decade since I've been and I only went once
Valid
I'm sorry it sucked so bad
Oof
Wait you live in Japan?
Damn
I miss it so bad
And it was/is one of my best memories ever
I remember when I was little I went to a planetarium like this
I am jealous
Live there
Honestly I would love to just
I want to be there
I
With my brightness turned all the down of course
And sometimes I'm on my phone regularly if I sit at the very back of the theater
It's not illegal
Hfkskskaka
Mine are literally just a somewhat uncomfortable seat
What the fuck the theaters around your guys places are so cool
DAMN
Noooo
What movie are you seeing?
not them
hopefully
oh
did you really just spend that much-
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
btw
that's a joke
you should spend that now!
oh
which is insane
also, all I need in SN and PoA and I'd have a full set Styigan Nymph
also, i am jealous
instead of her weapon?
Can we talk about the fact that I believe I've gotten 5 dupes of her different stigs
Silver wings weapon
okay but what I really need is
cause at the time I was really hurting for it
get the focus card from her trial
and I really did it just to like
well, it has improve her numbers
ahhh I see
I need em bad
Is that I'm lacking all of my lighting stigs
All I know
well
IJUNBY87HUINJMokl
Oh
It is done
I CAN FORGE IRIS
I FORGOT IT ONLY TAKES 50 OF THE SC METALS
WAIT
I got Iris after I ran out
outta pri arm mats
I am working on Iris rn
here
hold on lemme repost
do you guys think my pri arm choices were smart?
anyways
damn
I keep using them cause I need more mats
I don;t
y'all have stamina items?
Jealous
If that's your account...
I have spent money
I have spent money in this game
well, yeah
:(
Here's what I have in terms of gear
that's som sad
who knows maybe you'll be able to give me pointers
I'll show you guys my stuff
150$
I'd raise it a bit more
actually
hm
ye
I base the price more after that
how well invested is your account?
idk, how many stigs and s ranks do you have?
I wouldn't just sell it
and it'd have to be big money
I'd only sell mine if someone offered to pay money for it
maybe more
600$
I'd sell mine for
depends
yeah I can imagine-
god that'd be nervewracking
it was!
I don;t think I've had any crushes since then
yeah....
which is cool and I respect them a lot
pan and non-binary
they came out to me a long time after we had drifted apart
but at the time I thought they were straight
I sorta did
I barely know what they're doing anymore
we've drifted apart over the years
well, keyword being had
Btw
Also had a crush on this friend
I uh
Lotus I believe
It's simple but it's also nice
This is my other friends painting
She draws dogs and cats a lot
That friend, she's a really good artist
Yeah!
The other one by a different friend is like,,, two to three I think
This one was from about a year ago?
including that picture
so a lot of stuff has been moved
the other hasn't been hung up yet cause I recently cleaned my room
I can take a picture of it
rn
Yeah, one's hanging on my wall
I have two friends who've given me paintings
sad
Dawww
oooo
for valentines
no it's been less but I sent that drawing to a friend
and I haven't drawn physically again in probably 4 years
on the computer
2 years since I deleted all of my art
it's been like
That's why I've been taking better care of my stuff lately
of course I do
partially cause I can be airheaded and make dumb decisions
it's partially cause I don't take good care of my things
mostly
i count it
so upset I really liked that art
I've lost it now
There's this thing I draw a long time ago and it used to be my icon
I have just realized
that;s really cool
oooooo
I need to fix that.
also playing games
mostly cause I spend that time reading and daydreaming
I don't draw as often as I should
You're so valid
nice
valid
if only I was that
yeah that'd be smart
Ahh
I did not
which, at that time?
if you didn't have a defined folder for it
accidentally deleting digital art is so easy
Also
I don't have access to my old art
but anyways
that's a good idea
he's not a good boy most of the time
due to my cat peeing on a lot of it
and my hand drawn pieces are worse off cause we had to throw it away
I don't have access to some of my old pieces
I was super upset when I found out I had
I once accidentally deleted my entire art folder
Like
very lost
but unfortunately most of my old art is
I'd grab my old art to roast it
No nail no knuckle mcgee
that hand tho
the shading is good and the face looks nice!
adorable
I've had a few drawings like that
oof
don't put yourself down too hard
and the hair does as well
and the clothes look wet
over all the posing is good
The drawing is pretty good, there's just a few things that aren't great
it's okay!
That's an umbrella!
Oh!
there's an object next to miku that I can't comprehend
also
that's not that bad but I'll agree the rain isn't well drawn on the leg part
Sure?
Good*
The flow of the arm and how it looks is gooe
The line's slightly crooked I think but that's about it
Only a little
Yea the chest looks fine
I don't really think I draw anything exceptionally well either
For me, I don't think there's an easiest part
I'm jealous of people who can draw flowy hair
I wish I was better at drawing hair, it always looks so stiff and lifeless when I draw it
Man
Ooo
I really really need to get better at hair
IA looks both fun and annoying to draw
Something about Honkai enjoyers make em good at drawimg
Thats pretty good
Oooo
so I will eat
I'm feeling hungry and know that I am
I will dw
I need to eat
I think I'll stop drawing for the time being
Kilo
NICE
sounds nice
oo
good art can take time
valid
Also, my oc is a cryo catalyst
You're good at drawing scenery, damn
ALRIGHT
DAMN
I def need to try this on an actual drawing
I see what you mean
Omg
the airspray brush?
just like
I need to try this
omg
No, I haven't seen your art before, I don't think
the gradient tool?
I haven't no
understandable
also, There's some sneaky ways to make it work the way you want exactly
You can set it so it doesn't
but still, I meant the shading
def
great too
Your colouring is
damn
I might do what you did for it cause the idea of using the menu pose is a great idea
I sent my genshin oc in <#977588577720467546> but I'm thinking of giving her a bit of a redesign
She is very pink
Pyro!
what element and weapon type is she?
I love it
nice! that means this characters one of the taller women characters?
I should do that with my genshin oc
That's your oc in the like, idle pose genshin characters have in menu's yeah?
You're really good at drawing
WOW
did you draw that?
no
How to fix
I think the proportions are off
hmm
valid
hewoo
it's def more japanese if the far right is Japanese
yea
yup
It's a maid outfit
yes
lemme check some things online
skirt
I'm not sure what to do with the skit
ye
Haircolour done badly lol
Lemme colour it a lil
It's an oc
OH THANKS
by your parents?
HAVE THEM BE THEMED TOO
YES
honkai characters
for some yea
if you think that's funnier
could even be Murder Makes us Horny
or maybe just Murdering people is great
Death Games for Fun
y!hug <@483689649727078400>
anyways
I'm more comfortable that way
If you wanna make a server for it sure!
ah
y!match <@483689649727078400> <@241051045864800259>
If I could kill myself one thousand times over I would
I actually depise myself with a burning passion
That's incorrect
Huh
t!friendship <@241051045864800259>
Yay!
t!friendship <@964806731471405086>
Bots broken everyone go home
The bots broken
WHAT
t!friendship <@726672158151147521>
EYYYYY
Wait
Wow Tamako thinks everyone has bad or average friendships
t!friendship <@309634550273933314>
LOL
I see
She is
Is she your favourite?
Jdiskdjdksos
Do I draw
What
Also,
Unsure
sure sure
also
?
when a mod comes alive then
Then uh
Amazing!
If you say so!
cause I'd really hate it if someone came and disrupted us
But I'd want it to be a role access channel only
if you say so
how do you make those?
Cause unless the mods would be comfortable with me owning a channel for it
I'll make a server maybe??
yeah true
I'd maybe do a death game cause those are simpler to make
I could whip up something interesting?
Hmmm
I do do ttrpg's
anyways
it's just not on a console I personally own
I have a jack box, although not entirely mine but we bought it cause it was my birthday
like campaign
I can make a death game or a dnd game
What kinda roleplay would you guys be interested in?
Alright
Uhmm
?
Oh Shit
If you guys are interested
Make one
I coukld
I mean
Like, what's a roleplay without conflict
No but that's fun
cause of the time
Death game ones are really hard to arrange tho
Me and my friends prefer DND roleplays or Death game ones
He has so many maps for DND
I mean what do you expect out of someone who grew up with a Dad who was way into DND
and I have nothing else to do with my time
I roleplay cause it's fun
And they're basically married
and skip forward a year
And the one who came up with the idea kept rping couples with this other guy
for my birthday
bought me a figure
they like
I have close discord friends
I mean
Like!!
ALSO FINDING A GIRL AROUND MY AGE WHO LIKES ME IS DIFFICULT
PEOPLE ON DISCORD DON'T LIKE ME LIKE THAT
that would require leaving the house
where do you meet people
I'm fucking jealous
Oh man you people are in Relationships?
valid
cause I haven't studied that yet
Not written tho
I do understand some Japanese tho
I don't understand Chinese, unfortunately
Valid
Ahhh

you can mute yourself and watch
I need to open my art program

That's why I didn't want it added
the asshole in question was my cat
It was out of context

How?
tbh
You really suck at those jokes
Aoi you're *not* going to get with one of those jokes rn
You will not like it
and It will not be swift
Cause death will come
I hope you're ready
You've spelt your own demise
Keilo
No one will be able to sleep with their eyes closed if this gets added

I will kill all of you

Don't. Bother. :)
Don't bother

From what I hear spiders are rare there
Actually I have thought about moving to Iceland cause of this
Y e s
It seems nice
I'll move here
That's it!
I do know you get less spiders the colder the environment is
Just not them
I'm fine with other insects
Want life without spiders

I FUCKING *WISH* MY ASSHOLE COULD TAKE CARE OF INSECTS
NFKDKEKJWJSKWKW??
LIKE A TENIS BALL??
It'll bug me if it's alive
But yes
Lucky
ah yes, the good old, throw an entire house at a spider to kill it
yeah
spiders aren't fucking slow
if it's big enough it moves too fast
and not disgusting
small
they just need to be
Hey! I managed once!
if you're not somewhat calm the spider will get you
true
but as long as someone's there to save me
not really
well
my hero <3
or a flamethrower
Need to invest in a blowtorch
Ah, right
just incase
I gotta carry matches with me everywhere now
maybe if I did set myself on fire it'd kill it definitely
Actually
Like I'm on fire?
or something
Like, I'd get a heartattack
tho,
No I think I'd probably just die on spot
Yeah
I'd kill myself
Hahaha
Silverfish and the rest are fine cause if they're a nuisance I can kill them
It's like, very funny
It's funny tho, the way all tension and fear leaves my body when I look at spot on the wall and if it's not a spider on inspection
Yea
Some of the see through bugs are gross too
Yeah
Mostly
It's funny
I'm fine with moths and other bugs
Not reallt
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
I'm over it
I've encountered one recently every 3 to 5 days now for almost the entire month of may and now
The worse it is
And the bigger they get
I can't handle spiders of almost any size
But yeah
Valid
My keyboard for comparsion
I don't live in fucking Australia
The size of my thumb's finger nail
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584> pretty big
I was in the bathroom and there was a spider on the wall
I'm fucking cursed
Guys
Awww, still! This year, next month, exciting
yes!
Aster we care
true
I think that'd cause you to die
but generally I just leave and if I can't I'll bang my head against the wall to let out my frustration
For me it depends
ahhh
what are we talking about?
Thankfully, I've saved my hangout events for such a case but it's taking awhile to get through thwm
50/50 and I have 58 primos currently
I want to get Yelan but
More like I have primogem grinding to do
I am slightly dead
I hate alcohol

You're good a drawing
I'm jealous that looks so proper with a background
So cute
THE BOTTOM MOST DRAWING
Also
It's just rhe vibes
I know
This reads as you holding a gun against Heki's head-
We'll see
Will I?
I should
I should draw something for pride month...
You did a good job it looks nice
I see
You drew them well
OOOO
I hate it when shampoo gets in your eyes in general
It stays like that for a short while and then completely falls apart and I'm up at 3 am again
Every time I fix my sleep schedule
Honestly
Same tho
Squiggle...
However you're doing it must make it easier
Teach me sensei
Hands aren't easy but Frills? Are a nightmare
I should sleep too but I need to finish eating otherwise my body will yell at me
Night night
Night night Aster

ASS PHYSICS?
Ahhj
Also they're fun to draw
Oppai are eternal

Also posted in art
Nice
Lemme look around for it
I am!
I can find it
If you guys wanna see my art,
God I need to draw something fully again
I sympathize
But when I got a new pen I remember having difficulty
I draw on my laptop screen cause my laptop is touch screen and I have a pen that works for it
Valid and understandable
I think it looks cute but I also understand your feelings
Man, can't imagine that,,,
Yeah
That fucking sucks my friend
Oh
If you feel that
I don't think it does but you might need a different brush for colouring?
Well, for csp I use the paid version
I see, You Sail the Seven Seas as well
JFKEKDKEKDKWKS
I only draw on grey cause it'd strain my eyes wayyyy too much to draw on white
Gray is generally better to draw on due to it being easier on the eyes
It's nice knowing someone else draws on gray
I use the program myself
The good ol csp
I'll check their stream out as well
I figured!
Lol
Yeah, which makes me relatable 🤘
Felt
I'm really bad at the whole,,,, taking care of myself thing
Yea
And I feel better
I've turned off the light
It's cause I get distracted
I usually have my tech at the lowest brightness to avoid strain
True
I cant spell
Causing me issuse
It was actually my lamp
Well
Most of the time
Nope
I'm so sensitive to light and for what?
Sora stream?
And my eyes started to hurt real bad and I have a light headache
I thing it's mostly hunger but I also had my light on for too long
I am in pain everywhere cause I neglected everything
I think I did the self destructive thing again
Hello, everyonr
Fuck yea
I shall go eat ice cream

Such wonderful cat colours
LOVELY
OOOOO

He's a long boy
I shall
My cat!
I can send a picture of my pride and joy, Herman. He's my kitty
Yes good idea!
I'm aware
I would pick it!
If there was a better option!
so!
and scratch at my skin until bloody
that can cause me to not sleep
and it triggers deep paranoia
but It's not a phobia for nothing
I understand in great detail how good and important they are
I do for my mental well being, unfortunately
Well
yeah
if anything it's a mercy to kill them quickly rather then letting them starve to death
cause of the lack of food and temperature
it was a male spider and most spiders you'll see inside the house will die when you take them outside
thankfully
that's why there's spiders
at my old house
I've had an ant infestation tho
No
or if they do don't show their ugly faces to me!
They cannot exist in the same space as me
just
and I leave spiders outside alone
But yeah, Other bugs don't get me as much
I like you
you have a heart
It deserved it
when I was laying down on my bed
It had the gall to be right fucking next to my face
Listen
also it was tiny
no
we don't get cockroaches here
to the point that I've thrown up once
Like
I am like,,, deathly afraid of them
guys someone comfort me, I had to kill a spider
Florida sucks
I'm not familiar with chinese game terms

To see a man that pathetic?

Like
I like miserable men but not in a sexual way
KMOJV,PLMIJRVMOKDCW
taste, you have
Top tier design
SMASH
I'm curious...

Men can be pathetic tho
What's the point if she can't kill you?
Coward
And blood!
WOMEN AFTER MY HEART

Oh!
You a girl?
O
truly
KOMJINHUBGHUNJIMKOCDVF???
it works!
and if it's too hard I hide them with long sleeves
for hands
I usually just guestimate
Mobile games,,,
WOW
THAT WAS UNDER THE SUIT?
THANKS!
DIDN'T NOTICE
That's pretty self explanatory
I'd ask if you like cats, but your name is Neko
Maybe it'll get me motivated to draw
I'll watch too
PFFFFFFFF
he shall perish
the hills he chooses to die on are the hills I will kill him on
tired of his shit opinions
diavoros sucks man
the second I get a new valk it disappears
kinda
I am also always struggling
oh!
but the pastel kinds of those colours
mine is,,,, pink or blue
my guess is bruh
...i see
lol
Oh so that's an auto replier
it's the month to have gay sex with demons
yup
I'm only captain lvl 81 so I didn't have time to worry about that
well
oof
oof
that would've sucked for past me tho
Well I'm glad I play regularly enough to not really have any
Oh okay
OH
or is that like
wait is offline exp going to no longer be a thing?
OOF
So I can go Biking again
I can't wait to move next year
I want to go biking again like I used to but there's no place here
oof
it runs in the family
garlic in particular but other kinds of herbs can as well
anything other then bland stuff can cause stomach pain
I have a baby stomach
the spices
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
hard lol
That'd mess up my stomach
,,,
I also,,, get bored when I eat the same thing all of the time
but I understand
Probably cause you mentioned it
but I assume you might be wanting variety?
those are good for ya
still, have fun
oh oof
Have fun eating it
that looks good
Oooo
OH OKAY
LKMMJNIVFOPV,
oki!
Ah
College?
You did, I'm proud of you
Just let people be people
Not all asian's are smart,,, It sucks that people always expect the best out of Asian people over here
oof
yeah
and I was barely doing my work at that point
I got like two years into high school
Yup
a future?
yup yup
it's a distant past to me now
it's personal but I don't mind sharing this stuff I guess?
and then when I was 16 I dropped out entirely cause looking at the school website caused me to lock up
Well, I switched to online schooling 2nd year of middle school cause of bullying and like,,, I would've had to switch during 3rd year cause of the move
I also did online schooling at home before I dropped out
who knows
Oh no it's okay I just hated myself so much and had panic attacks whenever I thought about doing school work that it was better for my mental health
It's really been fucking ages
God, I dropped out before the pandemic,,,,
oof
well, it's also semi my fault for dropping out of school
yup
It's dwindled a lot
so
but I haven't done proper schooling in ages
I was good at math
In middle school I remember sleeping through math class cause it was like almost right after lunch
oh that fucking sucks
The possibilities are endless and I for one love unexpected fun things
What if I want that?
good point
yeah
I'm just not enough of a freak to get a funky role and was feeling sad about it
It's okay
the kind that avoids saying things out right I think
and caring for the other person
It's all about balance
well, just cause they're an m doesn't mean they'll take everything you throw at them
Well!! A relationship couldn't continue in that case!!
I don't want to hurt anyone too bad tho
understandable
K?
A bit of a freak
See
Lol
Honestly why not both?
Well Emotional Damage can be good!
lol
I'd feel guilty about that
I'd rather not have my partner deal with an infection
Not too much
Blood....
No need to call FBI
As long as it's a willing adult!
Depends on the kind of tears
Well
Death to all that tease me tho
Just a lil
Well, perhaps
Lol
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
Tears are great.
Varied ways
When it comes to characters I want to mess them up in a lot of ways
vague huh
hmmm
well, still, lots of eyes
does it?
while it is invite only
there's multiple people on this server
I shall refrain
I'm not sure if this is appropriate to say on a public server
hm
Well, I am sane but like
if that's how you describe it
I may have put myself too low
hm
Oh, Pushy
surely, you'd know
What's your opinion, oh Herrscher of Horny
yea
and yeah
man pain is making my spelling worse-
I think masochists are more common then sadists imo
Oh in terms of hornyness?
I think
valid
Mostly psychological stuff tho
6?
Hmmm
Well, uhhhh, if I must, I am a bit of a sadist when it comes to some of my favourite characters for one
lol
?
4/10 for my keysmash
mvfokvmrvvr4
But generally I am quiet about it because I can keep to myself
Listen, I could describe the ways that I am a freak in terms of horny if you want cause that seems to be a specialty here
lol
digging? how?
My freak level is tame!
Exactly
lol
yeah
I do like the crazy characters
I'm a little bit of a freak
well
ah, but unfortunately I'm not a hardcore freak or someone with a consistent joke
I want a funny role
lol
I think you're very consistent, at the very least
Lol
for you maybe
I think my shoulder would break if I tried toilet
Heated toilet seat is for ass, not shoulder
heaven
My sibling lent me theirs
oooo, heating pads are great
lol
understandable
Ahhh, so you're a monster fucker I see
Who's Mister Knight?
👌
yeah
well
Lol
that's how you know!
I play Honkai *and* Genshin
I'm not exactly fragile but I'm what you'd call, Self-Destructive
eyyyy
lol
👍
It's okay, I've always figured I'll head to an early grave
or when I'm hungry until I'm so hungry it's hard to move
I don't notice my headaches until they're really bad
I don
or a lot
Just a lil
thanks !
I don't notice my physical state getting worse until it's really bad
so lazer focused
also I sometimes am just
yeah
I am dealing with it tho
maybe
sometimes when I'm doing something it makes it hard to notice when the pain happened
It was worse earlier before I had my mom massage it
Maybe,,,, 5 hours?
Unsure
honestly?
just to the elbow
like more closer to the spine
mid shoulder?
my sibling thinks so too
I think I made a very sudden movement and tore something
a little after is what I mean
Or like
I think it got hurt when I woke up rather then in the middle of the night
idk
thanks to it I've not been able to play my mobile games well today
which I managed to fuck up somehow
aside from my shoulder
I've been fine
good point
Me?
yeah it was the roots
if I remember correctly
not the part people bite tho
it's possible for the cattail to choke you
yeah, but generally, not a good idea
but I think cattails should be edible
that could kill someone actually-
sometimes the city will put stuff in the soil so the plant then becomes toxic
be careful about dandelions on the road tho
ye
ah, I see
mokvfd,l;tb4reds
I'm aware, I'm wondering how to get the stuff to buy the white crystals
KMONHUBNIJMKO
sometimes it's fun to laugh at your own oppression
I see what you mean
Fair point
like ever
I don't pay attention to celebrities
IS she homophobic?
Wait
MKPMONJVDKPLWDQVEF??
Like,,, get help
god, I'll never really understand ntr,,, cause pretty much all of the time it's just straight up cheating
the real karma for ntr
Otto attempted ntr and the love of his life died
NKJJNIJVNVRVR
50
but she's also like
my mom's poly so she like,,,, knows some good dating apps
I just want a gf pls-
This is why I'm *not* using tindr-
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
and I'm single and lonely-
I'm 19, I'm at the right age to mingle
I've actually been thinking about getting one
def can
Is for me
Unfortunately as a Lesbian I don't think that site or like app
BALD ON GRINDR VKOMKOPRVMPOVFEVRRE
I'll celebrate by being gayer then usual
Anyways, I want to grind for that
I believe
Bipolar crystals, they're called
With a fancy thing?
Or well I *do* but you like buy it
But I have no idea how I obtained it in the first place
Cause I know I've gotten a bit of it
How do you get the gach currency?
In pgr rn
There's the outfit gacha
Cool!
How many people here play Punishing Gray Ravens?
Then again,,,, around Holiday's works too
It's at like the tail end of her banner
Works!
Father's day!
When does Itto's banner start?
Uhhh, Flag day?
On
It's okay I'll totally just get her...
Anyways, tl;dr I am a loser and hopeless gamble addict
Considering breaking out the wallet but I don't think I can justify it
But now here I am
And then I also went for Mistsplitter thinking the same thing
And while I did save primos I was stupid and went for his weapon cause I thought that you know,,,, I wouldn't be able to get Yelan anymore and stiff
That was the number
87
Or wait
At 97 pity
He came home with the 50/50 but like
And so I didn't have the funds for her
Was a little bitch!!
And Ayato!!!
But like,,, I have a goal of collecting all hydro characters
I was going for him
I wish
Itto...
I got Ayato on April Fool's
But there's definitely a smaller holiday I could take advantage og
The next big Holiday for USA people is Fourth of July
Anyone know when the next holiday is?
That being said
I only get stuff on Holidays
Genshin is painful but I've also realized something strange about my genshin luck
oooo
which he's pretty much all black except his paws and a semi large patch of fur on his chest
but my cat is a tuxedo cat
we have 1 fully black cat
ahhh
but generally pretty easy not to step on em
actually that's just having black cats while having a black rug
oh my lord that's a lotta animals-
she was tiny
there was another cat who was 17 who's smaller that I met
and she's kitten sized
that's like 11 years old
but also I do have a very small cat
yeah true I can kinda see it now
lol
but the picture lacks any good thing to measure it against
usually I can tell due to size
to be honest
I couldn't tell that's a kitten
I'm sorry I just assumed the picture was the cat you were talking about-
ah
looks fine?
oh you found the cat?
but then I had to get rid of sea due to storage issues
I had a Sea side before
plus if your cat manages to make it outside of the garden Cats will fuck up the local bird population
and a leash+harness
It's just not really safe to let your cat outside without heavy supervision
plus flea's are a thing
any animal can bite your cat and give it rabies
I'm talking about other animals
surprised
you'd be
still, if your cats vaccines aren't up to date or your cats good at jumping and you leave them unsupervised
you don't
to start with you should not have an outdoor cat
yeah but then you pick up your cat and bring it inside
and will back off with minimal human interaction
feral/stray cats are really jumpy
without you throwing stuff at it
the cat will be scared off
Just use the brush end
although in the future tho
I doubt that cat will be too hurt
unless you saw a bad injury
my cat
source?
and they bash their head against stuff hard a lot
cats are tough
the most you did was bruise
still
thank you
you probably didn't hurt it too much
I believe
you'll get her
but also,,,
this is a joke
Anyone wanna whale on my account for me?
I just want falcon flare...
Oh no
I just want her weapon not all of the stigmata dupes
got bronya T
I just
I hate Honkai,,,, I've pulled for Silver wing's weapon multiple times now
I really want the profile icon
You'll get jt
Oof
rip
my memory is not the best
happens
I must've been mixing it with something else then
ahhh
I might've mixed that with something else
then again I could be wrong
also, I thought they were sending em out on the 1st?
that's a good point I suppose
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
but I know it anyways
Will I ever need to logically know this? no
I know the most weirdest and dumb shit
those are fun
Although if you really want a death coaster there are coasters designed to just straight up kill you
Rarer then the other rides which will kill you harder and more painfully
Rarely
While other rides are forgotten
Making sure it wont malfuction
So they maintenace it more
Since if a roller coaster fucks up it fucks up
I will admit this is most likely due to parks being more cautious about Roller coasters then other attractions
You're more likely to die on a ferris wheel then a roller coaster
And the other attractions at amusement parks tend to cause more injuries anywahs
Like you're less likely to die on a roller coaster then in a car
Tho?
Roller coasters are pretty safe?
It's been ages since I've been,,, on a roller coaster,,,
I'd love to
i wish I didn't please take me OUT
I wouldn't be able to handle Rednecks
I'm glad I don't live in a red state....
that is a keyboard smash
i would if I could
okmefokfr4vrecdw
I have the first one
who knows
and I use Phyllis a lot cause the only good team I have is Ice
but I have a bit of Phyllis's
Cause I don't have Carole's gears
think I'll go for phyllis once I'm done with ss'ing carole then
I wish I had,,, Carole's gear
I see I see
oki
right
I don't use my aesterite on frags,,,
I've been working on Carole but should I switch to like Phyllis or?
what's the best valk to sss/ss for sp valks?
Other then Black Nucleus and LE
Nyx was my first S rank battlesuit I think
Depends
I should probably buy the bp and get her yeah?
I have so much of her gear
DA....
I keep getting her stigs
I want her weapon so bad
SW....
Hello ☆
Lemme go do that
Ah I haven't finished everything in abyss
I'm also not in redlotus
Na
Lemme see if I will retain
*pats*
Proper sleep schedule? What's that?
I say as it's 3 pm
Morning
Also
I'm Citrine, uhhhh, yeah if you don't know me by name then we've probably never interacted.
I'll try to sleep
I think
Night night
Anyways
Eh
Granted maybe it's only that way for me cause I only write about what I like but
1000 words isnt that hard tho
*sighs*
Close discord
I should probably
On it
You know I am trying to sleep yeah?
What the fuck
I will not be able to sleep
Please don't put those images in my head
I dont like to think about it
I'm aware
Yeah
See what I can do to sleep
I'll uh
Anyways
I'm deathly afraid of spiders and even if I just see a glance of one online I get very very parsnoid
A huge fucking spider appearing over my head in my room
Yeah, guess I'll head soon, I would've went to bed earlier if it werent for uhh
*looks at the time* 6:33 am
It's
I need sleep
I thought the controls on the toilet were a wii remote for asecond
Then I'd go to bed
Unless you spam that word a whole bunch
I don't think so
No
I have a lot to learn...
And you dont-
In joke?
I'm sorry is that an
Or like,,, you like toliets yea
Then why not haunted houses or something like that?
Ohh
I'm not sure, I'd have to read the article and stuff again
Then on Black Holes?
Oh yeah hi!
Also the effect they'd have on a human body
Horrifying right?
Emitted something!
This one
Like most Black Holes consume right?
Did you know that recently scientists found a black hole that like spat something out?
Cause Black Holes are super interesting
I mean, I can think a lot on black holes and astronomy
Depends
Rip
If it's handwritten then
But
I mean I'd help
Jdjsjsjsjs
What course?
I'm probably the most pathetic outta all of us cause I dropped out of school due to the panic attacks school gave me
Listen
I tested well but I didn't do any homework lol
Not that
Cause my grades were solidly
In which case I'm terrified
I think this is their report card
Well
OH
I'm sure you'll do well!
Ye ye
I believe
You can do it
Probably better then mine, the person who dropped outta high school
Third times the charm!
It happened again
Damn it
Wait
Oh
Tell me everything about the beta
Ah, congrats!
The toxic radition is getting to you
And it goes wee woo wee woo
Or maybe your brain can't handle that kinda feeling
Or something
You might need water
You might be right
You okay?
I see
Living up to your name
Ah
It's fine if she's a lil insane
But I want a nice stable relationship
<:MonkaS:966624721925976094>
Anyways.
OWO DO I HAVE TO KILL YOU?
WHY IS THIS A BAD THIGN
HOLD ON WHY THE FROWN
WITH A FROWNY FACE???
owo 8ball Will *I* get a love life? Like a girlfriend
Nice!
Oh!
Ngl
That felt like signing a waiver
owo 8ball Will I lose it and kill someone?
Not the furry bot!
Idk, Carl seems like a nice fella
Carl?
Do tell
For murder?
It's fineeee
It's okay if I lose it I'll just like murder s9meone or something, let the steam out
I think
Then I should be a-ok
Right
Oh?
But man I'm afraid of the stuff I might see
I'm an adult so I can see the adult stuff
That seems like a common occurance!
I like your red role
Uhhh
Hello Art
Oh
Oh they are?
I will keep what left of my sanity I have
I will not look into the channels with the weird names
I'm noticing some things but then again I will respectfully look away
Probs cause that server is like a Genshin news server but mostly a Honkai server to me lol
But I never checked it until then
I had the server like one or patches after Hu Tao I think
I believe
5.2 Honkai
I only became active and used that server like
Oh yeah no
I lurked a lot
Oh yea
I talked in arc city
*have*
How much
I'm now curious
Actually
:')
Didnt even get a rejection letter
Reminds me of that thing I signed up for that I waited two months for a reply on
Again, cause I don't speak too often
I haven't been warned either
Well, I was not banned, probably cause I just lurk and only reply every now and then
Sad
So it's just life then
Ah
Roy,,, miss them
Were they taken by the ban too?
Wait I see Roy!
Aight
Hanging out in my room
Oh my cat and my moms cat are just
Like mods inheritently aren't sane
I don't think if you're a mod that you're sane
DID THEY JUST MUTE EACH OTHER?
I can respectfully keep the questions to myself
I'm mostly fine with questions
Well
I see I see
Will be careful
I uh
Oh some people have fancy colours
EYYY
Hi hi
I want him
YES
HIM
THAT
Screwlum?
Wake me up when we get Screllum (idr how to spell his name)
same
OH

so that my other teams can slack
i need her to be op for my kafka team
no more ruan mei nerfs pls
other then you guys being my friends i guess
this exchange is why i never leave this server
so the target spd is 129 or 134?
*nods*
There are time where they arent my absolute fav
cause like I do always like black hair and insane characters but like
This is why my favs are always insanely hard to predict
LOL
I also like gundam from the second game
he's so funny
I'm a Makoto liker a lot
It's Makoto Naegi from the first game and then Tsumugi
It
Maki is not a fav, sowwy
I'm not a Mahiru enjoyer that much tho
Not really
one more guess
lol no
lol
I do like him but not my fav
DANGANRONPA
YJJJRKKF
Wait wait guess my other faves from dr kei
That makes sense too
Ohhh
Kei, you seem like a Kirigiri fan or an Angie fan
Yes it is.
You're a Hannibal fan
Cherry.
It means you are severely mentally ill
I like Chiaki Nanami
You do give off the fancy hair vibe tho
No not really
Nono then Cata's the villainess
Thats good enough right?
Idk you give twin drill hair vibes
Lol
Tet's got so much skill :OOOO
Skill!!!
Omg tet's a multitasker?
Tf are you guys talking about
I lookedaway for a second
Yeyr
LOL
Youre wonderful
Rita got the good estrogen
You werent scary to me Keilo!
I'd say same but i actually dont know if you guys know a single thing about me in actual
He is transmasc tho
Listen, As a Dains lover he is not transphobic.
Yeah thats accurate
You see if I made a card now id put in my dni stuff like Dni if you have hands, dni if you have ever had eggnog
Heki thats why youve had bad luck and taste
No fortunately
BCJDJJXKXKDXKSKSKSS
If anyone dates me expect it all to blow up because I apparently only date people who use me/dont actually like me </3
NFNFNFNFMMFMFMFMFF
Ngl
Repost to scare Heki!!!
Damn
This is why we are superior
No
Well yeah tru and
She's neither blue or green
Also Miku is teal
Your boobs should not be green and
No
N
What ? :O
# AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAA
***Wheeze***
Okokok so Heki would have the same reaction to fucking playing a Quantum Dream game and seeing boobs irl
# WHEEZE
HEKI YOURE LEGIT SCARED OF BOOBS???
LOL
I have huge male tits and i didnt even try
What do you mean
OKAY
YES
I have an h cup
Do you want mine
Acrually keilo
Thats it
I know how to get rid of them
Heki, you dont even have big milkers to learn to hate them
Amazing
Then I'll attempt her
Dot teams...
I might consider trying for her
Who is she good for?
That is partially what I'm referring to yes
LOL
Oof
I also think hoyo has like a few different designs that they recycle
Lol what I'm saying is Hoyo isnt very clear
I had doubts about Raiden Ei before she came out
Ngl, with hoyo its hard to tell  who is an expy or not
Tru
But thats just the colors and her cold glare speakin
Lol
She looks more like Raiden then Ruan Mei
I think the second one is imitating phoenix wright?
I like him
I mean
I showed my sibling Ratio and they immediately went Screw pulling for anyone this patch, I want him
BFJJFKGKGKGG
It's called being a snake.
Then you just need two dicks
people from natlan short?
besides Elios being a guy is a surprise in itself for me
lemme have another twink pls
We've already had a bunch of tall men guys
SHE LITERALLY PULLS OUT SUNGLASSES FOR COMBAT IM FJDKDKDMDKDKDD
This feels Illegal in cool factors
Hey how cool can you legally make a character
damn thats rude
i still dont get it much but alright
i see
why we so mean to the kid
Why is that the first tjing i see when i check discord today
first hsr man with catholic rizz
he better not be a dps because WANT
What are they on.
This guy looks more like kaveh
Pretty
Dahlia is
Yeah...
Him and one of those designs probably could coexist
He's so much different to the other versions that theyre frankly not the same
I feel like its an amazing design and fits him but like the other designs I feel like shouldnt have been classified *as* him
I actually think genshin designers are afraid of fun
Teeth...
I am filled with desire.
what the fuck
wh
Bladeee
With the bow
The Guy
*aggressively takes out wallet*
I NEED HOM
LYNEY SO CUTE I NEED
:(
and klee...
looking at all of the different skin concepts for jean...
yeah...
OMG?
All genshin
Yes
Tbh, do you guys think they've added the buff men model type because of how much they were getting clowned on?
Now where are the buff women-
So finally, Genshin can have buff men
I thank them
who knows?
leaks
fucking
some massive
These are
LOL
# AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
That's the mood

NO
SIR
SIR
SIR
SIR
HE'S SO PRETTY
WHAT THE FUCK
*sobbing*
*cries*
DEATH AND DESTRUCTION
*lies down*
ig this one was made for thanksgiving
its the bowling pin animatiions again
Cmon
Guys,,,,
Guys
Thats a belly button piercing
,,,,
LOL
Yeah!! It depends on the food I think,,,
Depends on the food and horny levels I guess
Def not real
i think im learning to hate the internet more and more these days
you know
Why
is better
also the line lanuage? shape language?
like in terms of art style an aesthetic
ngl
I kinda like the sketch better
well
Hey what the fuck
What the fuck
Tru
There's a lot of stories of women becoming pregnant with knowing How because of men doing shit like this
I mean yeah,,,,
But yeah, this probably fake but if its real.... oof
Human brains looooove connecting things
Its probably just because most are white and well
Meh, it depends on the skin care products
Its self cleaning
You're not supposed to wash inside your vagina at all
Soap is a very bad and painful Lube How
It can survive outside but like,,,,, Probably not in soap
Sometimes blue
Almost all womens soaps I've come across are completely clear and or colored like purple, gold, or pink
The real question I have is what kind of bodywash is she using that hides semen perfectly-
Plus even if she doesnt mean to theres a chance that accidentally she could get the soap inside while cleaning because yeah
If the liquid just so happens to travel inside she might not notice if she's doing a thorough clean?
Think of it this way, she's washing her entire body
Its also liquid.
Not really?
I've heard some interesting horror stories
Semen can travel quite far
But near makes sense
She probably wasnt putting it up
Maybe I'll fill out a blank one
Oh kink jars
it makes a really loud sound
yeah, in the west theyre called rape alarms i think?
No.
What is wrong with you guys
this looks like itd hurt
WHY
the fuckj
what
oh
<:BarbaraPray_Ikazu401:771007037287039046>
Thoughts and prayers
Fen...
There would be blood if it was real
How would that be a real dick is it on the floor very dettached from anytuing
Nfjfjfjddkdk???
No
None of that has made any sense.
KJHbujkml;
I saw it
then
I was wondering why this is here
A
WHAT
I reiterate....
WHAT
i see...
Was she reading it or something-
Genuinely.
Behind this.
The context
What is
Why would that come up LOL
What game is that-
I forget how shamelessly sexual nikke is sometimes
This channel is a fucking wreck
LOL
Oh this is Horny horny
oh dear
but there's still some that seem very very very horny
tamer?
most seem to be
lol
there's a ton of different ones
Well they linked the place where this mod came from
apparently.
cause I'm a curious bitch I looked through the description and pinned comment, these mods are normal
not necessarily you lol
I meant the ones who made the mod and uploaded the video and who gave it a like
Y'all horny,
Flesh light rather then dildo....
Also
Shoto's just one step away from being a porn vtuber at this point
lkjnicomkervr
What
h
That's not what I thought I was going to see today
well
Hana....
FDKDKDKDKD
What even is the source of this manga? Is this a hentai?
Kfkdkfkeld
I
Well!
This is an Incel
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?
people are insane
I DO TOO IT WAS FUCKING HILARIOUS
The bottom most shelves look lonely tho, Hope they get more manga to fill that out
I find it funny that on the same bookcase is a bible and under that is a dildo
Lol
Right?
sowwy
Unless you were talking to someone else
I've seen it around
I know what you're talking about
That's not a Manga
So
if you look closely
There's no author credit or words or pictures
But also it's very very blank
Maybe...
?
A Bible
is the last book on that shelf, right most
Wait
That's
I dont understand futa
VALKS
Oh yeah yaoi thats my jam
LEMME SEE THT FULLY CAUSE WAS THAT FUCKOGN KAEYA??
FUCKIN
:horsecock:
Hold on
Discord just straight up lets these exist as long as it's a server for adults huh
These are so sexual i cant believe
I am just looking at all of these emotes emotes ngl
NFNDMFMFMDMDM thank you
Oh okay
Try pillar
You know, looking at these emotes i'm brought stunningly aware how het society is
Lol
Why sonic
So many of these are insanely nsfw
SPLATOON
SPLATOON
These are definitely
If you dont like it thats fine! But def try it once
LOL yeah yeah
And I am not good at explaining
But you'd need to read the full ruleset
Again, there is a lot *more* to it
Yeah!!!
Generally the important thing about it is that it's purpose is mpreg being used as a kink and for rough sex,,,,, There's More To It but its a horny type thing
Although some omegaverse play fast and loose with some of the rules
Open any jp omegaverse manga and they explain it pretty well
It started out from being furry culture anyways? Sorta
Its like
Yeah its not particularly cringe
Oh well uh I like it so
It was not fucking lying
It's furries *and* omegaverse yes
Case in point, a lot of omegaverse anthologies are separated out by story even if they're like oneshots
Keep them all together
Sometimes people dont like
Yeah!
You Might be able to find it there
If its bl
You know about my reading manga?
Hmm
Yeah
I can also be curious
Ngl I'm also not exactly into furry stuff but sometimes I'll read stuff like these because i'm curious or because the arts good enough
You're more likely to find the Juujin omegaverse interesting then
Kedamono bitch does have some plot,,,, I think? But
Which most of these stories do not
The Juujin omegaverse is kinda weird but it *does* have plot going for it
Kedamono Bitch I liked but that mightve just been the art
Okay so lemme point out the ones that I liked or at least remember liking
HM
Oh i've read some of thesw
I mean, ig bara does have titties this size but
idk man
I don't like to masturbate tbh, it really sucks <3 I think it's due to me having the wrong organs tho
PFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
apparently
nothing
Eli is probably just getting up to some crazy stuff alone
They liked my fic
Source? I gotta a comment from them
Reads every single fic in that fandom
I;ve actually written a fic for this fandom too, and that person also fucking
Lol
but yeah
i think
?
the others just have like,,,, 20 to 40 fics
this one of them
this is what I mean by there's like, 3 writers
nicee
I tend to just read everything that's okay, even if it's not something I ship because the 3 people who write fics are good writers
the same 3 people who write fics lol
I read a rather small fandom all things considered and it's like
*pats*
I've never read any genshin fics tho.....
but anyways, enjoy your smut, I'll be reading fics soon as well
I now no longer get eye strain so that's nice
And i color picked discords colors
i just custom made one because idk what i'm doing
you also make ao3 colors into discord colors?
ayaitto smut lol
Selfcest.... I think it's weird but not morally bad
Very true
Our Yatta is not a baby
I mean, She Really Doesn't look like a kid, doesn't exactly act like one, and she would hold the power in any relationship dynamic she's in
I mean Yea, I guess but She Also doesn't Act like that because she Isnt a literal baby who cant talk
To me
I mean,,,, She's kinda 18
Senti's not really all that young in the way she talks tho?
Heh
Checked my spam folder for the first time in awhile and there was a Viagra ad
I probably shouldn't be so curious but
What good stuff are we talking about?
Understandable
I see
Ohhh
Not a dead body
That's
well, idk necessarily about necro if it's drawn since
Oh, that's good!
there's a pixiv ban going on?
mjhubgyvhunjikjnhubgvyfbhunjim,lkomjinhubgy
lolol
He became a wizard
LPKIMONHUYK,OP
yeah
Right
Endings
Bad
They're all unquestionably
N- no
lol
for Togainu, what are good endings?
I will admit that that game also has some horrific endings but those are all bad endings
I wonder how it compares to DMMD
Slow Damage seems to be less fucked up then Togainu
yeah,,,,,
*screams*
And Graphically!
Literally
There's multiple endings where mc gets fucked to death
Everything
Well
I recommend it if you can stomach the
Togainu no Chi is vry fucked up btw
Not too weird
Cosplay seggs huh
***That fucking Screwdriver***
*I am burdened with the knowledge*
i see
ahhh
so you don't know about the screwdriver scene
Ohhhh
lolol
should've clarified there
not the characters
I'm talking about the games there
Oh no
i see i see
like, i know the answer between dmmd and togainu no chi but
oh he's got fetishes
between the 3 which is the most fucked up btw?
dmmd and togainu no chi
i'm curious about this games story, i'm familiar with the devs other games
the most depressed bitch
i c i c
he looks like he's majorly depressed
dang
isn't this bitch the protag
gl ig
Blue Archive?
What game is that anyways?
Just flirt a lil
Its probably a shrek backpack
That meme is a treasure lol
Nahida eats a lemon and dies...
I know you're pointing out the awful third video but
OINBIOMJUNHYo/?
maybe it's both
It's half and half, a switch I'd say with results like that
Lol, I'm just happy you are
I'm glad you enjoy
is this
oh and then there
i see
and Cinema?
would you like to see Rad Dogs Akito?
right then that's yeah
but on jp? that was more then a year ago
unless you played on en
,,,,More then a few months
Oh that's
Akito has gotten love within the last 3 to 4 4 stars
Valid
You might've missed this one too
the newest card
have you seen the new-ish Akito card?
Hella
proseka emote?
Cuteeee
i think
yes
yew
Found it
Am looking for it
I think I didnt grab the role
Do not lol
Oh do I have that channel unlocked...
Is there an actual nsfw art channel?
yup, rest in peace captain

School memories are distant now

kmrenviropefc

I'm like 19 tho but I haven't  been in a proper physical school in like
FELT
nyaruhodo

Understandable
klmfjnvrev3

I'm lonely FUCK
DAWW
my sibling is older
ahh
Being mean to Tai I see
I think that's you being a jokestar
lol
sweet dreams?
uh
oh
I mean, maybe one day you'll meet up
oki night night
it's not the same
I mean I could squeeze titties rn if I wanted to I understnad that
that's cute
maybe I'll have more motivation to look pretty
seriously tho i wanna hold girl
yea
you both read as the same age tho
yeah that makes sense
hmm
by like, a year or 2?
I am afraid of toys tbh
someone help me figure out dating apps at this point
Maidenless
I am
*crying in no pussy*
LOL GOOD LUCK
i see
oh you're what they call down bad huh
lol
the horny has taken over you
yeah
that's all i can say
good luck
LOL
this chat is a mess
WHAT
Now I can respond
What
W
This is not a well oiled machine
It's just the daily maintainance on my body that I struggle with
Even when it comes to taking care of myself
I can be reasonable on a lot of things tbb
I limit myself on those cause I'm aware they're super bad for the body
I don't think I've had one this month tho
Generally I only have them maybe like 2 to 3 times a month if that?
I don;'t drink them often
Nah, you shouldn't spend on stuff like that carelessly dumbass, right here
ugh
I went to the store today But I didn't buy it
Man, I'm cursing myself now cause I really do need that energy drink now
Sounds like a plan I suppose
go to bed early the day I wanna stay up all night to fix it?
So like
maybe I should've bought that bang...
we;ll see
whether its; forcing myself into another semi coma or using an energy drink to get me awake until a proper time to sleep...
Soon I'll need to do something drastic to fix my sleep schedule
I mean it's sorta fine for like a little bit but then it gets out of control like it is now
essentially if you put it that way
I want to stick to a schedule but My brain doesn't look at the time and think anything of it until it's real late
It's entirely my executive dysfunction, and I know that but like
most days
decide to sleep
the problem is that I don't have the cut off point to like
when I put my mind to it
I can fall asleep easy
you see
But seriously, I don't sleep at the right times
Also I'm asking this here cause General's overflooded with bot
and I wake up at 5 to 6 pm
7 to 9 am
But the times I pick to sleep are like
Like, I sleep for a good amount of time
Can someone tell me why I can't sleep at reasonable hours?
right right
another general for adults yeah?
this is like
there's a lot of songs in rhythm games where the song ends in a 413 combo and I'm the only one burdened with the knowledge that it's a funny number
Honestly felt
K JHGGBHJK
OH LOL
Well, it does get interesting later on
I can also recc some stuff but my taste is probably weird
That is Certainly a Suggestion Hakcer
Ah, makes sense
you really know how to load up a person
there's so many reccs to read man,,,
I GUESS I'LL READ IT!
WELL FUCK
Does it have my specific brand of Angst then?
READ WHAT
because I dislike bad endings
I really like Isekai's where the protag wants death and like,,, they go through that or stories about suicide but handled in a way that has a happy ending
Man, there's a very specific kind of angst I like and it's really like,,,, very personal
Angst...
LOL
granted, I don't find much enjoyment from things like dmmd and togainu no chi, but they are fascinating to think about and dissect
to read soon
just so you know Fen I'm pulling up all of these in a tab
I can read it but I don't always enjoy iy
High tolerance
honestly?
I can handle most things
Well
I uh
I mean
lol
WAIT UNTIL YOU HEAR ABOUT CLEAR AND KOJAKU'S BAD END
YEAH
Man
DMMD was fucked
In the bad ending with Minx I think he fucked Aoba's decapitated head
DMMD WAS REAL FUCKED HUH
OH YEAH
I don't think any of the frequent sex scenes happen in it
So much more tame
The anime was
My condolences
Togainu no Chi?
Not the drink
and dies
No, he gets fucked and stabbed with it
Hahaha
What do you think happens with that screwdriver?
Now tell me
And one thing you need to know is that one of the Bad Endings in that BL novel is called the Screwdriver ending
Just know that this is an anime adaption of a BL visual novel
Oh!
do you?
Do you recognize the name Fen?
Lemme send you something and see if you get it
Oh wait Fen
I casually listen to horror game soundtracks
then again if you haven't read Homestuck...
I read all of Homestuck, this should solidify my tastes as someone who likes darker fiction
it'll die soon
rip to netflix
I am into dark shit, I am sorry
HORROR
ME LOVE
HORROR?
God, this might be an unpopular opinion but I hate harems with a burning passion
and there are some uncomfortable bits but those are generally skippable
But that's like a very long read
A wholesome BL, I would recommend TGCF
Anyways
cause then we know and it feels like not bad
I'm mostly fine with dubcon as long as it's the protags prospective
yeah
Funnily enough Chinese novels and webtoons generally are wholesome or focus on an actual plot that happens to have gay romance
Most of the novels written by MXTX don't have sex within the work
I'm actually rereading it rn
Yeah yeah
The Eroge one?
yuuuuu[
most things written about lesbians aren't being made for the lesbians
And they're especially not being made for Lesbians
None of that is really being made
I would love to read more lesbian shit but like
Understandable I suppose
That's all I can think
Why isn;t she with a women?
It's like,,, ugh
Also, I hate watching or reading like normal straight sex
It's honestly just not fulfilling, I need gay shit
Not anymore?
that says a lot about me
Honestly, I read it too despite not being into guys
Now that you mention it
That's a good question
you're safe to get railed in the future whenever you want
Well then
Oh
in a Straight relationship
You can still be the bottom
If you're straight you can still get railed by women my friend (cause I think you've mentioned being a guy)
I'm pretty sure I'm a top if it comes to personality and stuff
yeah
Considering I've never had any girlfriends
I am too
you're definitely a virgin
ngl
I'm probably a top
indeed
yes
putting anything that burns the tongue near those areas sounds painful
you should mainly avoid stds
Well, if you're practicing safe sex and you're like,,, aware
YEAH
LOL
make sure to wash them properly tho
Just find ones on Amazon
Exactly
honestly, probably unfulfilling
I'm feeling conflicting feelings
this is the first time that phrase has been used for me
also correct
It bothers me
But they can
And I'm just like
It's interesting cause I've seen people comment on how boobs can't do that in like comments of hentai and stuff
Fun fact, tho, cause this is the horny channel and you mentioned armpit licking but I'm one of the few people that can bring my own boob up to my mouth
lol
No
I know fisting is a thing but my god
GOD THAT DOES NOT SOUND PLEASANT
Anyways, I get licking your armpits cause horny tho, if you have an armpit fetish and your armpits aren't really gross
people...
?
Really
I think dildos are dildos
probably smaller ones
Cactus and Watermelon are more like natures dildos
it's really not
No
It's really not
Oof
As long as you have the transparent version of it
I wouldn't mind colouring it tbh
You commissioned this?
Well, I took of the wig at some point cause I was sweaty
I wore this one for a long time and it didn't feel bad
It's a comfortable cosplay too
AHHHH THANKS
That's one pic!
Well
I hadn't styled the bangs yet cause I got the wig so close to the con
I am
I love the characters despite how 2 dimensional they are
Also,,,, does,,, anyone wanna see my cosplay? If not that's fine (yes I cosplay danganronpa cause despite everything, I still like that game)
Just send in dms
Long hair, nice
You look real kind
Nooooo
I have a picture of my Chiaki cosplay, if anyone wants to see it,,, btw,,, I saw it when I grabbed my picture of myself
Lol
That's a good point
Pink in general is my fav colour, that and light pastel blue
I love strawberry things
It's a full on dress
2 months
This is the only picture I have of myself in like
You can see me squinting cause the sun is an absolute bitch
Ig I dont mind showing it
I took a selfy while I was at the beach
Oooo, neat
It's best if youre already wearing a bra
Yeah, you do actually
To the point that, if my chest was smaller I could probably find more things in stores
My chest is astronomically huge
Like, my boobs are 52 inches I think,,, might be more, clothes in general are hard to find that fit that
Valid
My boobs tend to be the problem
Alice does have a good fashion sense
Although my size makes it so I can't really find anything much
I really like these kinds of cute things
I have this
I mean, I have cute clothes,
Good point
Yeah,,,,
I don't really like how I look so I don't take pictures of myself often
Any tips on how to take cute pictures of oneself?
THAT'S CERTAINLY *SOMETHING*
I MEAN
WELL
OKMIJNVHMOERK,DVCDE
in dating apps
I just hope I can find someone who matches my interests
I mean, I could try either
Keilo is a nice person
and being lesbian is wonderful
That's cause women are sofrt and great
*sighs* I need to take better pictures of myself
What being maidenless does to a mf
I mean, If anyone wants to try anything with me, I'm lonely as long as you identify as female/female adjacent I'm willing to try <:cryge:966624721611403294>
Eldritch gods are wonderful
yes...
true
I mean, we are friends right?
I am not ready but it's fineeeee
okay
There's no good places for looking for romance just kill me
hahaha....
tinder these days are only used for hookups right?
but I know a lot of other sites are garbage
I have a source on that
from what I know Okcupid is okay for romance
I see....
looking to fuck?
All horny people?
Is it
good point
,,,
Like
is it?
how bad
Out of curiosity
but
Yeah, Grindr is for gay men tho so thankfully I'll never experience it
Ha Ha
haha
,,,I've downloaded okcupid but I haven't made a profile yet,,, on a scale from 1 to 10 how scary is online dating
lol
HE'S OLD
IDC HIS ACTUAL AGE
THIS MAN IS OLD
the kinda clothing you'd see middle aged men wear
bod
dad bos
And the haircut
No, it's the moustache
he's either going to age like milk or fine wine
my guess?
21 and he looks like a father
y'all are funny
cuddles are great
Perhaps I'm just a sleepy and lazy bitch
Although I could cuddle most of my favs
I don't often feel horny in the true sense of the word then
I usually just simp then
LOL
valid
Honestly, I rarely do that for irl people, I've sorta danced with the idea that I might be on the ace spectrum but it's hard for me to tell
Nyaruhodo
or just like,,,
Would that be considered horny?
I'll have mental breakdowns over how pretty certain characters are tho
I think I'm semi similar
*nods*
valid and understandable
I'm super lazy
*nods* most days I wanna take a nap
I'm not exactly pure but I'm not really horny most days either
lol
hi Keilo
yeah
Taihen's always horni
good point
so much more quiet in here
lol
lol
at least with some people
you guys do forget tho
It'll probably be forgotten in 4 days
rest in peace Fen
but I do think you're right that he's at least from starfox
why the fuck would his name be Starfox
it's a Wolf
I mean
It's the Fox
*nods*
sky

Sakura theming is also something that aligns with the season
Because of the season
Like, I mean rn a perfect theme would be easter
We should have a theme
Also, suggestion for next Art trade
hehe
so they don't get lost
can you pin all of the individual pieces btw?
Beautiful btw
Enana?
That's so cool
DANG
LOVE
GORFOSS
FKKFOEOROEODOFKDKEKEMD DNDKKE
the shading looks pretty close!
Maybe the design is missing some sci-fi elements?
Hmmm
No idea
Why this expression?
Attachment to the letter C
My general state of being, cringe fail guy
also
yea
I'd like a name with logic or knowledge as one of the kanjis
Cause that's just a thing I've always done for myself
I mean, I should always have C as the first letter of at least one of the names
What should I name my guy
I should maybe come up with a name for my oc
I like that!
Which could be deciphered as small sleeps (Naps)
It would seem
small night
lemme search!
Ig I'll color
THAT WAS WHAT'S MISSING
OH I KNOW WHAT I'M MISSING
Did a quick sketch,,,,
In other news
I am as well
Cash Money
Like
Kane
My first thought of an nickname was
Might as well include that too
Since y'all liked the mushroom choker I wore irl
I will continue then
mmmm
,,,,My sona is ending up looking more ominous looking then intended-
Maybe ask her if there's a way to make it legible?
dang
Suya Suya
I think I'll give him same hair style too
Oho
SINCE, I have red hair irl should I give my ocsona red hair too
I need to come up with the design on mine before I name mine
Hmmm, then Fuwase Amane should probably still work but Fuwase's kanji probably needs to be changed?
Yea yea
Oho
I LOVE IT
*that's such a cute name what the fuck*
OHO
We gotta have Ne in there
Hmmm
EITHER WAY NAMING
Now I've been making picrews of myself for awhile now but maybe I should try some different styles?
OMG SO CUTE
with a semi long first
We can give her a full name?
MAYBE
then we can draw them playing prsk together
I should rework my self oc
Ohhh true
Fluffy sleep
Nono, It makes sense cause Fuwa means fluffy
That's such a cute name
Fuwane!
OOOO
that's not Nene-
I think I could find a Sleep Sleep kanji name
LOL
My first suggestion!
Fuwa
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
SO CUTE
I LOVE
OOOO
YE
:O
OOO
:O
I'm a mess
idk
I wanna draw cool shit like that....
yes yes
What dahell!!! Your art so pretty
DANG
we could probably get someone who doesn't draw to do the distributing?
that's how it works
yea yea
YES
LUKA!
In hell
It's soooo cute
NICE
CUTEEE
Ye
OOo
In order, Welcome to Demon School Iruma-kun, Persona 5, Bandori, Dragon Quest, Sailor Moon Crystal, Proseka
aka, that one looks finished
i think the sketched looks slightly better but that's only because it's more cohesive
I think i'd be able to tell if your current one was finished
PRETTY
Aster!!! Art!!!
I legit dont think my art is all that good
Listen,,,
NDMRMFKD
THE GODS WORK
I mean!!! It could be better!! And that's honestly the best thing I've drawn
NFJSJRJRJD
But
It's okay
I mean
My art isnt *that* good
Ehhh?
Shush
Tet, your art is the art of gods
Jealous
Your art is so pretty
Dang
<:fishwow:963697747473604638>
WHOA
Excluding my friends styles-
This is what I have so far, including two friends eye styles!
lol
Old school then
I see I see
Ohhhh
Idk if this is considered Old School
This Bandori!
I did it uhm
tis from anime and game respectively here, currently trying out bandori's style, wish me fucking luck
studying other art styles eyes
OOoooo
I think it looks fine!
You trace over those parts /lightlt trace over them to get a feel and redo them yourself
You could always not post the traced version
*sighs*
Tho
Yea.... maybe I am just bad at art thi
Yea yea
I always do that as well
Yeah, absolutely
And cant tell the difference
Bad at art tho
,,,,maybe I'm just
It wasnt a curve tho, I do think the knuckles were kinda sharp it looked similar to my hands
Yeah, like I said it's the wrist that's the issue
I think mostly cause it should be wraped around the mic
You probably wouldnt be able to see that
There is also def a random line
No I think the fingers Are fine?
It's the wrist
It Does but I dont think it's the fingers
Yeah, that's a good idea
This is what I mean
It just doesnt look like it's connected like uhm
The obeject itself is a bit misaligned but the hand is good
I think so?
she's a dragon
Drew a lil sketch
OMGGGGG
I tried my best
THANKS
Forgot to post this here too!
I LOVE
THEM
I'll have to look at it again but you're right
Oh yeah, I did fix that I think
yes
hrmmmm
help ;;
tbh both legs
the bent one
Something looks wrong with this leg
Me?
open or closed....
*taps foot* eyes....
there's some clear improvements I'm going to need to make but meh
The one genshin character you can say that about
As long as I don't have to draw the hat I might be fine, his details aren't too difficult
you think :O
Might minus some space from the canvas so raidens hands aren't so far up
I need to get better at them tho so
Hands,,,, suck
hard,,,
Art,,,,
KANADEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
ITS PRETTY
LUKAAAAA
oooo
GOOD JOB ASTER
SO CUTE
ye ye
God I love your coloring tho
She looks 20 to me
She doesn't look too baby
Perhaps
?
Longer faces
OOOO
yiss
I am also redrawing, at aster's recommendation
she's looking amazing in your style
I love this Kanade,,
Are you doing a redraw :O
KANADE
Do cute
Aster i love your art
They did the lining and I colored
<@964806731471405086> We did an art collab uwu
I looks so nice tho
lemme see it, maybe i could help?
noooo
Now to get ready for bed
ye uwu
I have some prior editing experience
So, yes
THE COLORS SO BAD
GOD THE MORE I LOOK AT THE OG THE MORE IT BOTHERS ME
I hated the palette so i made an icon and changed it to blue and silver
originally red, gold, and black
is another color palette swap
and lemme show for the last one
I didn't do much with hof but give her red eyes, my sib requested it for their halloween icon last year
OH I MISSED AN EDIT
if I were to do edits again I think I'd do a better job
I've improved a lot since then
which was done 2 years ago!
of course I didn't exactly match the style and I think it's not the best of quality but I'm still quite proud of that edit
can't find the og for the first but
for example, the first ones hair is what I redrew, the second ones outfit and cat ears and tail, and the last two I added fangs
mostly do color shifting but the first ones have redrawing things
these are me edits
ye
God damnit, I can only find my enstars ones
which are old cause I haven't done an edit in AGES
lemme see if I can find one of my card edits from love live
so valid
oho, vry neat
I've done a few
Have you see card edits before?
unsure how Good I'll do but it'll give me a better idea of coloring
So, I could def edit this for you tomorrow if you want?
And yeah
Bayonetta!
It doesn't steal specific art work unless you're using a direct ref yeah
indeed
it's weird
look closer at the Rendering
nah, it's just the same color as the water
it steals mostly a style
it is mostly
easy fixes, all things considered
the other eye doesn't have any light in it too lol
there's a line that it added that it didn't need
I do have experience editing things
tomorrow
not rn but maybe tomorro
Try
I can
so valid
she's pretty tho
Exact opposite of the request lol
YEAH LOL
but the face is oddly perfect, usually that's where ai messes up rather then  her fucked up back and pose
and posing
Not sure about composition
IT UNDERSTANDS LIGHTING BETTER THEN I DO, BAD BAD
but also
it didn't completely follow the words lol
damn,
this is an ai?
So pretty
Oooo
I'm not the Best at drawing heads but maybe try practicing with the symmetry tool?
Np!
that's.... really the only thing aster's art has an issue with me thinks
def
you have great shape language, I can very clearly tell what's what
proportions for your characters are pretty great most of the time
you want a lil constructive criticism ye? you heads look like you've tilted them at a slightly odd angle, everything else looks very good
HU TAO SO PRETTY
it's a very good anime, actually
it's an anime!
I see
How to color blood like that
my art never looks nice to me
is the thing
I like drawing things that look nice
Idk how to do the stuff that makes colors look good and how to draw cleaner lines and how to draw complex stuff and have it look nice
I just have a lot of self esteem issues but also I a lot of issues with figuring out how to draw well
thanks
*sighs* I'm just never going to draw pretty
true but I'm not sure if they'll work, It's not like I haven't watched tutorials
maybe :o
I just feel like I'm bad at drawing and Idk how to fix it
nah the issue is is that they always look bad to me
I'm just mediocre at drawing them and everything else
i wish my eyes were more detailed tbh
Lol
I have trouble drawing mouths <:rozano:963353554532319252>
like that?
I just drew one and copy paste
There be eyes
like draw actual eyes or just two circles again
Idk if I can do that
Circle drawn
Tet teach me how to draw
JESUS CHRIST TET YOU'RE A GOD
i wonder...
*AND YOU NEVER TOLD US?????*
WHAT THE FUCK TET YOU'RE A GOD?
You can't have a Danganronpa game without death!
Or well
She was fated to die
Killing game
Poor thing indeed
<@964806731471405086>
She is ded
Tw for Danganronpa Blood
thanks uwu
thanks!
This is meant to be a genshin OC apparently that I made like,,, forever ago
I guess I'll touch this up and color it
Never colored it??
and I just???
I had a fully drawn lineart drawing?
*????????*
*finds this*
*scrolls through my art folder*
NICE
ah, i mean I have a few but i rarely drew them myself, i only have picrews
dead ocs?
I have my dnd oc
I mean, I do have my genshin oc
More ocs...
OMG SO PRETTY
I'll send the links in the dms
You may also spectate the rp if wanted
Actually, would you two like to join a proseka server in general?
An lives
Aside from An
Wait
They are all dying
....I'm afraid to tell you
I cannot for the life of me figure out how to dress Ena
I am working on all of them but Nene is finished, Kohane is going to be finished too, Honami has some of the basics and
uwu
I have Honami, Ena, Nene, Kohane
I'm one of two people with 4 characters cause of uneven participants
And so will Ena (another character I have)
Dw tho! Nene will be fine
I'm sorry to tell you this but Kohane is the victim for ch2
She uh
Yea
IT WOULD'VE BEEN BUT MOD TEAM ISNT ALLOWED TO BE MM
Indeed
I'm in charge of cases
I actually do not know!
So, essentially, We role play Proseka characters, and we put them through the Danganronpa killing game
This is for a danganronpa proseka rp
There's lil sketches there
So uh
<@964806731471405086>
NICE
if the design was different white might've worked but literally cannot do white
I realized that the white would not work as she got a hamster on her hoodie
btw
Here's white, bt
actually, I'll stream this
white looks fine too
pure white would blend into the background tho, as the background will be pure white due to uniformity with other drawings for the server
hmmm
also thank,
Like this yea?
Yea yea
yeah, I think that makes sense
cause the hamster on her hoodie will also have a colour...
Dark grey, almost black yea?
OOooo
also, I def feel the need to edit the eye's a little but
also, for the record, this is a low effort drawing for a rp server I'm in,,,
What colour do I make hoodie
alright, people are active here uhhh
MIZUKKKI
Nfnkdmdkd
MIZUKII
OOOO
SaKIIIIIIIIII
Also nice icon
ENA
NICE
She looks like an Aki-something
How about no?
that's so cool
I am now hungry
WHOA
Felt
Not rn cause I need to sleep but soon
I'd play
DAMN
THAT LOOKS REALLY COOL?
WOW
Eden looks great
Thanks!
Gonna have to give this design a few edits
this oc was supposed to be from Inazuma but whoops, I drew this before I knew what inazuma was like lol
I drew this before inazuma came out
This is older then the art I posted up there
post my genshin oc here
I just realized, I could indeed
My art? Thank you ♡
I'm glad she's recognizable as miku tho
So once I'm comfortable I can do funky things with it
But having consistency for me means I can practice on getting good at something and then diverge and meld it
I've managed to keep my art mostly consistent but I also understand it's fine to have a semi fluid style
They are
YEAH
Specifically Snow Miku
She is Miku!
It's also around this time I finally figured out how I wanted to do my eyes
I'm really proud of the top one cause the hair was a bitch
Yea?
Although the bottom one is like,,  more of a sketch
Some of my recentish finished pieces
I LOVE!
you've definitely improved!
i'll post my new haircut/style in my channel uwu
anyone else wanna judge it?
Oh okay so you just dont like me.
8ball do you like my new haircut?
it didnt need to be that real with me
yayyyyyyyyyyyyy
,,,,
8ball will my teeth stop hurting
so cute wtf
OMG
also thats not surprising
but like yeah
i think it can work out, my mom's poly and has two committed relationships rn and has been committed for 4 or 5 years now with both
LOL
i tried it once and it gave me some extreme trauma
I could never been in an open relationship or be with a poly person
Still doesnt mean I understand it
Youre valid
I dont understand Elon fans
Ngl
I have considered playing gta so I can shoot cops
And well
Pretty sure I came out in January
But like
RIGHT??
I can't
It doesnt fucking feel like it
It's almost been a year since I've come out as trans
I dont have concept of time
I forgot it was fucking december
I was like Oh no, that's a long time
Ngl, you had me in thr first half
Oh I felt thar
Maybe they should get brain cancer so they can have more!
I think that person lost braincells
YEAH!!!
Carv comes in with Pizza and then witnesses everything on fire
That's Carv
That one meme where the guy walks in and everything is on fire
I feel like Carv is constantly getting like
That's somehow always true
You're fine Carv dwdw we always love to see you
Hello Carv!! You should take a shower when you get home and drink hot chocolate or like warm tea
At this Point I'm taking whatever I can fucking get
# FUCK
# FUCK I'VE WANTED TOP SURGERY FOR THAT LONG??
***This happened fucking 9 days after my birthday how the fuck did I miss this***

JFJFJKFKFFKDKDMD
NGL
ALMOST

Context
Ask for fucking
I'm sorry, I'm going to put aside the dysphoria thoughts for a second and I would like to
Fucking What Tet
Fucking What Eli
I'm trying to not let my dysphoria keep me up at night and tank my ability to do fucking anything but its not working </3
Good luck Tet
This is why I quit playing
lol
whenever i play viddy games thats me
thats me
i could claim to understand it but i also have not fucking clue what she's actually on about
yeah thats the aro flag
just ignore them at school too
byebye
so just go
at this point they;re not respecting your wishes and comfort level
i'd say just block them
(x) doubt
I should play gta5 so I can shoot police officers
many wow
many treasure
good luck keilo
ya know?
I would love to see more of that world.
Still
true but like
there's something about that world thats very interesting and unique
i kinda wouldn't mind a full on series exploring a singular protag to fully explore that world
oh yeah wizdom's a good one
all of my fav oneshots are uh
thats the way the world works
sometimes it makes me sad cause i would've loved to see more but alas
indeedddd
yeah yeah
There was a bit I thought it was weird too
Ohhhh
granted, not every oneshot is product of a series not taking off but a lot of them are
you ever wondered why there's a lot of oneshots and webtoon promos?
and even then sometimes things dont get made cause it lacks audience
tbf if you work for a company for these things they do actually have tests and they do quality check before release
tru tru
so it allows a more fluid schedule
and sometimes you dont need to work weekly/you can take breaks and then catch up next week
thats what i was thinking
much worry
without like
so i'd have a backlog that makes it easy to post weekly
i think i'd draw long in advance
idk if i'd post weekly
i want to do something like that but
oh yeah absolutely
sometimes authors fumble around with the beginning of the story while they try to figure out what they're actually doing
tru tru
ahhh
ll?
ik theres some authors that post yearly
LOL
thats the nature of serialized fiction!
where you need more to parse it all
there are sleeper series like that after all
maybe you need more to get what it's trying to do
i'd say try sticking with it for niw
yeah,,,
sometimes when that doesnt exist i just sorta go oh well if i really cant understand
usually whenever that happens i turn to others and online talks
ngl thats happened to me a few times
*nods*
but which manga has you feeling that
yes
I hate that whenever i mean to type lol sometimes i get that weird face? emoticon? instead due to the closeness on the keyboard
LOL*
;P;
He's neuv's boyfriend.
ik the reason he gave hydro potions is because of fontaine but like
you will be missed
Rip Gresham...
oh wtf
Okiii

I'll have to. Look.
Hmmmm
Oh

*nods*
Oops!
Oh

,,,,
*pats*
Same except I not for the same reasons i think but somewhat for the same reasons
looks nice
Her profile icon, the side profile one
Down bad
Never
It would good to not have to deal with them
I just call my internalized transphobic intrusive thoughts jk rowling so shes not really in there but
Very true!
She sucks and I hate that I must fight with her with my own internalized transphobia so often, It's been less frequently lately but every now and then she steals my brain
The JK Rowling in my head is so annoying ngl
Having Worth is going to need some proper training into my brain
I only just recently managed to stop misgendering myself in my head and started fully seeing myself as male in the mirror
<---- Brain so broken that he doesnt apply his basic rules of respect that he has for others onto himself
Idk about mine tho
Yasss
And your ability to draw tits!
We love you!
You have worth just by being here!
Yea!!
/j
Thankfully, my parents never had an expectations from the start!
Yeah
Oof
It's more like that because things came more easily too you you couldnt develop the skills to study and focus, causing you to not be able to keep up with the classes
I was too and I've been diagnosed with adhd since I was 6!!
Like Not even Slightly
A thing that gets in the way of adhd
That is not even REMOTELY
That
I diagnosed Lyri with autism
You can count on me when it comes to diagnosing btw
Yeah that is being clocked
(Like me, I am surprised you havent been professionally dxed with adhd)
If it Helps you can just have one of your mentally ill friends who has the condition to help diagnose you
I mean, you can absolutely self dia
OW
well, at least have a lot of issues, if not just die
If you stab someone in the vein and inject air in the vein then you Will have a heart attack and die
they've never had problems finding my veins really
I have meaty arms but like
i have no idea why my body reacted like that
it wasnt my first time either
valid
so dont do that
Listen, I say dont throw up cause last time i had my blood drawn i threw up and then fainted
LOL
good luck, dont throw up when they draw blood
What for
WOOOOOOOO
Alongside my acid issues, and my teeth having had a lot of cavaties, and then theres my sense of taste being completely fucked.up
I am going to have braced and I also need to schedule my fuckinh tonsil removal
,,,,,I feel like the king of mouth problems ngl
But that might've been because I took proper care of myself
The pain wasnt *that* bad iirc
Might even wanna do ibuprofen or tylenol alongside your prescribed pain meds (if you got prescribed them like I think I did)
You'll need it
Also make sure to set alarms and scheduling for your pain meds
As long as theres nothing in particular you have to chew
Soup thats enjoyed cold also
But yeah, jello, meal replacement shakes are the way to go
*pats* I had all 4 removed
Or perhaps youre getting them removed soon?
Is the reason youre asking cause you had yours removed too?
Me when i have to climb 3 flights of stairs
Yeah yeah essentially!
Jello and slimfast or like nutrient shakes
In my general experience anyways
Heart palpitation is when you can feel your heart beating
I'd like to think that the real guy himself would find that dream funny
thats actually a hilarious dream ngl
I'm sorry I look away for a second the first thing I read is this
aqua's one of the exceptions cause i feel he's annoying enough for it
i only clown occasionally tho
gossiping can be fun
so i quit lol~
it's skill issue at it's finest lvl and i didnt feel like i could nor wanted to improve
ngl the main reason i stopped playing *was* the shill but also the fact that I,,, just dont rlly have the talent for honkai
i do feel this person but maybe like you are just burned out and also kinda suck at the game
lol
LOL
that was fun
night night cherry
LOL
yes

Me explaining the Mario franchise
My landlord at the end of the month
i wanna try
whats the full screenshot
LOL
also he looks malnourished-
so other men can hold him?
Why is his waist like that
lol
But yeah those are my thoughts on it
But if you have the need to hide it from a partner then I'd say you just might be in an abusive relationship if you truly fear that persons reaction? you know?
I do understand needing to hide it from family members and other people that you aren't familiar with
Of course this is merely my perspective
It's majorly unhealthy for yourself to pursue relationships like that
Rather then it being unfair on the other persons end (which it kinda is but thats a different conversation i feel)
Again, I feel like it's more of a problem that you feel like you can't Tell that person
Yeah
that's your business
hell no
Like, you dont need to tell everyone
true but if you're withholding it to someone you're in a relationship with,,, that's just a way to develop worse trust issues !
i do understand but that seems a bit unhealthy
I don't think it's worth being in a relationship where you feel like you have to hide a huge part of yourself for
But I also feel like if you're pursuing a relationship with someone then you should want to know as much as possible about them and you'd want to be as open as possible
Granted, I have barely even started on most of what I want to do with my transition so It's def very important
Same, plus it's like,,, important to me that you respect my identity
Yea
i would
i mean i sorta tell everyone/make it obvious but like
yeah
dawww
My god?
but i got him
c0 and no weapon because i am cheap
i got wrio too
WAIT HE ACTUALLY GOT BANNED???

actually it might more commonly be 7th
sometimes? i think it's 7th
its like a bigger campus and grades 6th-12th exist
it is that but some people go to a school that combines middle and high school
<3
all of the time
gay sex indeed.
Oh they have sex alright.
they are cute
cheers all around ig
i mean the protag who og killed the villain he is inhabiting ends up as his husband so like
interesting stuff!
Otherwise he literally fucking dies </3
He can't choose to murder to the protag, nor can he just fucking run away
Literally actually
No killing him also kills himself
good stuff!
which in turn causes the protag to fall in love with him
he has to save himself from being murdered by the protaf
self saving.
Scum Villain's Self Saving System just has a novel but it's short compared to the other two
there's also Heaven Official's Blessing
Mo Dao Zu Shi
thats right. those gay chinese novels i wont shut up abou.
you know what else is a decent read?
they do
yea
well.
god thats so messy
from what i know about either
no?
other then that uhhh
they have similar visual senses
i think the only similarity is aesthetic
LOL
*screams*
its still toxic but like its not whatever the absolute fuck that is
or like romance written by women
this is why i'm bisexual and read mostly gay stuff
makes me side eye male isekai authors
gotta love the troupe of a modern man finding slavery okay and immediately doing it when its legal
In fact, I am going to make multiple
I am going to make an isekai webtoon without Elves
games and animation tends to take too much attention
the artform i like the most is comics and novels
*pats keilo*
is it an elf
or visual novels
the only time i've seen series do well at making a believable game is literally when they're mimicing dating sims
be game.
actually.
game flavor really needs to like.
yeahhh
yeaa
like, I can get that not being something you want to think hard on
just kinda funny
bad
ease of story writing, that one isn'
prob not, the currency thing is most certainly for just like
good question
it's also more akin to streaming oops
game
Orv is a good example of being in a game but like thats a very weird
i think
for ease
there's some that sort of are fine, like solo lvling is fine
The way to right an op thing like that is literally to make the top tier guild
made for games
a series
Fairy Tail is better rep of a good example of a top ranking for video games and like thats not even
usually it's a guild thats on top
but rpg's are made for parties and most mmorpgs are made for fucking RAIDS
you can do that one alone
if they're a rhythm game player
the only way a solo lvler and solo person can be good at a multiplayer game like that is
former
?? like he stopping lvl grinding to pvp or he went to pvp
even if youre speed running
even for skilled players
it takes more time then that
That
to lvl cap??
12 hours???
like
that is not how lvling works
that
i wonder how it's doing
its been fucking ages since i last played wow and played it seriously
lol
it's not honkai if theres no malding
RIGHT muscle memory, I forgor that's not categorized in with reflexes
thats fucking hilarious
like, yea reflexes are important but like how about resource gathering and that fucking side quest
yeahhh
actually someone should watch and force me to fully start on making that animatic at some point because i can let my gays down
tru
kirito is not smart and also you could argue his trauma just makes him sink in further
welll, i am also going to make an animatic buyt thats aside the point
spin them around in microwave fashion
i will say that like my current tastes are like,,,, gay novels and my own fun for them is to just like think about the characters in my head
I mea, yea
LOL
sao in particular i like making my own fun tho
tbh i'm not the guy who enjoys having 50 mil different hcs either for most series
yeah lol
i mean it does feel like it's wrapping up
oh dang really?
view on the characters and my overall like towards them and the story
i will say that theres a chance the parody series has effected my general like
it's a mix of both actually!
to me they are refreshing in how kinda bland they are
well, that is because sao has mostly cardboard cutouts, i just think that these cardboard cutouts are kinda fun
no
The characters for the most part? i'm a big character guy
LOL
yes
i have good taste, i do like sao tho so it's not impeccable
i mean yeah
..,..comparing it to the other one i was obsessed with and cannot look out anymore without feeling shame
ik it's still a meme but like,,, homestucks one of the better ones to have liked
i'm glad one of my first fandoms/medias i fixated on was homestuck because like
I just hold so many feelings
Nvm thats correct
this is keilo's channel, if we wanna talk about home- OH
rudge
literally anything and everyhing
which the internet is
homestuck is special in that it's tone that it picked was everything! or rather the internet itself
well a lot of series tend to pick a specific tone for their stuff
I, myself, only really know stuff through grapevines
Which is completely valid
no no you're good
Doctor Who's most fandom favorite seasons are also the worst seasons of Doctor Who
Pop culture classics
By classics I mean like,,, Star Wars, Doctor Who
Lumi, I appreciate you, what the fuck are you talking about
I think I can say it's good because what Classic isn't like that?
I do
yes!
however, i think we both can agree homestuck is like going to an amusement park. it's a roller coaster and sometimes you see clowns
so that's probably why i'd not use those words to describe homestuck generally myself
Valid, to me a story is fundementally about it's characters
Okay Now I'm getting it
right
But there's a bunch of different music genres in that song that makes it feel like it's multi
You couldn't really separate the song out
Bohemian Rhasphody
In the same flavor as say
You could say that Homestuck is a series with a bunch of differing genres tho
It's still the same song
There's a bunch of songs who do that
It might be a differing perspective here but just cause it changes how it's telling you its story doesnt mean it's not cut from the same cloth
I wouldn't really call that being a separate story,,,
Oh you mean it's a multimedia kinda piece
Hold on, I'm lost because you can do that with any story?
No I do understand I think?
night night
I would not say it's a bunch of different stories rolled into one because that's just not honest
Homestuck does have different chapters, obv and different motions through it's story but like
LOL
You can't just tell someone to start reading homestuck when the trolls are introduced like you can tell someone that you can skip to season 3 of Jojo
It's not like any chapter in particular can stand out on it's own
imho
I'd list it as one long story?
Hmmm
Don Flamingo?
there's not a whole lot that drags
always a fun ride imho
yeah, homestuck isn't exactly consistent but it's like
well it's about as queer as one piece
Especially when all of the fan favorites are like 300 pages in
To read that many pages
Good fucking luck convincing ANYONE
It's SOOOOOO good but like
Homestuck is the One Piece of the western world
It literally is exactly like that
like as a series
you know homestuck is good tho
ngl same, the site i use to read things shows the pages like a webtoon does
actually
I was going to list the physical copies of homestuck as example
YEAH
It's harder the more unique
They do actually re-edit manhwa panels to work in book format
It's just the same way
You know how english comics are published right?
Manga's also pretty much always in just black and white
Manhwa has it too
anything with manga paneling is just manga.
I just tend to use manhwa and manhua interchangably/if i know the origins
No.
but the correct way of referring is by country
because the styles between the countries are very different
Is sorta used that way nowadays, manga and manhwa
It
damn can't believe they joined the internet at age 1 because BRAZIL NO. 1 🇧🇷 🎉
it just has g instead of h
like manga is the same
yea
is because manhua is chinese
that
Do you guys not know the term for- or wait you're fucking with me on this arent you
Do
???
Hua?
because clearly they are straight
they get married on screen in the live action but then they dont claim it as marriage
because the differences are so fun
Do it and then read the manhua
well I could but it'd be like,,,
But I am so hyperfixated on mdzs that i dont think i can come up with any character that is not from that
I wish I could help.
Intersex ppl exist too you know
Damn, influencer drama is the same everywhete
lol
Okay cool
Nope
Was I mentioned direcrly
Where is the at
DO YOU REMEMBER
He dont have the money for that anymore
apathy is an easier state to exist in
yea
Just Because.
avoidance being high makes sense for me cause i actively push away all of my feelings and suffering because
lol
then again we agree on a lot
also yea tet youre not mean, at least not to me
ngl it makes sense that i have basically no arrogance but wow
an even 10
Oh nooo
I see
Even if I dont understand it sometimes
He should respond, everything you say is important
So an irresponsible spender
Ahhhhh
I see
Ah
What did they do
Yall really dislike this Aqua person
DAN HENG
why are we doing math
you're welcome <3
glad to see this getting used LOL
I only know japanese music
Uhm
you may.
Thank you. I'll at least take that.
Scientific?
I hope my explanation was satisfactory and uhm
It's okay lolol
Yeah, I know what server that is now gbygr4vbt54
The answer to this is, yes, God invented mpreg. Sure.
My god.
Right?
I don't think any of this matters considering the fact that you were asking about all of this because of the fucking bible?
Anyways
in omegaverse specifically, there's like,,, second genders that add variables so like,,, most people are intersex with functional genitalia of both sides.
,,,,I feel weird for having explained this
Technically, in that world, a guy with a uterus could get impregnated by the women and carry the child
Women with dick in omegaverse is used for a similar concept, so wlw couples can conceive
gay men couples
,,,Mpreg means the guy has a uterus and he's the one carrying, he also has a dick. Usually mpreg is used for mlm couples
Or
conceive?
In this scenario, are you asking about if a women with a dick and guy with a uterus were to
okay so]
,,,,Yes during pregnacy it does, specifically during birth
What you mean by that.
PLease clarify
Hold on, Riri can you
there are women with dicks in some of these works too
yesn't
do you know how babies come out of a vagina? it would work the same way in theory
former but like,,,, Sometimes they have a cooch, there are rare omegaverses like that
BUT I'M USUALLY MORE CIVILIZED THEN THIS
I MEAN YEAH
Yes,
I feel like this is the most proving of my degen status I've ever shown to y'all
FUCK
In omegaverse they've got a womb
*I don't know how to respond to this, I am wheezing though*
,,,,,,,
C-section is very popular, but a lot of times it's like uhhhh,,,, you know,,,,
Read a lot of mpreg
I uhm
I have a few answers.
Why is Riri asking about this
I
Glass what?
Honkai is a speedrunning game
Lemme make a thread in my channel
Hold on
Actually, I can also do 1st, My dad has a lot of books
I'm thinking 5th edition but I can always do 3rd
Well, I have Lol
Yeah
So valid, if you ever felt up to learning, I can teach you
AWESOME AND AMAZING
OH
Oh dear
I am doing good-ish, a bit tired
Lol
Someday my jaw will be fixed
It does for me too which is why i don't smile
just a blank smile
whenever I imagine Aster, this is the expression they have
That's good
<:HarukaHehe:994011977154314320>
good !
I wish you luck in that
Ooooo
Life is hell as always and I'm slowly drowning in my negative thoughts and emotions but other then that it's been good!
NICE KEI
So valid,
Lol
how you doin
Hihi Keilo!
It's still deeply annoying <3
But seriously, it's like I know probably that most people who write for the fandom I'm talking about are like... 14 to 16 so they definitely don't have the best grasp on the characters but like
Yes
I hate all straight Genshin ships <3
No
YOU CAN LITERALLY READ THEIR THOUGHTS
HOW
Especially the fucking?? Main?? Characters??
There's one fandom that I like straight ships in, and they alwayyyyyyssssss get the characters wrong
It's more common in straight ships tbh
Gorou would not use Petnames like that
Totally ooc
As for other things, It really bugs me if a character is just
Tbh yeah <3
So valid
I think it's second person anyways
Homestuck fan
Since
I'm used to reading in second person? I believe
but that's just me
I hate reading x reader
Not do that
No, I did in fact
I
With the fucking
But most of the time you could've just had a different chapter or just used a 

POV Switch [Character]
And sometimes it is
Accept it if it's natural?
I can sort of like
KINDA
YEAH KIND
No double spacing and the enter button is just hit between sentences
It's impossible, there's also like, 
This kind of formatting.
It's... Really hard to read!
RIGHT?
I'm super picky about that
Formatting
for example
Unless it's actually impossible to read
YEAH
Which means I read a variety of ships but
have to read everything </3
when I read for lesser fandoms I essentially just
MISSED THE FANFIC TALK BUT SO TRUE
lolol
well, more of one
if you are indeed ace you'd share a similarity with my sibling
you're still a bit young and figuring that so,!
so valid
ace?
You're so valid
Ahhh
CUTE
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
when you're older maybe
yeah, nikke is a bit to sexual for young azelie
you're so valid
God, Hot Women get away with everything
KMOJNHUBGYHNJIKMJNHUBNIJK
And thick thigh actually
Now those are some honkers
Thank you!
I want more fucked up stuff from Nikke
yes
drag queen?
and then hits them in the head with depression
to me Nikke lures people in with horny
I wanna find more of them cause it's like
like depressing and stuff
what are some other intense screenshots from Nikke?
wait actually
of phone storage
had to stop cause
I'd play it if I had more phone storage
it's small but they have one
Hakcer has a brain tho
that would've been a great joke tho
I figured
yeah,,, judging from what you said
I wonder if it was supposed to be a joke based on how she's shopping so
10 exp off
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
It's my first time buying a snack box actually
yeah
Sakuraco?
Oh I have actually
Thank youuuuu
:O
tbh I never know, I generally like snacks tho
she gave me a new mousepad, fan, and clip on earrings
I already got my presents from my grandma
speaking of birthdays mine's tomorrow,,,,
cat with bowtie
it's a paw
nope!
gt5yhjuikmj7unhbgv
sometimes other people's problems are interesting.
tbf, I'm fine with listening to other people's worries when like,,,, I'm not doing something
🤝
I am severely mentally ill Keilo
yeah people at school are the worst and don't deserve any kind of compassion
...But I'm also not very nice towards myself so
ik for the most part, idm as long as my friends care about the stuff I like, they don't need to care about me, as long as they're not mean
i mean, idt that's necessarily the case, then again, neurotypicals are a whole other beast
I think y'all deserve it at least for the most part
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
I mean depends on the person
MKNJOIHBUGHINJKL
it's being compassionate and kind to other people that makes you a good person and everyone has to constantly work towards that
Tbh yeah
ordinary? idk
I'll be the herrscher of uh
i wouldn't have much empathy for them either
tbf
MKOJNIHJMKLV,;CERV
well, I gotta help them because they need help.
or it's more like
so idk if I'm empathetic or not
I'm just Apathetic and think others matter more then me
They also tend to be the one abused instead of being the abusive cause they don't know when to actually seek help because of their own issues
Second, Most Psychopathic people also don't hurt or harm others because they know it will cause them harm ergo bad decision
They just don't have empathy.
For starters, People who are Psychopathic do feel emotions.
that's just not how it works
That's just plain weird,
Weird.
Me being the most moral member of this server is slightly concerning.
Either way
Tbh, Nea, you're better off reading Philosophy books about Morality and learning what it is
In fiction it's okay tho
vefmbtkrwdg4rfedws
well, even then, You don't advocate for murder just cause they've done bad things
philosophy major here
If you think murder irl is okay then you're not moral,
being moral usually just means you have good ones/know what's good or bad
LOL
He's got every reason to be Emo tbh
I mean,,,, yeah
yea doesn't really look too much different
I'd say only in his current 18 form which
LOL
I mean, yes I do have the Aqua pfp
OH
Makima's an actual confirmed groomer yes
nope that's something confirmed in fact
denji is in fact 16
am I the most moral member of this group or smth
that is a very good question
They really did just bring people in for the horny and went Now that you're here.... *the most fucked up shit and heartwrenching plot ever*
lv 88
hit
i have
So I just gotta wait a week
yeaaaa
i wouldn't put it past them
for example the stars
there might also be small changes
the cuts and framing might be different
But even if it's not exactly new
we'll see tho
i don't think it'll be the exact same
I mean, Ik Beastars is somewhat the same but there are changes
I love the mv visuals
I can't wait to see the actual op visuals
IT'S SO GOOD
yoasobi doesn't miss
<@148145559897636865> okay, i've been non stop streaming oshi no ko's op
*INTERESTING*
I think anime only watchers will have a great experience ngl
The anime seems to be doing things pretty well
We'll just have to see how it plays out!
Lol
what eye color does she have?
....true...
so valid, I think the stars have something to do with lies though, and the black star has major ties to depression and death
<@148145559897636865> I AM very Curious, what do you think the stars represent, like the white one and the black one
but reality wise, yeah, Akane's a much better actor.
i mean, narratively, akane doesnt really have a chance
poor gal is even second to Kana when it comes to romance lol
i mean, she deserves a lot
yeah
oh i mean, I think it's pretty confirmed it'll be ruby
It would be rather poetic if Aqua couldn't do it alone
If it's not authorities maybe Aqua will figure it out... Or him and Ruby. Finally working together at last.
I think that the girl they show us being specifically murdered will be his downfall in some way tho
i'm just thinking that maybe,,,, idk, of course aka could throw something crazy at us but those just be my thoughts
I think it's very cute that they clearly setup a party for the staff whenever it's a Honkai characters birthday
Or they have a specific bakery they collab with for birthdays
Probably someone working at hoyo who used to be a baker
So like, I'm thinking for narrative spiciness. Or they might try to get him in jail and he manages to get out via connections?
THE REASON I THINK THAT IS *BECAUSE* IT'S THE LAST THING YOU'D EXPECT, it's also cause it's like.... It *would* get in Aqua's way...
i mean, aqua did lose both at one point. Got them back real fast tho
Thoughts?
God tho, aqua and ruby's father fucking sucks. Also,,,, I think the reason why we saw him kill that particular actress is that she's the murder that's going to get him arrested.
That,,,, kinda makes sense. I sort of remember it.
Morning
Moening
Just woke up
Also
Interesting....
Ooo
Hehe
I might call you Lin or Nea for short if you like it?
Linen
Linnea! :O
gl Astra
Chrom? Citron? Citrine?
I haven't actually decided on what to change my irl name to </3
As for me
It is..
Such a pretty name
all kinds of naming is hard
Indeed Kirby is
but that's just cause you're def pink to me and a lil blob
Idk, I think it fits you
I mean
Kirby
If you want it anyways?
It's half hearted but
I also just now thought of a funny suggestion
Anyways
My 13th birthday sucked iirc
PFFF
It has to start with C
I'm also a bit weird it comes to naming myself cause I have a sort of rule so It's easier for me
When it comes to naming you, Maybe you should look into Space if you think it might be for you
ACTUALLY
Astra, we aren't great at naming things huh
Hmmm
my favorite's Aqua
what kind of name are you thinking?
def
Yeah
They Both do
He needs everything.
THE HOSHINO'S GO TO THERAPY ACTUALLY
FUCKING YEAH
Oh it's both
often
I had completely forgot because she doesn't have them
I see that now!
yeah,,,,
True, but the dark stars are important so maybe but yeah
That's partially my feelings as well, especially with the shots of the tv and everyone watching the tv
Another thing is that the reason the other Ai doesn't have a black star is spoilers,
Very true but I still think it's possible.
MY GUESS IS, When she finally realizes what Ai truly felt and wanted and what's actually happened she gains the white back.
ALSO, when there's the shot of the children holding Ai's hands, Ruby is holding the dark Ai's hand
But she doesn't have the Black Star eyes.
I think
Actually, it's a good thing to point out that the Ai on the bottom has Bluer eyes here then her normal color?
this is just confirming it
So
The exact same color/
See?
Granted, it Could be Ruby replaying Ai's life. Since the other Ai has the exact same eye color as Ruby
Even though she lied she's NEVER had the Black star
SO I THINK, It's representing the two sides of Ai, the Liar and the the Idol, I also this it's presenting the fact that the siblings both saw her in completely different ways. It could also be Ruby as Ai in the film, but that's probably far fetched?
Lemme spoiler this real quick
OKAY
Got it
I think it's symbolic
but I don't think there are literally two of her
So I haven't finished it
Okay
Also, I think Ruby will probably end up playing Ai, but in the way to the decision there her whole world view will be shattered.
Y'all reminded me to catch up
Oh dear god
That fucking SUCKS
OH
oh no
you deserve
Aren't you going to tier for a future event tho
NICE
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
Lol
Y'all are not initimidating to me
I am not afraid
OH NO
So valis
Nitro isn't too expensive after all
Yea!
I'll gift you a nitro
You want me to comm you?
so valid
Not easy is the answer.
flashbacks
Sorry
*sobs*
*ughhhh*
Ohhhh
,,,,,
I should probably pick up the pace on grinding
wait do I
,,,,
i will be tiering on en tho, my progress is slow but I have some time
i do not tier on jp
oh dear god
so valid
i see
I'm still scared of enstars players
I think music is better but
it was INSANELY bad
or it might've been even lower
tier 1,000
Oh like,,,, I meant they literally couldn't do anything but enstars if they wanted a chance at like
you had to use so much dia
at all
I remember that if you tiered you didn't sleep during that event
but essentially, old enstars and I think basic but like
Basic is not music
It's a nightmare
....
tiering on basic is
I've heard horror stories of tiering on basic tho
I mean, it def means tiering is in your grasp f2p
indeed
All I know is that I'm an Nobody/Everybody is my fav kinda person with this game.
Upcoming it's like,,, maybe a year away lol
looks like
he does have an upcoming gacha tho
he's dead.
kinda like his unbloomed tho
it's his worst card.
bad news!
Good news! he does have an event 5 star!
He might have some events tho cause apparently being the 5 star doesn't get you on the event banner
two kohaku events tho
not a single tori event lol
There is
on global
Judging by gacha schedule we are mid 2021
I don't see any Tori event within the past 2 years
Bad news
I don't see any Tori event too soon for you to gather mats
Good news Aster
FOUND IT
OKAY
Oh I genuinely can't tell where global is rn
lemme check where globals at
Cause it's enstars
going to get good at it again
when 2  comes out I'm
I came from Love Live.... Yet I suck at playing Love Live now
enstars hell
yup!
a bit.
flick notes in enstars are
iirc there's like 6 covers
but it's mostly all original
there are a very small amount of covers
yes
Expert pick
Tori
felt
me.
this game is hell
I think so
You have to flick in the right direction
I have failed songs doing that
ever
You can't just flick where
work that way
It does not
Oh no
Are you Sure about that.
*looks at some of the + maps*
for Expert
Yesn't
yes.
Not even Undead 😔
MAN THEY'RE DOING NAZUNA SO DIRTY THESE DAYS
whoever is voice directing these men should die.
Enstars music sucks
i will say tho
you should play!
ye ye
yeah
which is eichi
unfortunately one of my favs is losing
Tori in particular is winning
valid
ohhh
That's a !! card tho
THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT GOOD
HE IS UNDER WATER
NO SHUSH
This card is still peak
you're right
No speak
THEY REFERENCE HIM MURDERING PEOPLE IN RECENT STORIES
ISN'T THAT STILL A THING??
LIKE
i'm just waiting for a kohaku card where in the untrained he murders someone
all i know is enstars lore is wild
i see
oh
understandable tbh
no that's the other blue bitch
wait
himeru?
i don't play eng version either, i played it around when engirls was still alive

Idk
Well
Limelips
Maybe it's a low blow?
Hmm
Something Heki can't stop talking about...
Oh hm
Heki, are you trying to get... boobs? I have no idea what the fuck
What are you guys talking about.
Near the fucking leg
lemme see what I got
i mean tbh that does sound like a hoyo thing to do
wheeze
Astra has gotten people hooked on spreadsheets
but he uses the new weekly boss?
Heki's not smart
I'm still pissed about it cause it fucking scared me
Idk why it did but it did
Decided to blast like the Announcement from the Purge that the Purge was happening
SOMEONE
in my neighborhood
For some reason I'm reminded of the one time like
I generally have a hard time connecting with and watching movies
I'm not a movie person? If that explains it-
I wonder if I should
I haven't watched it either, I've heard some spoilers but I haven't seen it
Gone Girl huh....
happens
so I think it just lagged for you
Cause it was perfectly fine when I did it
maybe it was lagging
Hm
I got a full combo
that you're just bad?
have you considered
Heki
maybe rn my brain wants to watch things
I've been in a weird mood as well
I thought I heard about it getting a second season
Oh it won;t?
I'll stick to the anime for a bit
there's so many chapters to the webtoon for Tower of God I got too afraid to read it
the art gorgeous on that one...
Who made me a princess.... good...
I read a lot of things
don't eat a ton of fruit
i...
cashews and pistachio's are my life
Almond's are wonderful but by themselves can be a bit bland
Walnut's are only at c Cause they taste good in other stuff and spiders are allergic
whoops
something else
And I thought coconut was
idk anything in d
I love pistachio
I should probably get Baizhu though cause I'm missing Nahida
I'm more or less going for Kaveh
Of course this on if I get him lol
I mean, thrilling tales is better for Kokomi anyways
Me /j
LOL
Inchresting
okay neat
Would the Donut work on Baizhu
what stupid thing did they do now?
Heki gave birth? /j
go insane
I would
I
Oooooh
I seee
character
This fushion looks good as it's own
NGL
I think you're right
Oh I see it
it's Lumine?
that's Mona's fur collar
Mona's
nnono
Oh that's childes Hand
On the leg
And Xiao's tattoo?
I also see Ayato
I think
what is this
cause he's just a bit chunni
This is inaccurate, he cannot top.
Everyone's so horny....
MOANS???
moans???
No thanks I don't want to eat a tree
You well?
Anyways
Ahem
Cause Scara's a b-
To react to that gif
It's fitting you used a gif of Scaramouche
This just in, only women are allowed to have Asses
Cause Mihoyo's afraid.
Unfortunately, we the fandom must gift them asses
Kaveh's got that figure I want.
I love them together too
I mean,,,, Kavehaitham is good
LPKMONJIOKML;
But I just adore them
Idk exactly what it is with Cynari
Yeah I mean
same.
Genuinely my favorite genshin ship
I love Cynari.... so much...
Very true
I don't think so.
He likes the jokes.
I kin tighnari
Listen
THEY ARE SO GAY
cause it's funnier that way
I think they are not on the verge of a divorce, I think Tighnari just acts annoyed with Cyno's jokes
Yeah
ah okay so older then that
No.
And still is
Amber was older then Collei
What
Amber.... Should be 18???
In the cannibal way, I'm not a degen
I wanan eat him
He looks like a Chicken
How much balding do you think they did
and discords back on my pc
tts

<:bocchiwtf:1071060916889735209>
Why
What
I
KMONJHIJMKOL;
rolls
300
Almost
braindead
that
can you be
How
Oh
I recently got the frags to make her 3*
Or they were not informed how bad she is
She's their oshi
I'm a Casual.
They should all die.
I hate republicans
Hm
Oh that's...
Poor Dehya
Welp
ah
I do not believe they will
cause there's no way they're going to leave her like this
I think considering what everyone's saying they're going to buff her some how
Hmmm
Is her tanking good at the very least?
Is she really that bad?
I have skill issue but its okay because I am free
MAFUEMU
I think they deserve to be besties
I don't ship them romantically but
LOL
I thought I did lol
More then
I perhaps like Nene a whole lot
Mostly IchiNene
Agreed, also Ichinene and KanaNene
Also Mizuki
Hmmm
I think you're a bit like Saki?
I suppose I can see Honami tho
It's like if you combined the two
Also Ena
Tbf, I do actually have some of the same mental issues as Mafuyu
I think that's just cause I've got big mental illness
Though
My other proseka friends said Mafuyu and Ena for me
Bye Bye Astra
Nice
LOL
Honami I see...
Which proseka character is me?
dabbing
yeah
Yeah you really can't
When I'm in an apathetic depression mood why is this the shit that makes me experience other emotions
I'm sorry
*wheeze*
<:sitstarege:1040586023740125244>
Oh
Are you sure about that
PFFF
Do you think that at some point they'd become sentient?
I don't think my face has faster morphed into a look of disgust
<:ninondisgust:963351549445304361>
Why do I feel like I've entered the twilight zone when reading that?
<:peepojama:1065041007911108668>
RHHFGFDCVDDDGH
It is
Oh hi Gres
But-
That is funny
HUH
I'm a Dirk defender
True
Is the real question
Which Strider
I need to start making more
I've GOT you
!!!
I know and
Actually, Homestucks writing in general is still really good, especially the dms
Dave has some of the best writing ever
I love Homestuck still
Lol
Heki's a furry so her barking is normal
Cherry is a bestie
Ofc but I'm the kind of person who likes to be careful about labeling cause I'm annoying about them
Also, ao grey non crits are also just raw damage numbers  huh
I'll think about it more before I decide on anything methinks
That's a good point!
maybe it's a stig?
exactly
OMP[[,mpiocre yes
Like also I do not fit in the 2 descriptors of that label which is Women who are gay for women
so that ain't me
I;m not a girl anymore
Girl
It's like
It doesn't describe the experience anymore lol
But
Yes
I mean
Well
I feel like I've done a massive self own
I do realize the irony in that statement.
L,[KMNJIHBUGVYFUBHINJKM,;
I don't think I'm a lesbian anymore though, since I've figured out I'm a guy I've unlocked feelings for men again
and yeah very true
that's normal.
sometimes girls are good boys
I'll call myself queer for now cause I'm not a fully formed person yet
Yeah true
Debating just slapping queer down and being done with it
Anyone wanna help me figure out if I'm bi or pan or whatever cause idk what the fuck I am now that I'm a guy
That sounds a bit unsafe
huh
yes
so maybe i just don't pick up the smell unless it's very intense lol
then again, I have a broken nose that doesn't smell well
only every now and then do I smell weed
some how the smokers in this neighbourhood have decency
WHAT
LOL
I also have issues with smelling and breathing but idk if it's because of that
because of it
Well, my nose is crooked
PFFF
Yeah I saw! I'm dying!
I almost died as well in the womb because I flipped when I was inside my mother and my nose got caught on her bone
anesthesia knocks you out in a way that feels like you ceased to exist and when you come to you can't control your body (wisdom teeth surgery was interesting)
I dislike smokers who do it in crowded public spaces
i've already got history with asthma and i had childhood pneumonia
lol
smoking anything will fuck up your lungs
i'd have weed but tbh i don't wanna fuck up my lungs and edibles are expensive
i get weird plot driven dreams
I don't have a lot of nightmares and I don't have dreams where I am myself a lot of the time
yeah kinda, except I can look at crabs
I probably don't appear much, I do remember I appeared in one of my friends dreams playing a weird but intense game of uno and I was winning
yes
I mean, it does kinda seem like we do have similar mental illness
Zombie apocalypse style
No like
My worst nightmare by far was the one where everyone in the world was turning into spiders
I've always daydreamed
to reality
it takes me like a solid 30 minutes after waking up to like,,,, re orient myself
I always have vivid dreams
OH YEAH
thanks
for me
my brain sung that
Yeah, it's that but you're always imagining shit.
you know your imagination
Yeah sorta, Maladaptive Daydreaming is when you're always daydreaming which is like
I am also doing the same thing
🤝
Same!
cause uhm
Look into it!
You could have Maladaptive Daydreaming
I also have biiiig problems with Dissocation but
are you daydreaming most of the time?
Oh Tet tet
doctors apparently legit thought i'd die
I think my lack of memories from my childhood comes from my super low blood pressure though
I have memories but they're super vague
Me too!
Oh you're repressing big time
I hung out with the one kid who took his knife to school everyday
I was vibing too, for the most part
Jokes on them, I wasn't a person back then
Yes, indeed
Don't share that with Astra
Yuuup
Haha, you're so different! :) And funny! :)
like
I was so unpopular that popular kids would sometimes hang out with me just to see what was wrong with me
*nods*
I think I was just very obviously autistic
which is weird.
everyone treated me like I'd become the next school shooter I think
Also, I wasn't a mean kid, I was just a fucked up kid
I hope so as well
i hate life.
tmi, I've had to do laundry 2 times in the span of 3 days
No, I mean heavy bleeding like me
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
you don't have my bleeding
be lucky
Just
NOOOO
I should grind up some crystals for Kana3
I wish you luck.
New Rui Lim
I got Staff of Homa
Genshin likes me
But I'm more or less the victim of Project Sekai's gacha
I'm also the victim of gacha
PFFFF
maybe yeah, I dont think you deserved it but you know
yeah yeah
they're just using all of their power to reverse the roles in their brain
no no, they're still Thinking about it
yeah
but they will think about it
whether or not they regret is another thing
they're going to grow up and think about it probably
I mean, that's also partially true
Rich kids suck because they wonder why they're sad all the time and don't stop to think about how they view poor people as lesser and that might be part of the issue
I hate america <3
Oh
I was bullied too, so felt
my middle school sucked but that was mostly not my middle schools fault
that was nice
they gave me a lunch buddy tho to made sure i ate when i wouldn't cause of meds though
or management
Like I have some good memories but not because of like,,, the principle
That Elementary school legit sucked so much
Yeah it does
they/them pronouns btw, both siblings turned out to be trans
Still fucked in the head but they're alright
My sibling? Yea
My middle school was not that much better
ANYWAYS
This chats a mess.
They also ignored my siblings SA
I've got many horror stories from that school
Yeah <3
Same teacher told me she'd hold me back a year all of the time
Cause I was loud
My Elementary school in kindergarten locked me in a small room all day
I spent school miserably
That's sad.
None of her gear
I still have a VillV stig box cause I have
Any of them
I'd love to use my box,,,,
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
She was a kitten...
She's like.... We've had her since I was 8 or 9
I'm afraid of my mental state completely tanking when we lose her
I hope she'll continue to live a few more years
You know, we've had my mom's cat for a long-ish time now
Yeah.... Shows how well you've taken care of him!
yeah, for a pug that's very long
Well, At least he's being treated like a king
:(
That fucker will not stop eating hair.
*looks at my cat*
Animals in general are so hard to take care of
Yeah the sounds right
SNAKES
you get them wet by accident and they croak
rabbits are so easy to kill tf are you talking about
actually, scratch that, dogs are easy
they're all living beings which require research and care
ngl
there's no good beginner pet in general
Oh absolutely not
She died loved.
Probably could've lived longer
I'm reminded of my pet bird
and then yeah
You play through the story
He's a new player
lol
It was during Aponia banner
The decision is up to a bunch of cishet white old men
The house just fucking decides we as people have to beg our governors to make the right decision
We actually don't have much power as people to vote for laws to pass
In terms of America
I just gotta hope it won't.
But there are things that could go horribly wrong.
I think things are changing for the better recently.
I'd call this mental illness.
*pats*
Which is why I don't think.
I think I'd take it as Wow, isn't it fucked up if you're always thinking about gender roles?
Well, they are coexisting happily in my brain, in the bad kind of way
PFFF
Which is probably not what Marg is talking about.
Then again, I'm pretty sure what I do is called derealization and dissociation
I see I see
You mind your angles and view yourself as if you're looking at yourself through a camera
Well, no, like I mean in the way how you always mind how you look in terms of even when you're alone, like,,,
You're always minding how you look?
It's like
Ohhh, I've experienced this
Yea! thanks!
Also, am using Chrom as my name, you can still use Citrine!
PFF
I see, I've made a banger quote
Yes!
I'm getting my boobs evicted and I am probably bi or pan, maybe
Well, anyways,
I do think there are Men who would be fine, I've met a few, but like, for some people it's not gonna happen
Also yeah.
yeah.
I also realized it's probably cause I had always thought about the traditional male female relationship.... And also I am a Top. for some tmi
Now that's what I'm talking about.
Boyfriend?
But like
Like, Ew, Gross
LIKE, I'd hate to be viewed as a Girlfriend by a man
YEAH
Idk if I'm fully A Guy but I do be liking those terms.
FR
ojunhybIJOMPKMONJHBU
True
Was I repressing it?
Why is my brain like that.
What is with that.
When I realized I didn't wanna be straight I suddenly gained attraction to men.
As for me
So valid
I lost the plot when I realized I was transmasc
I wish I could assign and figure out My Sexuality
AL,MKONJIOKMVRLR
They are
Also yeah
You're Ace
I also have a strange relation to horniness, which is probably connected with my gender shit. well, I'll figure it out sometime
I'm also pretty horny. I just know how to hold it back.
y'all horny.
Rest in peace Boo
OMG
Huh
Denim?
Texture
The
Is
save for Hydro Archon.
I gotta be strong
I want her so bad on main
She's like, probably one of the most meta units rn
I see I see
ACTUALLY WHERE IS NAHIDA ON THIS LIST?
True, but they're still inferior to like without nahida
Not even hyperbloom lol
Only Bloom
and her best options are Nahida and Kokomi
Well, yeah, But it's still limited
to work
Very specific team
I think Nilou is where she is though because she requires a
true, but idk if that was Enough
I think iwtl is Still quite divorced from the f2p despite trying his best
cause if it was a dendro one...
Then Ayaka being where she is makes sense
I see
btw
is this just a general tier list or a dendro one?
i mean she has for me
But that doesn't mean she can't brute force her way through the spiral abyss
that it might as well not exist in the eyes of hoyo <3
So neglected
I mean, that's only because Physical damage is
her burst is a fucking nuke
And Eula's also good, I do have her at c1 but-
i mean, venti's still very strong
I think it is ranked still-
Oh my god
?
maybe I'll watch the eng dub, we will see
Hm?
I see I see
I'VE HEARD SOME OF THE ENG DUB, IT SOUNDS LIKE A FEVER DREAM
I've been meaning toooo
maybe I will then
Oh they are Gay in subtext
I was going to watch that one cause it looked gay but then it didn't have any of those tags so
OH Link Click
I've heard people with Trusted Opinions say it's good
I haven't watched it but it Should be
It is good
How the fuck did you choose to still live?
but whenever I imagine myself in a lot of MC or Antagonists positions I'm like
Not necessarily Minor
well
Part of what's shaping this!
,,,,I do think the fact that I tend to think at any minor inconvenience that I'm going to Kill my self is
The lengths some people go to live confuse and frighten me
Unless I have special powers there's not a chance in hell
fuck that
like
or during one either
i'm not living in a post apocalypse
I barely exist in the normal world
Not long because the second I heard it was happening I'd kill myself
Mushrooms are actually very smart.
Oh they absolutely do.
I hate Science, actually.
THE MUSHROOMS THAT TAKE OVER BUG BRAINS AND MAKE THEM FUCKED UP ARE SU-
THAT'S A THING?
HUH
Are you saying you're becoming braindead
S- supplements-
Yup!
Y'all know about Cordyceps right?
Cause Cordyceps are Mushroom reproduction
?
Wanna hear about Mushrooms
Bugs are even more fucked up
Yeah, Dolphins
Yes.
I suppose simply put, it's an option for us cause there's enough of us
Praying Mantis... are brutal lol
Sometimes the females eat the males after it too
LOL
Chery got long Honkai Vertical
I got Long Honkai Horizontal
Long honkai Vertical
Not an Airport TV!!
I'M JUST PLAYING ON A NORMAL FUCKING PHONE
JFKEKWKDS
It is kinda funny
I see the devs spawning things in
Or more like
Cause of my phone resolution, some cutscenes are broken in honkai
Oh fun fact tho
I have a long phone
JFNDMMDS
Am I meta now?
HUH
Same.
Mihoyo losing itself

I wanna get HoFI's weapon and try er with her
I'm too tired to play the game these days
MINORISWEEP
I think he was trying the Manipulation tatic called negging
You know
HUH
Idk
I dont think I can help
*pats in same with Haruka Milgram*
You draw all on one layer?
I do know what I want in terms of appearance and that rn I'm obsessing over a specific anime Man
However
Or my exact gender
Idk what sexuality I am rn anymore
Congrats on the gender
MinoHaru's cute

PLEASE NOT MY
No-
You're good
Lol
Ar35
There is an ar requirement but its lile
Yes!!
Allan's good,,,,
I can barely beat Allan sometimes
Lol
True
Well, TCG gives you sometime to learn your cards and the like
I also am victim to forgetting important things and having that be my down fall
I'm also kinda impatient but
You play sometime
Watxh
I will
Also, Aster, You're pretty smart elsewhere!
We'll see
Maybe
We should play a match together sometime <:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
Yeah,,,,
At the very least
We both know that you're decent
Aster
But I do
Idk if you will
GRANTED
It's really fun
You should try it
So valid
That doesnt require characters
Cause
Also tcg?
:O!
I wish they had tried something different with those colors
I see I see
Whatcha all talkin about ?
So valid, you can enjoy genshin without playing it methinks
Aster, you can Main Jean ans Ganyu in TCG
And Unbothered
Dont play hoyogames except for Genshin TCG and you'll be free
Yeah,,,
Sussannah was done so dirty
Anyways
Steven Universe has some complex lore huh
LIKE,,,, I LIKE THE COLOR SCHEME ON HER JUST,,,,,
It is
AGREED
Yeaaa
She's cute but there's so much wrong with it
I just wish the everything else was better
I think it's fine that she's pink
Please take care of yourself
LOL
Wait, are you talking about Steven Universe
Mihoyo is allergic to melanin
They just keep messing up huh
I want Mona
Same
Yeah
whether or not it'll pass just depends on whether or not you can get past it
other things
For like
i did that to myself too tbh
As long as you aren't an ass about Not Liking a character it's fine
I don't mind when other people don't like her
I like Kiana but It's not like I love her
No Jean slander
I can barely beat 30's
Congrats!
!!
Bandori Hold notes feel like water torture
lol
Idk anything I'm particularly Good at
Half way decent at everything
I think I'm just
Asterlao!
an icon
everything
Aster's so good at like
But not telling the whole truth
Not lying
Just say you havent been able to learn yet
did you get a 5 star
or at least close to it
there should be enough time inbetween Yelan and Ganyu for you to get enough primos to hit 180 pulls?
so I don't think it'd be a bad idea to get Yelan
Ganyu isn't going to be re-run in about 2 patches
Do you really want Yelan?
Lol
I slee0
Alrifht
Fjrkfkd
If we sleep at the same time I'll do my best to protect you in our dreams
Sleep Astrr
Me: I'm going to bed early!
Me; *stays up until 4:47*
Also
Its caviar
You have both
Lol
That question
Also
My cause is the autism
And if I'm in my own bubble I sing along to the song I'm listening to
Tho
I'll laugh/say something if I'm reading something sometimes
I'm *also* pretty quiet
I can control it
Felt aster, I dont mind whispering if like,,,
That i cant control
Stimulation
It's too much like
Get so annoyed that I need to leave
A dear friend of mine makes so much noise during vc and I
Lol
You might
Which
I mean,,,, it's just if you're making constant noise
Sensory issues
Gomen
If it's made up
ESPECIALLY
This is why I hate people singing around me/making noise
It literally feels like I'm dying If i cant control the sounf around me
I need my own sound around me
Like my body movements and what I listen to
Restrain myself around people
I have to
I also have sensory issues but like a different king
I also go insane when I am forced to spend long periods of time with other people
Oh I'm also touch starved
I am homebound and I dont like moving
That might be because I dont leave the apartment
Granted
I find those easier
Idk
Ehhh?
Last thing I wanna do
Not believing in my partner is like
Idk,,,, I mean, I just think communication is key
Also
YEAH
And clingy
Annoying
I think it's partially me? I think I'm just
I see I see
6 failed relationships, none lasting a year ♡
Maybe the problem is me
I desire a partner but like
Yeah!!
Oh you're aroace
I'm no longer using apps, they scawy
Well
Also I'm not, help
You have a partner? :O
Dont ask me I'm new to this shit
Idk man
I can be a just a dude
Navigating this whole being mostly a guy thing rn is very interesting
I think people just dont like me /lh
*pats*
I dont make the rules
Which means every guy that's touched me before is gay
I think it's gay to want to touch another guy
It's the other away around my friend
JDJEJRJE
Gay probably
Sure, as long as theres no audio
But inside my house around other people?
I dont open that shit in public
Sounds like a solid relationship
Those are my blorbos!!
Makes sense but it makes me happy
Everyone loves that emote so much
It couldve been wo- JrirkrkJRKEJRJRJRKR
So
On it
Spicy
That may or may not have something
Considering I always have a dubious tab open
Not too bad tbh
Zndnnsjsjs
Lol
Do you want to see my valks
HEY WAIT HEKI
That would be fun to see in canon
I love those two
I feel happier playing the account that has Nahida and Yae Miko ♡
Genshin...
BDKDKDKDD

Doable
It might be
2-ish days?

all hb outfits have been technically free except for the bp one
holy hell
I want tgis
Yeah true
NDKKDKFKDKD
Heki I thought you were aster for a second cause of the mafuyu emote-
simple
Your stomach hurts because it dislikes you
It's Not Supposed to be realistic
The two new valks are literally supposed to be like gods in a way
Carole is really good
OH CAROLE
Elysia's base is not too bad either
Seele has an okay one with stygian nymph
lol
Oops
yeah, Isn't Heki's mom Tet?
I think she produces Energy on the initial E cast and maybe some on the shot?
Faruzan?
My Yelan will get an amazing upgrade and so will my beloved Hu Tao
valid
yeah
Prefarming weapons mats
Oh God I have a lot of Mystic Enhancement ores to get
diligence will win me my weapons
if It comes down to it
Especially in the the desert
I have 900 primos rn so We'll See, I have a lot of Unexplored areas
I'll see if I have enough primos for this, If I have any extra I'm getting c1 Hu tao
But yeah
I don't think that's getting a Rerun for a long while...
I want 1 Homa
I need more bows, I'm hoping to get 2 Aqua's, one for Yelan, one for Tighnari
Yelan's bow
I'm finally becoming a Hu Tao user again
Homa and Aqua
However
His sword does look good
Yeah
Happy about that
Hmmmmm, Still
I'm touched
Wait Carv likes me?
I dont use the signs at all so
I see
A
Think heki has the arrows in the wrong direction
very true
no idea
Huh
The men have tits too
I'm not ashamed to be playing it
Fjekdkodods lol yeah
But, I agree, the game is good despite being degen
For the record, I am playing it because I'm gay and like women
I am also playing o/
so
I can't save but I'm also a casual player
Elysian Realm...
the only time you can sorta play it like that...
Tbh yeah
njbhgv hbunjimok
My first gacha valk was Starchasm Nyx
Yea
Sometimes I think I bring better luck for others then myself...
Ig
Your welcome!
This post was made by someone who slacks
imagine playing enough to earn the crystals for that
I was an idiot and didn't save enough
Fuck yeah!!
Only pull if you can trust your luck
No pulling then
Nope!
Do you have luck?
Depends
hmmmmm
Am Listening
Idk what exactly is making them hurt
My eyes hurt so felt
*pats*
Hence is why my brain needs cleaning
Miss reading the intention
but like
Not as missreading the word
Yeah
Uhmmm
....
you know
it's more my brain putting the word thang as like
No not like that
very wrong
i read that,,,,
i think my brain needs cleaning
But now I see it
I thought it might've been ely
It's funny that I saw that tho
I see it better now
LOL
PFFFF
with pink hair
I see an anime girl
What's going on
Hm?
PKMOIJNHUYimokpl;.'
Isn't that most of honkai's outfits?
ICM0IVMVR; VDVR LOL
she's on the winning team, she hasn't showered or slept in a week
like,,,, playing in some sort of game tourney
She looks like she's a sweat gamer in that fit to me tbh
NOOOOOO
Or maybe it's Sakura
,,,,,Otto, is that you?
Certified Kallen lover
what
wh
what the fuck is going on
If I had money I would
Good luck with that Heki
Congrats!
Lucky
Dang
Lol
yeah
ic ic
seems like a lot
but I'm just so well aware of how fast the meta moves and how much time that requires
I want to at some point actually pay attention and do well in this game
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
I am missing some good valks but I think I'm just missing some crucial gear
In all, I really need more gear tbh
I luccsacced her
Yea yea
hmmm
But.... I have ELF Durandal, maybe I should shift gears into phys
I'm thinking of pulling Klein tho because Klein's vry useful
I should probably try gearing her maybe
dang
MPE is still good?
Ohhh
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
You really need PE for Phys these days huh?
I hate phys, sincerely
Although I'm starting to feel that unless you have a wallet you aren't going to do well in this game
Instead of dps's
This is the reason I mostly try for supports
yeah
Never Learn
I've grown
i remember when I was constantly in the help channel cause I didn't understand the game
god....
I'd want a digital print of the book at least <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
*sighs*
My sibling has been trying harder but...
Dang
I'm not rank 88 tho...
If I take a bit and get a really low rank will I still be able to obtain the art book?
for those who are lvl 88?
I'm usually in agony 2 to 3 but you forget to do abyss while having a life and...
Lol
This is what it's like being this low
And everyone completely slept-
Oh nvm, I slid down to the bottom cause I didnt play for a week lol
Abyss
Happy, although I'm baby in abysa
I *knew* this was a sw boss
Yis?
damn, jesus christ
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Its not when they dont have stigs...
NICE
I luccsacced Dudu elf
Sw's weapon... I desire you carnally
I would be the ER champ
If I could get SW's weapon....
Have fun with her in ER
I just want to
Maybe
Someone give me hov's weapon and stigs so I can play her in er
I'm not redlotus ready
agony 2 to 3 is good for me
or wait
I want to be the tier where the rewards are at least 200 crystals each time
nice
oh looks like I'll rank up
I've been trying to do the abyss more
since I'm saving for once
i'm gonna check if I ascended
Ya malding, Keilo?
?????????
there's also a hamster version of it
I see I see
I malded in Animal Crossing, which I didnt think was possible
Eh, Still appropiate
Oh wait, this is the malding channel
Cool
owo cry
lol
I think I have used a lot of different pronouns for you tho
I don't think those are actual pronouns but you are valid
I will laugh if you use he/him cause there's not a masc bone in my body
I also take they/them
I think she/her for me is easy to remember
If I don't know I don't use any or just they
Well, I remember pronouns usually if they're told or made a point of like that
I see
Why is it always he tho
Keilo is really on point with the threats when someone misgenders them
I think being hardworking is a good trait for the most part
Well, that's valid
Ahhh
Honestly I'm not sure how to respond to that
Uh, Well, Uhmmmm
lol
thats the right word
Yes
or wrong
neither is more correct
it's simple
You had a viewpoint on something and Tai had a different one
You;re not stupid
lol
I type it like that when lazy
@ ed
I was ated for a second
Yeah, you guys seem chill
Or if someone gives a wrong answer you can always think about it and realize that-
Either way, I think someone giving the answer and then thinking about why should be enough
Lol
I think both viewpoints are valid and understandable here
But sometimes putting in that effort is just too much
I get that
it's okay to want people to test things out tho
There will always be people to answer
SS SA is still sort of strong?
Every sp valk gets better with rank ups
Well, duh, it's cause Rank A Griseo doesn't have nearly anything to make her worthwhile right?
work smarter not harder
There's not much merit to testing things if the data is elsewhere ngl
You can straight up tell them and explain
I don't think either approach is bad but sometimes you can explain why something is better
Oh boy
Perfectly balanced
valid
thats so vali
But also I think thats mostly people on tiktok?
Twitter is an endless abyss
I have!
So they think she's a bitcj
Because yells and gets mad and angry
Nono it's accurate because the reason why they say that is because a lot of people Hate Ena
NOoooo
Oho
LYRIIII
GORGEOUS
UWA WHAT THE FUCK THIS IS
They are indeed
or, they have a debuffer on their side debuffing you
higher spd, probably they have a spd booster

Maybe you aren't a high enough level to unlock the ability to try it?
Hmmm

LOL
You cannot stop the march of time, unfortunately.
Next Mafuyu song..
I felt so,,,, disappointed
SAME
<:ichikaconfused:1089112603307024505>

Uhm
brg is Just a good song and they did an amazing job covering it
It's cause vbs is just good
so valid and
Nice
idk what to do say or do for ya....
*hugs*
??? I don't think that's true
they're active there

CUTE

Add me to server.
You can make server.

I wanna,,,
:O
Omg
What is it
I haven't
yesss

It's not like *I* don't have wild non-interaction ships either
So like,,, so valid
and HonaKana feels canon.
MinoMizu is cute tbh
That's a WILD ship
yeah
fuck twitter
especially,,,
people on twitter,,,
???
like
you only see them as family because you ship ichika and saki
saki and tsukasa are the only one like that
cause they aren't family what
and you shouldn't get attacked for shipping it
I mean, persoanlly I see Ichitoya as a platonic thing (mostly just cause to me i don't generally like ships that aren't heavily canon supported/hinted at/sometimes i do just prefer popular stuff) but also,,, it's not a bad ship?
you're so valid
coffee date
*pats*
Tbh, I understand that completely
*hugs*
So valid
NICE
I wish i could send you
*pats*
We are both dying
I'm dyinc
Riri
Oh dear
Oh
Yahello
I am biased towards gay media in general tho
Think that one's good,
I
Idk if I can help you with that, I like tgcf, Heaven's Official Blessings a lot,,, That one should be safe? it's got basically no nsfw
Have fun
Because you didn't listen to the warnings well enough
LOL
So validdd
Enough of it

:(
She is
<:honakanahug:1099498043008630896>
If you're okay with having a stalker it means you have severe self worth issues

Boo's in the doghouse
YOU GOT TOLD OFF BY ASTER-
I have,,, only seen meme's about it-
JESUS CHRIST?
*pats*
np
This might be a good bet
5,000 times
Aster has probably visited baby name websites about
Yeah
Chrysanthemum yes
Something that's like 4 letters max?
But Chrom was like,,,, one of the names I considered before Citrine
I didn't feel Chrom until I decided to become more male
Aster, I don't think you're going to feel most any names at this point, you're very deeply ingrained an an identity crisis
*pats*
Could make Miri as a nickname too
Mimiri
Jfjfjfof
so valid
Yeah, sounds like those were some good memories
You really loved her huh
I LOVE THAT
PADORU
OMG BUG MAFU

Okay!

Oh dear
yeah
Did you know enstarries are crazy?
iirc
1bil or 2 bil
The top few usually end with like
that's insane...
Autism excitement hours
You got this.
I solve this by not being present enough to say rude stuff!
You have to at some point become more aware
Tbf no one is born with it
JFJFJFKDKD
I didnt realize there's no black...
Ohooo
At least I think they're still trying it out
They've been trying out a new name, Linnea, I've been calling them Nea for a lil bit
My guess is that this is a card/background Nea used and then they used black shapes to cover it up to make it look like confetti
OOOO
LMAO
talk to herrrr
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
I only read those things occasionally
some things are just written to hurt
Oh boy

Current mats status
speaking of cgo
Oh that ones cute yes
if you need help lmk!
ooo
LOL
i'd tier parasol cider on en but that's directly after cgo
I wish you a very lucky off rate up
same reason I'm tiering Parasol Cider hehe
assuming they're doing 5 events a month...
i wonder in kr time when will parasol cider be
and then we can seriously tier like later
let's gooooo
also cause tiering can help me gather mats for parasol cider
but not enough to completely drain my sanity
just enough to get a pretty title
maybe t10000
t5000
by low tier I mean
I think if you don't I might still try to low tier val tho
Yayyy
indeed
but that's so far away lol
I def will tier Parasol Cider
yeah LOL
aka teratera
In terms of Saki it's nsnf
i can look that up
but if you're talking about individually
valentines
we def should
i mean yeah
pub hell let;'s goooo
Even if we don't get very high it'll be fun
Lol
on the AiriSaki valentines
we can low tier on kr together
earlier
I luccasacced 14
I am at 105 miracle seeds now
oooo
ye ye
LOL
our timezones are so far apart that they loop back around to us being awake around the same times anyways
cause fun fact
i think when I tier you'll be able to help me
They tier super early for me too, I barely manage to catch their last hours
YEAH LOL
so valid and
yayyy
*hugs*
OH NO
VERY CUTE
Excitement
oooo
May I see progress?
OWO
JFJDJDK so valid
I kinda like the idea of using time cause the e could be a clock with the time stopped
So validddd
To see how you feel about it
You should check dms for the group name suggestion
So valid
What would you like talk about?
Wb!
Oki
NDJFKDKDKDD
Then his finger falls off and he claims it's a magic trick
My guy seems normal at first too
FNJRKFKDODS
The main concern is if Calanthe would like him
I think he's the type to get along with everyone
Maybe?
Hehehe
I think she Darakhul too
The guy and his sister!
But I do know he has a sister
There's a lot I haven't decided on him
Yeah,,,,
Nope!
I haven't decided much about him other then someone quiet
Or well, the race is Darakhul, they become so after dying
He got turned
And is desperately trying to seem like he's still alive
He's a Zombie
JFKDKDKD
Would you like to know about my character in that server? 👀
And even if you teach they'll still say it
And says rude stuff cause doesnt know that's mean
But is just direct
Bubbly nice person
What if
YEAHBDJEKKDD
I think you should kill yourself! <:Haruka_Smile:961431869646319647>
Swearing and saying the most rude insults with a smile...
I think she'd have a quieter personality if that helps?
Calanthe's so cuteeee
maybe we can backstory combine with our characters
Lemme see your design again
Hmmm
Her main personality is that she prefers to do taxes as a hobby
Melina, my other DND character has a smaller and less fleshed out backstory but it's also pretty funny
Cause with her new found freedom she's killed a lot more people then she did back then oops
I thought What if the Villainess despite being completely innocent was actually still a Villainess
Her backstory is very intense but also it's modelled after the Villainess stuff I like to read
in a different country
So, That leads to where Mimi's journey starts in the campaign, like a year from being on the run
She was going to accept her fate until her mom who's almost a complete dead ringer for Mimi helped her escape and got executed in Mimi's place
So, she's sentenced to death, cause attempted assassination is a big crime
In Mimi's room.
Another fast forward to where the princess gets poisoned, she manages to live but clearly, it's an assassination attempt, And where do they find the poison?
Mimi does try to stop that but well, it obviously doesn't go well
There's a low born Noble who's been interacting with the crown prince and he seems very taken with her.
Fast Forward.
No matter what she did it was seen badly, The only people she had in her life was her mom and her maids
They all thought she was planning something awful
She had one flaw, her face. She had a schemer look/resting bitch face. So everyone was both scared of and treated her badly
She's a noble born high-elf who's position was very high, and she should have had everything, She was in fact engaged to the crown prince.
She's a character I adore
Want me to talk about her?
Okay!
I basically came up with all of her Backstory myself
However, You know Mimi?
Then the dm can apply it to the world and you work with it from there, fleshing it out
What I've always done is make a blurry outline and then bring up that's what I want to work with with the dm
Well, it's a bit hard when you don't know the actual setting
what would you like to know
Oho?
then we can discuss oc stuff?
yea eat
granted, the america sys is fucked and i know somewhat the uk sys but that ones also fucked
unless the patient asked
Where as if a patient going to therapy were to they wouldn't be able to
They're allowed to call cps for example
cause iirc in most parts School Counsellors don't have that
Like patient Secrecy
The secrecy law?
Oh really?
She doesn't have incentive or like a legal reason to keep secrets
unlike actual therapists
Well, you don't need to tell the Counsellor everything
I'm glad your Mom is finally admitting that you need help
I hope things start working out for you
Either way
Yeah!
at the very least.
I hope you can get on a program like that
You'll have to see
LLOL
Counsellors count as a teacher
They can, sorta
Dang
just instead of physically going you just tune into the group vc
no no i understand
well, there's also the option I mentioned earlier, it might do that
hmmm
which means moving easier.
Also, you have the potential of finishing school faster which means you'll be able to find a job easier?
Yea!
Well screw him !
Cause that way you can school how you like and still get this Social Interaction
Well, okay, fine.
therefor your mom might be like
even if that doesn't sound too appealing you can still control what kind of group
for example, you can ask to join a club or something
You can explain that there's other ways to get social interaction
then it all fell apart
had more free time
For the first few years of my online schooling I did that and it was nice
so you can complete a school year wayyyy before it's due date
Sometimes, with Online schooling you can work ahead
Unfortunately even that was too much for me cause I have very bad executive dysfunction
Online Schooling is a blessing
You'd have to look into it
I do think that that's an option
Yea!
that might be preferable cause even if you're still at school you'd probably be free for most the day
Not sure if they have that kind of Program in Australia tho
I know about this cause I had a friend who did this
alone/don't attend normal classes
where you go to school but you're like
I think there are like programs where they put you on a work based program
Idk what exactly the soap means but it belongs
No you're right,
LOL
For that
In schools
There are special programs
If they miss class just summarize for them !!
I feel sorry for all kids with gut problems
Hate schools <3
UGH
Schools just let children use the fucking bathroom challenge
ugh
I mean, that's understandable. They should just give you space to cool down
Hyperaware of everything but it's too much to take it all in
but I will recognize the different people that pass and memorize them
To explain further, when grocery shopping my brain gets so overloaded by the everything all at once that I don't notice when someone is directly talking to/sometimes i just can't Hear them
Exactly!!
Having a routine and not wanting to stray from it isn't something that's shameful or bad
Sure you should learn to cope better when your routine is disrupted but
Like
That's so fine
and guess what?
Yeah that's Autism
My sensory issues are strange. It just makes it so I'm not really aware of my surroundings
Oh it's awful
I'm so autistic the government gives me money.
And like... We have a lot of the same behaviors
To explain why, You have pretty much all of the symptoms?
Like 100%
Absolutely.
Yes.
i wait for the water to get warm and end up wasting it cause i get distracted lol
Oh that's so understandable
or like to
Understandable, do you need to talk about it?
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
understandable
Which is the case for all Autistic people
The reason could be you're just born like this
I mean
you're valid and understandable.
yea yea
Oof
PFF
NICE
That's a start at the very least
yeah, how'd it go?
OH THATS NICE
*pats*
I was very not aware of this
Ah
oh boy
Oh no bots aren't a problem in proseka
You're good Astra
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
That's good!!
*hugs*
no.
CONGRATS!!!
OMG
It's very cute
Niwata Yuri?
Absolutely a jokey song but it's an Actual song that's made to sound good
Like,,, It's on the same level as Popipo and Francium
SekaSeka's fun in that it's catchy
Thank you Collpale
100%
So
APPARENTLY THE SONG HAD A VERY BAD SA JOKE IN IT??
That person is incorrect, also
Nobody really wanted it in the game lol
Tbh from what I saw about people talking about it
<@964806731471405086> a good day for you
good question
Yeah I definitely have
So valid
what was yours?
I also had a strange dream today
Same </3 but the first version is so pog that it's worth
I'm also pushing for a double ssr produce but <3
1. Koito
2. first Mano
3. Tenka
THIS KOITO IS BEST THO
this Tenka
this Amana
this Mamimi
more specifically the top one
these mano's


I'll show you what I'm going for
universal experience
PFFF
slightly crazy
going
I am
2 hours rerolling shinycolors
I have spent like
Btw Astra
So valid
TEHY'RE GORGEOUS
You've seen them?
Right?
This is weird Idolmaster merch thread but this is your girl righ
OOOO
Then I will keep rerolling for Natsuha
Ohhh
she good?
Rerolling the free 10 pull they gave me
I hate that they changed it
Ig I'll make a line
i don't have a line
I'll need an enza account ig
ig I'll play again lol
whelp
It still took up space on my phone to be fair
uhm
awhile back
I had downloaded the app version
OH
I used to play a lot but I ran out of space on my phone
I want to play again
*hugs*
Oh :(
I might attempt some stuff for it
When's HonaKana week?
Good point
*sighs*
It also warns you if you have an unstable connection before doing a co-op live iirc
Yeah! It does
(or at least as good as one as you can)
Have a good day at school
I'm always willing to listen
No problem!
That makes sense
*hugs*
ok!
*nods*
Perhaps, I also just think that it just feels hostile now that you didnt have the support you had when growing up
Rather then out of concern for you
The translation for all of that is that they want you around because it's easier for them
That's a lot of guilt trippung
Yeah
It's temporary enough
Can you look into uni's and college's that your parents might approve of that have dorms?
Maybe you should try to get into a college?
Even if it's a slow process
That can be done
There's always *something*
It just means you're putting in distance
It doesnt mean you'll never talk or see them again
Sometimes you just need to be away from someone for a long timw
I really would like to separate yoy from your parents. At the very least you're not going to fix that relationship until then
The true devils don't feel evil
And neither is Mafuyu
You aren't your parents puppet
You aren't either.
And is Mafuyu happy being connected to her mom?
Mafuyu
You *are*
*hugs*
It'd be better for you if you did....
Astra...
She is guilt tripping Mafuyu into doing what she wants
And no matter what Mafuyu wants she's always like But don't you want to succeed? Listen to me and you'll succeed :), you'll regret it if you don't!
Essentially she's given Mafuyu one path to take
I've just had friends who've been through this kind of shit and it's damaging
,,,,,,Sorry, I got very emotional here
And reading her convo with Kaito is proving it. Mafuyu's mom doesn't see her as a person.
Textbook emotional abuser
Okay, looking at the event interactions, This woman is manipulative as fuck
Mother's like this cause soooooo many problems that it's not even funny, for your own mental health you need to cut them out of your life
Want that connection
So, yeah we're going to dislike her and want her gone. Those kinds of people rarely change and while you think that maybe they'll get better it's not healthy to like
You're allowed to feel any which way you want but You should note that Mafuyu literally wants to die and in text it's stated that it's largely her Mom's fault
She's denied the girl any sort of personal opinion to the point that Mafuyu *literally respressed them down so much that she barely has any kind of opinion at all*
It's not that she doesn't care about Mafuyu, it's that she only cares about what she thinks Mafuyu needs without stopping for a second to think about what Mafuyu *wants*
She's a horrible mother, looking at this actually.
Not to mention,,,, Considering how tense some scenes with her are, especially the one where Ena was on phone with her, makes it *seem* like she's going to snap and start yelling at any second
You can't treat your kid like a perfect robot who can do everything
That amount of strictness is going to cause *any* kid to end up mentally fucked
And the fact that despite wanting the best she's oblivious and not paying attention to her own kids needs
The reason we hate her is probably her entitlement
Oh I meant the facial expressions
i love how insane they look
i have weird taste but I love the clashing colors
valid
*pats*
oho
i sorta assumed?
yea yea
cause it hurts my thumbs more attempting endmark
they're both around the same level, although I think Endmark is faster
skill
still
sounds difficult tho
Yeah, I'm just coping on being able to do everything with thumbs only but lol
I see I see
and figured the proseka server is one you've complained about lol
Oh I was just wondering who it was
kovmokvmrgg4
Of the proseka server?
Is it the usual suspect?
Pffff
people are at different skill lvls
it's okay!
hm?
OH NO
I am as well
oh pfff
maybe organize and plan things to do for later?
what's a good low energy thing to do...
Hmm
so valid
do you want any help?
You're so valid
yeah,,,,
Nice also
NICE
night night astra, stella
Yea yea please sleep
I see...
What do you wanna know?
*nods*
Stella's valid
You're so valid
Lol
So valid
That is very sad
Maybe I'll comm you sometime cause I do have some money...
Ah
How have you been?
Long time no see!
Also hihi Stella!
Plural kit itself might be the issue? Unsure
*hugs*
i don't know if these people know that
you know sometimes,,,, you don't have to join a conversation
h
She's stupid
I love that
OOOO
I thank her
PFFF
She;s doing better then me
Hm
*looks at my neet ass*
OMG
I like her design a lot
hehe
I think I'll make more serious attempts at grinding harder songs when the events not cc
Yea yea
I just gotta get fast and pattern down
I can clear don't fight the music semi reliably so... maybe.
I think it's doable
I think my hands are in a bad state but
I will attempt you tomorrow
Yaminabe
*wheeze*
Alright
Gotta love that
I am both getting better and worse with each attempt
should take a break with the next 4 attempts I think
giving it a good 5 for today
3rd attempt is a failure
oof
I'll give it a few more attempts
I think my reflexes are also just slightly shit, I wonder if there's a way to train yourself to get faster
Yeah def
alas
My brain needs to not panic
I think I have a hard time with complex fast things
I don't have enough fingers for this
It's not as bad as the fast bits in between though jesus
I fucks with my timing
Oh fucvk
*Oh these slowdowns*
Oh
let's try to clear expert
now
first try
hard fc
Might as well do that hard fc
Sure!
true
Yikes
I picked the losing team for both servers
Also
I kinda wish there wasn't a cheerful carnival going on rn
Also gl!
dang
I failed so fast toktgbmv
Can I do this with 2 fingers
Hm
Oh
fear
I'll try expert
At the very least
I could play a bit with you
:(
AH
Doesn't look like you had that hard of a time?
oh, I see
you should sleep
I believe.
IT'S SO PRETTY
fluffy.
the color balance and the sheep aesthetic...
I love wxs Luka tbh, her design is top tier
those meiluka's are precious
I promise not to do Conchita
If you want I can take her though
again
I don't know if you can trust me with Meiko
I mean
No one will try to fight you on that one
So you could probably play Luka
I also think vs are open
I don't have much power but I think you should be able to play Mizuki
I think I'm of similar opinion ?
You're so valid
I do too
She's my favourite L/N member
Agreed
But let's rp HonaKana next proseka kg!
ideas
I have
I only know what I want cause
I mean, I doubt you'll get too much competition for Honami
or maybe I'll take Kanade
and we can do HonaKana
Maybe I'll claim Honami again
next proseka kg
Well
Which is why I always req everyone that if they ship with one of my characters in the rp that they know they're locking their character to mine
Especially rping them
So.... some bad memories come up when I look at polyships
For their other lovers
ignored me
And they
Oh cause I was in a relationship with someone poly
And when Emunene isn't even my top most nene or emu ship-
I'm a bit jaded when it comes to poly relationships
You know me
Tbh
It's nice when others share your opinions!
Lol
I agree with you on a ton of stuff
I mean
You're so valid
Even if I don't really like some
ngl, I think every prsk character is written great
Rui's a great character!
Fr
I would've lost patience
God speed to Rui, studying Tsukasa all of the time
Yeah
He's just annoying
Yeah
but....
So some Neglect there
He gets better later on and I'm sure he has his own problems cause their parents focus completely on Saki
I have no fucking clue!
He's a failure of an older brother
But he just fucking forgot.
Like he's acting for Saki
Forgot his purpose for perusing acting
He legit just like
Whoops
*face palms*
Oh
hhh
I love his design but
He's actually annoying.
I will slander him slightly because like
Tsukasa
Emu's a great character, I wish wxs focused more on her rather than
Both Current and Future are important
You gotta think of both ends
Yeah I think so too
Emu's goal is to make people happy cause of her grandpa I think
I think Mafuyu can help Emu realize her dreams and like,,, I think Emu would be happy she can make someone as depressed as Mafuyu smile
Some ships are better if it's toxic I will say but like,,,,, KanaMafu's toxic in a realistic and bad way that just doesn't make me interested in it
YEAH
Yeah I think so too
the difference is big
Meanwhile, All Emu wants is to make Mafuyu smile from the bottom of her heart
She's trying to Fix Mafuyu
besides, Kanade's Savior complex is Bad
Agreed
yeah
It just equals messy
For their relationships
It's like,,, Mafuyu and Kanade both need someone more happy and opposite vibes from them
EXACTLY
Yeah!
Mafuyu's like Oh okay
Emu's like We need to get you some happiness and self love stat!
LKJHBJKL
Like, that relationship will turn so ugly
Yeah
And HonaKana works better for Kanade
MafuEmu works better for Mafuyu
toxic?
It's like
I feel like they'd be so codependent on each other
I don't like Kanamafu much cause
Oooo
OHO
That's nice!
Yea
I don't understand the full context of that, are you happy because someone thought about you?
Whoa what happened
Good! And ooo
Aka Restless
But are you full of a lot of thoughts?
Yes, sleeeep
I can help Baban!
Sorry, I'm on Milk
sounds good
Yea yea
I think it's for some fun factor
it's a very unique rule, I forgot why he had the rule
maybe d20's too? I havent played his campaign in a hot second
Yeah! only for d6's though I believe
My dad and I have a personal house rule for rolling stats that 1's flip to 6's
the combined total
and reroll if it's under 8
you need 6 stats
roll stats first
but lets'
Rangers are fun, I can show you what's the most optimal
Clerics are op tho (which is what she is) so she didn't have to have a hard time
Yuuuup
For example, you can only be the most basic version of that class
Although those require money for it to properly function
There's a bunch of sites that do somethings for you
Yup!
So rolling stats is pretty simple, you roll 4 d6 (the most normal kind of die) and remove the lowest roll
*nods*
if you haven't yet
We can at least roll your stats
Do you wanna work on your character?
Plus I actually spent a lot of time helping her in the dms
She's using a few cheats
Got there
Well, she's sortaaaa
Alice? Oh you're talking about DND
Yea yea of course
when the updates done?
do you wanna play tcg against me?
Good luck with that
Pffff
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
I'm there for you.
So if you need anything now uhm,,,, Like idk what you could need but if you need anything
For now I'd like to be helpful in the now time
That's understandable
*nods*
Are you sure?
So when you can manage to get away from them I want to do everything I can to help
Either way I care about you much and your parents are very shitty.
So if you wanna stop that's fine
Of course, I'm sure this isn't a fun thing to think about
There isn't necessarily a big criteria for it
Like, of course you're going to think But they don't do this!
That it's abuse.
And the fact that you have DID
But I know just from what you've told me
Astra, you never think you are.
Being abused does that to you
Not in your current environment for certain
Just know that as long as you will it, I'll be there for you in all of those years
Yeah...
I need the same, although probably for different reasons.
You need your own personal space away from people to help your brain relax
Cause it sounds like you'd do better living alone
Idk about Roommates but I'd def help you find a place you can live on your own
I want a lot of money in general but like, If I had a lot of money I'd help you move away from your parents
However, when you've moved out, you should consider a lot of things.
Cause I don't want to think about how things could get worse for you.
While you are in your current environment I partially agree
I'm not fully out of my bad headspaces
The only issue is that getting out of that headspace is like.... Mega difficult !
Human brains are idiots but also really good at coping
It's not safe for to do so, so you don't
Cause you've not allowed yourself to actually feel things and comprehend your own feelings
But this is why you get annoyed by things and you don't know why
Yeah
It's not safe for you to express
I know why you repress them, mainly your abusive home environment
Or Not understanding your own feelings which means they come across to you as dull
Either not feeling due to coping
Which means you end up
Also, to circle back on this, you absolutely do feel a lot but you also seem to repress yourself a good amount
The hard way
I had to learn them
Not everyone has inbuilt people skills
people can be tiring.
Yeah
Because you didn't lie but you also told me how to improve
I did not feel attacked a single time in that interaction
You were stating your thoughts while a bit harsh, politely
Remember the time you did constructive criticism for my writing?
People don't respond well if they feel like they're being attacked
You just gotta word it so it doesn't sound mean
And I do end up saying them a lot of the time
Even I have some extremely mean thoughts
I find this better, you're valid though
Or
Agree to disagree
You can just say
People can't trust liars.
You're lying
Oh, because you
Yeah, well, I've got the mentall illness of feel things 100 times more then the average person
Cause that hurts people more.
Also, Astra, please don't lie in the future about liking things
Just know that a lot of people that will make them upset.
So you can continue being the way you are but
Of course I know you have issues with this tho
But there's a time and a place for stating that opinion
Of course you're entitled to your own opinion
You can say You're valid, I don't really like her tho
You are insulting them for their likes.
And you respond with Nene so punchable
But it puts people down when someone says I like Nene
And you also don't need to lie about liking a character
Of course opinions are different
Because it makes them feel bad for liking that character
The difference is people do care
Just went Idk, just hate her
Okay so what if someone said Luka was punchable and annoying and didn't bother explaining any traits of her that made her such
Hmmm
Alright?
You're not in the wrong
I can,
Astra, it's fine but if you want me to explain something here....
but idk it feels bad when people are mean to my favs...
i mean, Astra's valid to feel how they feel
i will sit over here with my trash takes then
ah
hh
Sorta
Rui too?
I like Emu and Nene
I don't like WxS showtime that much either
tbh
Meanwhile, I sit over here in Nightcord and Leo/Need
Saka's a vbs fan
Yeah they all are except for Saka
This Emu's nice
You're talking to the person who's tiering cgo
She does?
Loud
But like
her personalities nice too
I just like Emu's aesthetic
same
I think Astra doesn't like how Loud Tsukasa is
At this point my idea of tiering this wd event after cgo is a more feasible goal
That's a not a lot.
Hm
Oh
Also, that l/n event was a long time back-
How long does it take to regain cans?
Oh if you're talking about energy then like, I don't have.... like... I'm I don't have a life
Does Colorful Palete not give a ton of energy?
but still tier
a Low tier
Like
I also think that if I tier this I'll have the resources on en by that point to tier Kana3
I also think the title for this event is pretty
LOL
I do
Yeah
Perm banner....
L/N....
How chill do you think this one will be?
Well yeah
I do
I could maybe do this one
This one
absolutely Not
Oh yeahhhh
Directly after cgo!
I technically have everything to tier the event....
The funny thing is
You see
CGO is after that
Uhm
You see I could do blank canvas but
True
Hmmm
I want a chiller event
CGO
I know that one will be as painful as
Yeah,,, I'm afraid of val2 tbh, I love the Kanade but like
Astra, which event do you think I should tier after cgo?
Hmmm
Nene was shop
An, Tsukasa, Rin
New years
The gamer event with Touya/Emu/Nene
I'm wondering what event I should tier after cgo
yeah it's a cute event
Of course but Idk if it'd be worth if I don't have all banner cards anyways
Yeah, I know...
I will not use crystals for energy unless I have all banner 4 stars and I'm out of cans
Yeah I believe so
Oh dear god
I'm soooo going to need to devote my life to proseka for cgo
it was just more efficient to do it together
I needed to burn my natural energy anyways
np!
like Astra and I have?
40097
yeah
nobody picked dark chocolate
timed out
LOL
I've got two more lives in me I think
lag spike right in the middle of the fever, rude game
fr
another person who lingers....
Lol
92485
so it starts....
I only have this leaf mizuki
*pats*
didn't tap through the screens fast enough
idk
Full Combo yet
21064
I'll pick a higher scoring team that doesn't net me a lot of event points so you can get more
kmfbtodep,
for tiering
I should pick my filler team yea
Sure, if that's okay
am ready
right
we are in fact not friended, I'll send you a req here, what's your id
alright on
Gimme a second to log on
Ye
It
I could help you Baban if you still want kt
Awake
I
I also wish I could do that too
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
*pats*
I do like Mizuki's voice but I like Ena's better
I agree? Tbh
Yes
Oh my god
Nice
Tbh it's a lot less then I anticipated
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I have the required amount of what I need done for everything but practice scores
Current progress, I'll take a break for now
Alright, I think the thing I need to do most rn is grind easy and normal fc
I need to update current crystal count but lol
The progress so far,,,
does that matter ?
and does general like,,,,, the vbs area item
btw
So I want all of my characters area items to be level 10?
Ooooo
God I have no idea how to use spreadsheets
I mean, I do have Birthday Akito but Birthday's are just good healers lol
yeah,
LMAO
And probably assuming I'll be getting event Akito up too lol
alright
Should I calculate it assuming I'll be getting all banner cards?
let's see, I'm going to need to calculate charm cost now....
Oh that too
And it's not organized
It doesn't list all of the information like at all
that is what I'm referring to
Also I see, google/the wiki should be my greatest friend
Can you share what your spreadsheet looks like again?
*nods*
In terms of gems/coins/other stuff
How do I calculate what I need?
Let's see, i need to find your spreadsheet and copy some of it
Google spread sheet time
NDBDJDJDD
In a bit would you mind helping me with something, also I'll run milk too
Astraaaa
Oh yea, for white day what should I join
NO
No dying
wtf,,,
Yeah
God
okat!
Lemme check, what channel are they being idiots in?
Understandable
*nods*
so valid
I'm Terrified of the idea that Hanasato brought up
So valid
I see
It *was* a top10 board
Ahhh
Okay so, like,,, I'm going to backtrack on the stream to see why they played clips of those songs but to that one person who said  To show you what they sound like you are not very smart.
*nods*
I should join that one
right !
I'd want to join but unsure if you'd want me to
that's nice!!
Is that your tiering buds/
hewwo
KMONJIHBUYIJMOL;\\
So valid
Oh, apply pressure
Very... Melancholic
I like this!
You're very good at writing
Yeah!!
You're so valid
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
If Yae didn't hate men so much I think they'd be great friends
Tru tru
Interesting,,,
Yae and Ayato together?
Damn whales
I see....
?
Shouldn't you sleep then
MinoMizu is good tho
Ooooo
JDJEKEJEKE
*hugs*
And I'd credit you for every bit of work you do
You're amazing
I couldn't even make what you make
You should be acknowledged for your intensive work!!
GOD WTF
Yeah...
I DO WANT HER NGL
And she has a lot of attacks that are hard to dodge/trigger interruption
I think I just have a lot characters who hate being interrupted
You do! Somewhat
NFJRKKDD
Night night!
I haven't exactly started on fic yet (I've come up with an outline of what I wanna do) I shall sleep now, tomorrow I'll get to writing
Yes yes
All it takes
1 ten pull
I believe
As long as I save a fuck ton of crystals
I have 30 so I can spark whenever too...
Yea!
I need to stop pulling on Lim banners Lol
Oh but I have 30 pink vouchers
Also, 18 vouchers... So close...
Maybe we could grind together sometime?
I should too...
So... Dream Pick really works.
I got like, 3 Kanade's last dream pick
Yes yes
That's the only lim I'm missing, currently saving green vouchers to buy Lower Kana!
Next year....
I unfortunately tried hard and didn't get Valentines Kanade
I feel so blessed
I can't believe I managed to get one of her birthday cards
Felt.
I went for all Kanade last time so lol
All Luka.
I don't see why it wouldn't.
It should!
I mean, I can hope for your sake lol
maybe.
I think it'll probably be 3.
Yeah...
Maybe next Anni
PFFF
Luka feature event when?
So valid tbh
lol
I actually don't know anything about next nightcord event cause the leaks were bare minium
That's if next event's cute
Tho
I think,,, If you manage to get two features, specifically Kana, then you should be able to tier
Yesss
I think I probably don't have enough.
Oho
You should start saving then
Oh
Nothing more!
Soon
Word of him
We do have
Well, I posted this in spoilers but
Agreed.
Yeah
Like her Canon design/her hair?
Len is a small victorian child in Nightcord, I'm interested to see how pathetic they make Kaito
Yeah! Absolutely!
(Which Mei and Luka work together very well with tbh)
At that point it's more or less shipping aesthetics
Cause none of the vocaloids also have a set personality.
Which makes shipping a nightmare
Vocaloid's ages can be pretty fluid in a very weird sense.
So Old School Len which he was def more familiar with has very much College student vibes
Where they portray him as like a Womanizer.
Like, I will not tell you the exact songs but there's a lot of nsfw songs with Len
Yeah.
Back then
So Len is often portrayed as like... An adult
Also, He's old school vocaloid.
So he views them both? As Minors?
I believe.
I remember asking him and the answer is that he doesn't view Kaito as older then 18 at the oldest.
But in proseka? I'm pretty sure they're written to be their canonical assigned ages.
It's a bit different.
Especially in Proseka, outside of is cause they're not really human...
True!
It's very cute.
I get it.
No but I see that.
PFFF, Not to be a bitch JONOIMP;KMNJI
They do have a very cute dynamic, agreed.
I need to find translations of Nightcord Len though grrr
And how dead pan Miku is lol
And how Luka teases Rin.
I like how Mei and Luka in the Empty Sekai are always like,,, bickering.
They're really cute as a combo, well, I'd be adding Len into the mix but the 4 of them have great chemistry
Rereading Area convos to get a feel on them...
I suppose I'll open up a doc
*nods*
I think the most likely would probably be WxS but I think out of the VS I know Niigo's VS best.
Hmmm...
Oooo...
Oho?
I'm awful at coming up with prompts.
Yeah...
Uhmmm
Alright
I feel like I've been grabbed like a toy from a toybox
OH
Although I suppose that does require having inspiration...
You should!
<:peepojama:1065041007911108668>
But it makes me happy to know I'm not hard to work with
True!
I hope I'm an easy student.
<:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488>
Hopefully.
Well, I'll probably start noticing it more and correcting it.
Indeed.
True.
I will attempt to drill into my head.
I will tell you, this particular grammar mistake has always been my Achilles heel
AH
But experts or people better at it than me can tell that I'm missing important parts lol
So it looks like I'm good at things from an outside perspective
But not all of it
Half of the knowledge.
It's hard to explain how my brain works but I'm good at absorbing like,,,
True!
I think.
I am the sham kind of smart
Being naturally smart means you pick things up easy, being actually smart means you retain and apply that knowledge.
It's a both kind of thing
You're smart, so that's probably why.
Like, you gotta explain how that works!
YEAH
So *that's* what they mean by show don't tell
*nods nods nods*
*nods nods*
Yeah, that reads a lot better.
OOOOOOO
*nods*
Yeah, no that's definitely a problem I have.
Ohhh
Where's my motivation brain? I wanna do things.
Indeed.
These days I've not been motivated to do much...
So valid. It takes having inspiration...
Maybe I should write a fic sometime and have you beta read it
Am willing to learn
Either way!
And that sucks...
FR
Alas.
I wish I could've learned this stuff there but.
I feel robbed cause school fucking sucks at teaching
Yeah, I'm willing to learn tbh
<:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488>
I'll try not doing that for a bit and see if it flows better.
Idk why.
Oh that's true, for some reason my brain likes assigning exact times to things
Thank you, Astra!
But it feels nice knowing I'm not a lost cause.
I feel like I'm bad at prose but maybe that's just my own insecurity...
*nods*
Always good to learn more.
Sure!
I'm decent, I just need to work on my grammar
BUT what I'm hearing is
This has been grammar class with Astra
Now I just gotta learn the context lol
Right right
Well!
Gods and Goddesses
So it's like, gods and goddesses instead of
*nods*
Wait I did the thing again-
Oh wait, Really?
lol
And something I probably should've known
Insightful
That's
Huh
As for the other one... no excuses
so lol
bUt I know I tend to do Random capitalization Elsewhere
same with Goddess
A title
I think the reason I capitalized Royalty is cause it's like
Yeah
Ahhh
I could use a beta reader probably
*nods*
!!
So I was on Some kind of high
I will say, I wrote that after drinking a very potent energy drink
Either?
I will say, I know I've probably got a ton of mistakes
And understandable.
Pfff, so valid
I will say that the lack of capitalization would bother me if you were inconsistent with it but since nothing's capitalized it's like a writing style
gives a warm feeling
Your writing so cute
So they are Way more cringe.
Don't look at my other works, some of them are my siblings and some of them are like 5 years old
I will share.
I can send you one of my fics, It is somewhat cringe but
Yeah, I don't think I was properly taught grammar ngl
Oops
Do I do that?
Ahh
What do you think?
Idk, Aster, you've rped with me
You're very valid
I think my writing functions.
I only write fics once in a blue moon
I don't claim to be good at writing And like
Yeah
PFFF
But do not lie or else they will not improve.
Yo, this fucking sucks
I'd say you should find a Nice way to say it other then
be honest.
But if they ask for critic
Support them on writing
Listen
PFFF
there is the chance that it's actually bad
I mean
So cute'
Astra...
OOO
we appreciate you
barely active lol
also I'm also kinda
no one will judge
You can ask!
Suck
Idk what happened but dealinf with spideds
*pats*
I clicked but then I tabbed out, thanks for the warning
LUKA
<:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488>
They do indeed
alright?
If there's anything you need, let me know
*sighs*
I wish I had money and I wish I could help you escape
And your age
it sucks that you actually can't because of how awful they are.
I wish you could get away from them
Okay, that's a bit intense but
I will fucking kill them.
You're not alone.
I'm here for you
Well, if you need help with things
Act on.
To like
But I think you've got a good amount of information.
There might be something we're missing.
There might be something else that better describes it
For the most part.
I do?
I mean
unless you've already done research
maybe?
I'm sure there might be someone who does it for free?
I mean, if your online interactions aren't fully monitored by your parents maybe you could look into maybe finding an online therapist to diagnose you?
Hmmm
*pats*
lol
Solis would be more valid if she didn't insult you all of the time
And you're valid too
She's valid
Stella seems to be asleep these days?
Okay it's Solis
Maybe it was Solis
You dont need to but if you want to I can help you make a character
You'll do fine, if you wanna participate!
like?
understandable
OOooo
eternally angry or upset over it
I;m not
cause like, some things hoyo does aren't okay but like you know
I do have some some of that
Hewwo Keilo
Lol
although it tends to be empty
I also welcome you in my corner, Eli
That also sums up my feelings on this server
Yeaaa
Yeah,,,
Wanna trade-
GOD YEAH
lol
I mean, the gender dsyphoria would go away
YEAH
Like, idc about anything else, just gimme that flat chest and not a uterus
most actually continue until they're 50 or 60
I wish I was born as the other gender but like, Only because I just want the body of the other
Yeah same
I just think they vibe nice
Idk
IchiNene is really good
Either way, are you okay?
You're the only one who can tell us that one
You're not Aster?
Ah
Aster?
Night night aster
Same!
Yeah
That seems a lil heavy handed
Like
Jesus???
Fjsofkeodkd
Yeah actually
*is coping*
It's okay, I'm legible for the most part....
And that it's been forever since I've learned in school
You can tell I didn't do High school properly ♡
Fjdikdod
Relearn english someday
I really should
Forgetting the other uses of an Apostrophe
It's not Angel is share so without the apostrophe
You see my brain goes
I see
Ahhh
Ywah fjdjdkd
My brain does this all of the time ♡
I feel like I should Know this
An apostrophy??
Angel's share has
Oh wait
*pats*
I mean,,,, I'm slightly guilty but I know you've put in effort to be as good at things as you are
That's valid
*pats*
That's good
*pats*
Is bad
My memory
That mightve been someone else then, Idk man
Sorry
Maybe,,,,
Hm
It
I remember it happening cause you mentioned
I only half remember anything
Tbh
Idr
Uhh
But if it's consistent...
A one time thing
I think when it comes to mistakes it doesnt annoy me if it's like
Is an easy Mistake to make
Which
You spelt it Allen
*sighs*
I think she said it's supposed to be a nickname but like,,,,
Me
Annoys
A lot of the time and it
Grace spells Makoto Makato
I feel you
But yeah
Idt Allan still spells Keqing wrong,,,, hopefullt
I mean, you spelt it wrong first time you met, yeah, but you spell it right now
Oh no
*pats*
it is annoying indeed
idk
It's just Qiqi
confusing
That is
I'm just lazy
too
i should
Valid
that's probably it lol
yeah
completely forgot
I must not have been paying attention or just
IT'S SO GOOD
I didn't realize this was getting a cover !
OH
Dawwww
So cute
*Pats*
Ye ye
Endless possibilities huh
Yeah
Oo
Rinlen kaimei saki/ichi2
Or they might do something like
Maybe
Ichi2
Like
Meiko gets to be with the first other character repeat
Believe.
No no
Believe.
Another Fes
maybe
?
SakiLuka
yeah,,,
more even spreads pls
justice for all of the vocaloids
it really is
free them
They hate them....
So valid
*nods*
so valid
ooooo
I'm glad that you're home
Nice!!
So valid
I wish I had that space
That's a decked out phone holy
I'm happy
That's nice!
She's a trooper
PFFF
<:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488>
You're very valid
It's not weird
If Aster is happy I am happy
I'm just happy to notice that you two seem to be good friends
Listen,,,,
👀
Nooooo
hehe
I love it
Sounds like a great event
oooo
I love that idea
So cute
OOO
Adorable!!
They are holding hands!@
Makes me happy too tbh
I do too!!
Oh that's very understandable
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
An internet hug?
To talk or a distraction?
Would you like something?
You okay there ?
*pats*
that's cause I hated reading so the fact I was reading at all meant that nobody wanted to get inbetween me and anything I was willing to read
Granted
nobody did that for me
rude mother
it seems like a fun read!!
Oh boy
Ooooooo
So valid
pretty...
!!! What is Solis's icon in full?
Ye ye
She's can be such a bad influence
*hugs*
what happened?
yeah,,,
Contractions in english really make people confused
now that I think about it
*hugs*
*hugs*
When you come back
I'll be awake for a bit longer so I'll talk
Oki oki
That event is cool yeah?
Ooooo
What are some of your plans for your games
Nonsense!
Do you want to talk about something to get it off your mind?
It looks fine, but *hugs*
Yay?
I have all of them but Kanade I think?
I love the blank canvas cards
ooo
SO CUT4
POK,MVR VKJ V
tru
Oh my god
FUCK YEAH
Oh shit?
*pats*
Yay!!!
ALSO THAT
The hair isn't right and there's odd clipping going with the face
lol
This person just Slapped Mizuki's face and hoped it'd work
I don't think it's necessarily the body but like
yeah...
Nice! and that sounds fun
Hi hi aster, how are you and the others in that vessel of yours doin?
so valid
lol
ayayaya
Yeah
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
I'll ask her then next time she comes out
She's valid and yeah
She does at least seem younger then Aster
Solis is scary
She's *not* scary
Lulu is cute tho
*nods*
Ok
Ahhhh
If it's about the new alter
If you're talking sbout the sick person-
They either are too miserable the respond or have passed out
Tbh, I could probably help, I've dealt with sickness and and sick people all my life
And both people Don't know what to say
Someone was having a hard time piloting your body...
WB Aster
Either way, if you think Aster might be coming back that's fine
Right? So you don't need to do anything
Just fine
Aster can help their own friends
It's also like
But ya know
It's great that you want to help Aster!
You aren't responsible for that
Not yours
Still, that's Aster's friend
We can talk to you about anything else
Yea yea
That's not your fault someone's sad ya know
You don't need to deal with this if you don't want to, alright?
I think you're doing well, Lulu (?)
Yea!!
Like pain meds and the such
Yet
Ask them if they'd had any medicine
Sick huh
Ohhh
That's Doctor time
Oh, yeah
Yeah, I feel that
*hugs*
Yeah
so valid and thanks uwu
I still need to clean more but I figured I'd start if I didnt have anything else to do
Also, I started cleaning after that lol
Pfff
Guess I'll do some cleaning
Valid
I see I see
If you wanna watch me play a game tho it'll take longer cause I need to clean
I guess I can stream drawing now in a short second if you want that?
Nice pillow
*pats*
You want your vessel to be well
It's also good for your vessel
I'm watching a video rn anyways
If you're interested yea yea
Maybe I could stream myself drawing soon? I'll be working on a comm, or maybe I could play a game...
Is there anything you'd like to do?
Yea
You're a different person
Sorry, anyways
Them*
I mean, of course you wont talk like her
Lol
I do agree that's a bit unfair
Ah
She?
You're good
Hehehe
You and Aster are safe with me
You dont need to
*pats* it's okay
Anything that keeps you up?
Yea yea
Makes sense, I sometumes get sleepy at 9 am, no need to nap
Oh, so early mostly
I'm thinking it's either really late or early
For you
Also, what time is it?
Yes, she is
*nods*
If you want I can help come up with one!
Yeah!
Do you have a name?
Lol
Makes sense! I think you're nicer then Solis
You an Alter then?
Your art is so nice Aster, I love your eyes
Although, I do agree you should sleep soon
Aster, that doesn't sound just like you, is one of your alters bullying you again?
*pats*
I wish I had the money and ability to give you better presents
Anyways, you're good at a lot of things, although I think it's understandable if you dont feel like you are
Why are your parents so sucky-
sounds like a meal for royalty
It's a lace bracelet and anklet
Yeah, that's what I've heard
Warning, It is really cold tho
Someday I wish for you to see Snow
you're an aussie
Right
Oh
Do you like Snow?
yeaaaa
but I enjoyed being out in the snow so
I had trouble finding the car on the way back cause I had shit visibility
We went to costco and like
it was snowing
I went outside today for grocery shopping
Slightly cold but good
how ya doin
Hiya Aster
*pats*
I mean, I think it's fine if you dont stop her
I see
Irl?
*pats*
good question
Yeah
hypocritical, i'd say of her
she might just not want to respond
she's so rude to you
I'd wager they're a good person.
Since Aster has kept those thoughts to themselves and doesn't willingly hurt people....
Thought crime does not exist
What happens inside is irrelevant
Aster is a good person, Solis, stop bein mean to them
rude
People with did don't necessarily always have alters come to front if I've like, understood correctly
even if she's not got a form
you can, just imagine it
I've mostly been here to help Aster stop denying it cause denying it isn't very healthy
We've got a lot of friends with did
Yeah,,
I see I see
Ah, that's valid
I dont imagine she'd do anything too bad considering your body is hers too
If you want to drag her to the front sometime I'd say go for it tho
There's a chance that she's not answering because there's not anything for her to say
Something about did that I've heard is that the personalities are sometimes, heck even most of the time, not full formed people
My thoughts don't talk back to me
Cause she's not your thoughts she's a wholeass other person
I think you're just more or less forcing her to speak, it's like if someone didnt feel like talking to you and you sorta bugged them
No matter how she was formed
Then she's not something you just made up
Can you control what she thinks?
Happen
I think she exists because either way she does sort of
JFNEKKDKD
Solis is telling you to swear
Np! uwu
If I come across a new luka song or cover I'll send it your way
So valid
Yeah,
Hello, Aster, Solis
Luka is great yes
My personal favourite song is Kaito's
They're all based off of songs
og story here
it removes a bit of her motives
Sorta
It's exactly the story of the song she's tied to
Gallerian?
Who was the judge?
lol
Nope
cause I didn't save
Solo time
Intense
s
That
GOD?
MY
OH
I personally want the Meiko...
Did you get any of the others?
So valid
I see I see
Is that your alt?
Why are there two asters
All I can say is,,, That's a weak argument
Yeah
So I ended up dragging it out
And I could Not concede on something as serious as that
I cannot See Ruby's point
Well, I understand where Bruh was coming from but I just
I'm sorry,,,,
Drawing? Or on general
Cuteeeee
So valid
!!!Looks great!
Yea
Understandable
Believe
Luka will come home
NOOO
mini roll 3 star today lets gooooooooooo
I haven't gotten any 4 stars btw
what I get today if I haven't pulled
lemme see
Sad girl Jackpot is a banger
lol
but maybe it's cause I like Picon
I like Saisei
Mafuyu gets the best songs
I don't either tbh
yup!
nomad, infinitely gray, and ai nandesu
It's accurate
No
I'm so happy for you
Nice!
I believe
You'll get her
So valid
Are you okay, Aster?
You've really got it bad.
*pats*

<@483689649727078400> <@964806731471405086> ta-da!
oki night night
Searched and found more high quality transparents of all of them
oki
Aster, Mei or Mobi?
OOO

I could make myself a mobius icon
Indeed
thank you, this will help
I know how to make things less blurry, I believe!
gL!
I could,,,, attempt,,, at making it transparent
send it
Oh, wait do we?
I'll have to look around
Hrmmm
I'll see if that can be made but we don't have any winter like ely skins or transparents....
so valid
what would you like?
Maybe I'll make one for you too
The laziness we have knows no bounds
our own hug emote looks wrong so agreed
so lazy
,,,,Man I need to make my winter icon
Omg, Mafuyu emotes
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>

oki
do you want to vc?
wb!
gl !
i wait
yay! and alright
Do you wanna draw with me?
hey aster, I'm thinking of drawing soon (finally feel well enough)
valid
yea yea
Except EN...
As well
Yeah, I think so
En should be getting evillious in not too long
Oho
Oh boyo
Fuck yeaaa
Ye, they're so much fun
For ocs
Dress up games are so much fun tho and helps me with coming up with outfits and sucj
I dont play roblox personally but there's no shame in playing any game
You should be allowed to play your roblox game!!
Marshmary is a great song yis
Yea, Close to Gray (and Nomad in the future)
Ooo
NICE
:(
Oof
Server bad?
Nooooo
That is all
Cat girl Kanade is Everything to me
Love Ka energy
YEAH
This is one of the only moments for the past few weeks that I feel Wired
Which is Rare
<------ Full of Energy
I need to sleep soon but
I need to do something too
Hmmm
So valid
Yea
So valid
I think?
Genshin...?
Discord*
Dw, it'd take surgery to keep me away from discoed
Lolol
So no digital drawin
But I wont have access to my pc
Lol
Not from discord
Since mom's also there to help look after the kids while the kids parents are doing work
I'll be staying for two nights
Yea
With my mom to her bf's house, she wants to introduce me to his family (Context my mom is Polyamorus and I've known her bf for awhile but it'll be the first time I'm meeting his kids and his wife)
When I get back
So I can draw it fully
I'll have to ask for some pencil and paper while I'm gone to sketch concepts
PURE SPITE
Spite is fueling me rn
So like,,,
Yeeee
Might even draw my own frilled sharks
I'll be theming them off of the og mv
Yea yea
Edit edit
But I'm def going hard for this
Yea yea, a lot of that depends on Editing
And have other people help with the actual Video Making portion
I can do all of the art assets
Idk how to do Video Editing but
I'M MAKING MY OWN 2DMV
JUSTICE FOR LOVE KA
And it's the wrong color
The lighting *barely changes*
The stage DOESNT MOVE ALMOST AT ALL
The Camera work is lazy
Like, the Amount of Effects on screen is mininmal
**Leo/Need gets better then this most of the time**
But Other Covers?
Like, comparing to mvs for commissioned songs isnt Fair So I wont do that
They really did *nothing* with it
Comparing it to other MV's
It's so much worse the more I look at it
Oh my god, I'm looking at Love Ka's mv again right? And
So valid
CMON LEMME HEAR KANAMIZU TOGETHER AGAIN
*Since Hitoribo Envy*
YEAH
KanaMizu havent sung together since Hitoribo Envy
I agree they sound good together but I would like to hear more KanaMizu or MizuEna or EnaKana for that matter
I do think we get too much Mizumafu in place of other pairings cause it means we sacrifice other, honestly really Good sounding pairings too
I dont Understand why people hate Mafuyu's voice in Villain
SAME
But MafuEna would def work better
I think Kanade *could* pull off Love Ka cause I've heard people go soft with it and still sound Right for the song
Yeah
Like, No Doubt, Mafu song right there
MafuEna or MafuKana
For the group It Really Should've gone to
RuiKasa
Maybeeee
Well, for wxs RuiNene or EmuNene?
WxS needed to get *Uncomfortably close* to the camera for Love Ka
It would've been better as a duo
Why is it the entire group for Love Ka???
Also also
Look at this MV and tell me WxS shouldn't have had something Similar for Love Ka
Also, Love Ka *should've* gotten the Aishite treatment
HOW DID YOU GO FROM THAT TO THIS
Like,,,, wxs your Last 3dmv was Ego Rock
THERES WAY TOO MANY FAR AWAY SHOTS
THE CAMERA ANGLES ARENT RIGHT EITHER
Even the Choreo Isnt that good
THEY DIDNT GET A SINGLE THING *RIGHT*
Look like Vita
Why does Love Ka
The point is
Right rigjt
The entire mv is blue
Vita SLAPS
Another one of this producers songs
Is Vita
This, for the record
DID THEY WATCH THE ENTIRE MV WITH INVERTED FILTER??
DID THEY MIX THIS UP FOR VITA??
SERIOUSLY
**seriously how do you mess it up this badly**
Yeah
So even when you can see them they are Backlit and blurry
The *white* and ***blue*** tv static overpowers most of the shots you can see the sharks in too
**That you can barely see and that the camera never shows in full focus**
**THE SONGS TITLE IS A PUN AND THEY ONLY HAVE 3 FRILLED SHARK DECORATIONS IN THE BACK**
RABUKA IS FRILLED SHARK
YES
She would've killed it
WHERE ARE THE FRILLED SHARK
Also for the love of god where's the Dead Fish
IT DOESNT MAKE SENSE
For a model
This is like if you made Seele's blue side red and the red side blue
***WHY IS IT BLUE???***
**It's always RED**
IT'S ALWAYS DEPICTED AS RED EVEN IF THE CHARACTER IN SHOT ISNT FOR OTHER COVERS
ABOUT THE SONG
DETAIL
EASY
SUCH A SIMPLE
**Why the fuck, is the mv Blue**
*And why the fuck is it Blue*
The Stage Doesnt Mov3
I kid you not
This is an embarrassment
Like, I guarantee I wasnt ever going to like it over the og but
I'm so upset and mad that they fucked it up this badly
Love Ka is honestly one of my favourite songs period
*I'm also really sad*
I'm *so* confused by that
Yeah
INSTEAD OF MAKING MEIKO ACTUALLY GROWL/GRAVELLY
BTW REN FOUND OUT THAT THEY JUST LAYERD MEIKO'S VOCALS OVER OG V FLOWERS
I think both Emu and Nene could've sounded so much better if they had taken a different approach
Agreed
Rui's the only one who understood the assignment
YEAB
Doesnt fix how badly they messed the actual Cover up but ya know
I have So Many complaints that I'm thinking of trying to make a 2dmv for Love Ka
SAME OPINION
Aster, have you seen the New wxs 3dmv for Love Ka?
Ankrkrkrkrkr
Yea, same tbh
Luck, I have
<:catblush:963351912235810826>
Can i be a lao too?
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
Have you tried not listening to the song?

The Solution is simply to make yourself faster
OOF
Lemme attempt it real quick-

They're scissors!
THAT MINORIIIII
TIME TO FUCKING GRIND IG
Yeah, JP's insanr
Lol
I don't either
Agreed
same with Airi most of the time
Shizuku cards tend to be underwhelming.... they don't know how to make her shine
THIS NEXT SET IS HALLOWEEN FLAVORED THO
I'm not fond of the color balancing on that card
lol
i meant on the model
I would trade with you
the alt hair is really good imo
I like the new years one
I want,,,, minori for this next event
which was one of the no1 ones I wanted but whatever
I was lucky tho, I had like,,, about 36k crystals and only missed out on getting Minori
I GOT THEM DURING THE THE KANADE COLORFES OKAY?
unsure about my others tho lol
That'll be good for me, actually, I have colorfes Honami who is happy
They're due for a happy one
judging by event types, Happy hasn't been around for a bit and the last few leoni events have been different types
I think it might be?
Actyally
LOL
at least we got a title and the character we wanted
*high fives in tiering top 10k on an event we were aiming higher on for but had real life steal that from us*
but yeah, tiering on jp is harder either way
so it was to be expectef
this was during when my hernia was acting up so badly and during when I didn't know what it was
I was so sick that I missed my goal
I VERY VERY BARELY MISSED TOP 5K LOL
barely top 7k actually
wait now
The highest I've tiered on a JP event was top 10k, technically top 8k but
Yeah
Oh my god I'm so sorry
DAMN
lol
I've tiered top 4k in two events on en now
so valid
Well, that should be helpful
I HAVE COLORFES SHIHO LOL
OH
I think,,,, I should have stuff for this?
there's a reliable leaker that tells us the schedule for the next month
When the events over probably
*screams*
Oh *fuck* this is a Kanade event
Ena or Kanade event?
This is annnnn
By event rotation...

*pats* I'd trade you mine for the akito or miku
Understandable
Ahhhh
Ahhh, is there anything I could do to maybe help? Is there any part in particular that looks off to you?
Is there particular reason why?
<@964806731471405086> do you need help with the commission?
*pats*
I see
Ah
You could've sparked
If you could get 33 more pulls
Which if you had 10 vouchers
You'd be at 157 stickers
Shouldn't have converted all of those vouchers
You
I see,,,
Have you put any of those into wish pieces or vouchers?
Is what I mean
How many stickers do you have?
How many pulls have you done?
Nooo
Yeah
So valid
Its because some people and characters would try to expose the killer way too early
So that's intentional
Before triao
Yeah, most of the time we dont want you to figure out everything like
To be fair, trials of old bodr drop happened on the same day as trial
Yeah,
Valid
Lol
Although its a discord breakish
Murder *should've* happened on tuesday? Idk, i've been taking a break from mostly those servers

ALSO HI ASTER
Or did you say alrwadu
<@309634550273933314> when you log on can you tell me how many crystals you got from the new rank system
Oh *shit*
I might be actually Able to Spark
Wait now that I've been boosted this much...
I now have 20k crystals for Anni just before the Anni lol
I GOT 16K AS WELLL FUCK
the new cards aren't out yet tho right?
I'M DOWNLOADING RN
OH SHIT
YES
:(
Yeah, that should be fine
:(
Yeah
Small amounts of blood is to be expected
Okay
Is it Bleeding Heavily still?
Hrmmm
Ah
*Please try to contact someone*
That might be bad
Hmm
Ahhh
My tooth sockets didnt stop bleeding until 1 hour later
Wisdom?
What teeth did you get removed?
Your blood is supposed to Clot
Hmm
Are you picking at it/are you moving a lot?
:(
How are you feelin Aster?
either way,,, I hope to get something out of this fes
i can only dream...
yea
If not a solid 7k is what it's looking like for me
The new ranking system gives back a ton of crystals
If like
I'll have maybe almost 9k?
Valid Aster
OMG SO PRETTY
I need to play splatoon 3 anyways
yea yea
And EndMark is just Too Fast
Note Vomit
EmpErroR starts easy and then just becomes...
YEAH LIKE JESUS CHRIST
I FLAIL TOWARDS THE ENDING OF DON'T FIGHT THE MUSIC
I.... am rusty
I shoiuld pick machine girl
Oh random
lets goooo;]'
38954
it's oki
let's do a coop room
I'll play with you aster
YEAH
THE MASTER IS AN ACTUAL NIGHTMARE
THIS IS ONLY THE SECOND HARDEST VERSION OF IT
KOMUHIBUGTVFRTBYUHIO
something about it....
This is one of my favourite Beat Maps/Charts in the game
I can post it right here
I can fc some masters but damn it's been a bit since I've properly played
since you wouldn't be using them for gacha
you could use your crystals on stamina lol
I mean, if you want to reach there fast
but that does req some lvling
get gud ig
for accuracy
you're competing against someone directly
yes
IT'S 1V1 THO
KEILO, THERE IS ONE THING
RIGHT
I FORGOT ABOUT THAT MODE
FUCK
OH
after that
I needed a very big break
I think Prsk has them too but they're in person rather then in the game
and accuracy is the thing they test there
they hold tournaments every now and then
there is but it's like, an occasional thing
ah wait
iirc there might be one in bandori?
There's only one leaderboard in prsk and that's for events
Yeah
There is one for Love Live?
That is the harsh reality here, I'm afraid.
But don't try to tier if you intend to not treat it like a gacha game
So, you *can* get good at the songs
with a *good* event team
the entire week
I am saying this because I have tiered in the top 4000 before on EN, which is less competitive and it took up 8 hours of my day
You Will Not be able to tier without those, at the very least
Because you can get 2 cards per playing in an event
From events
Wait until you earn cards
Or at least
You cannot get a good tier if you don't have any cards
I'm saying this for your sake, Keilo, give up on tiering if you're not going to pull
gonna tier?
but you're?
a
Google play doesn't allow you to spend money on other countries games anymore
you can't even spend money on this version
Keilo, just pull in the gacha, you won't get addicted
You Will Get Carpal Tunnel
You would have to play 24 hours a day
You cannot t100 in jp with no cards, much less no event cards
So, Keilo
GL
which is more comptetive and time consuming
And you'd be doing in in JP
Tiering for t100 in Project Sekai requires 10 hours straight playing every day *with the four stars and good card bonus for event point*
That's literally Impossible
No
There's events for that
Getting Good
So Tiering in Project Sekai is
they're for score and collection purposes
Unlike In honkai to tier you don't really Need Good Cards and such
But still
and reward getting good
Also, some of the cards help with getting good
And FC the 34 masters
unless you can Get Really Good
If you don't plan on gacha
Also useless
,,,True, but higher Combo is
If you want an actual Miku rhythm game then play Project Diva
There's more to the game other then that
That's just part 1 of it
HAHAHAHAHAHA
HAHAHA
But
Ye, because team bonuses don't mean as much as area item upgrade
Aster just likes to do a little bit of trolling
still need to gacha
But
You *can* make a team that will hit score S with Minimal gacha
Lol
Actually
No
well
you will have the worst time my friend
but not using tickets is just completely wasteful
but crystals? it's totally fine to not use
it's because it's a separate banner
for them
there's an expiration date
please use gacha tickets when you get them, you can't save those
Hello aster
THERE;S ONLY 3D
THEY AREN'T 2D MODELS BABAN
you can save the crystals you get tho
theoretically it's possible but I would not recommend at least not using the gacha tickets from anniversary
Or unless you buy them
You don;t get outfits unless they're a 4 star in prsk <3
Welfare cards....
As important in prsk
Cards aren't
Well
will be A great boost to your account
the 50 kakera pieces per day and then the fuckload of free pulls
Keilo, this is a great time to start playing tho
this gacha was released oct 30th
it could be they opened availability to global for when the gacha is released too
maybe closer to halloween?
it;s not been released in album form probably
Oh wait, I know why now
Ahhh
I believe that would be jp only
yeah
Ye
It might be?
I was right
Yes, it is Lower
ig it's time to head to jp
I'm probably wrong but-
Lower?
That's.....
maybe not specifically Settings but
it should be somewhere in the menu yeah
alrighto
if you have the space for it I can sorta guide you
It's semi hidden in the settings because it doesn't recommend you do that but
Actually
You can download everything
Gacha!
Tell us what you get, Keilo
FUCK YEA
One of my friends plays on pc
There's a setup
You can
The × is gone from the announcement???
Why is everyone thinking that btw
But
Idk if wxs will break up proper bir
frankly
The beatmap might be Hard AF but the song slaps
Personally, my favorite from them it EmpErroR
A classic too
Sasakure.uk is a pretty good producer

And I was saying the set that got cancelled on en was more controversial
True yeah
no, the tsukasa in that set is a 3 star
I think the one that got cancelled is

HEY TET DO YOU WANT TO HELP-
Master AP 3 times....
Oh damn

yeah, you have pretty much all of the cards from this event
I regret sleeping...
Same
YEA THE ANOVOCA CARDS ARE NOW WAY TOO EXPENSIVE
like, enough for 30 more songs,
you have enough cards to buy all of the songs in shop and have plenty left over, aster
LIKE THEY WEREN'T BEFORE? WHAT THE FUCK
OH THANK GOD I NEED MORE OF THOSE
I think they probably increased the amount to like, 20 or 50 to complete a mission
THAT A HUGE AMOUNT???
KMJNIHUBGVYUHNI,;LKMJNIHUB
I see I see
Oho?
So, I don't think I can read all of that with my current jp skill level
Probably!

Enstars fan
I dont think so? Maybe but
If you're on tumblr you know what I'm talking about
This video next to that one porn sound clip where a guy cumming genuinely sounds like hes being brutually murdered
He sounds like hes gettinf railed
lol
lol
you love hannibal and that case mightve inspired some things about hannibal
like google chrome stalks you way more and i hate it
not as much as chrome
also yeah firefoxs adblock is amazing
google chrome stalks you and i hate it
i also use firefox
no
cherry can be krampus (that guy eats children right?)
idk i think cherry likes eating kids
lol
vinegary flavors are weird
i hate spicy and sour
actually i like both bitter and sweet things
for the record i prefer really sweet things because my tastebuds are weird well
i have eating issues soooo
this is why cherries the fucking hannibal fan here
its good
you should
also chocolate milk but lol
i'm much more into tea and soda
i just honestly dont rlly drink coffee, i try but it's not really my thing
too much and it becomes unbearable
YEAH
LOL
i dont like ginger either, i like cinnamon but like in very certain quantities
we are in the habit of not thinking huh
yeah
LOL
Oh right
like i'm not surprised its just
yeah
i think i am dumb
i have no idea, i knew you didnt live in an english speaking country but i had also literally never seen you speak another language
You know, somehow it's slipped my mind that you would be bilingual tet
dead *ass*?
what
That's a new one.
Yeah
That's the most unfunniest white supremacist meme I've ever seen
Oooo?
*nods*
I see
I'm so confused.
What's going on
What happened
tbh, unless it's voices i don't really mix people up
yeahhh
EVEN RIRI DOESN'T HAVE ANY WORDS
??????????
Love cats
~~Also, just a lil poke to look at my channel mayhaps, ~~
living the life of a king
indeed
actually
That fur looks really silky
SO CUTE
OMG
adorable
if none that's fine
Pictures?
They are in fact goals
RIRI
Heki,,,,
Baban also has memory
unlike other people
I have memory
I'm not
tbh, you could just use discords search function to prove it
Yeah, Heki talks about being indian doesn't she?
idk what to cosplay anymore, my body is feminine and i'm also fat so </3
Dorothy vry pretty
she fits your vibe yea
ooo
LOL
/j
I think you should cosplay them all
I'll have to get a better canvas up for it soon tho yeah
i see I see
it's hard to want to draw these days, if I could draw faster maybe I'd draw more
ig I'll try
anyways,,,
lol
*nods*
Ooooo
idk how to explain it
Just,,, dynamic poses that look not forced ig?
I wanna get better at the flashy natural posing you do tho,,,
,,,thank you
I mean,,,, I suppose you're right, that's a stand out piece I've done
Ohhhh, i see I see
i mean that's all I really do too
Idk about that
Ehhh
tho
even your doodles are better then what i put my entire being into
holy shit
Tet, you're a god
it might be sfw in content but it's not in intent
lol
Sagiri?
It's okay,
Why
LOL
I will however help with the baking
I will not consume any due to the unique body chemistry makes any kind of sensation like that triggering bad responses
That's impressive
Not surprising but
?
Baban smart,m
Oh dang
Aster didn't wanna put up with Boo;s antics ig-
Right, you guys are insane, i forget that sometimes
Ah
what.
genuinely
what
What the FUCK
Borger
I mean, the report is only good for medical records
*pats*
:(
<:ichikaconfused:1089112603307024505>
?????
What the fuck
Good lord
Yes
Heki isn't smart <3
You shoiuld already know
Intelligence
Heki's
You're questioning
Baban
I have no idea.
Just a drop in the bucket <3
I already can no longer draw or watch things or read new things anymore, what's another thing?
Sounds fun <3
I cannot wait for the day that I've successfully cut off all emotions. I'll be free and happy
It's fun, repressing and cutting out my feelings cause no one wants me
I can relate to the both of you!
But other then that idk what else it does
The Report is useful for medical records? I think.
If something bad happens then I'll just kill myself. Nothing bad is happening rn tho so it's fine. That bridge will be crossed when it happens.
I have something similar but it's uhhh more like
That's valid, Cherry
I've never believed I've ever been normal y'all say I'm normal here but in class I've always been the strange one
*pats*
There's a lot wrong
I need to go back to the psychologist myself cause
I think I had one done that explains that I'm autistic and adhd?
It's like,,, A report of all of the things wrong
Then again, maybe my perspective is warped <3
but like, the rest of you are decently normal
Heki isn't
I think most of y'all are normal? well
Indeed
Although every now and then how actually fucked up I am pops up and jumpscares people
But I do agreed that I am normal when other people talk to me
My self hatred is on another level that is hard to explain
Which is funny, cause I'm very Not Normal but my mental illness makes me kind and shit to everyone else
I hope I've been an okay influence here cause I genuinely wish the best for Aster
Aster is a very responsible and good kid who's always trying their best
if I didn't know any better
Tbh, I'd have guessed Aster was like 15?
They need actual therapy
I think Crystal's got too many issues to really be in with groups
Like, it's pretty obvious to me that you're a young teen
Ig but you're pretty baby imho
and stuff
For woes
I mean, unless you have that kind of bond with someone and you both benefit, you go to an older person
Yeah
How old is Crystal
Crystal: I have no one to talk to!
Aster: I am RIGHT fucking HERE
Do you not fucking exist to him?
and you are being genuine and trying your best
Like, even without context, that reads as out of line on his part
Your answer was perfectly fine?
I don't think they would've replied no matter what you said
It sounds that they were sarcastic and being rude beforehand
Yeah
Right right
You're not in charge of their well being
That's emotionally fucked
different topic
Aster, are you sure you want to be reading thi- ohhhh
Thank you Babannnn
RIGHT???
I am confident that I can get something constructed bigger then that
LMAO??
Oh is Cherry a minor-
I'll sc my reaction
hold on
ljnibhgvuyfubhnokm
Oops<3
Oh
I am ready to see the most pathetic loser.
LOL
in dms
I assume
The image
Okay
Funnily enough. I could get a bigger dick then that if I went through bottom surgery
I am curious.
Maybe.
I wonder if that's weird
Or looked for irl nudes or porn
I've never gone on rule34
Ya know
Lkgrvkfedwsq
Yassssssss
*high fives Cherry*

You aint doing shit with 2 inches
My guy, at that point you're the dedicated bottom of any relationship
# 2 FUCKING INCHES????
I see

Dang
I might be curious now.

Nyaruhodo
Why do y'all hate Shigure Kira so much
D4DJ YESSS
YIKES
Okay
OH
Wait what happened
Whoa what
very rocky
most beaches around here look like this
Idk if this image shows it well but
beautiful!
white/yellow sand yea
oooo
we have mostly grey sand beaches in my area? or it might be all grey sand
a lot of shells?
ooo
granted, it's basically all rocky beaches around here
You went to a less rocky beach then I did for sure
i'm a bit tired but I went to the beach today
That's a different language, how are you doing tet
FUCK
I forget to eat
Depends on the brand of mentall ill
KJMINHIJMKOL,;.'
better but I'm not a switch
Oho
this is a lie
send.
oho?
Yes
we're doing the thing that conservatives are afraid of, turning people trans (for the record, this is a joke)
meanwhile ultrasound is using sound waves iirc
x-ray's use radiation and can't really see into organs
just cause you're seeing into the body doesn't mean it's the same
it's not
OH MY GOD?
valid
Oh ic
Or Amana
Lol
Rinze?
what do you think?
Amana Osaki  maybe?
wouldn't there have been a better pick for Ai?
but hm
I like Rinze
WHERE DID YOU FIND THIS INFO
SHOW SHOW
WHERES RHE PROMO IMAGES
OH MY GOD??
I've heard about this
Yeah I uhm
IOUY8NHIJMOL;.'';LKMINJHUIJMKO,L

I wish that had happened to me </3
You've got this
This would make Vill-V Judas
Oh dear
PFFF
I need to draw mine too and figure out a name-
porble gueye
calculus?
what are you guys on about
*eats him*
Akito cube
rip baban
It's Kanade
Also card wise,,,, Only 2 events have been Kanade focus.
Like,,,, also,,,, I dont think the song particularly focuses on Kanade for that one
That's not an event song tho
It's Most likely Kanade, I will scream if they don't do Kanade
Kanade's on her 3rd
True but like,,,, This would be mafu4, and every other character would be their 4th too
Yeah, we haven't had a Kanade focus event since Tricolge
True but I think we're on schedule for a Kanade event
that told us lol
Oh no, it's the leaks
Not Mafuyu
lol
It's a Kana focus event
Fuck Transphobes!
Nice!
You've lost yourself
Ohhh Tet
Idk I dont follow what they do ever
Some kind of drug
LOL
Two steps back
One step forward
They're always taking
It's like
Mihoyo... my enemy </3
*sighs*
Yeah!!!
I wish it had been a tree branch
Yiu know?
Tbh
A Tree
I wish it was,,,,, Like
*sighs*
Yeah
I mean, Japan's pretty much okay with that kind of stuff
True
Right?
Rather then making the Culture sexy
Sexy from that culture
To make it
Do research
If they Want to make things sexy then like
I would just make things that are at least kore respectful
I wish I was Better at research and design cause like
Yeah
They just like How it Looks
It's like the weebs who try to write a japanese school setting, they dont really know what its like
They don't Really see the Middle east as it's own culture
To the stereotypes
Tied
So
It's not like they dont do research, they're just
Agreed
Yeah
OOO
NOO
WHAT
*eats your art*
I think you should let him not have the role
Who?
On
WHAT DA HELL!!
SO GOOD
OS
TET YOUR ART
is that....
Or
I think you'll be buried by Bayonetta
lolol
no
NICE TET
Unless we consider me finally admitting that he/him pronouns are sexy
I don't have any L's or W's,,,
misogyny too...
It's okay Eli...
or like,,,, sleeping
I'm just drawing
.....God you're mostly right
And I don't exist
I need to exercise
masa :o
It implies that they're going to do it a lot I think
*high fives Eli*
Maybe it's cause I hate how english sounds
I think I'm one of the only ones that never plays with en dub
I see I see
Jealous.... She's got Kana Hanazawa's va....
Yea
I will say, The periods happening or not depends on other factors too, I dont have periods because I'm on birth control which stops them from happening in the first place
Usually it's 2nd month, sometimes 3rd
Or get an abortion that fast
What Cherry said is mostly right but Most women dont realize they're pregnant that fast either lol
Scarlet?
S-
No Words.
I have No Idea how to respond
I can watch you play while I eat
I remember being interested but I wasn't annoyed lol
I keep misreading this channel as Teto Territory....
my god
Oh
technically not this years-
Somehow This Feels More horny then NU:Carnivale
Oh okay
I must Save For Ayla
for sure
Hak is horny for Nilou
huh
Horny
Y'all are
dang....
wait that went out of service?
Ohhhh
Oh, which game?
I think the Saki is Love Live...?
ah yes, using different games
It's not like that would be hard
I mean, I could just make an eu account
Awww
Mayhaps soon...
I think I'm getting more phone storage for christmas so
Again,,,
I must,,,, downloas this game, ,,
*I COULD PLAY AS BRS?????*
BLACK ROCK SHOOTRT????
Need more phone space
I wish I could play pgr again,,,,
This stuff looks cool
I am awake
AYLA
!!! true
I mean, I have a mine, it's not really a house
LOL
*nods*
lol, how are you accepting comms again
<--- me when i'm thinking about it again because i like lyri's art
commissioning lyri huh...
considering thats a bit off topic
drawing id assume
Keilao art? 👀
i've seen in a hot second
of panels
the funniest layout
That is
OH
the name does not point to that being a thing
smut in it LOL
ngl i didnt think there would be
jomvmkkmkmLKMLK,M;LKM;L;????
Hmmm,,,
*nods*
*nods*
romance is def one but like,,,, something slice of life or something iyashikei
i dont read many stuff with a lot of fighty fight scenes
Idk if I have the Bandwidth for a shounen
*pokes* Either of you, gimme a recommendation i am sad and bored and idk what to read
hes insane huh
people be normal challenge
my god
yeyeye
they cant just hand it over
i mean that's their baby
I get it tbh
i'm personally just a nosy guy
just fucking finish it ig lol
i think most authors would either let something be unfinished or like
this was more phrased as an how i would
well yeah for togashi indeed
and tbh, if i did ever decide i wanted to return to it? i could just do it still
hmmm i mean i suppose that's probably the fact that if i was truly not planning on finishing it then i either don't really care about it any more or that i just think it'd be too much of an hassle
and as a fan i just love anything i can chew on
because i wouldn't mind if my fans decided to finish it themselves or something
i wouldnt give everything i had away but like i'd say smth like The ending was going to have blank, blank, and blank, and it was going to be happy/sad/bittersweet
if i wasnt planning on finishing something i'd at least release something and explain what i was going to do for the ending
both?
granted,,,, thats definitely just me ig
Just like a written statement
well I'm not imagining like them drawing it or anything
hmmm
the anime
although netjuu i feel like had a semi conclusive ending? in a way
and like ig the ending
true but as a fan I'd just like to know what was going to happen
if they wanted
well,,, i mean i also wish that they could tell the fans so that the fans could do it
But yeah i agree with ruby
The reason i say that is because I am bad at just doing combat on the fly like that
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Meanwhile I am going to need to come up with a magic system to even conceptulize my characters fighting even
The magic is a bit whimsical so
Should be fine
I think its cause its a Japanese author trying to explore irish folklore/culture which means they arent stringing everything together cleanly due to needing to translate most of it
Yeah,,,,,
And considering the anime s2 has content I've never read,,,
I think it's a bit long tho, I thought I had finished it when I had stopped reading
It's good! But like,,,, I can only say what I've read of it
~~ive read quite a bit of it, i'm not caught up tho idt~~
I am trying!!!
LOL
It *is* unfair
Actually yeah
Maybe if I had confidence I wouldn't hate myself as much as I do <3
LOLOL
He would've <3
Yes!
LOL
Hmmm, I wonder if a certain man might've gone that to his past girlfriends
And constantly disagreeing with what she has to say
Example! Telling a Lesbian who knows what she's talking about when it comes to her own identity that she's wrong
It's likely that you were also a key player in being an asshole to them causing them to rethink you because of behavior you left unchecked
I mean it's not really a coincidence if you keep getting dumped by women and you come out of it thinking the entirety of women suck because you got hurt,,,,
LOL
yeah which makes it a bit more pathetic but seeing how he's treated you uhhh perhaps it might be that women dont like you because you are an asshole
Cishet men go die challenge
But woooooow
was still kinda
it
tho
That was On Topic
I
What
Ohhh good ol' misogyny
like doomer how
Oh dear
i mean yeah but wanna expand on that?
is sad
oh that
HFJFJFJFJFJC
It's a manhua
It's got amazing characters tho dw
YEAH
Oh if you want something with good art might I recommend heaven official's blessing? <--- I am so normal about this series
YEAH
I want more series drawn by that artist
goes crazy tho
'S art
i think vdtd
validdd
Oh that one for the second one, I remember dropping it or maybe I just remember reading it when it had like 20 chapters and I never picked it up again
PENELOPE LETS GOOOO
I think Ik which ones youre talking about but
so I can figure out which ones you're reading
Protag names and hair color
WAIT WAIT
LOL
I also use the same bodywash as my father and it does nice things for my skin
Yeahhh
God
So many logical leaps
Yeah kt guy is stupid
I am not the best at following conversations these days
Ok ok good I got lost rq
Wait who are we clowning on here
Yeah,,,,,,,,
Thinking.
Is that replier
What
there's a lot to it yeah
My god.

So the plot of the game is things are flowing backwards in time huh
Lets goo
this game is not wanting to install man
oh cool
Oh
As for me I'll get pickles if I can
I think lyri just doesnt like dogs that much
Oki
Pickles?
What units do I want? Toothfairy?
I'll look into it then
Do you recommend I play it? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
What game are you guys playinf
Just more masc
I think I will still sound nice when singing tho!!
I wonder how my voice will change with t,,,
Ive def got a fem voice tho,,,
Yesyes
Do it do it do it
Yes yes
Any and all mistakes blame on it being almost 4 am
Help me
Ending
I barely remembered the fucking
I do remember some of peachy key
Hmmm
Lemme see if I can remember it
And i cant bleep myself out like that
I would sing along to whatevers in my head but currently thats magical girls and chocolate
Valid
As for me,,, idk what to sing to show off how my voice sounds LOL
I hope that makes you happy
Very cutesy and soft
You have an Emu/Minori type voice
Its not that low!! But you do sound vry uhh
Vibrates in your head
When you speak
Tbf,,, your voice will always sound different to you when played back because your voice
Indeed
Generally my voice tends to sound higher in recordings then I'm used to hearing so that always fucks with me
I mean you can train your voice to go higher if you dont like your current range
Sof like blanket
I like your voice!! From what I remember about it
*nods*
Are you wondering where my dysphoria comes from or do you not like your own voice?
My natural talking voice idm
I dont mind it changing because i could probably always still sing fem because thats just a thing my vocal chords will remember
For the most part yeah!
No but the funniest part wss that apparently an entire server of poc and they thought everyone but the white person was white
The 30 bit was something i knew beforehand tho and cleared up a long time ago
But actually I think they still thoufht I mightve been cis male afrer that too
When we vc'd they were surprised that my voice sounded the way it did
I'm still dying at the Cis part,
Yea
**WHEEZE**
You know I do get it slightly, I tend to exist in spaces where I'm the only white but like Like
I'm Just fucking *wheezes*
Yea
This
I DONT EVEN KNOW ANY SPANISH
SOMEONE THOUGHT I WAS HISPANIC
LYRI!!
LIKE THE ROLE READS HEKI
Cause thats not good no sir
But not like be in genuine pain
I like it when people cry beneath me
Yeah LOL
I have frequently stated that I'm a top,,,,
I mean
No shit?
Probably gay
Gotta love tho that like
NFJJFJDJDD
This person is so fuckin funny and dumb.
Its okay, ik I'm not an omega so it doesnt effect me
I started fucking wheezing
They thought California was in Canada
ANOTHER HIGHLIGHT FROM THIS PERSON
ACTUALLY
That was so fucking funny
The omega thing is wrong too because even if i was born an omega i'd medicially transition
Oh And Also apparently fucking **30**
Mt favorite thing tho was thinking im cis
Like they went on and on and someone kept pointing out Hey, that literallt just sounds like Chrom
At least appearance wise
Me
Anyways,,, they literallt thought my bestie of 6 years was in fact
If you didnt guess me well
Guess whos the only white person in that server
Guess
Except me
Was white
And they thoufht literallt everyone else
They themselves are poc
SAME NGL
It gets Better
- not white, most likely spanish
- probably gay
- finished college
- type to make art
- most likely male at birth
- omega
- early 30’s
And this was the list they gave me
Particularly this one person likes headcanoning peopke they meet ig, essentially they make a lot of assumptions and guesses about people they meet
We were talking about assumptions
Well like
Now
One person who I've been friends with for like 6 years no
So in another server with new friends that I didnt know well particularly yet except like
Ok oky
<@483689649727078400> <@309634550273933314> you two are
Whos online
Wanna hear something funny
Hey hey guys
oh dear
*pats* You are insane, it's okay
I guess y'all,,,, both do and dont dm a lot of people?
Its me!!
its so sad
man, y'all never get to see my icon changes and layouts because I've kept herta
LOL
happy happy candy many many money
but shhh
,,,,and probably also Shanti
purely because of how many times I listened to Gehenna
and then fucking,,, wotaku was no.5
makes sense right?
you know,,,, pinnchiop was my no. 1 artist this year
🔥🔥
Its also one of my depression listens
Villain is like every trans persons anthem
So valid, I havent heard it yet
Also Non-Breath Oblige!!!
I SEE CHOGAKUSEI
SAMESIES
ROKI ROKI ROLL
I love Shoujo Rei
Ooo
IKITEITAIYO

GOOD
And my only recommendation
Thats my top song
Listen to Gehenna
*nods*
You have tastr
YES
I THOUGHT IDOL LOOKED FAMILAR
I only recognize two songs on this and my japanese fails me, what are songs 1 2 and 4
ANOTHER DECO*27 LETS GOOOO
niiiiiice
i dont get youtube ads
so
I have youtube prem thanks to my parents
SAMEEE
i dont think
i havent listened to a single taylor song this year
i dont like every deco song but they do have a lot of bangers for me
fuck spotify letssss goooo
HIGH FIVE IN DECO27
🤝 YT music as well
sure thing
can i transfer mine out, i want a flat chest
Just cause it's solid doesnt mean it's good
Someone should check hell
Heki has a good relationship?
Omg
I also miss it
I was asleep and im slightly busy now
night night tet
ngl i think i have issues with isolating myself and not having like fav artists is apart of that i think
i rarely followed artists and the like
she is indeed
thats sweet!!
yeahhh
i miss actual communities too. not like i was ever brave enough to really join them back then but you know
sometimes i feel like my past is as convoluted as fnaf lore
like i could come up with theories but i have no way of confirming them
i have actually no idea where i learned to and why i started to repress all of my memories and feelings
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
cause if i admit it then i have to do something about it and doing something about it is hard
does not.
nope.
this works perfectly and doesnt cause me years later to realize i'm trans masc and then cause worse moments of gender dysphoria
because no <3
i also continue to do this thing called i'm not going to think about or process that
somehow
i did that to myself
oh!!! that's difference tho
no but seriously, i know i want a romantic relationship even if i don't feel it
a bunch of mafuyu kinnies talking about romance and platonic feelings lmao we're so not getting it
Yea.....
i dont want to be the person who loves me most that's gross
idk if i also have ever felt romantic feelings because i genuinely cant feel most of my feelings
i want to be special
i just crave someone who wants me and someone who will put me first
as for me?
imho
you *should* be besties with your romantic partners
tbf
i mean, in a way tet, your love might be longer lasting because its harder to fall out with someone you consider a friend
*pats*
even if you dont feel it like youre supposed to you clearly have a kind of love there
you talk about him a lot and all that jazz
besides, you clearly love him in your own way
as long as you both understand and feel your relationship and are getting out of it what you want
it doesn't really matter what your feelings exactly classify as
even if your feelings are mostly platonic as long as you're committed?
i mean, you can give romantic people what they crave while not exactly craving that kind of stuff
lol
i suppose there shouldnt be but i am literally the most self hating person i know
✨
which is why i am currently dating an oc i made!
like it feels wrong to think of them like that because they might not feel the same way and so i stop myself from feeling or thinking
like that
cause. and this is the mental illness speaking, it feels wrong to imagine stuff like that with another person without their consent or something
cause i know i want a romantic connection but i am also the kind of person to not allow myself to feel it unless the other person has it first
i think i will fall in love with the first person to develop actual intense feelings for me
but thats just my piece on it
i think thats a form of attraction in itself and is kinda yea
well i mean that might just be the ace part speaking
it's kinda a mixed ball
tru
that's also an option
you feel it more readily then others
inversely
you guys either havent felt romantic attraction or
I think potentially
honestly so valid
for mdzs
writing a haunted house fic
Am currently
i
i'm not that strong
i cant write x reader
They always speedrun shit
I love wattpad fics because they always move like
ONOKNokmokmkmomkvr
PHRASING I,
THAT
What
AH
rita could write better dialogue
none of those characters feel natural
or like
Oh my god that is written like a robot
Make a trans man fucking the top for once. WE ARENT FUCKING WOMEN
Like Come on,,,, trans men aren't always bottoms and also they arent always uwu soft beans PLEASE
YEAH
No.
LOL
oh you just wanted to make this gay but also straight cause the way trans men are used in fics gives me dysphoria
and for fics sometimes i feel like
but i'll see a trans hc and sometimes i'm like i understand where you're coming from but like,,,, this character being cis is unfortunately a big part of why this character works
it's cool to not but it it's the only trans hc that feels congruent with the themes and coding the character actually fucking has
They do actually have Weight there
If you look at it
i do like transmasc mafuyu but only because there's actually a ton of Meta and Canonical coding for mafuyu
i dislike crack ships most of the time for this reason
i think when it comes to hc's im picky cause they have to feel aligned with canon
LOL
kanade and mafuyu both have other ships
i think kanamafu as a ship isn't great but like,,, they are wonderful friends but like
ngl
I think I'm actually way pickier when it comes to ships then i've ever thought
i don't like any straight ship in proseka gomen but i think akikoha are good friends
lol
she was forgot
Yeah poor An's kinda,,,
but akian feel like they straight up dont care/barely like each other
kohane and toya are allowed to have a personal connection
The way Akian straight up does not have chemistry
didnt mix it well at all
they
not only was it not anhane which would've sounded better
I'M MAD I'LL NEVER GET A FULL VERSION
IS SO GOOD.
AKITO AND KOHANE'S MELTDOWN
that and Meltdown WHCH ISNT IN FUCKING GAME AND IT'S A CRIME
Shanti might be my personal fav vbs cover
brg is gold
those shine.
Now l/n covers?
personally i just think peaky peaky and teratera are the only ones i listen to
poor l/n still only gets good songs once in a blue moon tho
god now vbs is close behind
they're still no.1 for me but
Theater singlehandedly tanked nightcords song value
Mafuyu was done so dirty
From straight up one of the best songs to come out of this game to one of the Worst
How does one go from Bug to Theater
like Samza's was
the mv isn't even cool
that it was better
I really wished
It's Just Boring
But Theater's Not Even emotional SOUNDING
Saisei LITERALLY IS ONE OF MY FAVS
Like It's fine if they wanted a slow paced song!!
Theater as a song is sooooooo mid
Yeah Mafu's next comm needs to be a banger because all of her other comms were and then Theater came out
Good
OH
that hasnt been released
there's another comm yea
lolol
I havent heard preview either
I DID
but it's a good song!
I just think it's over used in the vbs story
idk much about the vbs version but
Give Shunran a listen
ALSO
SHUNRAN
who sung it
any descriptors
?
oh
Kamippoi na
Otome Kaibou good
Otome Kaibou?
lol
I'd say Meltdown but the vbs archives version isnt in FUCKING GAME
Darling Dance yes
BUG \
AND CINEMA
in game ghost city tokyo
ok okok
LOL
ohhhhh in game?
wave by niki maybe
*pats*
<:TeriGun:973793149992435752>
*Catch up*
<@781539392039682058> You watch tgcf? 👀
ALSO I SAW HUA CHENG
Maybe
Uhhh
That sounds good yeah
Ohhhh!!
And if shes good for dot then I can pull her for my kafka
I could use more supports
Well thats valid the reason why I asked is because
Ruan Mei is for dot characters?
Yes
*damn* that *is* spoiling
rest in peace then
Yeah,,,,,,
It's what I've done to cope ☆ (I've had the worst luck with relationships)
Just make an oc or become devoted to a fictional character enough that dating a real person feels like cheating
I'll tell you how to get over it
Lisfen
*pats Fen*
hated it
whenever i was forced to sit somewhere different i also
youre so valid no no i get it
i only changed when i felt like the place fucking sucked now
i did the same
ngl valid
i am also territorial
Yeah same
oHhhh
Well I understand!
*pats*
It's normal for people with autism and honestly yes it is normal
USA is strict to those with mental disorders too
Idk if Canada is one of those countries but it might
Or actually you cant even go to New Zealand if you have autism iirc
For example New Zealand or Austraila will accept new citizenship from those with it
yeah
Or rather it can
And getting a proper diagnosis will actively harm your attempts to leave the country if you want to
The psychologist and I say so
You have autism.
Listen,,,, I try to get myself to cry and I cant when i feel upset
I think I ruined my emotions somehow
I end up laughing at fucked up sad stuff sometimes
I'm a tough nut to crack
I'm so sorry
LOLOL
I LOVED IT
IT WAS GOOD
Oh btw Heki I read the kavethem thing you sent
Jesus tho
LKJNLKNLTGLKTGG
I am so glad that i keep my stuff private
FUCKING WHAT

KMKBBTMKB,;BTL;T
*nukes them*
LOL
Heki

I should never be a health teacher
,,,,,
It's
The reason Heki's friend called it the bean is cause
The clit is the enlarged area outside the vagina.
So.

Please ex[plain
Heki

you don't know what

,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ngl I would also start laughing
Like
Tbf, penises are funny
BAD
NO
N KJ JKKJBLKMBLKBT
FUCK
WHAT
I will not
I feel,,, bad for letting lyri know these things. it's just education but man...
You do not need to understand.
dysphoria and not being a bottom
tbh I also don't physically understand either but that's due to the
*pats* and you never have to
I mean ig yeah,,, same but like jesus,
njnnjthghth6t
HEKI
The thoughts of a lesbian
idc if the gay men in your stories are pretty and gay men are pretty. they are not for you
Women do not want to be with gay men pls
I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU
WOMEN NOOOO
MY GOD
I don't want em
The only problem is my tits
*hm*
I mean.
,,,,,
Now I just need a community where other males hang around
i trust them.
I'd let the Fujoshi's decide on my partner and relationship
JBNJLKJBNLKLKBNBTR
LOL
My sibling is insane as well,,,,,,
My parents are not the typical parents ig
Both of them are gamers, old school gamers
Like they worked customer service
My mom and dad met at Nintendo
Okay like
We are all neurodivergent.
btw, Wanna hear something crazy. I think my dad is confused about me wanting to be a guy because he's genderfluid and wishes he could have the female body i have, also i think it's partially him not liking other men.
It is!
Yes
I got lucky, I'd say
*pats*
which is why i'm out to my mom and dad ghmkhtnmhth
So like,,,, queerness is pretty much normal in my household
I helped him with his kids (he is also married and poly, i've met his wife, she seemed cool)
Have actually been to her boyfriend's house
I
LOL
lol
She's still married to my dad?
My mom is in 2 committed long term relationships
we've talked about marriage but nothing beyond like dresses and such
lol
talk
we've never had the when you find a husband
Well for me my mom is poly and dates like,,, 2 other people other then my dad rn so like
*pats*
I'll keep that in mind
*nods*
they might be okay
well ig idk about bi men,
straight men are insane
This is why I'm only ever dating gay men
Men
Ahhhh
BGONBONLKBGLKNLKHTMT
nailed him you say? /j
so that is (1)
I just know I'm man
Or well maybe more idk the status of the rest of the servers gender
You know One good man
hey hey lyri
my tear ducts dont work properly
no tears
that was so cute!! the ending was sad tho
wait introduce me
sankyuu
I like alhaitham only because the more i analyze him the funnier he becomes
send it
but I will give you a reward
idk <3
I will uhhhh
If you can get me to cry
hit me with it
I don't think I will but honestly?
I wanna read it now actually
LMAOOOO
you gotta stan both characters for ships a lot of the time
thats so valid
i wanna see
send tge comic to me
mdzs fan?
,,,,,
Shenlan is very good
Idk how sane I am
two
I love the dad jokes between the too
I just like kokosara and cynari
i also like xiaoven
Yeahhhh
the things men do to feel loved
Ahhhh
i do do sibling cosplays tho
Idk what couples cosplay I'd do, I am forever alone/I am currently dating my oc so
i prefer zhongchi too but everyone has their tastes
dawwww
You're so much taller
OH MY GOD
as well
I would love to see it
at least not frequently enough for that to be my assignment
I am not the little spoon
If I am shorter then my partner.
Listen.
this is why you keep making bad decisions, you're too tall to see the fine ground details
even if my partner is taller than me i'm still the big spoon is what i'm saying
it;s okay heki,,,,, i know there are tops out there who likes/would top those taller then them
Do people expect me to be short
people are always shocked to hjear about my height
it's not like it's my identity or anything it's just Weird
it's okay
this is insane
I am used to being the tall one or one of the most tall people in servers
OH MY GOD
i would like to be just a bit
I'm currently like 5'10
I want to be 6'0 tho
You do not want to be 6'4
My sibling gained an inch in height as late as their 20's
still
RIGHT
OH
you're still growing
lyri, dw, you're like 14?
i'm going to go onto t as soon as possible, i'll tell you if i grow taller
I dont think that works
WHAT
????
HEKI'S FUCKING TALLER THEN ME
yeahhh
that sounds scary
oh
damn
ig everyone knew i was a guy long before i did
so ✌️
i think i've only ever been catcalled once in my entire life and ngl i dont remember if it was actually a cat call
actually this goes to heki too cause apparently she's had issues too
anyways, lyri if we were to ever meet in person i can be your guard dog
*pats for your friend*
so whenever me and my sibling are out together they tell me not to leave them alone lol
like, whenever my sibling was around and they were getting harrassed the second i stepped in they went away
men always avoided me
ngl, it's kinda funny to me but i've never needed one
good
So you *do* have a rape alarm
Ohhhhhh
if you have a tattoo directly over an organ
also makes your organs not useful for harvesting
get a tattoo on your collar bone
lyri can i buy you a rape alarm for safety if you feel like you need something
i looked it up real quick
No lyri's right
Oh
,,,,,stun guns shouldn't be counted?
what is legal
oh stunguns are illegal?
OMG WAIT THATS SUCH A CUTE COLOR
I dont wanna use mine either, nor do I want to have kids so I'm perfectly fine gunning for the other one
*pats*
Yeah, birth control should work then
which is a thing that can be done, it requires more surgery then just getting the uterus removed
Ahhh, in that case you'd actually be referring to,,, getting the hole closed
Including no periods
It's a daily pill but it's useful for a lot of things
No.1 Is birth control
For the record there is a way to no longer have periods for the rest of your life without getting rid of the uterus but that is an effective way
Hihihi lyri
lol
ik the convo had moved on but
I second disliking having boobs, they suck
Oh dear
You heard Luna
tighnari is gender
Dang your fashion sense is top notch
is that your outfit? :O
FUCK YEAH
(This cant be a gekokujo situation)
My mouth hanged oprn the entire time I'm so excited for the full version
Ill listen tmrw
Oooo
Oh uhm Mafuyu or Touya
sometimes i wonder why im still friends with you
intersex people are crazy
It always has been but you never hear people talking about it
omg ado is doing music for spy family 2?
sure
oh dear
oh jesus
I think you'd get reported if you did that
Lol
body dysmorphia?
anxiety?
uhmmm
d- dissociation?
why have you put up with him for 3 years
Oh nvm it's death that he deserves
I think edge deserves to be isolated for the rest of his life ngl
,.,,,,oh of course i am
am i a ner-
am
,,, what if i want to dress like this when masc.
Oh thats gorgeous art
I love the art tho
you're valid
lolol
cutesy
not like
oh, but when I say anime girl I mean something more along the lines of pekora or like,,,, something kinda squeaky and clown like
people sorta sound like their pfp's
It's the pfp's for the most part
You to me, sound like you'd have an anime girl voice
Something in common!
PKOIJU9HY8UIO
I forget Fen sounds like that
KL;,kmjinmkol
LOL
lmjnihkml,;vferecd

IOUINBYUINOMP
Ain't that fantastic
Tho
I can probably do breast removement without spending a dime
but you're valid
I don't have the organ's I want in order to be friends with benefits with anyone so
gotta love that
all of my friends are in relationships except for some of the minors <3
cool!
are you or are you not dating someone tet
Tet has a bf right?
LOL
It's not a poly relationship, but that's the reason I feel outcast in my friend group <3 they are all dating
KMOhubnjkml,
I suppose those kinds of toys do exist,.,

I'm sorry that just sounds like something's penetrating the penis rather then

and How do I use it
What is veron
Done
I see
How to unlock.
I see...
<--- Is unsure how ToF gacha works
If I fail pity on the pickup banner, will that carry over to the next lim banner I pull on?
,,,,,I need to grind a bit more
Lol
Early on the gold nucleus banner
Thank u
Red?
Okay
Morn
Slep for today
I am at 40 pity on red nucleus banner
Lol, I was afk at the time
OH
Hi!
Cause I cant play for long because of mt chair
Get a new chair soon
I'm going to need to uhh
My back hurts...
Cause Astra is nice to me
Decided to do supply pod grinding
At 7 nucleus
The one red nucleus I went to requires a relic I didnt have oops
It's so useful
And it
Did indeed have the arm!!!
Alright, cereal time
In which case I'm set
Then
I think I might have that
Cause
With the 5 red nuc's?
Wait dont you get that with the .99 cent pack
OH
Or do Mirroria
Oh, maybe I will find ruins first then?
Thanks, I will get started now.
Cool!
I meant for puzzles
*nods*
Is everything available with my beginner equipment (i am only lvl 19) or should I advance a bit more to get some of the other stuff
I'll have to see
That place scares me slightly
OH ywah
Ig I'll scour Astra then
Okay!
Which area do you recommend me going to first for red nuce's?
Ye ye
It was rude.
Either way I wasnt calling my bank so I had to setup a razer gold account
They dont accept my bank or bank doesnt accept them?
I did go through a lot of trouble to buy the .99 cent pack actually
Where should I start for farming red nucelous?
Which reminds me
I must get Anna first
But
I kinda want her
Umi's base was very cute
But yea, katknigt's a very old user of mine
Weird
It should be katknigt
Ign? Username?
Yes Tet! Invite me
Make it make sense!!
LIKE
YEAH
I only noticed the arrow like,,, take 5
Yea
I did manage that
Do I join a specific crew or
<@309634550273933314> is your crew open?
I AM GOING TOWARDS WHERE YOU WANT ME TO GO AND I AM AVOIDING ENEMIES
IT KEEPS PUTTING ME AT THE BEGINNING
There's this motorcyle part and I dont know what it wants from me!
This is frustrating
Oh
this is throwing me for a loop
cause I want to explore everything I can but
not complaining?
I'm
I'M GOING TO VERA?
HUH
this is very different from what i remember
change the story?
did they
Oh
While my old account is an NA server
So Babel is an Asian server
Yes! You can't transfer to another region's server
And!
So, I logged on to my old account real quick to test something
Oh boy
I need all of the beginner area ones
Ye ye
Thank you tet!
Smart
I am not very sma4t
I just noticed
OH
Whats the fastest way of getting red nucelous?
Let me back in rigjt
It will
That's a crash!
Oh
Done with character creation
ANNA YOU CANT ESCAPE
***I'm playing lets goooo***
**FINALLY**
LAUNCHING AGAIN
I really do want to play
unfortunately
tof really doesn't want me to play
technically 3 cause I had to restart my pc
take two
They're supposed to be harder
Probably cause newer region ?
Time to get up and figure out tof
Which means
It's a new day
Tomorrow the grind for anna starts 🙏
I might need to uhhh,,, do most of this tomorrow cause I need to sleep soon
Looking like
It is
meanwhile, death stranding is almost done lol
take two.
Completely wiped computer of tof
Time to get the full team then
BET
Yes/.
ONJBFDPL,;K
OHOHOHO
OH
Fuck yeah
Oh all pretty girls I wanted already?
Annabella pretty and want her skin
WELP
When does Annabella get rerun/when can I obtain her
IN OTHER NEWS
Let's reinstall shall we?
SO
like it loads and then it doesn't load past the loading into the game screen
Cause it's just not booting me up
I think I have a file issue
SO
cause it's actively not letting me play
I think somethings wrong
Oh okay
And I moved genshin in too
I didn't reinstall but rather move my files to my hard drive
Cause that might be a file issue
If not I'm going to have to see what the issue is
Lemme log in
Oh it crashed lmao
JFKFKFKFFK
Of course catching up and exploring the new area will take longer
Exploration
And lije
I wanna get to the gacha
Lol
Oh i meant the tutorial
This is So much more smooth then last time I played
Did they optimize tof better??
OH 2AIT
I can do that again
Character creation!!
Kinda wonder how fast I can speed through all of this
Completely corrupted
My account data is probably jusr
So
It also says it's lvl 1 for some reason??
Cause fuck that
Just starting a new one lol
So
When trying to enter my old accoubt
It kept crashing
Slightly scared
Hrmm
Dang, it's not wanting to load my file
If it's not an option I'll just start from scratch
Tis fine
Taking awhile to load up
Log in time
Okay!
Oki guess I gotta log in first
Idk, how do you do it?
Idt I can transfer it then
And The Glades is in NA
So Babel is in Asia?
Oh
Also Babel right?
<@309634550273933314> Oh
How do I swap servers
So I'm on The Glades
Oh okay
Loading now
***IT'S LAUNCHED***
I love that actually
That's good
OHHHH
lol
If not I'll just start over
big possiblity
I could absolutely be on babel tho
Cause idr
I'll figure out soon
Uhhh
<@309634550273933314>
*however*
some time
Okay so had to move files and that took...
I'M READY TO PLAY YOU AGAIN
TOF
***downloading/moving files***
Much later today but today
*Today*
also
I really think he wasn't getting what you were saying
*crying*
Yeah, Omg your art so cute
Ye ye
Design
Where it's like a carved in
Or you can try something like this
Make the lines colored and have it be a clear glass with colored lines
Idea
so ig the meta only matters for that one arena then
Oh okay
like is there not a particular meta/the game can be beat with any character?
whales whales
Like
then again it's also important if I am on babel
restart cause I don't think I joined babel
if I like
Is that important to know
Btw, what units and teams are meta?
I can't wait....
mostly to start over cause I think my accounts not that good any more
a new server
I might join
that's when my hard drive arrives
I will start playing again on wednesday
I'll soon be in the same boat astra
**soon**
I'll be able to play again
Soon..

Maybe,,, I'll see in a bit
No Lin

Exploration required to get crown to the dc I need should give me enough to get to 80
50 dc to hit 77
At 76 pity
Going to take a break
I am unlocking teleport points in crown
I'm headin there
I'm going to see if I can go to the next areas already and I'm just stupid

Huh...
Arent?

Really?
Isnt some area's capped through- yeah
Which is currently locked
And am able to explore the next area
Well, I will probably get enough if I go to the next chapter
I see
25% through the last part of chapter 3
Navia
Uhm

I dont think I'm close enough in the story to Enter Vera
Also I have realized something
<@309634550273933314>
Also how to Recipe

<@309634550273933314> <@483689649727078400> I feel like the two of you would like this one
this was about zodiac
today's a good day for out of context quotes from ig
God it hurts.
To start with. I don't think I add anything of value anyways. Really to anything.
I don't think if pressed any of them could answer basic questions about my likes or who I am.
And I don't think there's a single person out there that'd love me.
Ya know.... I've had this,,,, sneaking feeling but,,, I don't think I can ignore it anymore. I don't think my friends actually know me. Or really care about me.
My current feelings on everything and myself? Low.
I feel sick still
Yeah, thank you
I'll live.
,,,, No and yes.
Heya, anyone feel like talkimg. I feel like crying
I am going insane. Constantly.
Yeaaa
Like when you close your mouth your bottom teeth should close on your top teeth
On your top teeth?
,,,
The dentist agrees, your bottom teeth should in fact *not* be resting on your gums
I have an orthodontia (i am too tired to remember if I spelt that correctly) referal

I don't have any jackets that *don't* have strawberries on them
tbf, it's mostly the Jackets fault
true but some of Barbie's fits do have strawberries
It's literally JUST cause my hair is red that you're saying that Lol
Anyways, the movie wasn't bad but as a Trans guy I felt isolated
Nppp
Thxxxx
I wish you a very Blade

MKVONRIJOKVRL;VR4
I feel like we're the types to bring out the popcorn and watch things being set on fire
BRING BACK THE HUNGY GAME
We should make popcorn
Oh I'd pay for that too
Riri would win if They could channel their inner anger
Tbh you're valid Baban

I think I'll do that a lot more soon
Yeah, I do that a lot.

I don't think I can really handle much
I think lately I've just wanted to escape from reality more and more
*nods* Yeah
*sighs* thanks baban
I'm spiraling all of the time,,
,,,Not to interrupt anything but why is it that when I'm alone I want to be with people, but when I'm with people I want to be alone.

It's really becoming so bothersome
I guess that's it for any and all updates <3
Well
I think if something bad actually happened at any point I would kill myself legit.
Got so many feelings and no matter where I try pouring them into I'm left so depressed and unsatisfied
I am so unstable these days it's not even funny
And so I'll stop that too
Some day I'll lose motivation to breath
Seriously, I've reread this one manga like 3 times at this point, I'm not even reading new things now
haaaaaaaa
Too bad I don't have any motivation or aspiration to do anything anymore
Wow, I should do things more often huh. this is a dead zone ✨

I was so depressed and unkempt
I wore the same outfit every single day
I was such a menace and troll in middle school
KOMmonjiokml,;KMJNIHIO
oho, might give it a listen
the man had obligations that day ig
I think that girl seriously thought I had killed him tho cause she did a sigh of relief when he came through the door
LOL
he showed up like,,, 10 minutes later
one of my favorite memories
The look of fear in her face was priceless
Why do you think he's not here today?
I told a girl I killed the guy behind him, he was absent that day and I had noticed so like
If I had been in physical school longer oh boy
Tbh i don't blame him, I've pulled some similar tricks

This character and a type writer would go together

I would like,,,,, something to keep my sanity.
I'm waiting in a hospital wait room with a baby that wont shut up and very bad wifi
*flops*
Anyone wanna talk?
I hate this
My hands are sweaty
too hot
It's
No joke
I am goijg to kill my neighbours
Still a bit outdated
Probably
It's handy
Using da egg cooker I bought
Mmmmm
I dont blame them
Or maybe I'm just that unlikeable or weird that nobody wants to add someone like me into their stories
Maybe
I find myself wanting to relate to characters and I just really can't the most of the time
It's just odd
the closest I've gotten is Natsuki Subaru but he doesn't have exactly all of my issues
like
It's kinda weird/interesting to note that I feel like there's no character in anything I watch/like that's like me in anyway
last sif
on like
i remember something like that
about right
that does sound
Hmmm
I don't understand the system well either
yeah,,,
20....
Wow my birthday is in less then month...
Anyways
Tet's a tricky one
Ohhh
It's oki
Where are you looking this birthday info up?
I guess so
Very funny and strange
Cause your birthday is the day after my sibling
What's with us and having sibling's birthdays basically on the same day
Oh huh
Yea!
Makes sense
Yup!
I have successfully filled for the first time
ye ye
Hm
still
Oh and Akito 3 star
I am doing all three cards incase I get them all
Hmmm
Way too many
cause I need uhhh
yeah, I think I will starting the next few days

burning me nats on pro room
TELL ME THE CUP SIZE
What the FUCK do you mean by XL
I am going to get a headache looking at bras
I sorta knew with the old games but this one...
so valid
Nice!
During cgo
Unless it happens
Cause I know that I'll probably attempt the next Kotori event
For a Mari event
Like
You'll tier in sif2?
Do you think
<@1052210664191557713> ACTUALLY
Tbh I've done the same it's fun
you're valid
that's a good question
so valid
Pfff
where do I say hi
now
exactly
ye ye
Joining!
cause that'll be good for practicing playing for long periods of time
yea yea
in that tiering server?
join you
and like
maybe I'll try building a filler team?
Yeah, I might try that
?
I don't have anything in particular planned for June/
Well
if I manage to get the mats for it all
what do you think I'll be able to aim for?
I mean
I see I see
.....I will admit part of this is me also just liking to collect resources and upgrading things
idk,,,, maybe I'm being stupid
I'm being too optimistic </3
PERHAPS THO
I don't think there's much wrong with that
have another one
essentially I'm aiming for more just incase I uhm
but then medical emergencies happened
I was going to t5000 for spojoy Kanade right?
that's true but I wanna make it easy on myself LOL
I am just hoarding and collecting resources
true, which is why I haven't really touched anything but leveling my event characters decos
so I'll def at least have one event card
I am actually looking okay in terms of being able to spark
so I don't want a repeat of that
I got t4000
last time I tried to actually tier something with like,,, a plan it ended horribly
am chill with that
but like
Which is probably just t500-t1000
I want to go as high as I can
huh
I think they'd all be at 6? if it wasn't for lack of Coin
the others are only at 4 cause of coins
Toya's is at 7 already
yeah
I mean, I just need to be stricter on myself ye
Oh am I screwed
you think
I need to actually grind every day now but I should be in a good-ish spot?
crystals for the weekly def
Ye ye
This events in June
at least when I'm done with scores and I'll make sure to grab crystals and energy lol
using my event points on seeds
which is why I think I'll work on seeds more with events
yeah
It gives some stuff but Unfortunately I don't have a lot of time to play every day
yeah def
what do you think
<@964806731471405086> Nea
seeds
maybe charms too but
seeds?
when I'm done collecting them I'll use event points for like
practice scores are looking to be the first one complete
nothing is done yet tho
slightly over half way there for cute gems
and the cute charms
I think what I'm lacking most is miracle seeds
been slowly working on the decorations
did not
crystals then I would have cause I used one 10 pull on the colorful fes just to see if I'd get anything
I have some less uhhh
Current tiering resource list
looking at my miracle gem count tho,,,, 1/3rd the way there
And also properly calculating practice scores LOL
I have just been burning nats as well as I can on auto (def inefficient but it's fine) and uhhh forgetting to do challenge lives, I'm starting to catch up on doing that every day
so I will take my time to do that
I haven't updated my proseka tiering items in a long time
The slide notes arent too hard until you hit Nico Puri and Mermaid Festa2
You have to have a completely different hand position for love live
Literally LOL
There's slide notes in master
Oh it's a learning curve alright
yeah
but
those might be harder actually
Nico Puri and Mermaid Fest Vol.2 are also insane
Play Beat in Angel or Solider Game
FUCK YEAH
IN ALL OF THEIR GLORY
THE HARD SONGS STILL EXIST
ALSO
I just gotta play more
I now suck at love live but my muscle memory will return
still should.
probably
they should
I know they absolutely Can make rhythm games
TBH SAME
probably will be
think if like,,,, honkai released a rhythm game
with a dedicated fanbase already
i think it;ll be hard cause it's a new game tho
before covid!
but that was when I was invested which hasn;t been since
I used to tier events pretty easily
unsure
It was in it's prime?
it's prettier now I think
It does look like they've updated the art
ALTHOUHG
great thing about love live is that they do know how to make things look nice even if sometimes the art isn't the besgt
yeah!
the initials are kinda ugly
Yeah I'm going to save too
Mari UR?
which is usually just the day before it hits
and these are the characters
so if they continue with that then all you'll here is the next event will be this type
cards were put in like,,, 30 minutes before release
also like,,, new ui features
and that was it
old sif days, they datamined events
that's mostly cause they put cards in at the very last second
granted
unlike the people who make proseka
Sif's never really card about leaks
Yeah, sif has never had strong protection
\o/
I DON'T LOSE LP FROM LEAVING A SONG
OH MY GOD IT REFUNDS YOUR LP NOW
it's an outdated thing i'm afraid
I should play with the speed setting
That were awful until you hit master
I remember sif having set speeds
Good question
to transfer my stuff
I have to wait for global...
I've played it once or twice
Yeah same
OHO?
Thank you!
OOOOO
OOO
Indeed.
soon
yeee
Aponia btw
He is very happy to be home
Probably cause he went to the vet today
My cat is being very lovey
That's something I've been wondering too...
Yea!!
Lanzhu's so pretty
Same jp va as Kokomi
Umi's great
Eli has the exact same birthday as my Siblings so my sibling loves her too
OOOO
Valid! Have fun
I have a Kanan cosplay
You are right
I did indeed!
Guess who my favs are!
Fun fact tho, Mari is my siblings fav too
OH NOOO
So valid
they do look incredibly similar
Yeah
Chika's personality is the most distinct out of all of them though I think but
Honoka has the excuse of being the og
Yeah
LOL
Kanon technically has the like,,,, different art style going for her but
Ayumu's hair is more pink then orange but
the curse of being the main character 😔
pffff
i wonder how much free stuff I'll get from it
I wonder how account transfer will go
And NICE Tae 4 star les go
Yessss
?
I think
Love Live 2 is set to start this month?
It's shut down :(
It comes in on the 27th
Thanks!!
cause Aponia
try everything
If I have to reduce size I will
we'll see
I am a very big person and the measurements were close enough
Her default costume
Honkai Aponia
yes.
We'll see if it fits.
I bought an Aponia cosplay
Another thing
thnks for the advice Cata, I have managed to start thinking again but uh
anyone know a good way to get my brain working again?
I'm having a hard time thinking and gaining ideas
*deep breathe* SO
I do? I think
Lol
There in fact was a reason and food wasnt going to help
why do I feel like this
why am I crying for no reason
aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Yeah pretty much!
I just don't like what it did with the characters
I pretend the epilogues aren't canon  to save my sanity
So valid
rn
I'm the same shade of pink
It's okay
*hugs*
komnivejmod,pa
Baban,,, Are you having an off day today?
Lol why would there be fics of maincord people also
Not even the most popular I believe
Characters in homestuck
?
Maincord people?
Idk if I had any rarepairs with homestuck
Erisol and gamtav where my ships lol
Fics that featured either of them
I just meant i specifically looked into
Now
It
Although considerin
NO NO NOT THEM TOGETHER
I was heavily into fanfics featuring Eridan and Tavros (more specifically shipping fics but, eh)
So valid
Reread, read fanfics, Liveblog so I can talk to you about it
KOITO!!!!!
I am set
I got this on the other free pull
NICE
I'M FREE
GOT HER
give it up for hour 3!!
das a lot of support cards
i haven't suffered enough
we continue
no
hhh
but
I want her
DO I KEEP GOING?
Moving here
Or just,,, do anything I want it to
Why cant I get my brain to do normal things
Hhhh,
i see
Ah. major depressive episode
Everything is boring
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
like,,, doing nothings boring but
*lies down* I want to do a thing but nothing feels right....
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
I want people to shut up
Idk
I think
Too pissed to sleep
Shut the fuck up
I want to be alone.
can they please just leave me alone
I want to destroy thrm
Can they please stop messaging me
I hate being nice this shit sucks
actually
I'm starting to understand astra
So bad
I want them to shut up
5 seconds
Actually can my sibling shut up and stop messaging me for like
cause I think I have energy
I should play
Let's see, I did train the Touya today so lemme look at my mats
Sounds like a plan
Yeah!
So.... I could end up getting her with chance.
Well, there's going to be free tell pulls between now and then I believe.
I see I see
There is the chance of luck sacking her though, actually.
But, I do want to fully tier
Maybe
Would it be a waste?
Well, Yes if I can grind more crystals to get enough vouchers for her
Hmmm
I read that on yours but
done
Ye ye
Thanks uwu
Oh practice score-
Other then the card tab is there anything I'm missing
<@964806731471405086>
*settles down*
Idk
Yeah
cause sometimes..... i just think my experiences are like,,,, not that bad
And that people sort of recognize how they're traumatic
Idk,,,, Validated by the fact that nobody thinks my traumatic experiences were okay
Whenever I talk about some of the shit that's happened to me and people react with What the fuck that;s abuse makes me feel like
You know. Idk if it's wrong to feel validated by this but
Had to do more fucking laundry
Physically, doing fine.
Emotionally, I'm plummeting to rock bottom rn
I'll be happy to be rid of it.
I should be fine
Yeah...
Carefully monitoring it cause generally I experience the worst towards the end
Yet.
I haven't experienced any really bad pain this cycle tbh
Yeah
Been lying around all day
Still experiencing massive amounts of blood but I've got my containment for it set so no longer it's messing with my things
No pain
Better! <:slacc:963350438940397588>
I'd want to!
Maybe I'll like,,, sit with you while you look
Well, maybe your next day off
*pats*
It's good that you had a break
Well, not everyday has to be
Update, I was productive today even with all of this shit going on, praise me.
NICE
Oh noo
Like, okay, there are Treatments outside of that and a lot of people don't jump to that but for a some that's the only solution
Btw, Did you know that if you have Endometriosis that the only cure is a Hysterectomy!
Well, I think that's a rare one
Ahhh
Huh?
Granted, after menopause you stop bleeding so yay!
Cause even after menopause you will get cramps
Well, Unless you're on T I don't think cramps go away like ever
Correct, btw, Although I think removal of ovaries can also,,,,? Get rid of periods
The one you used to eat
I've been on for a very long time
For me the side effects are not noticable (At least I think, I was testing by going off of BC but I'm going back on cause fuck that)
But that's a Hysterectomy lol
There Is
Well
Most of the time you'd want to take it before you sleep
Once a day
I've heard of them existing but idk if they're in use now? I could be misremembering.
Implants don't.
Generally the one that stops periods is the pills though
I know about the implants
There's implants, pills, and I think injections? Maybe?
There's many different kinds yes
*pats*
Btw, Birth Control is like,,, A contraceptive but it's also a medication that keeps your Horomones balanced and prevents periods
Yeah...
Well, I also have really intense pain usually (Haven't had that yet)
To me it feels really heavy
Idk,,,
I went off of Birth Control for a bit cause I thought it was fucking with me, Now I see that the issue is the Uterus itself.
Idk if you could ask for Birth Control but that is an option for if you don't want them anymore
She sucks
Although I bleed so goddamned much that I'm afraid to see what that would look like
Tbh
Yeah
I mean
JFIDKIDKD
So much it's unreal.
I hate parents and school
Mega ultra dysphoria and messy
I know it's just...
Yeah,,,,
I want to commit die.
Cause thats what happens
I wonder when it'll balloon into some of the worst pain ever
Oh so there's the pain
Ow
I'm going to kill myself
Make it make sense
How does a pair of underwear not get a drop of blood on it and instead it's the bed
Not when blood gets all over my bed and I'm trying to sleep
God
Why must I put up with having a period? I went off birth control cause I thought maybe it'd help with my other issues but
I am going to cry
I hate having uterus
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
*nods* Sounds like you had a good time then
So I might try that in the future
I wouldn't mind having like,,, the ocassional drink
*nods*
I'm glad you like it!!
BUT
I, unfortunately, don't really like alcohol (I can't get drunk in the pleasant way, it just makes my body do weird things)
Niceeee
Whats the drink?
Oh?
Yeah... I understand that feel.
We are both not doing great, huh
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
I don't have to think during a dream.
dreams are better then whatever I have here,,,,
i crave to be asleep forever
I have her now btw
please let me collect my crystals
I love you girl but
Mei is monologuing
I need to sleep soon but I don't wanna
Never got to speedrun cause busy
*lies down*
HoO
I want
TIME TO SPEEDRUN HONKAI STORY
BUT I ALSO JUST FIND THE CONCEPTING OF THE SONG VERY INTERESTING?
So yeah
I like listening to Interviews in general
Ig
Is because I like listening to people talk?
Yeah I think the reason I vibe with this
If so valid
Do you not like this one?
Why is this a brainworm
Yes
this is no longer a question, I'm saying sayonara to my tits.
YayyyyyYYYy
Niceee
*pats*
Idt this sounds very convincing but if you do it now you wont have to do it later
*pats*
OOoo
justify it
to like
I'd get more cute bags but I unfortunately don't have the room and I don't go out enough
*nods*
That is very cute yes
OMG
valid!
If money is not an issue lol
I mean,,, I could probably send you stuff here if you paid for it?
oooo
ye valid
I recommend thrifting tho
OH
Torrid is a plus sized store
Granted
I do occasionally find some stuff on amazon and like,,, Torrid?
ANYWAYS
Although it's rare that they have pastels lol
online
Hot Topic is one of the only places I can shop cause they have Plus sized stuff like
The cardign and the necklace came from Hot Topic, I found the top online
and gold
When looking through my necklaces I saw it and went Oh, this is like, perfect, there's a cherry blossom and it's pink
The necklace worked really well with the cosplay
but yea
It's my favourite cardign
Thanksss
uwu
Twas fun
I was Yae miko out in public
I wanna be in a way that makes anyone gay for considering me
So so so valid
I wanna be cute and sexy but in a feminine guy way
Yeah
Eichi is probably one of the firar characters that transed my gender that I didnt notice he was doing that
Thanks!
There is def more I could put on this list but that would be too long me thinks
So I must
I wake to a chorus of show
mind you,,, it's somewhat the specific images but
anyone wanna see a like,,,, thing I put together of all characters I think have the gender I want
JDMDMMDDK
yes....
He's just difficult
So
to be fair tho I went to hard pity for him on Guaranteed
lol
Maybe he likes them he/hims
I believe
You'll get him
*hugs*
she's my favourite genshin character and I wanted her to be my pfp
cause I like Nahida
Yeah
LOLOL
Which in turn feels slightly weird
God, my brain has really gotten comfortable using the term male for myself tho
PFFF THANKS
BUT IF I DO DECIDE I WANT T I'LL LET YOU KNOW AND WE CAN TAKE IT TOGETHER
it's neat
I think
Happy with he/him
I think I am at least
I'm leaning towards masculine stuff to see How I feel
CURRENTLY
Idk about T yet but yeah sure
KMJINFRFE
I might be currently,,,, trying out he/him pronouns and using the name Chrom
So
*lies down*
Figuring out gender hard man
I am so sleepy today
I took pain meds and went to sleep
lol yeah
Bad
Feeling
My head is
In lots of pain
In pain
*pats*
He's lucky I wont kill him ♡
*screams into pillow*
Teehee
Thanks
Yayyyy
ye hehe
I also like this length I think
But yeah, Very happy
Very good question! I will do just that
it highlights my eyes very well irl
I think this one has fit me the best
I've tried out a lot of colors and tbh??
Yeah, tbh, I agree
it's slightly pink undertone thanks to the lighting I think?
I never posted a picture so lemme do that
I went as red as Himeko
I am now a Red Head
THIS BITCH
GUESS WHO DYED THEIR HAIR RED TODAY
40H
Btw, I've finally managed to figure out my bra size, It's uhm
good!!
*pats*
Does it still hurt?
What do you think caused it?
Oh sure
bored
Yeah
Solis's like,,, aggressiveness is different from yours anyways
Yeah yeah, that's not how it works!
Yea yea
yw
<@964806731471405086> this place is epi free too :3

Finally, lol
*lies down* New year, new icon

*inhales*
<:KanadeHug:1046426613660799029>
To killing myself
This close
I am
Fuck
*looks up at my new whiteboard which has Draw time written on it*
*Me watching video's absentmindedly*

Maybe it's because of something else?
yea...
none in my area tho
I should have lunch soon
so hungry already
yummy...
Mac and Cheese and Fried chicken
So excited for dinner today
But also, that sucks, I hope you stop having nightmares
When have I had issues with explosions?
Well, that makes some amount of sense with you having had leg issues lately
Why must I keep having awful dreams including explosions and fire lately?
it shouldn't be too busy
I'll save and and finish tomorrow
*lies down* I'm unable to focus today on drawing looks like
oh and some hair accessories
she got me a microphone and a lamp
Went to my grandma's for her christmas presents
I think my brain just likes weird sounds
Ngl, Something about off's soundtrack makes my brain happy

Either way....
Or intense raining on grilling meat

And yes, the part where it's being fried
Slightly yes
my Brain is strange then
NINnojmvbtrb I'm just
Is it bad that the Meat portion of this song doesn't disgust me like most people but make me hungry?

Lemme show you
A certain thing
anyone wanna judge me real quick?
Hm
Matcha like?
Is
The after taste?
Oh wait
It's not matcha
It's still got a strong flavor that is uh
I think I fixed it Slightly
I have added milk and sugar to it
Maybe this one is more for cookin
I like matcha but ♡
If it did it I couldnt read em
I definitely did it wrong
In flavor
Not Matcha

At least when you have to draw for a deadline and you don't have the motivation
Pain

Drawing
I dun wanna play a Human, they're so boringgggg
For aesthetics *and* stats
Deciding on a Race to play in dnd is so hardddd
lolol yea
I kinda feel that
So valid
MONJiklmvnjiobkmbvr
Pfff
Rolling around is fun rig-
Hi Tai
Oh

Despite all of my eating problems I like cooking
It isssss
I like making yummy food
In the upcoming days
I know mac and cheese will be made sometime soon
I will
That's a good suggestion tbh
Life will be bad again shortly
I have eaten my spaget
For the short while that I have spagey
My life is good
Spaget
I make
That's just murder
I have made food
yes
Oh okay
Someone convince me to get up and feed myself,,,
Leg hurt.com
You can turn on all
Np!!
These should be good enough!
The downloadable content for DMV


Better then d&d beyond, harder to use, needs to download the other options in order to make characters but you don't need to spend money, can make a pdf/printable of your sheet


A character builder site, needs an account to make a character, heavily monetized and some options require spending money if you want to use them


I'll pin some dnd resources Ig
So if you do any personal research make sure it says that it's 5th edition
I will mention you are going to be playing 5th edition dnd which is vastly different from other editions
Or if you're unsure about the specific role that class plays
I will say, I can explain further about any class if you need help
If you want to learn more about a certain class
I'd suggest looking through 
There's more stuff to explain like with spells and weapons but you only need to know the ins and outs if you want to play that class
That's sorta the base of dnd
So you can eventually became so proficient in something that you have like a +15 mod
your Proficiency bonus will go up as you level
For example, if you have a proficiency at level 1 in deception and you have a 14 in charisma, instead of the modifier being a +2 it's a plus +3 (or Is it 4 at level 1?)
Proficiency adds to a given skills modifier
I will now briefly explain proficiency
Pretty simple right?
you subtract
which means instead of adding
that's a minus -3
a 5
if your stat is like
Yup!
So for any charisma roll you make if it's an 18 you roll a d20+4
All the way up to 20 which is +5
+1
12 is a
10 gives +0 modifier
Each roll is a d20 and your base stats give you a + modifier to your roll to make it go better or worse
As in, how these rolls work
For the math
Now
Deception, Performance, Persuasion are all Charisma rolls
So all bard's tend to have High Charisma
The reason Bards rep for seducing/talking their way out of things is because the Bard's casting stat is Charisma
Which is how much you can butter your words and make people like you or how good you can intimidate people
Last is Charisma
Not exactly, it's more about being aware of things
Perception is one of the most common rolls your dm will have you make and that's Wisdom based
Common sense and the like
Next to wisdom! street smarts
iirc
This is also the most common Spell casting stat
Intelligence is about booksmarts
Either way
Con is useful
Ahem
Yeah
I haven't learned that one
That's a different system then dnd
yeah
Call of Cthulhu right?'
So
I dont play coc
Ahh
Shit con means you'll be one shot
It usually means both
Not really
pffff
No skills use Con but a lot of saving throws do
Constitution is How healthy and sturdy your character is, Your hp will be higher if you have a high con
oh neat
Dexterity is all about being swift and good at moving your body exactly how you want to, this is used for stealth, acrobatics, and initiative
Pfff
Dnd is super flexible
sure
You'd need a spell for it? or the skill for it
That wouldn't even be strength
If the door is wooden you absolutely can
You can
If you want to move a heavy object, kick down a door, etc That's all strength baby
Strength is as exactly how it sounds, It's how strong you are, Most weapons except for certain cases are rolled using your strength modifier
Let's explain each stat
Each skill you can roll are based off of your base 6 stats
you can unnaturally get higher through items but that's a different story and irrelevant
Naturally, they go up to 20
There are 6 different stats!
gimme a second
So, I think to summarize best I'd need to get out a character sheet so
For example, I play a High Elf Monk Barbarian
Cause at the end of the day you play to have fun
Of course, if you want to play like something that doesn't work well together stat wise that's fine
It's not as important as class but if you pick a race that works well with your class it might help make your character stronger over all
Stats mainly, it can also depend on the world, some races have innate casting
Or as a dwarf
you can play as an Elf
For example
Do you want to be a human or not
Another important thing is race aka
So classes are important
Indeed!
Wizards tend to be purely ranged damage dealers
There are tank clerics but mainly they heal and buff
For example, Clerics are generally support and healers
It helps decide what kind of role you play
Class like and rpg class
It's a pick your poison kind of deal
When it comes to making sheets there's sites that can help but most of them kinda suck but entering in the sheet info on itself is also confusing so
that's a sure way to end up hating the experience
yeah, I would say don't play dnd with people you hate
d20 and d6's are the most common
The basic dice of dnd are, d20, d12, d8, d6, and d4
Sometimes if a bot is being mean tho, players can roll dice they have irl and tell the dm the results
Although, as the dm I usually keep track of it myself/have the players keep track
yeah yeah
Is the tatsu command
t!roll d20
Tatsu has dice rolling options
Classes
Brings me to my next point actually
There's a bunch of bard subclasses, which
Oh! Lol
Y- yes?
there's a ton of different books because Dnd is played either through Official premade campaigns and worlds or you can use the content from any given book and make your own
Dnd is basically one sheet of paper and a bunch of different dice
Source book are the instructions
It's a tabletop game
Grab everything from
Source Book is essentially the book you like
Fae's are a type of creature and race you can play as and fight against
The mechanics can be a bit difficult to figure out at first but once you know them it's pretty easy
Yea yea
There are a lot of differences but it's a roleplaying game
Ig?
It's similar to the kg's we do except no scheduled murders?
Essentially you make a character and go on adventures/follow a story your dm makes
Where would you like to start?
I'm a dm you know?
I can explain!
UwU
It's a surprise for Aster and the kg in general uwu
Something different
Time to draw
SO PREETY
I will prob avoid gen for a bit
I'm smart teehee
I did!
Oh dear
Was it
...15$ or 12$ for a grilled cheese
Wow
Dang
Like double priced
<@309634550273933314> cafe right? How expensive was everything?
How does someone like that Exist
I just
I am also pissed
I am so grossed out
I genuinely no longer feel comfortable around Ruby
This is now a safe haven from Ruby
*I wonder*
*I wonder if Ruby lives in america and has lived through their school going through a gun threat*
Also,,,, Against Gun control
LITERALLY THE ONLY REASON I CAN THINK OF IS THAT HE CLEARLY LIKES CHILDREN BUT DOESNT WANT TO ADMIT IT IM
Why is Ruby trying so hard
Ruby is banned here
<@309634550273933314> over here
*flops*
So sleepy....
Famous paintings are a bit,,,, Their posing and framing aren't exactly what I'd go for
Hrmmmmm
it'll help....
if I make an icon?
maybe...
Well, Ig I can start by opening my art program
*rolls around*
I wanna do things!!!
*sighs*
I think it's just cause I've had difficulty doing anything lately...
I'm just stuck on figuring out a concept and posing
this person likes Raiden and Scara and
santa
secret sants
sorta
And I have some art to do
I've been having trouble starting to draw anything
Does anyone want to help me get over my artblock
*lies down*
Yeah, it happened by accident tho
Yeah, It was kinda funny but it killed my raiden lol
You're amazing
Thank you Eli
This happened at some point
Hewwo
bottom area looks so wrong
Yeah thats why the
OH
ngl
does not look right
that
Lol
Why does she have camel toe
ANISSSS
ANIS
NEON
Most outfits in nikke do
pants
is she wearing a thong over her
hey
H-
indeed
i call it field research
this is why I ask around and then use data from as many people around me to figure out who i am
but if you asked me which ones more like me it'd be Haitham
Not even I tick all of Alhaitham's boxes and I tick some of kaveh's too
that makes sense
I'm open but there's a lot I dont say about myself and I've recently figured out how much I think in benefits which is rlly weird to me but that's definitely an Alhaitham trait
despite the fact that i am friendly
This is right for me, I'm definitely more Alhaitham then Kaveh
but also it's not underneath, i'd argue that's a window that's sewn into the fabric
because you can see her belly button
or some kind of transparent fabric
It looks more like mesh
perhaps?
considering it's mostly leather and shenhe and ganyu's probably are silk or something like that
Eulas would probably be harder to get out of too
its called being lazy
✌️
no i am not picking up a new hobby
i wish i fucking knitted-
damnnnn
idk where to buy 'em
can we bring them back
i love how leg warmers look tho
cause somedays it feels like the worlds going to fucking end any fucking day now
i'm just waiting to get isekai'd into a world thats further back on the self destruction of the world
ack
i mean there's not anything wrong with wanting to be a stay at home wife/mom but like
yea
tradwife is short for traditional wife,,,, uhhh basically think of the christian ideal for the perfect wife
lolol
yeah,,,, i can;t imagine why! /sarcasm
yeah
LOL
it's still a majority but like,,,, not as crushing
indeedy
but lol it's probably closer to 70 or 60% of people who arent trans rather then that amount lol]
I mean, yea, most people are going to be cis
I dont even think that statistic is right LMAO
*pats* happens to the best of us
besides, facts are also based on evidence and this persons understanding of evidence is fucking wonky at best
✨ Feelings ✨
based on
everything is a social construct
then what are facts? cause ya know. guess what,
sorry women
I guess men are the only ones who can have children
At all??
hold on this line in particular is funny
?
do women after menopause stop being a women
do you deny a women her womenhood because she can't get pregnant?
that's a lot more common then you'd think
also,,, a male is defined by having a fully functional dick and testicles and women a fully functional vagina and uterus okay what about people who are infertile
the infographic fr has a lot of false info
cis men can lactate tho
NJNGJNGRGRGRLKNR
fr
yeah
Oh tell your bf that I respect him and also same 🤝
~~should i be concerned that the transmasc transition goals one are technically mine too, sorta, id want to look more like a guy who crossdresses more then that~~
,,,,,,,well that is something!
LKLKVMKOBGRLKMBTLKMBLK
Oh is that hannibal
Yeah accurate
They dont understand attraction at all
Jesus
Good fucking question
Thats what theyre like
Yeah ,,,,

I hate those men ♡
You can only tolerate enough misogyny before you just straight up leave without accomplishing much
I'd imagine women scoring lower is due to lack of women's participation and lack of women interest
*nods*
Ngl, they could just use.... Boxing classes but specialize them for their sport.
I do and dont understand why
There's actually quite a few sports categories in which cis women beat men every single time
The misogyny in that Is not to be forgotten.
Also why are we making cis women out to be frail or imply that cis women would lose to men in every single sports category?
EXACTLY
Yup!
We could come up with better separations like weight class and or height for certain sporfs
Personally I think separating sports by gender is silly anyways
Anyways, Long Rant sorry but I do think this information is important!
Iirc there's data that shows that if they're in their transition for long enough, i.e., been on hrt for long enough, that theres actually no difference between them and a women doing sports
Thats even if you think that trans women would have an advantage, they dont really actually have much of any
Also, sports as a category celebrates people who have unfair biological advantages anyways
Ahem, what I really mean is that there's Basically No Advantages to being trans in any line of anything
Transwomen and transfem people still get killed on the street for being visibly trans hope that helps!
The reason why is very simple.
Coming in late but it's super rare and almost non existent for people to claim they are trans to invade womens spaces (or male spaces for that matter but like, thats a trans women debate, trans men dont exist ♡)
in case you thought i mightve not gotten it
nice play on words btw
yessss
lgbts sure do love houses
if they love houses then clearly they'll love myhouse.wad Which is Also queer!!
Amazing
okay and oh dw I know it's not serious but I think it's funny enough to be notable
do you want me to add elias to the things i call you, alongside jerma and cherry
Understandable and valid
LOL
thats definitely a bad translation
Why.
Has she eaten at all in the past 4 years
Why is her stomach caved in
Sandwich?
wonderful
they are wonderfuk
Also fuck this bait anon
Miku...
That makes sense
HOPE

HAPPY BIRTJDSY YOU TOO
AN
YES

I will do so soon then
character in witch hat prob, i should read that,,,
who is he teaching and my god that's funny
*pats*
I do understand that Epi.
Interesting
That guy from witch hat ateiler??
Sampo and
Oh nooo
sometimes
Villagers will just want to
Maybe Cube
I'll look around
Wait, do I have an assigned villager?
:O
I love new leaf
NEW LEAF
Wait is Aster playing animal crossing
it's oki
:(
meee
that's normal and cute
tbh
Me too
Yes...
Understandable
That's what I was thinking of too
I do think Tsukuyomi is somewhere tho
I have heard bits and pieces of what people think but idr any of that so LOL
Hmm
KMOJNIOMKFRR4??
Yes.
KMOIJNHIJMKLRVVR????
KONIBYUVTHKMO,;
But the way Kaguya's author uses them is very unique and
Cause they're used a lot for story telling
Tbh when reading or watching anything Japanese it might be a good idea to read up and familiarize yourself with some Japanese Folklore and Myths
yea yea np
and the mental illness and strong character motives comes from scum's wish author me thinks although they're both good at writing that
Kaguya has some VERY strong and intense roots in Japanese Mythos
I mean it's Kaguya's author so obvi they're going to be this insane with symbolism and Japanese mythos
Honestly these two authors are fucking insane
Is a crow.
a lot of things
In one of the Mythos Ametersu's lead into like
You'll have to look them up but yeah
It's mirroring what's going on pretty well?
strawberrys ceo and who ends up getting real attached to Ruby
what's her name.
Ruby directly introduces herself as Ameterasu actually when she was baby trying to intimidate uhh
/folklore
Japanese Myths
LOL
Ruby and Aqua might be Ameterasu and Sussanno
There's a few theorists suggesting that
I think when they finally reveal it they'll start working together
Yes.
Together.
I think it's showing us that they will have the power to overthrow this all
In the future flashes...
but Ruby and Aqua's will not end up like that.
Ai and Hikaru's relationship clearly was toxic
Like
I THINK THE PARALLELS ARE THERE TO SUBVERT THEM
SAME
,CVNIOIOVRMKVRMPVR
it's very explicit parallels but I think
very true,,,,
I knew at that moment that they were warning us that their father was a fucking serial killer and that he is closing in on them
THE FATHER
AND THEN BOOM
I WAS WONDERING WHERE IT WAS GOING
The thematic.... The aesthetic,,,, the symbolismmmmm
SAME
I could fit him in so many horrible ships tbh he's an amazing blorbo
<3
Screw any of the characters in series, he is mine /j
Aqua is my babygirl
*looks at the concerning amount of death flags Akane has*
Which he might get to experience very soon!
Yeahhh
If I'm going to be honest if Aqua's going to have an End game it'll probably be Kana
I would love to see it
Even though it won't happen
TBH
KONIBUYINOKML;,SD
Of course a Doctor is going to say that instead of completely turning her down so that she might have a chance at living
People are so braindead when they look at that reply
It's also not all that weird or gross to say Maybe if you're older cause she was literally dying. He definitely was saying it to give her something to look forward to in the future so she'd continue fighting her illness
make it happen people.
I need fics where she never died
I'm still fucked over the fact that she so desperately wanted to see them grow up
god poor Ai actually
yeah
they were 5
and mental illness
They've both got so much trauma
Poor gal
I may forget a detail or two but I'm caught up
dw!
Yesss
Cause to me it doesn't seem like he remembered much
of his past life
remember
How much does he actually
and
IT IS IMPLIED HE WENT THROUGH INFANTILE AMNESIA
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT
Actually
YEAH
it's so fucking great
The great thing about Oshi no Ko that even if it's silly you cry as you laugh
You can forget it sometimes
RIGHT THIS GUY WAS A DOCTOR
Tbf I was like in that moment
KLMJNIHBUINJKM,;
The trauma of a lot of things severely fucked him up
hard.
He regressed
Even if Aqua was older as Dr. Goro
MEANWHILE
It's the first time she's really lived
Ruby was still immature when she died and we see it reflected, she never had a chance to live so like that's also why
I think it has to do with their ages at death
YES
THIS
Based on her being a detective
I'd read a spin off
ALSO I WOULD LOVE THAT TOO TBH
Which is why he's particularly unhinged around them
are all his fp
for example Ai, Ruby, and Kana
and he just has very particular favorite people
Actually I could make an argument that Aqua has BPD
He needs to work through his issues before romance really happens for him
Still is!!
No, he was not romantically interested in Ai, he was just fucking mentally ill
Like respect but also Aqua didn't do as much as the nasty stuff as a lot of people claim he does
SHE FUCKING DIDN'T LMAO
LIKE
ALSO RUBY IS ACTUALLY GROSSER? Like when they were kids
and about their journey as Ai's kids
but the story is about aqua and ruby!
it's the stories driver
like
The real story isn't exactly the revenge stuff tho
I gotta know
how braindead of takes are we talking
Like
Oshi No Ko is good tho??
WHAT
HUH
ADORABLE
yea
I like how BronyaSeele are the couple that gets to kiss the most between all of the couples Hoyo has
also
Oh my god that's so clever mihoyo
BronyaSeele supremacy
THEY'RE GAY IN STAR RAIL TOO!!
We're simply too old for Baban
Cherry
honkai has rotted my brain, I thought you were talking about rita for a second and I got confused
I wish you luck.
So valid!
Makes sense
Yea!
so very explicit
apparently official eng translation does in fact use she/her
yeah!
but they haven't really put her in any skirts, despite putting Other characters in skirts
iirc
It's like she does express some interest in wearing feminine clothing
they can! but mkvrrv4rf
Arashi very pretty
He's funny tho, Tori, I don't think he's too annoying
LOL
just cause happy ele forces her to still wear pants doesn't mean shit
A lot of people try to claim she's not trans despite the fact that it couldn't be anymore obvious
This is Arashi!
Brat child is his personality
Idk what the official en translation is doing to her
dw dw
that's not a gacha character
well, and there's also Negi but
There's not only male characters, there's a trans girl in the cast
NICE
What in the actual hell is that
I see
**50??**
I see I see
Ahhhh
Wait, Tet's younger then me tho- by like a few months?
PFFFF
I'm turning 20 in May
Buddy...
Me?
NICE
Am I old to you guys
We used to be in a Servamp server together
Yeah
We used to talk
Well, maybe friends is an overstatement
She didnt know Honkai
I used to be friends with cloud_ya back when
Ydah
I think I like Ako more
I'm a bit late but lol
I like both Rinko and Ako
It kinda seems like they gave up ngl
I hate her
oooo
it's bird food
It's Bird Chop which means,,,,
together
all
you mix it
lol
birds?
this for
Is
bird chops?
I wish I could eat more things then just apples and beats and carrots
I have issues with fresh fruits and vegetables...
PFFF
I probably just need to figure out on getting more ingredients
*nods*
so valid
so valid
that's just me
I probably wouldn't use sour cream and the fresh green onions at the end
Inchresting,,,, I like potato...
I basically like all kinds of meat tho
I'll have to think about certain kinds of things I like and am okay with
Cherry, do you mind sharing some of your recipes?
ye ye
KJJl,kjn sdgtgfrb5tgvrf???
Oooo
HOWEVER, I am willing to try thing
My brain's gag reflex...
Textures
yeyeye
👀
it's just when you have food sensitivity it makes things difficult...
I'm okay at it but like, it's just pasta and rice and microwave
I need to learn more cooking
someday soon...
poor
just
I def need to be eating more f kjvdl
I like that too
RIGHT
i probably should be eating more meat though, it's just expensive
Like, sugar is not the enemy
also, I curse diet trends because all you really need is just,,,, figuring how much you need to eat and making sure you get in enough proteins and fiber
well, that's for sustainable-ish weight loss
I mean
without exercising
the right nutrition can also cause weight loss
true, but exercise matters the most.
If you want to loss weight, exercising is the best option
then what people think
A lot more
Either way, the amount you'd have to not be eating in order to loss weight by just eating less is
cause it tricks your brain
you put mildly cold and hot things alternating in a row on your skin and you feel intense pain
Straight up
No it's dumb
cause your body is pretty dumb
It actually just depends on how extreme you're doing it
yup!
I forget to eat
this is partially why I'm fat
You just gain weight
Then
So if you are eating but like,,,, Not enough to be eating the right amount
it'll hold onto your fat
What it does is that essentially, if your body doesn't think it's eating enough/if it thinks it's starving
ANYWAYS
Thought it might've been connected to a game
Idk
Irl it's kinda simple
Game wise or irl
What is with this game and can we get the girl and her cat a proper home.
Castle!
your sensei must be hitting their head against a wall rn
Gross
which, drop dead gorgous
Yea yea, that's what I wanted
Lemme see
:O
We've logged in the same number of days
or is it just that his last message was a long while ago
is bruh gone from the server?
daww
I think Diluc's more bird themed
Idk man
I have one Bingo
I dont consider myself Talented so lets get that straight-
Yeah i think so
I think it counts
Is it Commitment issues when you fully commit like immediately
Agreed
OMG WAIT I DIDNT SEE THSI ITS SO PRETTH
Gorou would be very stinky
yes
Tighnari would smell like flowers
Gorou has wet dog smell
This
You need fucking soap
that is not getting clean
That's still dirty
N- no
Tighnari would take frequent showers
To continue this, Tighnari is absolutely cleaner then Gorou, Gorou looks like he'd roll around in mud and the only thing he'd do to clean himself would be stand in the rain
Very valid
Valid
I hope you'd talk to me
she did!
I love your art
OMG
Oho
tai, that's just the board
Yeah? so ?
I hate floors that aren't carpeted
I don't like your floor tbh
69 eyyyyyyyyy
PFFFFF
It's okay, I like you and you also have a bf
You're crazy crazy huh
Yes
Less crazy then Cherry ig
Sure
Aight
perhaps
Pffff
I understand but please don't die
Tet is simping so hard
I am pink, it would seem
I tend to get the pink ones
Sure
Unsure about this but We'll go with it
LOL
23 out of 54...
pace
slow
at a very
I am also taking the proseka quiz
Hi
iormvprpmbt4t4g
Confident
Brain Eater
omg
that's a funny tierlist lol
uwu
*hugs both of you*
*pats Heki*
Yea?
I mean do it
Ahhhh I see I see
I don't wanna get outta bed
That's cause it is
I suppose I do say things are fine a lot and reassure people,but like
I do not consider myself a doormat
You don't need to be one tho
*pats* I'm aware
Imagine having an existence tied to others
Nothing with the words Sensible fits Heki so that makes sense
i see i see
Heki?
Sensible?
OINUBYV8CUKMO3FVR4
It's like a chicken
Egg is the stage before you figure out you're trans
Heki do you not know what Egg means
Oh, wait
Yet....
I c I c
Heki, are you sure you're not an Egg
lol
it is
nyaruhodo
only infj's? I feel like I have this stare
yeah,,,,,
I just can't help but feel everything will go wrong
yes...
Anxiety
And All I can feel is
A date today
I've got
yeah....
I don't like being like this
I mean, I might be, I feel like I seesaw between the two
*hugs Heki*
Love.... I don't think I'll ever truly experience it
Kinda feels like my emotions are weak candles
tbh,,,, I feel jealous of people who can feel things strongly for long periods of time
gl heki
Half-hearted
I think?
sorta? I mean,,,, I just don't have strong opinions
that's a bit much
Oh honey.
my opinions on myself are-
I mean, I am,,,, I think? The issue is is that I sorta don't really know myself that well sorta
Heki, are you alright??
further if need be
things
explain
I can also like
tru tru,
Def instinctual, although I might've made myself that way due to not wanting to do annoying things
oh yeah
oki
oho
I'm a walking contradiction
yeah
Like, I want to hide in my room and not have any social interaction but
Doing anything is a pain and I want other people to take care of me
i want to be able to live alone and sorta exist by myself but also
So like
I cannot be sure my responses are completely right as I'm someone who doesn't think
Here you go <3
and I forget my birthday
I've forgotten how to spell my name before
I forget basic things sometimes It's annoying
Also thanks
do you have a blank version
,,,,I don't think I spelled that right but for some reason my brain hates me rn
Maybe I like more conformation
I know I'm a 7 but like
I kinda wanna do that lil quiz too
Pf
gl
*pats* Happens to the best of us
I am just a normal mf and that makes me weird cause who is normal
The fact that I'm unperturbed everywhere and in a lot of scenarios
I think my normalacy *is* what makes me weird
I like observing them
Tbh
I think insane people are funny
I mean
Where have I been weird elsewhere I wonder 🤔
True
Oho
My own category
Or am I just
Who else is Normal like me
The fact that that almost spells out bruh is hilarioys
Although it could just more be that everyone else is so insane that I look sane by comparsion
I am the most sane fucker in arc city ....
Lol
Normal
,,,,I think if you were to describe me in this server I'd be
So valid
:O
What about me?
I got someone else
It'd be funny if like
Ye ue
You should
Accurate!
*pats*
Evil Women...
Tet, why do you think I downloaded
Women
Np! Youre welcomr
Yes+
While you hold the knife I mean, if you have to
Maybe sad music
It depends on what you feel conflicts with the feeling
Idol music or something really happy
Like
The brain can get Confused
I'd say listening to music with conflicting feelings might help a bit
Which is a good idea
It also helps to make sure you're in the right headspace
If you have intense violent urges like that when you hold something like that I suggest not holding it normally and to try to put some distance between yourself and the object
Uh
Oh shit I'm an hour late
Just Marriage, yes
I am unoriginal and only ship most of the canon stuff it would seem
Kiamei, Bronya/Seele, Elyden, uhhh

JDJDJDKD
It's more of a grey color but eh
I used to have pink hair (dyed it) and my eye color isnt necessarily too far from Yanfei's
OH NOOO
Now that I think about it
Yeah, def
I recently got Yae Miko on side and am happy
Yaeeeee
Omg hi heki
So,,, yeah
I will be as soon As I have money!
The funny thing about this is that I'm planning on Cosplaying as Yelan
LOL
We are both Bingus
Heki, I'm Yanfei
BFKEKFKEKD
HEKI??
Hu Tao
But I think I'd take Yelan over Hu Tak
Like them both tho
Idk
I'll take a Yelan, right here please.
I'll take a Yelan
Can I get someone who's more obsessed with me then I am with them? That would be great
Who is Yanfei's most popular ship
As for me
Very true since you're ely
Sounds about rigjt
Lol
***Fucking Monkey's????***
I WANT TO BE WHALE OR SOMETHING
WHY DO 4'S GET TO BE UNICORNS AND SHIT
:(
Bonobo?
Why am I a Monkey...
Oh?
I promise I'm better
Ahahaha, no girl, don't find a Yae Sakura
sCREAMING AND CRYINH
Yeah, no white haired girls
Oho
If I want to get obsessed with a girl I want to be sure I'll be able to do so safely
*googles how not to end up like Otto Honkai Impact*
I see I see
<:kannawaow:963350507655688212>
We're both cringe fails
I fail about as much when it comes to love as Otto so I can believe it
*falls facedown*
I am Otto
Hmmmmm, do you know compatiability stuff for ennegrams? And also what types generally like?
Yasss
Yea
Probably more of a 6 then a 1 maybe?
*nods*
Senti's so cool
Oho
I dont leave the house
I'm probably too shut in for most people to consider me a 7
I mean, to be fair
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Alhaitham feels like an 8 to me btw,,,, reading into it
Maybe hes a 7
True
Hard nut to crack...
Hmmm
Tbh, I feel like Tighnari is another 1?
But also eats random fucking mushrooms
He's functional
Or maybe they're husbands...
And his Boyfriend? (Tighnari)
Oho
He fails at telling Jokes so hard that they make me laugh
HE'S SO FUCKING FUNNY
YEAH
Type Cyno, tell me why I find him funny
Hmmm, as for typing characters....
Lol
JFKDKFKDD
Even now
Tbh
I would consider it
If I could go to Law School...
Lol
Oh sure!
For me I just want a reason to legally be able to roast people
I'm not complaining tbh
For me
It
I'm starting to feel like Yanfei is just
Actually
I even once wanted to be A Lawyer
Like my voice, my personality...
Interesting
Which is
People keep assigning me as Yanfei
Pfffff
Out of all of those characters which do you think is closest to me?
I see
KLEE JFKEKFKFF
Mobius and Pardo...
So valid
Yea yea
I like to know what others would assign me
What Honkai and or Genshin character do you think I'm most like?
Oh, btw, considering my typing and such
Yeah, Yanfei makes sense as a 7
So valid
I get the feeling that 7's don't limit themselves
Nahida.... I think she limits herself too much to be a 7
Kokomi is a 5, I agree
Yeah, I just look at the types and go Hella
So valid
Nahida and Kokomi... I cannot imagine being 7's
Although, my favourite genshin characters are def not 7's
You def are
OMG
So valid
Like,,,, I'm insane so I like other insane people
I've learned to embrace my fucked up ness I think
I see, I think the thing is
Ahhh
Cause I've looked at a database with characters ennegrams and like,,,, Some of my favorite characters are also 7's
Btw
Do 7's tend to like their own type a lot?
ALSO YOIMIYA YESSSS
Yea yea
But I think it's actually a reflection of my 7-ness
Oh, I do do a lot of the things 5's do as well now that I think about it
*nods*
Cause the more I read about 9's the more I realized that I'm wayyy too lazy and honestly self absorbed for that
This is why I def think I'm a 7
Lol
Ever!!
I dont want to get up!!
Like, yes!!
I love it when people take care of me and do everything for me
I hate being sick but like
I love excuses to not do anyrhing
That's the dream
I also know a one and yeah
JDJDJDKDK Yeah
Hmmmm
Ah
HEY, CAN THAT ONE PERSON HELP ME OUT
Learned that one!!
Although If 5's is being constantly daydreaming then !!
I cannot produce easily man
Lol
How to structure tho
,,,
So valid
NDJDJDKDK
Lol
What can 7's learn?
*nods*
Slightly
I think I know what you're talking about,,,
