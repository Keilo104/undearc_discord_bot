<@416445660443967491>
Sometimes the bags are stapled though but like nothing as fancy as that
That's about it
It's just a plastic bag or a paper bag, both usually with a container
States doesn't do that at all
Peeka
But they can retcon anything so
Isn't it written in story they're small forever
Roza and lili
Well
All the lolicons will quit

He's literally just  I listen to bigger whales so you're wrong
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
From an entertainment perspective this is hilarious
From a modding perspective the guy should've been banned
Useless mods as usual
I actually backread to this
Tap button go monke
I use frr in raids LOL
Marisa forgot to mention (maybe he'll do it later) but Dorms have been heavily revamped.

Dorm buffs are now only based on your dorm level (not tied to ranking up individual valkyries), and dorm levels have been raised from 38 to 45.

The icons are in order:
HP
ATK
DEF
Total Damage ???
Phys Damage
ALL Elemental Damage
Reduce Elemental Damage Taken

And you can see what levels give what buffs.
Does this still matter?
Didn't they rework dorm
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Everyone is gonna SS day 1 again

🌽🥜
i still dont have a good bio dps <:deadge:975652771082698782>
but swords was buffed
this was true
though tbf
i feel like hos 3 set or sasc was overrall better
the main reason people used this was sp
~~for glb~~
It's like 4 or 5 years old now
Different times
Truu
Based on these, not much uploads
Same team scores ~700 now and s2 hrb blows that out of the qater
At 481D
9S was 774+ with dupes
Bruh



<:worryPitchfork:791025339043676210>
So long as I can combo with her
Af
Man that's right
Don't herrscher only get those
Dudu's seem to stick around
Jesus
It's been 7 months
<:kianaheart_hh:834878885082038362>
But I also like using hof
I kinda miss when we did it with hof
Yee
It's like the fastest boss imo
Should be easy to play though, not worried about that
I might demote though lol
Literally everyone is gonna have ranked pe Seeley and SSS prom
I have pe, I just mean that it's it's a rl boss
It's actually over (for me)
Why
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Are you fucking kidding me
You can't kick Eden out of that team really, and you can't kick cn out of fire

I think they're gonna do for fire and lightning element specific supports and call it a day, like how they kicked ae out

But who knows what the dps options will be <a:bcaPatientlyWaiting:764167633234559016>
They release an sp lightning valk that forces htr out
Just maybe
But maybe
I can't really speak to lightning team though <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Fire needs an update, bad. 
The best fire valk is still somehow hof...
Da no timestop, vil is more qua boss, and hfi is a hof sidegrade solo
Outside of argent knight, all fire bosses have not scaled well with the rising disturbance
Imo
They would do a fire or lightning valk before they did another Ice
there's no way nyx doesn't get another battlesuit right
So like
No 1.7
its so good lol
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
there's no free rides on this train
i'd highly suggest funding me
thats the p2w aspect
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
the biggest thing is opener
exactly lol
yeah
<:Deadge:1073469031513862214>
cost is redundant too from what i've seen
imo
sp/s does nothing for her
<:8Jerry_Shock:934876792093835364>
Where was this earlier
Ffs
After 18 patches
Could also schizo it

Jades are the lowest they've been
This time I think wood and jades are the wave
Mega scam yeah
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
why are you doing this to yourself lol
from what i've seen
or you dont have her and you cant clear
you either have kira and its a non issue
is a literally nothing mechanic i think
you mean the new boss?
Keilo allowed they're retired
Story skippers
Not sure tbh
<:higotheretardest:663877479546486784>
Amazing
seele literally deleted hs's sp problems

It's okay I did too

its really and truly a terrible tutorial
time*slow*
it can lol
yes
yes
a lot of supports now with this lol
i mean there's like
sushang?
ult entry animation isnt but the actual ult is
ult seems to have timestop
im really surprised they went with the stacks though
boss shouldnt matter this early
i mean the overall gameplay
but playing her in general
well yeah
ngl
that feels like it'll be awkward to play
<:TE_PepeLaugh:898642659743260783>
Too slow for the fast paced gameplay tho
Isn't that basically hof

Lol
^
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
If this is what it takes to kill trio
But yeah should be type counter plus hit count
A boss that cn has never played.

It was literally aponia or die
Is what I mean
The last time we had this boss, it was type counter weather and we got the paralyze version instead
Assuming this is the right clock, kind of not really if you're still looking for an answer
~~inb4 the intern fucks up again~~
I'd honestly argue she's some of the more complex ones in recent history

For 6.1?
we do the patch after
well
we usually dont?
which should slow timer
well, all sus ani is, is moves that behave the same as time fracture without causing time fracture (so doesn't trigger tf qte)
yeah
once she ults
i think pardo too
gd, htr, maybe sirin (elf)
same
suspended animation
Why is one drum one bar
Yeah
I'll manually search
You know how far back that is
Wtf
Reads like it anyway
Looks like it replaces holmes for general phys
They need this to not stack

MID: Team deal +20% Physical DMG against Bleeding enemies. Host’s attacks inflicts +25% more Bleed trauma.
LOL
Does more damage than non SSS BKE on bleed hos
I really don't want to pull
Do we know the gear skills?
She's a dps confirmed, correct?
Bet
<@453263261467410442>
I forgot she existed
This is the first ever valk that i skip
I think
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
yeah
combo dmg stonks, ult dmg not stonks
most every hit feels impactful
you gotta adjust for the lack of s2 but the animations are smooth and fluid
i like mei a lot
fun
havent touched the event or dps test yet
i dont really wanna mald ma
i did er and abyss
no whats up
They don't do more than 2 valks a patch
Most likely
cause i did those
oh you mean beta?
whats up
tomorrow
up to 3! and if you want to go even further beyond there's an extra s
completely optional!
just ignore the ones with an extra s
just reinstall honkai and you can try as much as you want!
its ma but 1 less s
yeah
<:02shrug:809888510143496264>
Maybe huodou
Not on parv
<a:PoyoyoApprobClap:857225566435672136>
I could see that
<:PeepoSupreme:1053548021650038875>
At 480D
Dabber 2* is pretty good
Yeah, the CD is what you want
It's a lot more dmg basically
You ever use 2* Ely elf vs 3* Ely elf
Or sirin or dabber or wedge
But that sounds right
Which is even more
4* is also 8* tdm
I mean
This is probably the most fun I've had in a long time
Yeah
And low cd
Kiana elf op
LOL
Though I doubt it's just that
Elf is a good chunk of dmg
Ah
I couldn't figure out 810+
What was the score
Everything dies way too quickly
With this low D
Kinda hard to test caps
500D soon
I don't pay attention to beta
I didn't
It seems
Trio rot
Bronya weapon >> Attack (to get 2 stack) >> Ult to mech >> Combo atk >> Ult to Kiana QTE
Kiana QTE >> Weapon >> Combo atk >> Mei QTE
Mei QTE >> Weapon >> Dash >> Combo atk >> Ult to Kiana QTE
Kiana QTE >> Weapon Active >> Combo atk >> Time fracture >> Ultimate

REPEAT
Upgrade them all
LLLLL

if im understanding right
how should u plan for next patch
and it says what you should do if you can't collect the trio
I just showed up with ss lol
I didnt say a word when y'all were shitting on vil
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>

Ew
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Oh
So I might pull that
I have 73 pity rn
Hmm
Oh s2 in 50 pulls for her huh
Yeah, they gimped her
Because you'll use elf more than you'll use the valk
I generally grab elf ranks before valk ranks
I'm gonna s0 everyone and get 4* elf prob
I pulled s0 HTR I'm f2p
I don't even have funds
~~isnt she already dead at s0?~~
i wonder what else she uses
<:meisip:833970844958720010>
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
cause base was meh
then her battlesuit dropped and got 2 dlc packs
oh i mean in story
pretty sure they retconned the story (or rather, redid it) to introduce her, made her seem super op in story
that's about right lol
but thats a boomer thing
if anything the character people would hate is dudu
im fine with every character in this game so far
i don't
that would just make you mei in genshin?
its almost like if they considered her a herrscher they'd announce her as such
herrscher <a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
Announcement:

New Herrscher Character - Herrscher Of Finality Kiana
New S rank Character - Herrscher Of Origin Mei

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Remember ae evades
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
Yeah hofin takes that
Ic ic
It's already built in
Since ai chan does the ignite
What does the rot with hof look like nowadays
Each poece works separately
She *can* be
Oh I misread this
She should be perfectly fine without i think
Yes
You spent?
I did nothing
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
.im Raiden Mei
So I'm not worried
I've seen a healthy mix
S2 and SS there
Kek yeah
Even enough for nirv
Anything beyond s0 is myriad
Yes
Jk idk what happening
Common mei L
<a:downbadhic:1008015831722102854>
take me out and set me free
end me
do it
🙂
to be nice
lol
just pull htr
you can
<:WOGGIES:434310250737303562>
or for mei or for something to happen *outside* of er
some people wanted hoc to do more
oh, for sure
yeah
LMFAO
and idk what to think about this arc so far
no attachments to elysium everlasting
i liked kolosten
it feels like we're just kicking a can waiting for them to be herrschers
for number 4, i wouldnt say story rushed per se but
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
tought process
you can say this
at literally any point in the game
number 3 i mean
and stopped lol
i got to hoo downgrade
LOL
me lol
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
^yeah this
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
everyone else is saying its ugly lol
i see, okay
cause basically people that get it say the same thing you do
since most not from cn wont appreciate it
how do you feel about the cny spending event skin
oh ruby that reminds me
esp looking at carv's background on them
i dont really have a problem with the suit
i havent gone in there today
oh, maincord
first im seeing it today
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<a:aworryPopcorn:470253910750396417>
im hoping for salt
@ nini is the funder here
i dont even have funds wtf
i did nothing
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
i mean the ghost ping
i saw all of that yeah
<a:AA_Ping:648745176088444928>
This happens too often tbh
<:02shrug:1001147147703562260>
The chart?
As I've said before I think s0 is good enough for nirv, s2+ are myriad rankings
It's not bad
8 sp, 5% tdm boost, enemies take 5% more damage
<:sad:854800429572554753>
I don't even have 2 pennies
I did for you dw~
one example if you want to backread from here
but yeah it seems that way lol
it was in cn-gameplay and honkai-vent for a bit
cause a lot of it was they'll get more in cny than we will
and i dont think they realized its anni
yeah
glb got this early, not fair etc etc the usual
the usual glb/sea anni stuff
people are actually so mad about this in official lol
prob for glb anni though
someone posted this in official
They just like you fr
<:whiphic:662935173847056394>
Get to it
<@704867526877904908>
<a:praygirl_hh:757338631747928161>
I got it
3s if you want the 40 sp like hos
but it seems s2 > ss are the stopping point
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
will they bait ss pullers to ss2
now the real question
ss unchanged
the ice dmg got moved to ss1
vid above goes through each rank, but s2 is cracked now
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>

Pretty solid imo
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
Not sure if this goes here so pls delete if not but anyone can read/tl this?


It's HoF all over again
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
Nice fire patch
idk if this is the place for it but
prob bchip
Yeah
Phys breach when
On hos it's a bit more damage on plume
Same
I think for adv you need the full 100
I actually can't tell it's really blurry
I think this is new hoc too?

P2 is literally just the core
Can I post bull gameplay here?
Good to know
6S in er is pretty cool ig
Oic
I saw husk and went to the robot
Wtf is the new husk
Wait guys there was more
<:BaelzNeuronActivation:942144690671734815>
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Oh wrong ping
?
But 7T is legit busted
Eh, I think the timestop was needed
Ic ic
Who even topscores?
That emote is scuffed
Keilo
Beetle?
Why lol
Interesting
Oh that's what it looks like
Otherwise you're locked into the 4 ults rot
Yeah if you're strong enough to one shot core
Brb
New bosses?
Okok
And no info on Carole's
Prob right?
Is griseo costume paid?
2 pris
The new gloves
Did I miss anything else though
Mkp holmes
I think fragile did
You can
It shouldn't matter
Wait but mkp doesn't give sp
You didn't do er
Yeah
I forgor
Actually does mkp give sp
Yeah ss doesn't have an sp problem <a:runfast:959995921305829466>
It's strong for what it's designed for ig
35% damage on img enemies + 20% phys on ult
So that's what, hod and fgo?
Prob not
Nice
So like gaming mouse or cflare
Pog
Oh
<:terikmshic:637305536202670093>
So gauntlets bronya weapon and Eden pri huh
If you mkp Holmes hos
Mkp replacement?
It seems like
Like
Idk what to think of them
I saw the gauntlets
2020 stig huh?
Wow
It's dumb lol
Just looked it up
It actually does seem really strong for HT
To make sure she outscores?
Aponia
What is it even for
I'm actually so annoyed
I'd rather 3 sp valks again
This is bs
Double > single > double > double
<:ew:960016221636530206>
So 6.3 is double pri *again*
Are you fucking kidding me
i wonder how the trio will do standalone
ya
but idk
if you had to pick i'd go bronya tbh
but fuck dude i dont wanna ss
way more value than ai chan
elemental support
if she
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but it seems i gotta get her
i also dont want bronya
excuse me sir, i believe you have pinged the wrong person
<@385655541248163840> is our resident financial consultant, she'll provide you the funds you need
didn't see any earlier
not sure
Something like that
more sp management required since ult I think Is higher cost (not sure)
v2 is weaker overall, but you do more dmg outside ult
From what I understand







Yeah
Oh nqn dead
:DeadFischl:
I see
What's up
Barely
It's bull shit
I mean
(if they start doing sss full ma)
sss otto sss heph sss couatl in one week

i cant even do one
wtf

?
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
its been so so much worse
since the new recruits came from genshin
and from maincord
yo
wow
its actually real
Less planning <:Jingliucozy:1116649307353911306>
Yee everything happens instantly
I'll take it
Is it wedge good
I like the instant cast vs pre cast that we have to do for stacks
Makes sense
That's why I was confused by the 2*
Do you have dabber btw?
I see
Right
Tl erroes
Technically molasses
Well
Yee
Different people but she took her name to make Kira feel better
The niggurath that died in 2E has red hare but her body was inhabited by the sugars, the same ones from the bubble universe durandal stabilized
She did
I think it's more like 90% likely tbh
Same models same mannerisms
Just never 100% stated though you can infer it <:deadge:975652771082698782>
She had her time in 2019 <a:aKKAlphaStinky:764343439725953046> bring her as an sp
That would make sirin our WT valk
The real question is WT in 6.9 or sw style banner later
The model is already done
100% she will be
Misdirections <:worryPopcorn:411066690021883915>

Looking forward to seeing the reactions when people play for the first timw
1.5 chapter writing already better than 1.0 <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
i dont have a source i stole it from someone who didnt source it either <a:runfast:959995921305829466>
Get their ass carv
Is this all explained in the animation or
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
Should this be spoilered
ty carv
nevermind found my answer, carv already explained this in maincord
I understand this much: 
why some Herrschers are weaker than others, specifically - because a Herrscher needs to undergo Metamorphosis to stabilize their core/gem, which no HoR did, And the reason is because the Core of Reason was solidified in a different way than other Herrscher cores. I wanna know *how* she did it specifically to get the HTR suit. 
i played through it but slightly confused: she made the core accept her instead of the opposite (like how she and previous HoR has always done) to wield the power to transform?
can anyone story wise explain how bronya became htr for me in the latest chapter?
pog
for chapter breakdowns and stuff
carv would you recommend homu labs as a reference
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
oh, the mod there is also a bird
<a:yoimiyagun_hh:913803575690420224>🐦
time to build her and rm at the same time
got it
?
i assume salsa
for clara
whats planar
waste of time
thats with thief too
oh god thats right
which is fine
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
that means going back in that domain though
yeah i've seen that too
can use clara topaz now
i have her lc too <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
thats right
<@416445660443967491> guess who i got from standard
Been out of town
I still haven't touched it
Nice!
Dalao
yep yep
imo yes
she shouldnt need it, assuming she uses bronya in the jingliu team
see
its why you see like 25/250
yeah ice dps is stupid lol
?
any more is overcapping
+ rutilant set
50 from transform alone + 12 from fx is already 62
same as yq
like 20-30
^^^^^
e6 is a lot of dmg tho
<a:modcheck:926226465782132736>
~~neither was anything after e2~~
why did they stop at e5
insane
The latter
I think that's fine
Ahh
I don't know what event you mean lol
Yeah what tet said
Gresham's in the middle of something <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:KanaMFW:1129793835975856198>
I'd give you mine but it's in the grave
Always using skill
Plus pela
The robots that shield
Yes
Crying
for most accs imo
if you're not planning on building the char
yeah
imo
anything above 2 pulls is a waste of mats
then why is this a question lol
you have to have the char no
then why ask about even pulling mei
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
name 1 standard char better than ruan mei for your account
i think thats fine but if you hate a lc enough to bitch about it i'd expect you to at least know the name of it
whats this one
is that why your seele does no dmg
not read the light cones you use??
do you just
you're joking right
its just 36% cd
making it a waste
knowing you you'll prob pull lc on rerun
but yeah i wouldn't sacrifice a new char at the cost of slightly upgrading a current one
im jsut trying to see the logic behind pulling a lc for a char vs 30 pulls for a new character
or swordplay
do you not have only silence remains though
if you stack the buffs
its like the second best option
your herta cone is on seele right
do you even use him
<a:WhatBlink:402587805869408266>
?
i forgot about that
ohh
the predator
tet chatted about it too briefly
here lumi
the fastest would prob be to do plane 1 boss then reset
its the rarest options <:deadge:975652771082698782>
like if you get the 3 trotters card, thats a hunt option (if hunt is your chosen path at the time)
or from any in game options
yeah
<a:miarave:1170139621259231296>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i still refuse to do predator/80 turns/etc
its def easier
a while ago
oh i got elation first
its the same thing but wish i saw his first
nakfrg apparently did a vid here on it .
but yeah drag > tp > drag > tp > etc until done
and that should be all 6
so that you have time and freedom to go to boss and grab a huohuo
then lead them here
so just drag . teleport . drag until all 5 are below
and when you teleport it makes them stay where they were when they were chasing you
you want to use teleports because if they lose aggro they reset postion
you want to go to the ramp to the two enemies and try to pull them down
and one on this ramp
2 below
2 up top
to the left are 5 enemies
here
lemme load up game i'll show you
yukong and teleports
2 from jingliu 3 from swarm 2 from dialog missing total, plus the 400 caverns/stagnant etc
516 now
<a:miarave:1170139621259231296>
i did the huohuo one
just popped up

<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
From a fast clear (0-1c) standpoint
Which enables so many things
It's spd
At 75 pity
Yeah
For me
Hh is either skip or e1
I haven't pulled
It's always just barely not enough at e2
Her energy pisses me off
Giving topaz er rope and giving her back atk boots
I'm low-key considering
Just barely okay but I fucked over him and topaz
My jy is
Dude
Told you
It doesn't seem strong until like s5
I referring to why use that over like the herta one
People use that one?
I think mine is 3.2k atk, 75/187 or smth
But can't auto with her
I feel like qq has more raw damage though, in my experiences
Now that she built she hits okayish
Yeah Seele is my go to autoer
Qq nation rise up
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Well that's cause qq is better
That kinda matters too
No bronya's right?
Lol
F2p lc
~~at least they're not lolis~~
enemies are tankier and deal more dmg too
yeah they changed
You could do that too aye
For e2 lunae/ting/luocha +1
The swords are fucking tanky lol
Actually not true
Ic
Oh what
check pins in leeks
mhm
omg adventurine piece
seele got targeted bad
auto almost killed me
omg lol
Help me
And max pela ult
Need to finish kafka > gui > sw > sampo
Rn i'm in the talent minmaxing game
But one day
Not anytime soon
One day I'll build him
I'm doing what this guy did for my Luka


Real
He *can*, but it's eh
Give to Luka or something
<a:nomballs:1056949905127637002>
<a:TE_monkaSTEER:797886659039199252>
im just along for the ride
specifically this part:

IL's skill description says the skill doesn't consume sp because the consumption is on his basic itself

Which is a direct upgrade to qingque consuming sp on skill and doing nothing on basic

It's one way for them to cuck qingque in case they ever want to make an IL set but prevent qq from using it
they work differently
and potential to have a skill point specific set (that only he can benefit from fully)
<a:AINTNOWAY:1072381924343037972>
I can't believe yt lol
This guy had sus thumbnails for furina people I think
<:MumeiNaruhodont:879945488529514536>
Nice
1 x5
1 x 10 and I think another x 10
They give jades like twice
first im hearing of it
im so broke
actually 2
damn nice
ssg
3
i have like
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
i level up too much chars not to
ah
i can barely afford it with the 1020 needed for tracks/tickets
what the
they gave a boatload of mats this time yeah

idek what to do with mine lol
also valid
then start farming for rm
i wanna max sw and kafka traces
yeah im going back to trace hell
<:PeepoSupreme:1053548021650038875>

I just woke up
Did you figure it out yet
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
i upgraded him to hp orb
did you see blade
neko
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
like maybe 3 max usable relics
ten double planar runs
idk if it is but it feels like it
lowkey for me it feels better
<@385655541248163840> which
ignore cr cause im rolling e2 when he comes back
left is current right is previous
It read like you used it
O
75 pity
I tried ngl
A
But saving now
That's what eli is using
Otto's works too
The Clara one I thought
Since shared feeling s5'd and... The event lc already work well on her
If it means not pulling lc
But I'd much prefer the 4T ult
S3 post op does the same thing
But yeah lc makes it easier to 3T ult
Fun backread
<:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>

Holy shit this is tilting

That I have
Use char you don't have
Now its
<:Deadge:1073469031513862214>
Ffs lol
Instead of who do you have, did you try this
I don't understand why people just use unit you don't have every answer
<@385655541248163840> why is it always the mfers who don't read
only remember these other two anyway
thats the last one i think
yeah there's an *abundance* of solid lcs
Than 1/4/2/10
5/8/8/8 looks cleaner
And max the most important of the 3
I'd fill out flat stats and 5/8/8/8 main usually
I think she's 4T ult is why I asked
Rip
Feels stale ig
Yeah I could see that
How often do you ult
Prob spd
How fast is she already
So true bestie

Blade > Kafka (collecting dust)

Dhil> fx (<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>)

I enjoy the men more in this game ig
Why not
I hate watching it too
Real
I'm male only puller
I think after hanabi drops

Sobbing
Wtf
Every dot piece has cracked crit

Nor would full SPD set
I don't think break effect would matter on her
Survivability
2 hp 2 spd
Probably the same as every other support
I wouldn't take that tet
If it were me
More jing yuan drama mostly lol
Reddit is on fire rn
~~he never left~~
Yeah
Speedyun is a locked to a shieldyun
Cause this isn't even with hacker
But there was a 200 floating around
Normal def isn't 8 minimum per piece
not mine obv but insane
It's a lot yee
<:segsgodhic:929368144563273798>
<a:modcheck:926226465782132736>
Were you not one already
To not overshoot pity
Asking because some people actually single pull
What spend level are you lol
<a:wdance:938285446155366440>
Imo
Imk
But yeah to answer you huohuo would be the more universal pull for that specific team
Lynx is hard to solo sustain with
That sounds like you should die less
Because both are luxury imo
What does your acc need more
Huohuo good for teams that have more than 1 attacker
~~i wouldn't have rolled that~~
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>

Emergency skill or something maybe for an ally who's targeted who has no health
Ah
And save Ulta for grabbing the fire
Should be fine
Luocha fire mc ting dhil

Use fire mc skill to draw taunt and play around that
That should work
Or someone to draw aggro like fire mc
Do you have ty by chance
<:Fubuki_Grabby:828297136927801374>
Sold

<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>

REAL
but there's a lot of enemy waves
there's a blood code somewhere early  in that area
no they stopped messing around once you hit that area
reminded me of anor londo
its very aesthetically pleasing
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
its longgg
i completely forgot about that map
ohhh right right
decent cr and solid speed

its pretty solid
the planars are *cracked*

Blood borne PTSD <:deadge:975652771082698782>
i surpassed the legend himself

LMFAO

☠️
How do you think blade did it
<:jeify:1164798909789503538>
Sobbing
How to fix
Yee
But in game it's definitely 510
I think it said 487 last time
Can you re-add me on there
Which site
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Real
I think it wasn't supposed to be possible yet
They were too busy memeing
They weren't
And I refuse both
That and the abundance achievements are all that's left for swarm
<a:bcaPatientlyWaiting:764167633234559016>
I'm still waiting for predator to be realistic
From what I heard yeah
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Cause no jingliu or huohuo
I can't do the huohuo one
Mf isn't even out yet
Some people are selecting argenti's quest
Event rushers
<a:AINTNOWAY:1072381924343037972>
And guinaifen is amazing
She gets really fleshed out
But I was tempted
No
It's so good
I powered through the event last night
I'm 510/527 or whatever the cap is now
😭😭
Okay I take this back
<:kekhands:699566615854841876>
The what
** REDACTED **
<a:AINTNOWAY:1072381924343037972>
it was a joke
this game
before he summons his stand
srs answer is jy's ult line is time for the master stroke
sobbing
im at 65 pity again
im saving too
she's cute
im tempted ngl
So you don't need to run through it over and over
Yeah
Wtf lol
<a:modcheck:926226465782132736>
Do people just not have jobs
already er rope
wow
game is up
I like to get breakfast at least when I'm traveling so i got familiar
Full board is all meals
Half board hotel is breakfast and dinner
Nice
Isn't there someone that speaks German here
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
How fucking long is the word
I'm like running out
Cottage?
Resort technically but also wrong
I thought of hospice or mosque

But both are wrong
I think this word started with an h
That feels like this
Cause a half board hotel has dinner and breakfast
Do they mean staying?
Half board?
Then I reread
I thought it was brunch at first
But sure lol
I've been out of school for years
About what
<a:PepeStepBro:1047270333419368448>
My chars feel naked if I don't have their lc
That works too
I should've just pulled 3 s1
I did this and I hate it lol
I feel like erudition has maybe 3 good purple cones, but every single one feels like it needs superimposed
Give up breathing
Esp your jy team
Huohuo will be very good for your acc
I think
All abundance cones pretty good
Yeah unless your name is nini or Gresham just use an alternative <a:patpat:943375983002677290>
^
For her
I think the event lc will be fine
I wouldn't pull healer lc <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Hold this king 🇱
She kinda did that when she gutted him
Pins
Outclasses mine
Hers just
Same
Yeah yesterday
It literally just reset
Oh is that how he works
She synergizes well with him
Which you do
And if you have jing
Any char that has a high cost ult is good imo
Once every 4-5 turns
However, your ult is only gonna be like
And cleanse on skill
She gives energy and damage to your characters on ult
Natasha lynx and bailu
Silver wolf is who I mean
Her value diminishes
I feel like, if you have a lot of dps
Most here will prob say silver wolf
Got my priorities straight
I'm skipping because rumor is there's a blade rerun and I want eidolons
I thought about it though
No
??
en went hard
And I'd rather rip the band aid off personally, do it all at once and play other games
<:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>
I like no timegate because there's no excuses to not do content
💢
@ hei @ ruby
Those are better than mine too wtf
She's going to block him
It's the potential tho
He was wiped by asta
Oh nvrmind
<@416445660443967491>
<:AiStronk1:811537909642428436>
She's low-key hard
Gg for right choice
That's the direction the game was hinting toward choosing
The game kinda pushes you toward a direction
Follow your heart
What to do what to do
<:jeify:1164798909789503538>
Screaming
<:EZ:945704815751741570>
You got this
She's easy carv
<:smugBitch:1137262042017955921>
I just manually input what I need in star rail station
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
Jk gl
Best I can do is flat hp sorry
was related to the same link
apparently 1 gacha erudition = erudition bad
scroll up a tad
bruh
but too much content
fontaine brought me really close
the only thing i remember about genshin abyss was the zoo
that was like 3 years ago though

i feel like most of it is enemies wasting time now?
and we'll all be free
surely he means the servers will shut down
c6 itto is a monster
my guy it isnt even 2.0
eruditions last hope
that reminds me
yo
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
until we get more follow up attackers
from what i've seen, yeah
i dont own clara
i do
and topaz
my seele rn
Eww
She may be
Who do you think would be fun
True
O
I'm surprised you didn't build
Gepard?
That you care for
Who's left
Eidolons make up for it
Issok
My topaz kinda mid
Yeah <a:Smoge:808844088115068938>
O
?
I'd enka but I like my honkai men rail one rn
Might as well
I'm gonna check my chars
Actually
<:sus:1047728839826079764>
I think mine is like.. 3/11?
Say that again
Ahh
JK still great
2 more rolls in crit and I would
Oh pinned
2069 or something
Ein is like
I still remain second lowest uid here
330434
Wtf
Is that 10 SPD on the rope
Salsa, interesting
<a:SeelePat_Shizue:952770597883113522>
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
Nice nice
Yee
Nope
But yeah enka hsr shows the exact decimals
Wild
Enka would show decimals
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
131 even?
160-(115*1.25)
131 or 132, either is fine
I though hunt was 115
I believe so
Max it
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Not anymore tho
My qq actually used to have 21 spd in subs
See <@416445660443967491>
Just something I hear on reddit and other servers
Not that anyone here has said that
Something something speed subs impossible
Otherwise attack yeah
I'm assuming 0 subs
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Non e2 wants spd
Ohh right
I would give you mine if I could
<:Sadi:938597219743989800>
Just roll 12 cr on every piece <:clueless:973756617109676032>
Weirdge
I guess the ehr
What
Sw cone bis?
24% attavk
Maybe space sealing?
I still haven't used that event lc
<:ashCook:1149879186652151838>
?
Pela
Is that a welt cone on
but both work
SPD preferably
<:madge:826898161334222859>
Or he could've been a clara
If he came earlier he'd be my img DPS and I wouldn't have dhil
I'm kinda annoyed I got him tbh lol
<:kekhands:699566615854841876>
I can't build him
I'm literally out of tracks of destiny
<a:peepoBlush:1124743727303364720>
My welt has a 5:50
Gg
Yeah not bad
But tbh I don't mind that
In this game you can't off set either
Welt uses cd chest iirc
Yeah I'm with Eli lol
Roll it
<a:bcaPatientlyWaiting:764167633234559016>
<:SaluTao:1046248230192697354> <a:petCarv:990307540610990100>
<:Guinaifen_Cheer:1151319530119905290>
But nothing crazy
Only other notable one imo is e6
E1 can be nice, it's 10% eff res reduction
Guinaifen?
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
Nice
And you don't care for huohuo, argenti, ratio or ruan Mei right
Yeah
E1 seele is only 15% crit on enemies <80% health
Can you live with a c1 of either if you get spooked early
You already have both
Ah
What's your pity on gui banner
True yeah
Imo you'll get way more mileage
But guinaifen cute
Bronya is the smarter play
Time to get more pulls
<@416445660443967491> look
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>

It's just rare
You can
<a:37cheerhic:1125778342239539312>
lowkey those were kinda hard
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
Nice nice
?
lunae died on cocolia <:kekhands:699566615854841876>
okay mostly done
dhil is STUPID lol
eli and tet helped
yeah lol
<:letcook:1083029418185859133>
so enemies literally never move
because immediately advance after ult
e2 lunae is stupid lol
okay you guys were right
im assuming yes
this one right
sub dps seele to generate skill points for qq
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
i dont own fu xuan
sir
okie
o
got it
do i need double harmony
nice
wait this is useful?
ty
i'll alternate then
would dhil work too or is it just qq
didnt even think of that
are you serious lol
is that it
whats the secret
for the planar event
how are you guys getting 100k
they wanted you to share some feelings carv
feels like its high <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
idk how high the chances of the one spawning is though
specifically because trotters gives you an extra one
look for reward domains imo
<a:AINTNOWAY:1072381924343037972>
if you care enough to spreadsheet it
this was the chart i was looking for nini
i hate this too lol
this is a bad chart but it shows which ones at least
some of the hunt options are in p2 and p3
it does
and ipc event
trotter was one i think
yeah that too
if you wanted to speed it up just clear phase 1 then quit after boss
but hunt is the rarest
20 hunt dialogue options
Sounds like me
Rippp
Yes
<:7Csoontm:628344479178424330>
I ran out of tracks of destiny too
Help
22 million
I need
Keep your kinks to yourself
Did you try breaking the plant
Make it an hour
<:Deadge:1073469031513862214>
Only asking because I didn't think it mattered too much if she's around
Do you have bronya?
Relics <:Deadge:1073469031513862214>
Don't you have fuxuan
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
Imagine not autoing moc
wth is this
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
Everyone complaining about luofu
No one complained about belobog
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
Iirc 5% Regen rate and 40% adv forward?
Err
So I guess 4 stars is an any element game
<:Madge:821066878482645013>
There's no precedent anymore wtf
But yeah he looks good
I can't believe them actually named a char ratio
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
Okay I can't afford her
Mei?
Who was dropped first?
You gonna take that
She called you forgettable
What the hell
O
But not sure
I wanna say no cause separate entities
Oh then just do whatever Eli does
I'd say left cause you don't have e1 or s1 lc
?
Oh is this topaz
Are you using keel
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Like 201 after casting ult fast
Since she's like as fast as possible anyway
I honestly just would leave fast
How slow is slow
E4?
What is your asta
But idk if I wanna pull
Meaning perma uptime on enhanced numby
So theoretically you can 2T ult with er rope
Every time numby attacks
5 energy
I haven't been home lol
Scroll from here
<:GACHA:950141007767416832>
Yeah heki didn't read the passive
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
If acc seed real ID rather my 5* rate
I expect no purples on average
Issok
The only thing eidolons do is decrease the stacks for follow up from 5 to 4 at e6 and ult dmg at e1
It's his passive
Why wouldn't it
Hmmge
Low-key I kinda just want e2 too
Looks better in practice
I'm gonna swap to SPD boots for topaz
<@416445660443967491> <@213811388546678794> I'm changing my mind
If you don't have
It's a nice boost but you'll need ehr subs
Lol
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
They just took a while to come it seems?
You still won most 50/50s
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
So like polar opposite nini
I do have this tho, from before I pulled topaz
I can share then if you want
I'm not home until late Sunday
<a:Smoge:808844088115068938>

<:Topazyay_TZM:1165230744667443301>
Nice
It's topaz time
You all had your fun with jingliu
E1s1 yep
I literally pulled then uninstalled cause I shouldn't be playing rn <:kekhands:699566615854841876>
Using me as support and lmk how much it does
Can one of you try topaz rq
Can't wait to import pull history lol
<:handshakege:1079981089604501534>
I got e2 too
And some good lc at least
8 times
I got luka like
Oh yeah
Oh nice
Imo
If running with asta just atk boots is fine
So Nini won
Only e2 guinaifen though
Okay bailu never getting built
Okay true
Was gonna pair with asta
Atk boots yeah
I'm actually mad about the bailu lol cause I have to rip that cone from lynx
Final stats
I take it
So I'm guaranteed for next char
Dumped 60 more and nothing
I had 133 left

I tried for e2 and got a bailu at 70
It took 70 pulls to e1s1
From 74 char pity and 50 lc pity
Couldn't wait
I installed star rail just to pull topaz <:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842> then uninstalled
Eli
Nice nice
Tetttttttttttttttt

Is daylight saving time ending? What to know about Sunshine Protection Act
Although the Sunshine Protection Act was passed unanimously by the Senate in 2022, it did not pass in the U.S. House of Representatives and was not signed into law by President Joe Biden.

A 2023 version of the act has remained idle in Congress as well.

<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
2 of those 3 you werent using anyway issok
from standard
clara and bailu only chars im missing actually
i dont own clara lol
or topaz asta ting + 1
fire mc topaz asta + lynx ig?
buffs *both* chars
yeah dual dps she's best imo
topaz asta sustain + buffer was gonna be mine
she should work well with her
this is mine rn
eff res too i ran with for keel
preferably spd subs if possible
spd boots yep, and err rope
whatever chest you get, make the orb the opposite is generally what i do
hp chest/def orb, vice versa

i think hp chest is better though personally
i went with that for survivability
that works, or 2p 2p ld
asta cute\
i recommend it

From glances anyway
I didn't like any sumeru chars except cyno
I wanted them
So good
Neuv and wrio are like
Ngl
Everything before that done tho
I didn't do watatsumi, that's where I left off
Fontaine feels and looks so good
But yo ngl if I wasn't pre chasm I'd come back for a bit
When will we get that in sr
But that's insane
I remember vaguely the mistsplitter ayaka grind
What the

~~with food~~
70 230 or bust
Nah you'll get it tho
Being a FAKE FAN
You guys have really high standards
You won't run into credit droughts
So long as you don't build a ton of chars at once
That's okay
Ty
Ok
Edt yes
Sitting at 6m rn
I stocked up on credits then
So remember that double calyx event
Can you do at 12 pm EST?
I'll be getting ready for work so I can wait

That reminds me
<a:hugs:1000015668504174592>

I've never been lucky either
Unless I'm not sure what you're asking
That doesn't sound topaz exclusive?

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
not a fan of planar grinding tho
okay true
she has her own ~~in retrospect i really shouldn't have s5'd that cone~~
only good piece is gloves <:kekhands:699566615854841876>
i'll treat him right one day
<:terifrownarms:960001216107147345>
banned
its stupid every char is so good
okay true
cause if waifu pull whoever
are you pulling for account strength or for waifu
is what a disney movie would say
follow your heart and you'll never be disappointed
im refarming next patch anyway its fine <:Cope:888647792434765864> 
your topaz better than mine damn nice
its so upsetting
im running s3 with err rope and im missing 3 energy
rip
<:kekw_hh:710693621216706620>
i thought fob rolled e2s1
when did you get s2?
<:susW:945704815311335504>
i hate it so much
would be an improvement but also breaks 136 blade 135 bronya <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
for blade
this is what the rope rolled
that second one rolled 11% hp though so im prob scrapping
so yeah ~35-36% i see
+5 base
yeah 12 cr in traces + 18 cr s1
ohh
s1 is 18 iirc
thats s5
LOL
nvrmind
if i use that on topaz which orb better?
i need 1 cd roll pls
im winning ~~until i roll~~

Welcome to the club
Tysm
apparently prop blade is a thing
Dreamy maybe
Guoba good too
~~has some truly dumb takes tho~~
As much as I despise pokke I like *most* of the suggestions
Here's the website of that sheet 


That is painful
Never
If I can get spd on rope or a pair of atk boots

I'm gonna just use that
Zoomin
21 spd in subs+spd boots
Never
if i max boots shes 154 spd
for sw
i got this
Can't run yet
I'm say work atm

Are you fucking kidding me
<a:PoyoyoApprobClap:857225566435672136>
If bp/monthly I believe
About 90 per patch
S5 moles hook was fun
He can 0 turn moc tho
~~no~~
Though hook synergy is better with the woof lc
It's really good on hook
<a:SMH:1021112056063213648>
Too much work to mirror
I like these stickers a lot
Oh no link rip

Separate the tax collector from the *character*

Nice!

kafka asta could be good combo, kafka is strong enough to be a hypercarry
pela is also really good
i think your current team is good
<a:AINTNOWAY:1072381924343037972>
got it
i've restarted 10 times and no slack dialog

Hi3 right?
<@309634550273933314> what did you want to pull for again?
Then I'm doomed for huohuo
Mhm
I'm at 74 on char  48 on lc
E1S1 better take me 90 pulls
Istg lol
Just need to know what lines are the event you want
So reset until you get the one you want
And it'll generate a new one
Before the event finishes force close
Yes
Just force close the game
Would be an upgrade for me
This isn't even bad lol

What's the gossip one
I refuse for the predator and 92 turns
The elation one and 9999 credits I could maybe do
And I'm not in a grind su mood
True true
Idk why she got *three* achievement
But I don't have jingliu no
I'm still 478 I think
Lol
Mhm
Yeah she's very very good
so you dont need an ehr body'
and gives her ehr
ult every two turns
but the tutorial one feels really nice too
it stacks with her
the luka oe
imo that one or s3+ resolution works really well on her
not have event lc
do you
lucky
<a:modcheck:926226465782132736>
i mean im not one to talk lol every unit i've pulled i've also pulled lc
healer lcs feel like a waste to pull for though
guarentee for new char weap <:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
also check the arenas you did
he gives you some

with this his shield is only around 2.3-2.5k
but allies havent died
for me value isnt there
i stopped at 8 for shield
he wont die lol
if running all that
4.7k def?
you can prob hit like
but this too yep
i mean set
cause his base spd is *92*
you can use 2 def 2 spd
not wog
wog
most of my ehr is here
but issok if not
to have his ult up before the 2 turns expire
preferably
do you have err rope btw
ehr is *nice to have* but not crucial
if not then doesnt really matter
if yes then 50%
are you using belobog?
4k ez at 70
yeah thats stupid LOL

It'll be fun
I did the event last night, it's good
Start it
Having lived with atk boots until 2 days ago, speed feels way better
I'd rather more spd personally
Less speed means slower heals but longer field uptime
23% break effect <a:pepelaugh:771978971155791903>

eff res / cd 12.9%

almost free
busy tonight
later
i believe in you <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
get grinding
i made my orb the opposite of what the chest was, so like hp chest > def orb
doesnt really matter
hp or def
for asta?
but survival prob better
you can do a sub dps asta if you want
<:4worryBirds:658552022538125332>
<a:birdgeleave:1128250401276301332>
action value
because if your asta hits like 201 spd its kinda moot to add an av lc
and this is *okay*
this needs s5 though
yeah this is fine
what eidolon rank
get harder
Maybe idk
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
c🇱ara
Kafka hits fucking hard
I would expect the first one with fmc
?
Dmg output
Is your problem staying alive
Ice and lightning
Oh right right
Yeah that too
Fx should do better than fmc id think
Why not mono qua 2nd floor
But yeah like what's your roster
Where clear
You have fx, DHIL and gepard
Who's your 2nd team
You're a bigger whale than me lol wym
Bruh
5
Look
Yours is better than mine lol
Can I pull some boots out of there too
Rip
Is there a link for that btw
I'm gonna Kafka sampo/guinaifen
I mean I can use her
That's what I'm doing now
It's a wrap
When I finally get kafka relics
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
My rope has 19 cdmg but it's purple

I'm literally never replacing it
Also wtf I just saw this
Banned
Or E6S5 blade <a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
Can get spd from subs
If you play asta it doesn't matter
Well
From ult and tame stacks on lc
That's counting in battle
Well
I think
71/190
I'm like
Ssg
Good plan tbh
Is that counting the 5.0/50 crit base stats
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
At least he kills on his basics
I like blade's aoe more tbh
LOL
blade e0s1 is pretty stonks ngl
And I used him maybe 3 times
Ironically blade is the only one for me with this
And def
Rolled ehr
My spd and atk boots
Dude
Who are you gonna get carv?
<a:whalepat:899061677583122432>
I've been looking for boots for days
Where are you getting pieces
I already did
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
None of them are good for her
I really hope we get a better set
No but saying a comp where her personal dmg suffers is best for her is an issue
Lol
Topaz basic is a follow up
And her dmg output is lower
That's a dual dps comp
No
Rip
Could sub SW in instead tbh
Sw
Do you have de
Jing ting asta sustain, but no built asta <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Jing teams work too
Standard dps hypercarry
Could use the same team you would for say, seele or dhil
Ideally you'd use asta, preferably E4, but issok, tingyun works too
Himeko not needed

Topaz can be either st dps hypercarry like seele, numbers are comparable

Or Dual dps enabler

I think St is the better route personally, but you can use Clara in dual dps fashion
Yeah lol she's stupid
any extras is amazing
you get ~8 purples  per 180 stam from fusing at a minimum
its nice is what it is
<:CB_blushing:816312568259805214>
mhm
is when new patch starts
October 11, 2023, at 11 AM (UTC+8)
~~they'll come back when in heat~~
Y tú Cariño
^
do it
can try on mine iuf you ever want
amazing unit
12 skills points without crit
or
either autarky  on turn
seele's better for me for auto, but i like qq overall for su/moc more
actually nvrmind
well
real
yeah lol
i dont think he ever hid it
based
for me personally
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
that sounds boring
<a:Smoge:808844088115068938>
owning fu xuan
you know whats wild
i still think him tbh
ah
made it sound like you did
you dont have?
granted i have 54 ehr
~~so does e1 gepard~~
and kafka does aoe, which i dont think march excels at covering
she's good but not much use case for you
so i dont see why you'd need her atm
you use blade or clara?
and you dont need more dps
i doubt you'll use march much
nah not even lol
but i mean i think pela or gepard  is fine to start with
sorry
opps caps
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO CLEAR?
why not run her there?
you have fx though
~~just kill faster~~
she's very easy to build too
sounds like pela it is
which ones need to be built
then luocha geppy etc
i mean how much though

you mentioned m7 and pela
build one of those first if so
do you need supports more
~
it is
More days to save
<a:PB_ez_clap:776846804754235433>
Make him worse

Maybe hod?
She hates everyone, not thinks she's better?
Does she though

yee
???
Fighting phantylia
<@385655541248163840> your blade died on auto
Since I have options anyway
Id rather wait to use a dps than use a dps with the wrong pieces
I'd use keel
Well
But assuming you heal once every 3 turns for sp positive, hp is better
Hp rope is a 4T ult
Err is a 3T ult
For what I see in calcs
I'm at almost 7k hp lol
<@416445660443967491> I think I stay hp rope for lynx
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
i still dont have fx either
<:worrynope:1107369053179367474>
<:worrykms:398047795732545536>
too close to pity
i dont want argenti

Every basic attack triggers dot
Propagation makes it nutty too
Issok

<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
But e2
Mine is like 118
Ic ic
So basically only need 8 subs
Yeah
I'm thinking of
From the resurgence
+25%
Yeah I'm overthinking
She needs 144
Yeah you're right
It changed?
Or smth idr
If s1 lc I think 132
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
Mine was garbo until recently
How long have you been building
She has 21 spd from subs
No
My qq needs them
You preferably have spd subs
i prefer atk
?
for seele
imo
use cr chest until  better subs then swap to cd
you have like 0 subs
where is your cr wtf
Would prob help others tho
Not pulling so not needed <:bedge:903014531268243506>
Yeah
I don't trust luocha
Yeah seems right
Is this solo sustain

topaz eating good
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
okay, thas what i have
ill keep an eye out for any good pieces while farming jy/topaz stuff
cause i gotta re-farm if so <:deadge:975652771082698782>
and salsatto for any eidolons right?
ic
right, since his hp scaling better
or is that normal
i feel like his attack is low
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
and missing 3% cr
blade kinda done except purple cdmg cheat
Oh right, fx could solve that problem
I'm annoyed by it <:deadge:975652771082698782>
My qq is perma stuck 60% arena

Brother
You need er rope
As we saw yesterday lol
It's for her personal survivability more than anything
Yeah
Def isnt bad though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Yeah the ehr is a waste
It's way better at s5
If you have it
March lc works too
Moment of victory
Gepards lc
Herta or landau (not mov, the other one) work
Wow
Nice!
Lynx piece
Ohh
I have like 5 hp chests
We have the opposite problem lol
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
But I feel hp should be a more common drop
If you want to sure, so long as you don't need like an er rope or some other harder to get missing piece of gear
Though also I've never gotten good subs from modeling resin
Unless you won't be farming there for a while
It feels like a waste though, wouldn't it?
I've been farming for a cd piece for like 2 and a half weeks <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Have you tried having better rng?
Yes
Just pull
Don't hesitate
If you're asking you want it
Incredibly based

Wait for pokke to talk about how much better she is at healing than midyuan
0 clue
Probably do the same thing as Natasha ig
<@416445660443967491>
E1s1 is a prayer
Hopefully
147 pulls by the time she's here
Owomath 60+60+27
Since she's second half
I'm guessing like 60 ish maybe
Record of all pull income since 1.0
Guesstimate from this
*Allegedly*
How the fuck do they replace bronya
You mentioned it before I think but
Honestly though
Then survive until new quantum harmony eventually comes out  <:Copium:945701120376995890>
I need to survive two banners
<a:AE_KomaNONONO:752849202920292462>
Bronya
<a:bcaPatientlyWaiting:764167633234559016>
But I want 70 cr
I'm mad cause I can't replace the gear lol
Without speed boots
She has 21 spd in subs
I wish I could give her my qq subs
Every bronya I've seen with high cd has 0 spd
And not slow as fuck with 2638405883 cd
I'd rather her be fast
<:7Csoontm:628344479178424330>

your sanity matters more
i wouldnt
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
it seems
fmc taunt you need ehr
march's taunt depends on the team
copied and pasted but
Enemy Targeting: Aggro & Taunts

Not every character is weighted equally for how likely they are to be attacked. They have a Base Aggro level that is first decided by their Path:

75 - Path of Erudition & the Hunt

100 - Path of Harmony, Nihility & Abundance

125 - Path of Destruction

150 - Path of Preservation

This Base Aggro is then multiplied by any modifiers active - These are:

6x (+500%) - Clara's Ult & Technique, March's Skill

4x (+300%) - Gepard's A2 Trace

3x (+200%) - Landau's Choice & Moment of Victory Light Cones

0.5x (-50%) - Dan Heng, Seele & Sushang's A2 Traces

0.4x (-60%) - Yanqing's Talent

The character's likelihood to be attacked is the percentage of how much of the total Aggro Value of the team is theirs.

So - For a party of March w/ Landau's Choice, Clara w/ March Shield & her Ult, Dan Heng below 50% HP (A2 Trace Active) & Natasha it's like this:

March (150*(1+2)) + Clara (125x(1+5+5)) + Natasha (100) + Dan Heng (75x(1-0.5)) = 1962.5 Total Aggro

Clara = 1375/1962.5 = 0.701 = 70.1% Chance to target Clara

For the party it looks like:

Clara - 70.1%

March - 22.9%

Natasha - 5.1%

Dan Heng - 1.9%

Removing Landau's Choice from March would increase Clara's chance to 82.7%
so for march its different
I change every once in a while
because fmc taunt counts as a debuff applied to the enemy
idk about march
fmc does
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
time to be banished to su6 ig
and kafka gear
i need:
is for jy and topaz
spd boots and better def orb for gepard
cdmg chest for blade

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
salsatto is so bad for me <:kekhands:699566615854841876>
and a prayer for this chest

<a:TE_PepeCowboy:562530279005224970>

Whale
Owomath 15373 / 160
Or am I thinking of wrong boss
Isn't it just stay right hit 3 times run repeat
That's the wolf right
Have you tried growing and changing as a person to be better
Pull her regardless
Real
E0s1>e1s0
Ssg maso
Wow you got it
Bot faster next time lol
I keep getting attack with crit subs <:kekhands:699566615854841876>
Why are cdmg chest so fookin hard to find
i need to fix qq cr
both are ok
but better than b4
yeah mid
granted these are also fairly weak
her old boots were garbo
i have to
okay seele has boots again
bruh
<:whip:907388909774835824>
its 43 pulls
if i was to pull
i dont have much for her either tbh
kafka was fomo
he's my only non eidolon 5 star
he actually was
i built too much pity
blade was an accident
good yq piece ig
every fucking rope on wrong set
bruh
Just do that 5 times
I know you can roll 34 cd on 1 piece
I have 0 clue lol I'm just saying numbers
Where's 80/220
I haven't really had time
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>

just different accounts?
was this with vpn?
literally me
<:comfy:1083977329296027760>
jing gets a lot too
not great but pretty good
yeah, higher stat scalaing cause 5* and this is a nice boon
the only thing that beats it is s2+ swordplay
it is
For me
Every er rope has been rutilant lol
<a:Smoge:808844088115068938>
not even 5 for geppy
40 minutes on a damn ape
beat him first try
now time to get destroyed by gepard
so was *wayyyy* harder than it needed to be
i also didnt grab this
<:worryWadeva:454364877423902724>
trying to survive 4 fucking cycles
40+ minutes
thank god
no fr this is disgusting
why is this fucking ape harder than the bosses
and that feels like this fucking ape
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
i cba yeah
she deals so much fucking damage
kafka stomps
doesnt matter what world
oh kafka yeah

<a:whalepat:899061677583122432>
pogggg
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Use asta
Yeah if you read that one takes quite a while
So you can do whenever you want really
At least swarm is permanent
Ah, you don't have a built qq right? That one I felt was easier cause the enhanced basics + propagation was easy dot
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
It's so joever
Need to mentally prep
Neko how long did abundance take you
These runs too long
I think I finish the tree challenges tomorrow

And do achievements next week
like 30-40 mins a run
these take so fooking long
nihility next
mixing and matching gets the same results
the same team clears everything, supports literally dont matter *that much*
i really cant believe what they did with dhil
think i do destruction actually nvrmind
destruction or nihility next
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
a *lot* of prayer
doable with fmc nat and qq with uh
wow you werent kidding
who needs follow up chars
sleep girl
it'll come <:prayge:863861301310652416>
even saving
e2 s5 felt like a boatload for me
ssg
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
def is for wep
hopefully
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
its not stupid if it works
Lol
Burh
Surely
You'll get her in 20
the closer it starts the sooner it ends
finally fuck
friend of mine
<@309634550273933314>
so now its nigh impossible
that has been patched
there was a glitch to get it with trotters
an achievement
oh ffs it is
i cant get trotters to attack in adventure domains
<@309634550273933314> is predator patched
su dhil broke the record
jfc lol
crying
lot of laos here damn
Actually that makes sense soloing
Well
Damn destruction
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
I'm bad at the game
I don't think it changes anything but I could be wrong
Extra turns good <:SadCatThumbsUp:806587729332011008>
Etc etc
134 will net you no less than 3 extra turns in a 6 cycle fight
Basically you get 2 turns per cycle at a certain speed
Though the breakpoints haven't changed from sols pin, but visually it's easier to understand
147 gets 4
143 gets you 3 bonus actions
This has been by far the easiest way  to understand speed for me
Can someone pin later
Haven't used cog/memories on her
Dance 3 has been amazing
Honestly
Himeko has the highest base, so like 2700 ish
2550 good enough for most yep
I don't have a atk orb either
Yep <:deadge:975652771082698782> 
Er rope and spd boots have her at 2300 <:deadge:975652771082698782>

Cause attack is NOT an existing sub stat for me
Yeah most likely
I don't have anything for blade either lol
I'm prob gonna do that or keel idk either

Like asta /ting need hp orbs, and seele/qq need better ropes but like

My jy planars are garbo
<:life:1001518241610485781>
Seems to be
Yee
every attack in her kit is a follow up
Do you care for jingliu or topaz
Alternatively
What supports do you use more?

If your only dps you care for is blade  and/or jy, could do keel if you wanna bolster supports
Planars
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
<a:pepelaugh:771978971155791903>
since i waited so long every day feels like improvement
it actually feels really good doing relics now
my jing ded tho
getting better i thinkge
fixing my qq and seele
okay so
i dont think you can complete any of these early
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>

what the fuck
I know you haven't
Time for the old man to rest
I'm switching this to DHIL or topass
Speaking of
Yep
Though looking back in ss's
Should be
You're the only meta we need
Everyone and their extended family shouted it was cause no one tested it
Not in the beginning of the game
Autarky mechanics: Works like other follow-up attacks except for energy so stuff like Tingyun benediction and Yukong A6 should proc off it (Yukong A6 also applies to QQ skill iirc).

 It is affected by follow-up damage boosts (before dawn) but NOT affected by basic damage boosts (musketeer set). This is a huge misconception. 

Hidden hand talent Atk% boost DOES NOT apply to autarky, it drops right after her first enhanced basic attack due to how it is worded. 

Autarky DOES NOT generate energy, whereas most other follow-up attacks do. 

Autarky DOES NOT cast if the main target was killed with the original attack. 

Autarky DOES do the same amount of break unit damage as the original attack, 2 to the main target and 1 to adjacent targets. 

Autarky will hit targets that are made newly adjacent to the main target by the death of originally adjacent enemies (though it should be noted that there are a few exceptions, notably the enemies that delay their own death for death effects. Off the top of my head the dragonfish that come with aurumaton and the exploding robots should act this way.)
So here's my notes on autarky
But generally cr ye
She either tickles or bombs
Ye
At s1
No no jy gives 36% cd
Which is why my ratio shit
I did cd
Lol no
Whoever you want really
Which is pretty amazing esp if no kafka
Iirc it lets anyone trigger dot with a basic attack
Nihility+ propagation resonance interplay
Are you all set on this
I don't see why not
Account seed is real bro
Imagine

Something like that
Like 54/160 something
She either crits 200k+ per hit or does nothing
But my crit so bad
Qq does so well with it

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
my tree deadge
-3
its literaly impossible
<@197871478950068224>  i gave up after try 5
my sysadmin at my current job used to be one
insanely yeah
you should be a conductor
i used to be brass section in band
fun times <:deadge:975652771082698782>

unironically
we've all heard your screams
heki: very english
tet: fuck you then you read
i still remember yours from degen games

<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
i dont think people will be happy if i posted
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
~~i've gotten better~~
not my uid
nope
And yeah you need something tanky, abundance preservation destruction

Any of those works
That works
But probably sustain > healer > buffer (bronya) > qq
Idk what your roster is to give you a sufficient answer
Something something backread
Yee
Not really grinding it atm
I'm at 396
whoops
yeah
i use both
copied from cn
Why speed?

 QQ has an insane amount of ATK buffs herself, as well as from potential supports. As we know, ATK% is not an optimal stat to stack unlike DEF reduction
 QQ with SPD feet can hit 123 speed with 0 subs, 1 speed off from 124 speed to have 8 unit turns every 6 absolute turns (see Speed Sheet). Getting 11 more speed allows for 6 unit turns every 4 absolute turns. (134)
Directly translates to 2 more SP every 4-6 turns, which can be utilized either by herself to cast more skills (higher chance of hidden hand/DMG% increase) or for her allies (buffs/heals). Makes combat more fluid and adaptable to situations (sudden CC, debuffs, emergency heals etc)
Generally a more viable path for sub DPS QQ, who only wants to auto attack, while SP is allocated to Main DPS/supports. Even Main DPS can be viable due to high amounts of ATK% buffs.

Why atk?

QQ that is too fast may result in her going before her supports (Harmony/Nihility), greatly reducing DMG output due to lack of buffs and debuffs. QQ has 10% Speed buff after 1 enhanced basic at A6 and this will eventually ruin turn order over time if team has no speed buffs.
High SPD QQ, especially for Main DPS QQ, will result in much higher SP usage since you want Main DPS to get 4 of a kind as soon as possible. Slower SPD team may not keep up with SP generation, even worse if player is unlucky.
Buffs from Harmony or Offensive Support units (Tingyun/Bronya/Yukong) expire faster with high SPD QQ since her turn is reached sooner.
Total DMG from ATK% QQ will definitely outdamage SPD QQ if the battle ends extremely quickly (2 or 3 turn clears); no chance for SPD QQ to gain extra turn before battle is over.
who said they sucked?
atk boots 100%
do you own bronya
this is like 100% cd
god damn lol
and also 3 fooking 5 stars
but e1 clara
a friend ran this
not for the aurm alley
0 problems so far
qq bronya luocha ting
qq ate swell
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
its a lot harder  with more rewards in exchange
hello sick and tired
<a:aworryPopcorn2:470254293530705921>
<a:aworryPopcorn2:470254293530705921>
<:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>
Gacha players read anything challenge (impossible!)
Sam when <a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
Heki 3 years into the game with 184 fuel
The game's for now giving him the account he deserves
I saw yeah LOL
<:peeka:1058877271420715118>
Time to tell velvet
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
The second option
and 10 has yanking
moc 9 does
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
i cant replace these even if i wanted to
also <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
i'd rather her get more tiles
i use bronya, no need
i need more cr
relatable
yo
this is mine atm
she can take sword/void aggro
i would do fmc
lmk wen
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
i didnt record <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
like replaying it?
it worked
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
gepard jy asta ty first half
fmc luocha bronya qq second half
this was correct
left imo
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Solid ratio actually nice
He only needs like 116 I think
If you use asta you can run atk boots
Just ping
I can stream if you want
Though tbf relics are mid and I've never fixed that so I can't use them if I wanted to

Cause I was building more chars
But I'm happy now
My mindset is like
1 day I'll use them

Surely
Certainly
Hopefully
Me with 75% of my roster
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
My welt is benched until 1.5
I'm 70/132 lol
I really need to fix him
Take the 90 lol
My qq is 57/160 and she never fucking crits
He's being hard carried by that s5
Yo ngl
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
I like jy so I'll use him whenever I can
Too many options I feel like a whale
Though ig I can actually use blade
If I need to kill fast
She can burst down, jy will be a slow burn
I think I can brute force it though
Nope
Or sw maybe
Fmc qq luocha(?) And bronya ig
Ty
Okay qq on that side
Ty can't take more than 2-3 hits
I was gonna use jy
Fuck
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
I think some people said her max dmg potential (perfect rng) rivaled dhil but idk I didn't care enough to look
Highly recommend
She's good when you put time into her
First side just qq it I suppose
So that side gets luocha
<:Tiredge:1102446455098183740>
Wtf
Eww
For the bosses
It's yanking and who else?
I'll lyk later today
I got up to 8 and stopped
<:sentisleep:1112247773534879754>
<:belupls:1135653525947420752>
Can I have it?
im actually really looking forward to the new su
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
double the mid subs!
wow
Living out my dreams God damn
his multipliers are stupid
it was from another spanish playing friend
issok
it wasnt from your acc
nini did you see heki saying dhil was better than your blade
yeah her luck is insane
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
cat has this too
wow nice
is what i've been following
on every enemy except svarog in current moc and every enemy in the following moc, its a bit too much
same for sampo actually: only need ~42%
its the equivalent of building 110% crit rate and 50% crit dmg because one enemy has 10% crit resistance lol
yeah thats way too much
so it ends up being wasted
people also say pela needs 67% but she gets 10% from her trace in battle
you need 96% like
max for e0
you're overcapping hard
what
speed makes it hard for supports to generate enough sp
if you have bronya, atk yeah
she's never let me down on moc 10
~~rng issue~~
just do it
dont hesitate
if you're asking you want it
just do it
more like it
yeah, not a fan of it <:deadge:975652771082698782>
^
There's too many enemies on the field basically, same for jy 

3 reasons.

His damage buff to slowed targets is very unreliable now.

His bounce skill is still single target damage, no splash damage to other enemies next to the enemy hit by the bounces.

Needs to clear adds to ensure he can focus his skill damage onto 1 target, but this is impossible when trash mobs keep spawning in.
5 mobs per floor
Bounce attacks
<:KEKWTRASH:856863762702663690>
Welt is getting fucked too
they were counting living days too
luocha ting bron and qq carry for me
in w7
the deer isnt even the hardest boss lol
not bad at all
outside of hoyolab stuff
friend just posted, doesnt look important
did anyone know about this?
<a:Smoge:808844088115068938>
Across 20 banner chars from that ss
6 lost 50/50 overall
Man I wish I was that lucky
Low ass pities
What the fuck
unlucky <:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
unless just really bad luck
impossible
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
Just never lose
who's he thinking of next? cause thats insane luck
but opposite
i had the same thing happen actually
salsatto works well too
rutulant
but he's be my ice dps for the foreseeable future when i do get around to him
i dont want him to cannabilize mats rn
<:Topaz_comfy_TM:1147464924927361084>
because topaz is hunt
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
can fund me mats for these ones though
i have no one left to build atm
that's interesting *to me*
on char building break until nov. 1
ngl
feels good to finally farm relics
yeah id say bronya too'
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
i dont own bailu and im not pulling fx (for sure <:clueless:973756617109676032>)
im locked out of that one
i forgot sw and march existed
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
thats why i changed with the strikethrough
for ~~the preservation one~~ both
i need eli actually
well
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
samesies
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
ah
or was that luocha?
i think nini topped you up for him
oh right right
you have blade?
<:KanaMFW:1129793835975856198>
i spent 120 stam on the *wrong* calyx
dude
dont make me grind more stuff <a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
you -3 from characters, i -3 from dialogue
we're tied again
<@309634550273933314>
It's in the notes
As soon as new patch dropped
e6 is extra skill point
e4 is the follow up
its insane
e6 and s1 before dawn is a nuke
she's really fun
completely functional at e0, completely different character at e4 imo <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
nini just offered to swipe for you
For 4 days
You need to do it daily
Well
It's a daily
Hopefully we can replay story quests <a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
Dialog is permanently -3
I get the immortal delight today and todd tomorrow
There's a guide yeah
I got it accidentally lol
i really like the event though
i dont wanna grind anymore <:cryge:966624721611403294>
-1 from 1mill im upset
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
75 for char 65 weap
i think its same as genshin tbh lol
like 1200
a lot
<a:SMH:1021112056063213648>
they cant win lol
mihoyo when short events: where content <a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
mihoyo when long events: why this much content <a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
mihoyo when letting players choose to pace events: why no timegate <a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
it was gonna be like the museum then the day after 1.3 released they released on twitter that they were removing the timegate
yeah lol
this wasnt all supposed to be done at once btw they just removed the timegate
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Damage so low mf needs a magnifying glass role to find it
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Because it's a easy boss
Someone just told me dhil e2s1 = blade e6s5
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
I saw yeah lol
I just chose not to comment
good quests
oh i see
luka is literally a shonen protagonist
sorry not sorry
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
time to do companion missions
i found like 7
idfk from where though
im missing one i think
yougren here
box is around my waypoint
go, interact, you find a cycrane, then go to yongmin or whoever
there's a box
alchemy commission
375 now
i just got this too
ily2

you got the dialogue so im -3
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
its glitched
no it doesnt
<:AE_zero2Lewd:735244622439251988>
or any companion missions
did you do the 400 blows one?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
focus on those 2 first lol
then there's your answer
in general
question always goes back to 
1) what does your acc need more, and/or
2) who do you like more
^
i dont see why it would lock you into 1 payment method though
i dont play mobile
0 clue, i've only topped up frompc versions
hard to find whale advice <:deadge:975652771082698782>
nothing i found but i'd guess it cuts him down from 3T > 2T
lemme look around
maybe a streamer discord or golden house
time to grind
just got home
Wtf
Ruan Mei huh
Same ugh
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Credits and xp books you right though
Okay even for me traces are whale
I'm at 5
I need tracks
Same man
You cracked the code
I see
I couldn't believe it
I saw that on reddit LOL
I wonder why sampo specifically
Mhm, clever
<:AA_Kokomi_Sleep:1110545945248137328>
Yeah I much prefer stuff like this too
Just hit
No
This is a literal trick shot wtf
The usual guy
Someone made a guide
Oh wait
Yeah that one
The first one
Not scalegorge
But rip
In some places
Ik you can do that in the new 1.2 map
Nvrmind
Oh
Oh I think I have an idea for that
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
Just implement it
It's literally in the game
But not your ult
I'm kinda upset you can cancel DHIL stacks
Like other rpgs
This is where I wish this game has a wait option
FH2 second boss
Lvl 60
He's floor 2
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Yeah cause you need the chars, no ow boss yq yet
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
How tf am I supposed to catch up
I'm tilted though they didn't add any dialogue to make old ones possible
I am *not* about it
We see in a week <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Oh that channel exists

I lost the 50/50 if it makes you feel better
No I wanted him
I felt it would be wasted
I got e3 lc in 32 pulls
Him and blade were accidents
I am
I don't like it either no
Ty but nty <:deadge:975652771082698782>

<:pog:842260542479532042>
Shortens time increase difficulty
You could also bank on the strength of your chars and skip the buffs and just get to the boss immediately
You can do it in a few hours but the maps are lengthy
It takes a while lol
Me, also realizing there's nothing clever or funny about any of them:
Me, wondering why seele doesn't have a mid nickname yet:
im keeping for now though
0 clue
cant wait for my roll into flat hp <:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>

You're right
This was my biggest problem looking back

ohhh
prsv?
~~and any other times i linked~~
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
either work tho tbh just use the one with better subs
dmg reduc
guard
replace snow with speed here though
for like the 4th time lol
lol
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
If I could I'd pin this lol
Same Problems on anyone else: ABSOLUTE SHIT CHARACTER

Way too biased to see the forest from the trees
Problems on kafka: it's fine cause I like kafka
I think the problem is
unless i somehow get s2+ gnsw
since fire break does a lot of dmg
thats going to guinaifen
Around here

is this good enough for blade
Was hoping it wasn't fuxuan <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
If f2p/clearing moc etc
It's like 16k jades in overall value
I mentioned here tet
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
Asta, whoever
Yeah, need an sp generator like Pela luocha ting etc
Though at e6 imo spd better
But tldw is syncing up with bronya
It's talked about here 
Some people actually prefer attack boots on her vs spd
What eidolons qq
Oh nice
Real
I await the next goalpost move <:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>

nini here when you see this
Could just conserve and save for big turns
i would hope you wouldnt need 3 stacks every turn
Why?
I'm sure
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
EqUaL chAnCe aT SuBs
Insane
With bronya that man was hitting 120k
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
It's okay probably but we sleep until live
Is what I mean
Like it *could* be good, but rolls might be better allocated elsewhere
Imo
This feels equivalent to building a sub dps luocha
And e6s5 helps
That what
Impressive
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
At least when you get it you have endless fodder to level it
Main stat is usually enough
What are you defining as good
Even purples?
He literally needs 20%
Why do you have a crit rate piece on him
Isn't that expected?
My Bricked acc not owning him
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
Man I just want welt
Hp is fine if you're not worried about heals
Either way works though <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
Not saying you couldn't, but higher tankiness / healing imo outweighs 1 extra turn of 12% speed
Speed set you'd prob want 2 +2
Not great but not terrible
Crying
<:SampoHeehee:1035712721804603575>
<a:FAMILYAAY:892952462565203968>
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>


could be wrong though
like 5* gacha > 4* bp=5* herta > 4* gacha
in terms of stats iirc
i think bp lc have higher stats than gacha 4* lc
and herta shop lc have lower stats than other 5* lc
found an e6s3 luocha
okay capped
360 is my max without those dailogue ones
after this im capped
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
you can what
and seele
but all i see are kafka
yeah the 40% attack buff food
its quest only
you cannot
where are the whale luochas
ik the achievement hunter guy had a vid but like
how the fuck do you do the luocha one
<a:lewd20:721249309806559263>
looking now
this was in patch notes actually
personally identifiable information
most likely pii and whatnot is reason to hide it
adding an option to show it optionally later prob
they dont show it anymore
you got me for a good ten seconds
<a:modCheck:843977786568736789>
hoping i get these finally next patch
tet we're tied again
easier to understand reddit post <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
there's other spreadsheets too but this is one i had saved


attaching pictures in english for those of us that dont know ~~moon runes~~  chinese
great entertainment though
its so stupid lol
another one
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
assuming i hit my averages
and patch is usually frontloaded with jades so i should have enough for topaz + lc
i think i should have 110 tickets by start of 1.4
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
100+ for spenders, 70-80 for f2p per usual
this is with the low spender stuff
thats assuming no bp/monthly, and that you're clearing moc 10
this is gonna be lower for most but rough idea of what to expect
no dice
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
its okay for kafka but dog for my jing <:deadge:975652771082698782>
take mine
does the set matter <a:aworryRun2:601196179878969382>
<a:csgiriewtf:1000666104127045642>
Oh God you're right
Break can be good
But that's so much farming I don't wanna do
At some point I wanna change to speed
Really flexible
Pela is like
I use 4 on pela
2p guard is pretty good <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
I forget what the 4p is offhand but it's like 20% extra shield or something
+15% def
<:worryok:696400820652081194>
so then just sub dependent?
<:Tiredge:1102446455098183740>
it really is
wow, not bad
solid speed rolls
i got these hands too


he might just become my best build char
i got a nice set of boots wanted to make sure i could use
<:chima_sweat:826854591684804629>
okay good
actually im just gonna do speed
speed or hp boots for blade
guys
hallo
ohh
or maybe im thinking of something different
isnt it just heaven and earth as a chessboard
Amazing
All good, this one was similar enough
LOL
Yeah that's the one
Prob something else
He had genshin drama?
This guy
I do respect him owning up to it though
Right now I just watch her and guoba, though I wasn't a fan of guobas drama
She just hates people telling her how to play
At least with dreamy, she doesn't make vids about how bad x char is
Started this whole mess
Fuck pokke
Enough said
What is going on lol
ironic
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
he's pulling topaz with me
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
or a tankier yukong
but sub dps is the wave usually
you could if you wanted
this is with e0 yukong
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
yukong
its about the simpage
its not about the damage
i am yeah
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
Yeah
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
they're counting her life
bruh
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
topaz savings going great
its from pokke's server
True
Have someone lucky pull fornyou
Cancer
Ty mrpokke server
Can actually practice that after 1.4 more
Samesies
True
Just f2p seem lc averse generally
No I agree with dps+lc usually
I'm skipping 1.3 and going 1.4 for topaz
Kafka cleared me out
Nah
I feel like a new char is always better if you have the choice
It's funny actually, I recommended going e0 dhil and e0 fx
Listen you
Time to ask <@385655541248163840> for a loan
Is fine
I get bothered daily lol
Shift starts before Livestream always
I'm at work
Nope
was planning to but then 2 fires were drip marketed
she can be good but i havent built mine
Wasn't too bad if you were willing to wait a cycle
The attack with gepards or fmc
I felt like you could manipulate
I gotta finish 6
Is it?
That happened to me too tho on f10
🇱
Hold this for me
phys break effect hp based right
A funny picture wym
To spite luocha skippers
Yeah
Maybe in 1.4, but we don't know yet
Now I gotta build kafka luka sampo <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Too busy building blade
Haven't in a while
Well
I don't follow leaks but probably
As much as I like him, he's doing 20% less without before dawn
It's not like jy anyway
For me anyway
Generally I prefer new characters over power boost to existing characters
<a:modCheck:843977786568736789>
So you asked me a question with a predetermined decision?
You would pick a light cone over a new character?
Oh
preservation one
on fu
just use herta cone
<:GuinaiHeart_GNFM:1121640097524224072>
Sold
blade done <:deadge:975652771082698782>
E6 is just sub dps pela
Even e0 is fine
So you have a slower ult but more dmg
Luka lc s3 + has permanent basic debuffs and stacks with ult
Talent 7 er rope and max refined event lc is so much energy
That's just
Not true??
Lemme look around but I doubt it
Her cn va is fischl/albedo in genshin, and hua in hi3
Yes
Even though I prefer the kr/en voices in this game
Hua va amazing
Not my fault
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Since I have yq
I'm just gonna pull her instead and skip jingliu
I was gonna build hook and/or himeko too but now with topaz drop marketed
But I needed wind dps so it's fine
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Blade was an accident building pity
2 more traces
I'm still trying to finish blade <:deadge:975652771082698782>
It can work for sampo if you have him
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
I'm 3 down without the damn dialogue options
Relax wtf
<a:SMH:1021112056063213648>
I assume you'd build as a traditional dmg dealer
0 clue I don't look into chars I'm skipping <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
I'm out
Ohh this argument again
It's on page 3
You passed it
they beat the game
someone in another server
prob not consistent enough though
that i dont actually know, i can find it though <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
70/170 <:sleepywhale:1120460602947666033>
maybe thats why i enjoy qq so much atm
mine is bricked
same
lvl 50/60 and 80/80 lc
im still building blade LOL
er rope is throwing imo
no
You can do mobile just a pita
Jesus nini
E1 bronya e1 geppy
Omg e4 bailu
My blade planars are done then LOL
Bet
Damn whales
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Apparently not in sols
Shit game
Everyone else was 80ish
The only good one was 2* dabber at 35
I erased that from memory
Oh my gosh the elf
My hi3 has been *awful* recently
Idr much else
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I know for a fact I lost zhongli rerun to mona
But I don't remember much anymore
I think my genshin luck was bad
I only remember winning ayaka
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I can't share mine anymore
Jesus
All high pity too
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
What the fuck
then lynx whenever we get her off-banner, then jingliu, then im free
all supports + 1 dps char of each element
only 4 left <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yukong is beating my mats *UP* rn
tyty though, i'll build him 1 day
that gets me s5
i'm actually happy about that lc too lol
so many good looking chars
man this game is dangerous
i kinda want fu xuan too ngl
now *surely* we can not build pity until jingliu
its fine though
but blade somehow ended up on my acc after 51 pulls
cause i wanted a wind dps
the wind one
he would be cause i wanted to finish dan heng
well
so far on my back burner <:deadge:975652771082698782>
he's liike
actually nah fuck it, blade stays poor
cause i have s5 vow but uh
time to find the tickets to pull lc ig
whoops <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
but different sources of burn can stack, so trend i think is very nice in that scenario
i think day one or landau's is still better, as they give more def and utility over trend's hp and 32%
around the 27th or 28th
26 1/2 days from now
busy today
im good
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I hate the apes though
Pela solves the mara thing
not running again
kafka killed luo on the last turn
and 6
its cancer on 8 imo
fuck stage 6
can maybe squeeze 1 or 2
until we get more dialogue im about the same
<:KOCRI:1037231305362002020>
surely your luck is better here though
i like him
its fine ig
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
only to get his e1 on luo
i ended up getting geppy with mine
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
nice
oh wtf
i dont wanna grind the annoying ones <a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
tet rn
12-15% less damage
for like maybe
breakfast works
it just does meme damage
dont need it
<@309634550273933314>
<:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
okay fixed my qq again
Took a hot minute
I did that in the boxing event
Actually bricked
353 if I knew about the dialog choices achievements
I'd be at 349 if I did
I'm at 348
Gl gl
160 jades
About time
but feels like wasted potential going e2 + s0
now obv if you dont care for minmaxing / want more chars, no need to get it, swordplay or cruising are excellent
these are old ish dps calcs but i dont expect them to have changed
you can cap the buff
if you're e2
yes get the lc lol
wait
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
not in the states it isnt
ngl lol
carried by lc
his relics are mid
she's using his s5 lc rn
she's really fun
sue me
the bank of gresham is closed
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
find a sponsor
its so stupid lol i love it
in su
she was throwing *HAYMAKERS*
yeah
she needs better planar
this is after 3 days of relic farming
im a qq user now
i've retired jing
okay so <@704867526877904908>
Apparently mihoyo was hacked
also taught him swordplay
she did kill him over and over, yeah
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
The guy annoys me and the dialogue is too long
I haven't really played the new event
Okay
you'll be waiting 2 years
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
or e2
its e1 for nini
<@309634550273933314> when you wake up did you hit 350 yet
oh that reminds me
<a:AE_Gaspp:752859943270350908>
Okay gotcha
Ohh
15% defense is like nothing  <:deadge:975652771082698782>
If you don't get the 50% ehr
The belobog set isn't that good
Well
Is that for basics or
What about arena
That's the effect res one right
I haven't read into how much better the new planars are
Then idk after
I have to do 7 for the first clear rewards
Man I do not want to do su
Big facts
But it's relic time <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
At some point I have to build sushang dh himeko and yukong too
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
It never ends
i feel bad for the people who havent played and havent gone dark
hasnt even been a week
Happy birthday btw <@309634550273933314>
Otherwise good
I'd unlock the last major trace too
Talent to 7
oh do i have a vid for you
Weren't you 37
Watch your back
I'm at 332 achievements now
Tet I did story finally
Real
He's clean ngl but same
They did good
They'll reach a paradise I'll never attain
Enjoy it for me
Nah though his ult is dope
Why are we still here
The dead will return
Fuck you I'm sick of it
His death voice lines are so funny
Yukong's great with Clara and jing, idk about seele but just depends on speed tuning, no?
<@309634550273933314>
This cc good, but clickbaity
I like this vid a lot
And that way you have 100% ult uptime
I think event is better if Luka's isn't r3
Ye
Debuffer with the event lc?
How are you using her
So like
but good enough
could be better
there's a reason i havent been here
not playing story yet lol
??
It's suffering aye
Copy
Okay so nothing changed
I haven't done much of anything
That's also a serious question  though I have 0 clue lol
Like hunt, nihility, whatever path you want
Destruction/abundance of it's too hard, run business as usual stuff otherwise, no?
I can't imagine anything has changed
You can only have 4 chars In a team <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Or, or
Probably layering issues
Yeah lol
though atk body reduces overall heals <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
ye
Nice carv
The dude sneezes and full heals you: no need to over invest in attack imo
And just get the subs
I would run outgoing heal chest spd boots atk orb
Atk% subs if not running atk main pieces
Ask this <:pantsgrab:959752209061527642>
I think I'll be 66 in a week or so
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
<a:petCarv:990307540610990100>
Jk love you carv
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Fair
But I feel like a lot of it is parroted idk
Yeah she is definitely on the higher end
Her, herta, and a couple others that you'd get a higher roi from say, just investing in  jing yuan
Unit needs investment to be good

What's next, we need jades to get tickets to pull?
I think the himeko bad kinda overblown <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
omg i found cherry
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
It's really expensive yeah
okay tet won
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
~~its better for my mental health if i dont~~
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
Tuesday?
When is the new patch again?
I think I have S5 good night too
Time to farm
Ik what it does but that's still crazy to me
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
4pc WHAT
Is that gcrow
Wtf are you feeding her
<:HSR_Trailblazernom:1117011820335607869>
im competing with alice
perfect gif actually
<:seelepls:1069254242554093618>
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Activate windows carv
I just like collecting
Based
Like ting maybe?
If you're just ach hunting
It's cheaper
Why not Dona 4*
Oh wtf
I'm still missing 3
Nice
So just need to build luocha after seele and the rest of my time is dedicated to relics
Finally finished sw/pela
In maxing mine this week
+10 here is the equivalent to crowning in genshin
who needs double rewards <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
More lvl 80s than me
Heki whale
Those look like mine lol
this is exactly how mine have looked lol
so like
Real ™
Skipping until jingliu
Who?
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
So luocha at some point and qq at some point and relics
Can *finally* start relic grinding
Seeley traces maxed on sunday
Pela/sw done by friday
I'm free soon
Ban him tet
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
I stole them
Yes
Weakness break
Yes
Technically herta and himeko
<a:Grabby:1071887944731852901>
I just want them
Most of the 75s aren't
she still gets 2 shot
It is not LOL
75-80 is bad though
And not *too* bad from 70-75
That works too, I just want the extra trace
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
There's still yukong and luocha
I went really wide to avoid relics
For every support
I'm doing lvl 75/level 80 lc/5-8-8-8 talents
Pela/sw
He's just sitting at level 30 LOL
Peer pressure in sols man
I did
And already had jy cone <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
I had e3, pulled luocha, and got e6
E6S5 jy cone
She'll be fun
Build mine too pls
E4 so comfy <:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
Totally not worth using right
Remember, asta's niche guys
And they out here getting 48k breaks
Idk how I want her to be used
I wish they share their FUCKING asta build
Dream is such a good ytuber
<:worrygalaxybrain:698804372766851113>
People on reddit said so it must be teue
Don't you guys know that himeko is mid her kit is trash and everyone else  is just better
<:ClownTao:959088901790765186>
But guys people are telling me my dps isn't worth being built in a single player game and that she's weak
what a great event
<@385655541248163840> I found someone that's just like you fr


Bedge at 12 or 1 dailies at 5
Nty
I tried that but sleep way too late for it <:deadge:975652771082698782>
So early doing dailies
Unless I'm being scammed I didn't, neither did someone in sols
LMFAO the double event doesn't double dropped purples
Use destruction or abundance
.
effect means how much damage it does when you break
efficiency is how much the bar goes down per hit
the way regression hit
LMFAO
okay you were right
too late i already dm'd
Okay lemme get outta bed
I can send you my import data
That said
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Yeah same the only feasible ones left are the su ones
That's so much more work
Spreadsheets
No
Ohh
To the site?
In starrailstation yeah
I don't want either banner though
They drip like 2 patcges out now
Oh right
That assumes I pull kafka
That I do
You'll get that one
Yeah
But you own luocha and yukong now
Hacker
That's so fookin expensive
I don't have 4 level 80's chars
No
I was being a good person in the dialogue
I looked that one up
How?
Can't do dialogue or battle ones, cant get luofu reading, 20 morals aren't available rn
I think like
Only 2 more are possible rn
Maybe
Good thing I'm at 323
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i actually went through my playlist twice
same
yeah
i went from like 16 to 300 yesterday
that's way easier
ohhh
~~Luka waiting room~~
true
i dont own clara either <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
how do you do phys?
wait
can't*
she unlocks like 4
so is bronya too
what about us f2p who arent pulling blade or fu xuan
i' dont think i've seena welt since week 1
i havent lost a 50/50 in a while
i did
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i dont own welt either
oh wait shit it is
nihility is doable?

<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
im on vacation until 1.2
<:Ooolook:1016312031189680208>
new competitor has stepped into the arena?
<:smadge:1122064565639856228>
but can afford to build no one
i wanna build everyone
man
istg
idr
i think it takes a day
ahh

wait
rip
i dont want to do them either
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>

<@309634550273933314> i kneel

Banned
<:terifrownarms:960001216107147345>
You're like 4 away from me
Stop it
<a:Ok:806651842561835058>
not great but not terrible
<a:pfft:962355401515466872>
3 turns quid pro quo imo, or the luocha 4* lc
if you just want his ult every two turns can use s4 post op
5* stats i think make it second best
wtf
~~should've skipped seele like i wanted ~~ <:Cope:888647792434765864>
e6 qq s5 jing lc
about to be *memes*
you've inspired me
im actually doing this now
because some spicy is just not enjoyable
how spicy do you go
you need a lot of investment aye
himeko herta kinda fun
i actually like herta lol
or build himeko
i could finish servall ig
true !
nihility
my jing already maxed talets
erudition
i dont *need* it
thats the worst part dude
<:copium:893342397541519382>
no purples
on the bright side
<:worrykms:398047795732545536>
i just burned 180 stam doing the WRONG calyx cause i wasnt paying attention
im so annoyed
So more stacks
Cause you can ult more
It's viable but weaker
I've never used one
Congrats though
Die whale
Imo
Way easier
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Cause it's the char/time gated ones
Then I'm hard capped
I'm pretty sure I can get like maybe
5 or 6 max
I'm at 304 <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i cant pull on anything
i hope she's free
ahh
but i liked those better too
i came close to looking it up a couple times
ngl
at least those arent too bad
gdi
i found it
should be yeah
but can double check
i think i did every one when i needed strale
that one was a trip
yeah
im missing 3
wait what the fuck
brb
hoyolab, okay
where do you see that btw
what the
i try not to be unless the answer's really funny

<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
tet might catch me <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
<a:dalao:1110262708282069113>
i saw some people opting for beach one and you can if you wanted but the other two bigger value imo
salsatto if you wanna dps her
ageless otherwise imo
lol
we're still char building but like tet said no story either
also i mean
its only been 2 months
not yet
pls
<a:aJam811436950606839880:882187036650504274> <a:catjam:960029551885426738>
I see <a:patpat:943375983002677290>
Ohhh
Cause you said your schedule was jacked
Did you sleep at all
True!
Yo
But ty tet
Long ass name
Not on PC ATM or I'd do it
Name it socool or smth
Can you quote that image
Neko
<:eBKthumb:678570245018877982>
Hallo
Okay lol sure
On who lol because I hope you don't mean yukong
?
just faster than dps + 1
like tet said
she doesnt need speed lol
Since she has a boatload of her own
Dmg is best imo
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
<:worryok_hh:770950253658636329>
nvrmind
i think ting better
actualyl im a liar
although the ideal if no bronya is seele/ting/yukong/luocha
but to answer your question, ~~i think so~~ no imo
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
you cant auto with yukong though
if fast where she's first, dps / support must be 2/3

so not that much difference
if slow yukong where she's last, then the dps/buffer go after her the turn after
fast yukong or slow yukong
so 2 ways
since clara's so slow
for clara dps it literally doesnt matter though
she's finicky though, cause things like dance dance lc or cc buffs like freeze can impact it
you want her to go before the dps
so ideally its yukong > dps + 1
because her skill/stacks lasts for 2  turns
you need to tune her for your specific dps
but i do know this
gresham doesnt own yukong, i havent really looked into her
why
wait
i'll reinstall rn
bet
triple
also exp needs like
you stop gaining stuff at 65
should be
<:E_WorryGibMoraExp:932624859949842442>
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
<:TE_PepeLaugh:898642659743260783>
that looks good for yq
<:E_PoliwhirlConcern:793960306882773003>
Nice carv
so good
sp generator, big ass heal, energy efficient, aoe buff remover
what more could you ask for
yeah lol
~~his lc kinda mid~~
see
ruby's smarter than that
never
yeah he's cracked
at least a non refined one
right
otto only rly skills in emergencies or to build up AF stacks

i dont think you need natasha's cone for that
you're literally only using post op for er lol
then nvrmind back to qpq
it doesnt wtf
shared feeling might be the move
i take it back
actually carv
with refines qpq imo
but she mainly tanks, can be counter dps though
destruction chars are these weird hybrids rn overall though
tank generally
I don't use her though
Atk boots with speed subs should be fine
For who
?
Energy is nice either way, 100% ult uptime almost
Imo
But qpq mid if not superimposed
That one or quid pro quo works
Cursed server
<:worryPopcorn:411066690021883915>
Congrats!

You all good now?
How was the healing process
Oh btw I forgot
Surely
Okay fair
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Have been breaking gacha addiction too a bit
No longer care about capped stam
My spending on hi3 has flatlined LOL
I don't wanna pull
It'll do until I can pull again
That's never happening again
It just gave me a double 5 star
You're right
What the
I funnel my addiction here

I wanna see you break the bailu curse
Or streaming
Nini are you recording
cracked sw
Atk boots speed subs if possible
Whale
yeah is a lot lol
Harmony erudition are the go tos rn
Hunt maybe at some point cause dispel

i log in to roll and nothing else
i never knew LOL
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
thats what you do with those
wait
(base atk of unit+lc) * .55/0.27
doesnt matter
everyone else do the formula
2607 jy
2725 himeko
meaning ting needs 27something
the highest is himeko
correct
iirc
yeah
luka one is cracked
has good subdps cones yee
there was a nihility one leaked
<a:bcaPatientlyWaiting:764167633234559016>
waitng for a better lc
i just buy the superimposition things atm
you could've been s5'd lol
bruh
did you get the destruction one first
wait
still want speed subs though
then you're good
o
for max scaling with her lc
you need like 132
i think atk is fine if you can get the speed through subs
e0 right
aintnoway
not great but not terrible imo
its a watered down bronya lc and you need to tune the speed
5-8-8-8 across the board (before eidolons)
<a:peepoClap:788077991988822066>
I'm finally farming traces now
75-80 is *awful*
70-75 isn't bad
New event?
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
my name isnt robin hood

Even better
<:worrygalaxybrain:698804372766851113>
If you don't you 100% lose
If you pull you could 50% win
If you're asking you want it
Just pull
Don't hesitate
Don't ask
Pull carv
i wouldnt know i havent looked at numbers for either
but i doubt sushang beats him out
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
this is mine
not my acc
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Are mid
Ones i have rn
I need to farm better artifacts
That reminds me
There's too much aoe
Yeah moc 2 healers almost mandatory
im not refreshing anymore either
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
saving for jingliu
i have 15 pulls rn
yeah
2 of those were in 50
110 or 120
e2 was like
lc was 67 pulls
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
i accidentally got e2
<a:AA_Senpai_Run:1109879979828846634>
??
Not in this channel we dont
Pull everyone's banner and be happy with who you end up with
Just pull
There's a simple solution
Madge
I should've bought a sanpo con
I might do that from now on
I have like 4k left but not a wise use
25 per 10k is a rip off
I'm not pulling until jingliu
<:worrykms:398047795732545536>
I might have to start farming credit calyx again
So fast
I burned those credits
Yo same
I don't *need* it rn
But that's at 80
Like march and fmc get 10% def
Supports most don't need just yet
Do your DPS ones
Lemme rephrase
Cause dps
No i did jy
Just takes so much mats
Go for it
It's nice
Can kill before the fight starts
I figured
Good to know though
I haven't farmed ow in weeks
They what
I'm too broke for 80/80 all char
But ymmv
And bronya for the bonus 11% crit
Though the only one worth investing imo is seele who you don't own
1 needs 80
1 needs 75
At tb60 if you ascend your char 70/80, most of them
It's like 5 days a level
Not until 65
i just hit 61 today
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
WHALE
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
38 events
20 per event
That's new this patch yes
Guess not
With march sig lc
It's working well
I have 4k rn
<:worryCoffeeSus:778719399745945651>
If you need a breaker just use asta
Iirc
Atk rope better
Bait
Im missing 5 somehow
The events yeah
?
You guys saw all the qol stuff we got
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
And i need more weekly mats
There's like 6 chars ahead of her
I can't even build her either LOL
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
And now i can save for jingliu
Yeah it was lol
Only reason I went to e2
I got e2s1 in like 180 pulls
Just surprised you saw my slander that quick
Yeah ik lol it's all good
<@385655541248163840> fastest responses in the west wtf
Do this instead
Guys if you ever feel like randomly pulling
BSN2EWMHA4RP
new code
dammit carv
servers up
rip your circadian rhythm
fair
you said you'd sleep
actually nini why are you up btw
i forgot those were a thing
nice super react
iirc
no story this patch
no longed busted
this applies to no one here but this means sw e2 super luxury
Lol
Only 3 months late
Getting car fixed first
I'm gonna swing by in july
Oh that reminds me
Don't scare me
6:35 from now
Yes
I'm a liar
Should be 6 inthink
I sleep at like 12-1 anyway
Whatever it's fine
I forgot
Mfer
What
So sleep
You need rest
Approx.
11 est
Past your bedtime
Yeah 
For 5 star
trace lvl 9 is 160k 
Trace lvl 10 is 300k

4 star lvl 9 is 128k iirc

And the upper traces are 128k-160k each depending on rarity
<a:bugcatdeadpat:898434851160604684>
Help
Or 128k if 4 star
It's literally 160k per trace
After i stop doing credit calyxs
One day
I picked him up too
Nice
Build shampoo
Oic
It works but i think the event one better effect
She's a debuffer though
Or just use the event one
Are you gonna use lc
Yeah you could
I lost seele's to bronya
And haven't since
For char
I haven't lost a 50/50 since the first one
I might yeah
LOL
Is anyone streaming pulls
What's the second effect heki
?
I don't think bronya uses the celestial differentiator or whatever
She can though for the free cdmg but i feel like ageless would be better
?
<:teehee:610396865611038730>
I hated chem
Wog
With yq
If you have landau's choice march is strong
Or mix and match
I use asta fmc seele bronya
Ting jing march and natasha
Duh
Just kill them before they kill you
<:peeka:1058877271420715118>
Doesn't really matter
You haven't even unlocked moc
Natasha
I just have geppy
Me neither
Two healers is all you need
And you have natasha
Bailu is servicable
I'm personally skipping Otto and going all in on bronie
But hsr
Spiral
Abyss
Otherwise sw should be better long term
Anyway cata if you care about moc and want to clear now go otto
For repeated questions
That's my new answer
Or actually
No that's for heki
Answer
credit income is stupid
Duplicated message etc
Discord was dying earlier
Just saw this lol
wtf
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
And getting good *enough* artis until 60
That's why guides recommend farming mats
Yeah stuff is expensive
<:oldge:958678264468078603>
Whale wtf
You're 60?
~~so i can get closer to e6~~
kinda want that sampo con
i ngl
But no shot people wouldn't have outraged about it
No i understand completely what you meant
you're crazy lol
<a:modCheck:843977786568736789>
i didnt want this male
some weren't but they were complaining about ruining pity
to ask neffr
ask frann
ask neffr
<:peeka:1058877271420715118>
like what did you think would happen
and then some arent happy with jing / he grew on them
literally 95% of people i know that have jing were because they were pulling for ting
but i meant the guy that pulled c4 keqing before he got 1 copy of bennett
yeah idk how people thought a healer and buffer were mid
does nobody remember the bennett guy
is a BAD idea
pulling banner for 4*
again
if not high speed anyway
but pela prob the better more consistent choice
since she has seele
more so than the debuffs
though i was thinking speed
until like e4 or e6 <:deadge:975652771082698782>
yee true
i havent needed to debuff <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i dont use pela enough to justify but asta also expensive to run
personally
i say pela
any flat stat imo
from traces
like the 7.5% def, etc
flat stats matter too
12-15 = 1-12 in terms of cost btw lumi
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
e0 s1 sw skip luo now that i have geppy
im going back to this
okay this was a lie
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
oh ik what you mean
referring to the luck part specifically
i've never seen one lol
luocha and asta should synergize
though tbh
i mean true but how often do you get energy ropes
i feel like he's gonna need the energy more
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i dont think i've never not gotten frozen
jy best tank
<a:gaeunclap:850940986972307477>
but with the crit dmg set
this happened to me
<:FelisOk:1047083219587182682>
and get all hp/def pieces
i cant wait to start farming
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
my seele is so bad
i wish
~~not mine my relics garbo~~
i have like 0 crit <:cryge:966624721611403294>

wtf
game really told you to reset the run
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<a:orcasob:1024983856350244915>
no originality to me
most things i post here i grab from other sources
idk who made this
<a:TE_Chatting:881132712696635412>
since he's slow as shit
you need some on the subs yep
but it does make it easier
shouldn't need ting's e1 for it
harder to get and work around though cause your supports will need it too so atk works
on jing
speed is stronger
it is yep
apparently mats and achievement import is being worked on though
manual for now
no automatic importing
no
inventory takes you here
just click the corresponding menu
no but its really straightforward
you'll land here
But it does check against what you have and check it off
You have to put in your mats and the character details, doesn't export automatically
its very handy for planning
trying to level 3 units at a time <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I'm dying
This is why people burnt out lol

you're expectin people to read in the first place
but carv
but she isnt tanky at all either
seele serval and arlan are all lower
idk how the same people are consistently leaking with no action taken
like back in the day for game leaks you uploaded a bunch of shit to like 4chan or some forum and disappeared forever
im more annoyed its such a consistent thing
amazing
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

but she's much better than pela if you used pela
at this poitn she's a *nice to have* unit
if your team doesnt need as much attack and some help with weaknesses + shredding defense u use sw

fun game
i like it a lot rn at least
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but its hell either way
eq4 you get 1 purple every like 15 it feels like
cause at eq5 you're almost guarenteed 1 purple a run
the crimson calyx
well at eq4 for gold calyx its maxed
i think any mat farming before 60 feels bad
ohh
no its easy i just feel like i should be doing traces or artifacts or smth
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i dont wanna farm gold calyx anymore
ye
atm it feels like literally every non shield support in the game is just wild wheat + ageless
i think for the most part the v2 ones are fine
past and future is very very solid though
or chorus
i like dance if you have it
its good but not the best imo
great pull <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
nice birthday gift from mihoyo
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
i bet you win it
And I've lost twice
All my fucking lc are 70+
Char 50/50 yeah recently
Well
Before cons
Get the lc
That could've been luocha money
No because I'm actually annoyed lol
Nor are her eidolons worth swiping for
I have no desire for the stellaron duo
Then not spending until jingliu
E2 s1 for sw and luo
You're right it is a lie
Not until jingliu
They swapped yukong to luocha <a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
<@385655541248163840> I'm late but I'm slightly annoyed i S5'd jing

i warned you lol
luocha better value
vpn doesnt work anymore?
they jacked up your prcing
oh what
the earlier the better imo if you dont care about moc
like its so fucking expensive
all my subs are garbo
get something *usable* for now
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i just ran wild wheat a bunch
<:pillowcina:872203638746017842>
good so far
im farming golden calyxs rn
im farming his and seele artis
once i hit 60
relatable LOL
if you wanna spend <:deadge:975652771082698782>
money better spent on refreshes ngl
would cost that many pulls
and you can math out cost from there
if you took this average though, it
i think that only shows chars
you can math it out for the weapons though
between those 3
that shows cost and averages



if you want approx. use genshin
save for sw or luocha <:prayge:863861301310652416>
like 4 or 5 losing 1 50/50
e2, s5 or both
for waht exactly

Very skill hungry
And she's very high damage but
Most everything rn is weak to phys
She's it
Sushang if you're looking for just dps
Hook is good but not what you need rn
Welt dps is throwing
> asks who to build in team
> Offers 2 options

> I don't like that option
Which sushang and yq are
Yq is conditional
Depends on content i suppose but sushang is a strong option
Got
Who do you git
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>

Wait do you not have work today
Picked up from another server that calls her smelly <:ohno:959752132905566261>
Seele
If the rest are lvl 7 already
Also only trace you really need on smelly rn anyway should be the talent
No i need it
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
I got 3 from her earlier
Yeah, 2 with a chance at 3
At eq4
I hope it all rolls into hp
I suppose
But use whatever has better subs
Yeah idk what these guide makers are smoking
Yq has follow up?
I'd rather the guarantee
But idk
Not to me personally
I think my fmc is gonna use ageless ngl
🇱
Gotta get those dorm buffs up
Then pre farm to 60
So I'm in the mines until ~56
You won't get best drops until 60
Tbf too
Kill me too
At this point in saying fuck traces and farming artifacts
Same
That's what I'm doing
Just give everyone wild wheat
Than this one that they got while farming seele
I'd rather farm the def set and a set of ageless
They're like deep into moc so for them my guess is they take a lot of dmaage
Just use the set you have better subs for
Seems like it's not too different from genshin
Ahh
Is there a spreadsheet
surely
you got this
but the 20% applies to allies too so idk
they changed it
their subs are fucking cracked
so im a liar
im surprised its possible lol
for the achievement
also
jk idk if its legit
totally legit
<@416445660443967491>
Def set
I don't think so
4.5k def
My whale friend uses her in moc with like
Keep buffing that shield
Lol yeah
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
Dog cr tho
Like 5k on breaks and ~3ish normally
Mine is going pretty okay damage
Yours maybe
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
prob not actually
can you check artifacts
this much to 60 > 70 a unit
kill me
every single one was 70+
i didnt lost any 50/50s but man
jing actually cost everything
exactly yeah
i think i skip luocha now
im gonna try for sw and lc
the game won
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oof
for e2s1 thats amazing
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
or those weere pulls saved
$300?
how much
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
or the voidwalker thing
i hate that thing
i take them over the damn centaur any day personally
the big frost monster, right
geppy+m7+yq+sw will be the best team imo for him
but thats a full 5* roster basically
highkey
def annoying though <:deadge:975652771082698782>
that i get and agree with 
but i dont think aoe is a problem per se if he's never next to the shielder
at least currently
the shield is too small
at the higher levels
fmc really doesnt
but imo yanqing is better if you never get hit
really depends on situation
early sushang seems better
meh
me neither
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
i dont own yelt or use yq, not sure
but i  also dont know if m7 is enough to fully draw aggro away
yeah moc is cancer
that iplys no but idk
my yq ded
im missing himeko too
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
march 7th eating good rn <:deadge:975652771082698782>
otto
i need a secomd healer bad
id invest
if i had her
mhm
til
asta lc is badly worded
oh apparently
exactly
we're all still building acc
hasnt been a month yet
also perspective
o
??
the books i mean
this isnt enough to 60-70 a char
for lc exp
im hurting so bad
its nice
at eq4 you get 4
very quickly
you're gonna hit a wall
once you hit 50
so ngl
only
yeah
we all still need to scale ~8-10
how the fuck are you lvling all your characters
apparently eli does
sensory pursuit first yes
i think resolution is personally better
otherwise void is an ok 3*
if you want her to do dmg use this one
if supporting the one above
i using this one rn
pulling for the 4* is a bad idea 🤓
and this is bronya
<@964806731471405086> tingyun
pela good for screenshot damage too
until yukong
friend in another server
<:peepoBlush:610641863816511538>
yeah mald sim until its dome
which is it neko?
a higher friend limit
they really need
rng sucks here
not bad but <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
done aster
tet lives in the future
lemme kick someone
did you try to add aster?
its actually not made up is the funny thing
:howishegeneratingthismuchpower:
jk seele is still way faster
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
swipe harder and they will
11/20 aren't elation
I picked elation
Su rng dog
Gotta clear space
What's your UID btw
But effect hit rate itself is chance of debuffs landing
So there's an artifact set
That once yours is50% or more
Gives 15% def
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
But i cba
I need effect hit rate for mine
But once you get def it doesn't matter too much
Shield is tiny yeah
That's called a projection sir
She seems strong but not dominating
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
Busted
E6 is like
I'm not into dommy mommy type
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
Kafka who
Was why i thouhht
I saw your code in channel
Wog
Ohhh
?
Aster plays sea though i think
That's a e2 if you won 50/50
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
To e6s5
A friend of mine went from not wanting him
Prob
It was for ting
No because Jing deserves the best <:clueless:973756617109676032>
I said it feels whale
I didn't say i was f2p
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
But it feels whale
I want to do this
See
Only last 5 turns
Wildfire isn't that good
It's what i used before i got march lc
Yeah that works
Hey it's universal market
But def fire mc
Natasha doesn't need much she'll be quick
100%
I don't max refresh
It's fucking def
Every time i craft though
Subs were okay
For jing
Lightning orb
Ye
That's still a 10 pull a week
Just 3x a day is enough
50>75>75>100>100>150>150>200
I haven't played since 2.1 idk <:02shrug:809888510143496264>
It's 8
It's not
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
next time nini
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
do you need any cones?
breakfast is pretty good but id save
My subs are so bad
Bro
You have 35% higher vrit
-7 speed and -a lot of crit
I need to fix my Jing still
Yeah what Alice said
I think you can
Just look at mine
You have me added
Wait
If it's non emotional
Damage I'd keep
By now
Grim has a vid somewhere i think
Or 4 PC of either
And 2 PC  lightning 2 PC musket
Lightning orb attack chain
Generally crit rate chest attack boots
Speed is nice and what I'm using though
Ah
Yukong doesn't exist
But who knows
Yukong may change that
He gets crit dmg from lc
For the 50% bonus
Crit rate chest if running salsotto
<a:orcasob:1024983856350244915>
You guys are getting books?
Ic
Are you trying for the achievements
doing this daily farming
im mentally unwell
<:FelisOk:1047083219587182682>
i have no mats and no credits
im so broke
nini help
low pity too
no nvrmind
wednesday i think
won almost every 5050
friend of mine
Pwease
Someone fund me orange speed boots
Relatable
50 is fucking expensive
And weekly mats
I hope you farmed ascension mats
<a:Smoge:808844088115068938>
But still
Not much to go off of
I didn't click the link idk
Pulls/=sales
That looks like pulls
Though tbf
<a:TE_Chatting:881132712696635412>
<:peeka:1058877271420715118>
But i thought he wouldn't do well because he's a man and not from honkai and everyone was skipping
so no big deal to them
they only play 1-2 hours a day
they still play though
LOL
and immediately went looking for a starter acc
my friend got e1 himkeo
pretty sure they're uninstalling lol
for e2 bailu
my friend did like 80 pulls
cracked
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
glad its only sp
honkai gacha too soon
actually cracked
nice
wtf
but prob not
depends on this event
lost only 1 50/50 so far
havent lost a 75/25 yet
cause i spent my other pulls on seele
320 i think
i swiped like
starrailstation.com
pulls so far
they went good
or loucha
not pulling until sw
i gotta look at the total but
for nothing
i threw another 60 on there too
ty ty
<a:aworryRun2:601196179878969382>
no
i got e1s1 in 125
i got e5 ting
lucky
wow
how did everyone make out here?
if no bp
iirc it was s5 breakfast
super squish team <:deadge:975652771082698782>
i used her natasha hook and asta for floor 2
~~she actually did~~
just use smely 5head
Double dps gets shut down
Preferably
You need 2 healers
And every time Nini has changed opinion
I've popped in here 3 times today
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
It's supposed to be 50 jades
new code HSRVER10JYTGHC
Can someone lmk if this works
Ah it's not here
.
I have faith for once
You're better off with new units
However f2ps should never pull weapon
It's 20-30% higher than the next best option

However f2p should never pull weapon
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
I can't read moon runes
Seele
And then i pulled smelly
That's what I did
<:TE_PeepoLaughPoint:854581698422112266>
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
she's good then i swear
for jing lc
swipe
ult is nice though ngl
nor do i care for kafka/sanpo team
if im pulling jing why am i pulling kafka 
i dont need to double up on lightning
no kafka
no
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
which is pocket change for nini but still
thats like 200 a banner
and if i pull him too im def not pulling until jingliu lol
cause seele + jing + sw back to back is a lot
i havent gotten that far im kinda feeling out sw first
i could always cope with bailu
prob not idk
for majority of people he's just gonna be a healer
how so?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i want luocha now too
help
<@385655541248163840> okay
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
mine was crit dmg LOL
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
surely this is winnable
Same for the seele one, it's not necessarily the best
After i saw break effect set recommended i kinda just threw him away
40% on basics bad
Cause 20% speed good
Is that the 20% speed?
Or you don't mean major trace
Can only build one more char
Spread a tad too thin
My mats are in critical condition
I also may have fucked myself pulling seele
<:Deadge:942802905046581248>
I'm shocked i still made it past svarog
I can't get past geppy
Is still beating my ass
Forgotten hall 15
Yeah that shit is hard
Moc?
Yeah bp
I have 30 pulls and a dream
Can you pull mine too
Not great but not as bad as like himekos
Today is another peaceful day is pretty good
All of the cones are there still
You should be S5 cruising by now
Did you use the herta stuff on pulls
??
<:kekew:1084510710756806737>
Break set
LMAO
ahh
?
actually yes in my old neighborhood
there's a good amount of openings here
a very surprising amount of people still\
~~only like 5 of us work here!~~
have literally never heard of it
til
that exists?
excuse me
im surprised you never got into tot
this was how they were tested
which kinda fucks himeko lc
these were all run against 1 enemy though
cutee
pardo also isnt really dead
from what i've seen
would be crazy to expect every support to have an ae ~~reign~~ longevity
yeah
then this shouldn't apply lol
legit question i havent played since 2.1
has any support unit really fell off in genshin
anyway no
oh wrong way
owomath 23000 / 21
in this game?
based
LOL
or no?
e0s1?
you were getting lc too right nini
cope
cause windblume festival
i think it was venti
1.4
if i skip i'm prob not getting them in the future
he isnt imo but he will be really strong
rn im thinking seele > jing > sw > maybe fu xuan, i like her kit > jingliu for my shopping list
i think seele's dominance will be unquestioned for the first like 4 patches
LOL
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
and just happened to spend it on seele
no i whaled for jing
yes
was all
im not e0 gamer anmore
no u
<a:nou_hh:833500436526530570>
okay this was a lie
<:worryThanos:446510364272885762>
now for jing
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
impossible
i have her lc too
build mine
LOL
this was svarog
14
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
with 1 star yeah
all i have is serval
he hits hard as fuck
oh jeff
forgotten hall
e0 gamer
prob not cons anymore tho
nah i still pull
from c2 > c0
he just got demtoed
i have to swipe now though
<@416445660443967491>  look what i got
braxoclown
<:nope:1107369053179367474>
on forgotten hall 15
how the fuck y'all beat cocolia
It does at 2.7/3k+
she will with jing's cone
My Jing relics are all mid
Same
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
Mine is 2pc musketeers 2pc wind
Nice
wtf
<:peeka:1058877271420715118>
Oh that reminds sme
<:AyakaWatching_Rui:1090633910997766225>
And i doubt it ywah
Ayaka forever
If it's same week you're not going outside
Idr
Isn't genshin the week after
Patch is ye
Reset isn't i think
I will when they get here

Rn i use
 fire mc serval dan heng bronya
Natasha pela asta hook
Ig keep farming ting/Jing ones
And my team traces are maxed
I'm sick of relics
Idk what to spend Stam on atm
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
My hunt su is actually gonna be maxed superimposed on Monday
I can't take it anymore.

I'm sick of Seele. I try to play Sushang, my Seele deals more damage. I try to play Yanqing, my Seele deals more damage. I try to play Dan Heng, my Seele does more damage. I want to play Tingyun, her best team has Seele. I want to play Bronya, but she wants Seele.

She grabs me by the throat, I grind for her, I do SU for her. I bought the 5* SU Hunt Lightcone for her, even superimpose it for her. She isn't satisfied. I pull for her signature lightcone, she scoffs it off. I need this to be superimposed. She tells me she doesn't need a team and she throws herself onto her enemies. You just need to support me, I can do everything by myself. I can't pull for more support characters, I dont have enough oneiric shards and they aren't available yet. She grabs my credit card, it declines. Guess this is the end.

She uses her ult. She says Disappear among the sea of butterflies, illusions of the past. At this point, I've already been broken. Nothing but resurgence always having her turn every single time. What a cruel world.
And i sleep until jingliu
Just pulling him and sw
Only for jing
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Soon <:prayge:863861301310652416>
On average it will take a while, but you can be fucked
This is from genshin but relevant
Because 4* isn't Guaranteed
Because pulling for ting
Even though they don't want him
Because they'll get Jing
Like a *LOT* of people are gonna be pissed these next couple weeks
I wouldnt
If you're pulling just for the 4 star
But pela is only slightly worse
Sw is a very strong debuffer
What chars do you want
I mean
Are you asking if sw a skip?
?
fuck svarog's za hando
finally <:deadge:975652771082698782>
ice is king
also in current moc
is so good
but the ult debuff
she has respectable damage
yes
soon
50%
E2
Kafka con
Mine are too, i haven't farmed yet
But still
<:Deadge:942802905046581248>
I have to rebuild like 3 chars
Break effect gives more dmg on the hit that bar is broken on
Break efficiency breaks the bar faster
If anyone else didn't know
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
the raccoon
Posted in leeks
?
I'm guessing you guys saw [REDACTED]
Me neither
Good thing I'm not a slut
Ah
I open this chat for the first time all day to this
They just did the eva thing i think
There are websites for that
I'd rather c1-2 3 chars than c6 1 char
At most e2 s2
I c6 no one
<a:nomballs:1056949905127637002>
I'm just waiting to see what kits look like after 1.3

But to your point i think vertical seems best
He was fun though
For serval
I have shampoo but i put him down
Himeko shampoo etc whoever
Yeah, prob
In Kafka teams the dot is stupid
<@385655541248163840> did you ask cause you wanna rank Kafka up?
You need like 18
Then it doesn't count
Yeahhh
Until Kafka comes
He's a juiced up serval
Tbf
<@82358863155703808>
You only technically have 9
And 2 were path effect
So like if you had 11
Toward that total
Also I'm 99% sure path formation doesn't count
Wtf
Are you sure all 16 were the same path
What's your ability tree level
It's called working papers <:joenerd2:762095982094581782>
nihility is cracked
ngl
for your earlier question about placement
this is why
<@385655541248163840>
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
blubbers
a friend in a server
i want jingliu whenever she drops
<a:nono:960016699032227911>
there's not enough resources to pull and level up everyone this early so im just gonna swipe the ones i like for now
for whoever i like next
then saving
bronie yeah
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
just waiting for him
im sooo bored
<@385655541248163840>
i just burned 700 jades and i feel dirty
also how do people max refresh in this game
yep*
thats right yeo
c6r5 tb50
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
fire mc next
okay bronya and natasha talents done mostly
<a:SMH:1021112056063213648>
?
42-47
yeah
hey saint said the same thing
for at least a week
yes
yeahh use it lol
u wanna do guarantees resin returns rather than artifacts which is a sink
iirc
you get 2 guarenteed orange t=at eq4
60>70 is stupid
much worse than 50>60
is insane
cause the mat reqiurement
oh they stopped now
and rose and chrisbo saved until eq3
only rose chrisbo and a couple others dont
ryeo too
tb 50*
saint is bp 50
except pat
everyone chatting rn max refreshed
also to answer your question in sols
i've been burning like mad
e1 is 25% aoe
e2 is another 20% for ult skill basics i think
e4 to be exact
she gives more energy, and jing seems pretty energy hungry
im forsaking pela ~~only slotting her in if i need ice~~
nini this is gonna be my jing team basically
That dragon fucked me up
I didn't know how hard the weekly bosses scaled
Also
Nice
So those stay at 50
So i guess leveling talents one char at a time
And i don't think any of my lc good enough to warrant 60 yet
Got everyone i use 50/60 though
I was not prepped lol
Insane
40 is
I'm gonna focus on farming
Expensive
Everything is 🫰
Just trying to survive
Idk, I'm not there either
Rip
After forgotten hall
Memory of chaos
Eli did you make it to moc yet
<a:bloodlao:959706412685099038>
kafka
hosting this week too so i can clean up a bit
so just gonna chill
and i forgot to take the pto back
i was supposed to be somewhere but that got cancelled
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
im off today
i can stream if you wan
are you at work
will lyk
trying 4-2 rn
but idk
im about to
how hard are worlds 3-2 and 4-2
oh i benched march too dw
only c1 too
she puts up good enough numbers with a *lot* of break
she's carried me hard for a whilee
you can
jing
i like serval but
but i use them a bit too
serval and dan heng are forsaken rn
this + bronya/pela, depending on enemy
then hold off
im gonna 50/60 my core main team
well
im skipping dps units i think
true
rn im getting everyone relevant to 50/60
so her and jing make sense
ting gets a nice attack bump at 60
fmc was my first to 60 as well
echoes of war yep
?
echoes is the weekly right
good to know though lol
oh im doing stagnant shadow rn
<a:bcaFedupUghh:703605002899423322>
im in same boat lol
this is painful
neither am I
ty for reminding me
i STILL havent done er
wait shit
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
10 days
since her ult increases speed, but lightning lord isnt impacted by it
asta wont be that good with him i think
yeah
so ideally you want to build stacks/buff as much as possible
im pretty sure lightning lord just attacks at the end of the turn
o
to maximize the lc
dont you need 160
i can watch for a bit
i need to r5 crusing
Get me some too
This is general 3 basically
Stacked acc
You whale
Congrats
Amazing
Hallo
<:Deadge:942802905046581248>
But just don't use it with clara
Overall
Looks like gepard is better
First one
I'd think hers would be better
What do both do?
How the fuck you have c6
?
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
im at like 115 lol
wtf
Need to save ~~money~~ levels for jing
Good
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
Last weekend i couldn't play at all
I missed days remember
I'm at like 27
Not even close
That's at BP 40 though?
Ye
But good general knowledge cause idr how it worked
The only reason I knew this was cause of the whales lol
I think it is if you enchant it
Rip
20% chance to dispel
That's preservation buff ye
Ohh
?
Or the herra one
You have her lc
You can get insane dmg watching the boss suicide
Yeah
But also there's only whales that I've seen do it
For Clara counter
Iirc you run preservation
It's really nice
Gl
Yes
Gonna wait for weeklies now
I grinded it ye
Cause i could bomb her twice
26 and stopped
I went to like
Okok
What level is your ability tree btw
<a:bloodlao:959706412685099038>
also cn is op
<@416445660443967491> <@385655541248163840> finally beat it
ideally
it'll take forever but you never die
i missed 3 or 4 days
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
its stupid
i wasnt kidding LOL
that explains it
ahh
im just +6 atm
are you maxing them?
artifact farmers
i havent been farming though
this is mine
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
my name isnt ryeo
you want this to be you eventually
ye
its stupid lol
heal on skill, ult, basics, and all allies heal when natasha uses skill
and heals when attacking enemy
but you do no dmg
if you set it up you literally never die
with abundance
kafka takes *ages*
me neither
i get to phase 2 and get demolished
<:A_HuSadge:814445957960826931>
i dont have the dps for either
right?
kill cocolia without killing bronya
no more pverty for catalao
you can skip tat
yeah
i just pulled it
its in the thread
<@704867526877904908> if you have any of these
EDIT: nvrmind you do not
trying to clear now lol
based
fair
liike clara's was solid
and the character story quests too
most of them have been pretty interesting imo
i had them expose themself
which did you pick
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
same

That said I enjoyed the story and animation up until the end (around when they introduced frill), was left more confused than anything
Started off very strong but clover was making like 3 other anime at the time

Animation became outsourced, story kinda fell apart toward the end and movie didn't really help
That sounds normal to me lol
There's no doubt that he's a good athlete, but I doubt that he'll win as he's injured?
in negative statements doubt is followed by that. In other statements it's followed by if or whether.
I doubt if he will win doesn't sound like proper English to me
I think D

fair
~~i did warn you to save the pity~~
The most i do with mine is mute people then unmute right after lol
I am once again asking to make me a mod
exactly
which is bp now too
cause you'll have nothing for next patch
if you want could throw 10 at it but i wouldnt recommend going deep into that banner
+10 attack and another pri/mei BiS
vs htr and gear
are you planning to *gear* the trio
do you plan to get htr
what crystals you got
do you have hot
to save
you're skipping
didnt you say
<:suss:936998044891754558>
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
Gl <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
Lemon Mona lisa and Styx take +100
Oko doesn't have hoh and tenma doesn't play anymore
You can retain
That's still 9 spots
Who else?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah
on paper this looks strong
are pulse rifles still broken?
~~that screenshot is rl though, everything works there~~
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
and not hiding stuff
well she has her husband back
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
it doesnt get much better lol
tbh
compromise seemed best
there wasnt anywhere happy they could take that situation yeah
true
yeah
no but we do know he didn't find satisfaction in any relationships or other outlets of release other than danny once a year
kinda worked out for the couple though?
it sounds miserable
i mean like to me he's happiest once a year and cant really find anything better the rest of the year
idk about happy but its okay
iirc?
did it end where theo fucks a stranger and danny fucks karl once a year?
i misremembered
oh wait wait
my guess is they divorced
i warned you
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Are you actually watching vipers
Bro
Yes
I'm homeless now
Isn't that one kinda fucked
Actually a pleasant surprise
That's a pretty good one yeah
Yeah
LOL
That's unironically hang the dj
You watched san junipero right
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
Idr what I said
What were the episodes
No like I'm asking
I know me and Nini give you a bunch
What's on the list
<:poggies:799768079814361088>
3 wishes
Omg
LMAO
~~check audit log~~
Have fun watching lol
i found the show mostly liek this ngl
playtest was a good one
she's watching black mirror
i think tet's going for that next
but it all came back to me
i havent watched this show in so long
this last one
oh just you wait tet
carrie needs a hug
disrespectful
<:OH_peepoTrash:743662557226598460>
this was the most shocking episode for me
i think personally
i wasnt kidding
<a:excitedHoony:970578353809657879>
lmk what you think about those ones
that one was brutal
Black Museum was really good too
man against fire maybe too
i think good episodes for me were white bear, hang the dj (s4 ep4), and um San Junipero iirc
so good
yeah that one was crazy
but this is highkey true lol
i just jumped around seasons mostly
i think s4 ep 4 was okay too
creepy
its a slow burn but its like
yeah
and put it in an episode
take that
so like why do people use them
you know what an ouija board is?
no
i think s2 ep1 was pretty interesting
real
LMFAO
i just feel bad
its a rollercoaster when you're blind but like when you know whats coming
its a wild ride either way
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
I remember this episode omg
I'd say htr though right now
Which will feel bad to play without ai
But there's no shot mihoyo doesn't make new ignite shit
But you either invest in fire and skip htr
Or invest lightning/fire and get an ice DPS too
Wait for v3
<a:darksideslap:786450895378317342>
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
but id rather cope turg tb sus m/ppm and save the crybbals
if you pull b you can prob use irene or glut or smth
if you pull t i think you're fucked
why not just turb tb sus m?
you dont even  have a 10 pull though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but
i've tried before
i mean
Go phys
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<a:JailedTakoWantsToLeaveButCant:869950055044505650>

Depends on team
Remember?
I showed you a 9s in forbidden
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
My brackets suck
I want to kill myself
Just 18k and play something else
It's a vacation
Nirv is nice
Breh
LOL
dor/key of reason is usable and feels okayish
but you'd get more out of sushang i think
probably sushang then
no crusher/ff hb ss
weapon/no stigs s2 jk

thats a toughie
now get 750
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
her stigs are huge for her
i dont have like a dps test or anything though
i dont think sushangs rank ups are *that* impactful pre ss
i'd honestly still opt for hb if you dont have sushang gear, but can test it

eli broke 830 with cb19 ss hb this cycle as an example
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but i'd imagine hb is better
idk the difference between s0 sus turg tb ppm and 4/4 sss hb though
not really sure
do you have sus weapon at least?
hb is the wave for you
Ah
Isn't it 30 per card?
You just got 60 free frags
Im actually annoyed
But I don't think it's a bad idea
Could forge pledge of Sakura if you want
👀
Your top up says different
Wasn't it in BP like 3 times now
Who would even use shui
Just in time for assaka
You never know if it's needed again
Like drac M was for a bit
My personal policy is keep a stig if I never had it, and reso future dupes
But what would you even get from exchange
I think B is mega dead nowadays
Oh, B

It's fucked yes
Though it's moot now. Almost certainly excommunicated from this community.
Who again, he swindled over $500 usd between some of them
Leading to one of them being disowned by their family.
Formed an army of simps
Yep
Doing crowd control
I will in a bit
<a:CB_poof:595321900717178952>
Anyways
Including sols yes
Various armada discords
No
I've been out literally all day and come back to this. I'm fucking pissed
Fucking scum of the earth
Someone was disowned. Hundreds of dollars total lost from multiple people.
Basically that
Yes
But yes
I don't want this shit spreading to this server
Please

Not that I care
Forgot about this Lol
Man 
Unexpected doxx

prob glut, but unsure
Stay out of my brackets pls 
You'll smoke me
Mobi survived HT weather

If she gets the nyx treatments then that's at least 6 bosses that patch
But idk if she'll be an easy skip
For most people yeah
I don't think so
Honestly
I want new herrscher to be ice
This was because I have no ice dps
See what
<:felishoryshet:959980144263581696>
<a:terilurk:960002977257648190>
it def will break your ma scores though if you care about that
2% wont make or break your agony scores but its nice to have
same for the lightning/ice/fire ones
but yeah i would level it
i mean
its important if you care about nirv/easier rl
at lvl 9/10 that sword gives 8.0% phys
yeah
Then I might be capping
<:CB_pika_think:553556724917862400>

bruh
true lol
old one was so outdated though
<:PepeSmile:966629532943650836>
ww is looking sick ngl
better to 4/4 herrscher than throw pennies at sp gear imo
tbh
you're probably better off saving
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
edit: im pepega this is in the annoucements in game <a:bcaDerpDrawLazy:439086052758650900>
waiting on marisa to confirm, could be 6.1 for all we know
yeah
potentially
5.9
<:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
i wish i can clear fast
wowe

Wow

Bullying Jizo in agony again huh
600 ez
Gogo cata
:mobidead:
<a:bcaFailScooter:872242158910984212>
In some brackets sure
For most players

For people who want to try, I think It incentivizes people who promote to nirv and just sleep to actually try instead
There's gonna be slack brackets still
But idk <:A_HuTaoShrug:792525248779517972>
Idk I feel like it blows nirvana wide open
Esp with how much brackets have grown
Imo
No pressure
Nah
You can honestly 18k and sleep and still retain now lol
More crystals for sure
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
i don't play either
<a:ChillBar_bonk:956619302692335616>
Ty ty
<:meowpensivepray:814858736497590302>
I see now
Like we do in sols
Ohhh
How to 946 every boss?
What about?
Oic
You're taking up Magery's work?
Blog?
i don't wanna remember back then
and the rhapsody pri
<:worrySadPat:633872417223213056>
wait, how did you max 11th but not bri ex then?
and it never is <:tericross:902580093304586320>
and i always hope they fix it the patch after
no fr
i really hope they add them next patch
<:Fubuki_Grabby:828297136927801374>
gib
your asterite
and the equipment mats <:deadge:975652771082698782>

honestly
its a vicious cycle
use coin to buy mats => run out of coins to actually upgrade with => wait for both coins and mats
and a3 isn't hard even without gear (read: 12/12 teams)
only really hard if you aren't somewhat geared
where the stigs give the effect and not the valk
i was thinking hers worked like DA's for some reason
thats what it was, ty
<:kekDoggo:775708084051378217>
griseo stigs give bleed, no?
SpA doesn't *need* AE per se
Ye
HoF or SpA
HoR but ehh
Mobi, SpA, etc
could probably just use an elemental mech in the latter case (if you have one, not sure)
cata with the 900 yeah
doesnt make sense to me
you wont use ely for a while
iris at 50 is good enough, and you aren't using fr dps
senpri maxed is for dps senti (and extra dmg in MA), and why do that?
but i dont think you need max pris in agony
but there's better players than me here who may have better ideas
just leave them and save pri mats for herrscher
thats also true, yeah
if you're agony gaming honestly
imo
leave iris and senpri at 50
DoI
what is wotp?
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
o i just saw this wtf
pretty common in exalted brackets though
there's a LOT of older players
most of them dont really try though
<:PepeSmile:966629532943650836>
there's whels in agony too
my bad
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
tap > full att sequence > tap > tap > ult
the slash is fricking hard
with the twirl attack its a lot easier
tap > tap > 2 stacks of black > tap > tap > ult

oh nvrmind

wait
yeah this boss can be pain
<a:bcaFailScooter:872242158910984212>

Styx akayuki etc

No gear elf or anything
Edit: I know krakens this isn't me
There's a very large difference between s0 SS and SSS whales
I agree with this
A buddy of mine said that about Spina and they didn't have mobi at the time

watch you get 5 purples in one pull <a:deadlao:959706479470985286>
i'd give you my mobi weapon if i could
yeah, ig handel/monet/jingwei (if one enemy) or something works
hopefully you can get 2 missing gears in 40 <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
we might get focused cards too <:Copium:834822065231364156> 
i hope
that's around 17k?
you said 63 pulls assuming a3 retention, right?
not even 30 pulls
you'd only have 8k crystals after the skin
you can brute force with fire
ohh
i saw 5.9 lol

i know about mobi banner then
banners are out?
or you're guessing mobi banner since mobi skin?
had to skip for cerulean though
time runner is actually better than i thought it would be
outfit is 9600 crystals
one of the best skins i've seen
i'd get it if i had a mobi to wear it <:tericross:902580093304586320>
50 cosmic good
DoS need max
you lose sp from base weapon > until dos 65
i'd say maybe 
but you really shouldn't skip sp gear if possible
just use mobi on type counter hos
but gl gl <a:kittylove:782465422099742732>
def not lao lol
<:CB_ghost_hug:586822702061584392>
that can be left at 50
should be fine anyway
true yeah
wouldn't be my first pick though
wait, then why'd you make iris
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
oh, no weapon
and seem to want to skip cezanne (which is fine in agony)
personally, i'd still say nebs at 50
but hof for sure
and mobi too ig if you can eventually 4/4 her since she needs the sp from linn
since you already made ely and iris
are you looking to eventually promo/retain ex RL?
or chilling in a3/rl bouncer?
ohhh
was referring to this
who is si?
not familiar
wait, you want mobi skin and gears at 63 pulls?
ah
why get hekate and not her cross?
griseo could greatly increase your phys team since you dont have paga
dont think about dps fr
if your FR isn't ss2
what havent you pri'd yet lol
yeah HFS is your best bet i think
lvl 50 senpri isn't that good, but better players than me can confirm
There's like no ice content next patch yet so hold off on DoR

Idk about the use case for Iris, also didn't realize you didn't have AE
i wouldn't make senpri if you havent yet
<:CatHmm:938153335423377489>
since herrscher is expected then
though idk about maxing hof 
im not boomer enough to know how quickly she gets kicked out of meta once 6.0 comes
no one makes refs for lvl 50m pris
its better to make dps > support > max 
easier to copy refs too
generally, you can go wide (have a ton of lvl 50 pris)
or go deep (have a select few max pris) then branch out
nebs is def first no matter what to me
who's dps
what teams you use the most/have mostly complete
<:slaphic:638931285838135316>

Yooo
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
<:deadge:975652771082698782> i see
wouldn't really recommend HoS DPS nowadays though
Senpri isn't usually needed outside of extra damage in MA, or when you have enough SP that Cosmic won't make a difference in abyss
but my thoughts on it
imo
Nebs should be the first if you have AE or HoS
<:bceCoy1Evil1:593020248513314816>
yes

Do it <:cheerhic:877383900324843560>

No

Al
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
Yeah trio is dead
I'm off that day ping me too
56% BE and enough energy to allow a 3T ult
Memories s5
That's the one I'm using
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
She already gets 57.3 BE from traces, and 60% from lc
But yeah her build kinda depends on what you're pulling for her lol
<:seele:963352407365017640>
If the weakness bar is too thin, gimmicks on breaking the weakness can be done without rm. If the weakness bar is too thick, rm might break right before the thing dies anyways.
It's all just extra anyway
But she's very flexible
More SPD is fast clear stuff
Ult duration I mean
Well
For an extension
For example you can use vonwacq to make her ult before dps on her first turn and then have her be slower after that
This is viable too
She's gonna be so good
It's free DMG on top of a stacked kit
Yee
So not negligible by any means to your point
10k dmg on 60 toughness mob tho
~48k on 300 toughness boss, which is super easy to break
It's decent damage
rm extension + talent break dmg totals to ~47k dmg on a 480 toughness boss
Break effect, that's literally it
something like this is believed
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
should be free
People were talking about destruction maybe being good here but erudition, specifically argenti, should stomp
Can just full dps/support
I like it

someone posted on miyoushe

Need to see team interactions
But
Okay I'm satisfied
Way better vid wtf
thats fair
ic
for me personally
but sp packs was always annoying
im fine with missile stacking and cat balding
case in point
new players couldnt handle that
Yeah that was part of what made ma cancerous

That made the difference for ae and Hotf lol

Blade and dhil was fun
Lowkey
I think I'm running dual DPS more
<:Gui_Cry:1121640094563061873>
Yeah I think rm+ hh+ 2 dots is the new dominant team
<a:CB_yesnod:651894141952983060>
They do a lot better than I thought
Same tbh
Topaz jy is amazing
Ever since nini pmo
Pull more characters
But she's still very good with her
Like Jingliu for example, she doesn't buff the biggest parts of jingliu's kit
Like She'll be good there, it's just not her specialty
She's a direct upgrade to pela asta etc
So like
.
Cracked
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
Glgl
Both SPD boots
Some ehr but not much
Well, yeah atk% spd
If you have Kafka LC you can build SPD, but she wants to be fast anyway

Is just easier to hit 160 for new planar
And blade/rm first
My kafka and gui atm
Worth the wait
This is what I'm doing too to your point
Ic
Fwiw at e1s1 his damage is about the same as it was before
Yeah 15%
rn im e2 blade (e0 atm) > e1 mei (no lc) > hanabi 
and if the double rerun is real, probably e2 kafka if there's leftovers (there wont be) (e1 atm)
blade eidolons come first
on a rerun
a lot of people were doomposting earlier
TL;DR is 

From reading the text and from different servers, it seems the main problem people have is he went from being able do fill a niche of dual carry with topaz to needing a hypercarry set up to hit the 6 debuff cap and also needing a buffer as he doesnt self buff as much anymore.

Which means: 
Rather than having a different niche team, he now competes with IL for hypercarry set up

But I think it'll be fine
.
memories s5 vs ruan mei new lc

56% be vs 60% be
8 energy per attack (basic) vs 10 energy per wave (only 20 energy in moc, but will be a boatload in new gamemode)
zilch vs 24% dmg on ult + 1 skill point if >=150 be

4% worse be, potentially better energy income, but no extra dmg and no skill point refund
3t ult rotation or 4t ult rotation but gives %damage and SP refund 
her ult is strong enough that extr might not matter...

kinda dont wanna skip though ugh
hmm
Not my words but people are really excited now
Also, her dmg increments are buffs so they don't care if debuffed enemies die and wave change (e.g. pela)

She's also going to improve mob clearing as her talent deals respectable damage and mobs have low toughness to begin with

Elites like arumaton you can even disable before it goes into rage mode and keep disabled for much longer
That idr either
It's stupid
SP positive with 100% skill uptime
Permanent 68% dmg
Permanent 15% spd
Permanent 50% break eff
Permanent 20% BE 
On Ult 30% pen
On Ult 20% def ignore (e1)
On Ult 24% dmg (lc)
On Ult 1 SP refund no cd (lc)
Team +10 sp per wave (lc)
And now non negligible dmg on breaking enemies
Unless BE set comes out
Would just need 27% in subs
Talia + lc is already 153 I think
If rm is this overhauled
Which is fantastic news for hanabi
Guess they didn't want to disappoint first 5* limited harmony
Universal now too
Yeah it's cracked
No need for SPD boots if you combine them
E1 rm is stonks now lol
If you pulled e1 hh
Although
Same thing you said but some numbers

before:

lower base atk,
12% CR,
36% CD
36% ATK,
15% SPD
10% DMG teamwide
higher FUA MVs
needs 4 debuffs,
higher speed
small IMG DMG% buff in traces

Now:

higher base ATK,
12% CR + 15% CR
30% CD
50% DMG% for himself
lower FUA MVs
needs 6 debuffs
lower speed
no IMG DMG% buff in traces
Makes it easier to skip now but not happy
Yeah not happy
<:Deadge:1073469031513862214>
Guess I'm pulling both
Her LC got buffed too
But rm is so much better at e0 noe
Both chars did
Huohuo is for double dps/dot teams too, buffing blade+jingliu or topaz+jing/clara or kafka+whoever
Huohuo would prob be an upgrade but I wouldn't pull strictly for jl
For rm specifically: She could be better than asta there but it's not really what she's designed for so I wouldn't pull her specifically for that, because another char like bronya or a future char can fit that role better
125 if paired with rm only
115/116 if paired with asta only
The 116 is to account for the buff downtime, cause her ult buff is 2 turns, and asta ults every 3 turns
Sshe gives 50 SPD at +10 ult
Tldr Jing spd

129 speed = 2 turns every other Lightning Lord proc (LL turn 2, turn 4, etc. Might be the go to for most people if building speed)

134 speed = 2 turns before MoC round and 2 turns every other Lightning Lord (Need more speed substats and only matters in MoC)

140-141 speed = always 2 turns before Lightning Lord. (For those madlads out there who want to min max)

Note: at 99 speed Lightning Lord moves after MoC turn 1, so 100 speed on JY is a must when building atk% boots.

With asta, only need 116 SPD to hit 140
Otherwise you'll get like 7-10 stacks, which still is pretty good
So if you at 125 ish it's fine
It's allies
Yeah I recalculated
Which I'm assuming is her base spd
And I believe she's 16% boost to SPD on skill
Cause full stacks ll needs ~140 to lap twice
Assuming your Jing is at like 116 spd
Well
I believe so, yes

Jotaro does that
That's literally the second pose no
He also posted this:


**__Ratio__**
-    Strongest single target DPS character
-    Ratio E = Seele E << Ratio’s follow-up attack << Seele ult < Ratio’s Folly of Sages 
-    You basically guarantee follow-up attacks almost at every turn and when enemies have avg. of 4 debuffs. Ratio can only apply one debuff so he is very good with SW. It’s recommended to get at least one nihility character in the team
-    Ult takes 4 turns. When E3, it reduces to 3 turns
-    Cons: follow-up attack targets randomly so you gotta be careful when dealing with multiple enemies. If he’s dealing only with 1 or 2 enemies, this is no problem. Also, when ratio’s ult is activated, it’s best not for other allies to attack other enemies and instead focus on boss so that ratio’s follow-up attack can target the boss only. Also, you need to build his effect hit rate to apply debuff. 
-    His E6 is insane. His dmg is double of Seele’s (excluding resurgence)   

**__RM__**
-    Overall, not that great
-    Standard buffs: 16% spd increase, 50% Break effect increase, 45% dmg increase, 6%  RES PEN
-    Conditional buffs: 20% RES PEN by ult for 2 turns, enemies with weakness break receive 24% more dmg
-    Standards buffs are not that great. Spd increase is useful for Glamoth but 16% is not enough to substitute spd boots, 50% break effect is advantage to ice team than the teams with other elements. 
-    Seamrend break effect dmg is around 20k at E0. 
-    For JL, it’s better to use E4 pela with sweat than RM
-    Overall, testers are not satisfied with her kit. They expect her to get buffs in later versions.

New relic set and planar set
Yeah
Should be yes for both
Yeah it's like 8% better than 4p lightning for him
I think is fine in current state
Will be WHAT
She's still good as is
It's fine
~~old news~~
Makes sense ig, 2.1 should be around april
1.6>2.0>2.1 (Anni)
Apparently 2.1 is hsr anni
why is reddit like this
Gutted
And it's e0s1 with 4 PC follow up looking at the vid
The only one you should watch is topaz hypercarry
This and the argenti one
This is a bad gameplay vid btw
LOL
I scrapped most of my fodder <:kekhands:699566615854841876>
I gotta farm huohuo too ugh
So eh
That need that domain
But I have *FIVE* chara
Is what I'll use
So fua+ fire
Dmg% better always
Yeah
Oh
With the stacks
Did you see my post earlier
For who
?
18% fua better than 10% attack so I take it
Saw you guys chatting about it
Also yeah that's correct this follow up set 4 PC is jing only I think
Brih
Owo hug <@309634550273933314>
50% ult DMG

Yeah jing's def better
50
This fucking bot
Owomath .36*140
140
QQ isn't 180 energy
Wait
Use elation + hunt/Des maybe
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Isn't it free with elation?
King Yuan's is straight up better
Jing covers it all lol
Averagenti is same cd, 

so 65% DMG on ult

Or

18% ult + 48% fua dmg
Jing's effect:
Increases the wearer's CRIT DMG by 36%. Increases the wearer's Skill and Ultimate DMG by 18%. After the wearer uses their Skill or Ultimate, they gain Somnus Corpus. Upon triggering a follow-up attack, Somnus Corpus will be consumed and the follow-up attack DMG increases by 48%.
Great for jing still, and I'll prob run 2 fua 2 fire on topaz
But I'm excited for this set still
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
But that locks him to using asta
I used to run speed but I found atk was better DMG for me personally
This is really cute
Yeah fuck it I'm running spd boots on him
Okay so permanent 42% attack on jing yuan
Averagenti
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640><:Cope:888647792434765864>
its fine waiting for v3
4pc not restricted to follow ups specfically, so ult and skill is still fine for jy
but like idk, feels more restrictive now

EDIT: I think this is better for jing yuan
His whole kit is buffed now, and free 42% attack means he can use spd boots, since that is a *lot* 

Topaz idk, seems weird, but I'm still farming anyway for her
*removed upon next follow up attack*
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
old effect
4-pc When the wearer deals dmg to an enemy with a follow-up atk, DMG for this follow-up attack increases by 8%, this effect can stack up to 8 times
argentina players
thats insane
and old e2 to talent
the e1 idc about, the e2 you get *two* res
this is cracked though
they realized it was too broken
<a:AINTNOWAY:1072381924343037972>
She prob ult once every 3 turns with er rope and lc and trace
Yeah <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:hsr_huo_happy:1158595446055391242>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
One day
I had *thought* about whaling for E4 topaz, but I want e2 huohuo so sticking to e1s1 topaz
I'll see what's left after topaz
Perfect timing, multiplication etc
Any lc works ig
Healers are like the easiest chars to build
And planars standard keel or ageless, but keel is generally better
Her healing scales off hp so probably 2 pc hp set + 2 pc healing or spd, I'd personally pick spd so you only have to grind one domain
The more I read and try to understand the kit the more I like the char
It's stupid yeah
Huohuo + ty + carry + whoever would be quite a solid team
Esp if you pulled topaz, jing yuan, dhil or any high energy ult carry
She's gonna be really good
And not that you are, but if you were. A whale, her e2 is permanent cleanse on team
Spd and eff res in kit, so easy to build
And increased err for huohuo if a teammate is 130+ energy
Debuff on skill, gives energy and attack on ult
She's insane value
New set
:midgenti:
<:ChiwaSleep:842385574534184981>
Hmm
23%
Up to 10% cr + 5 base + 8 salsatto
Okay yeah I'm pulling sucrose
For another 15% ult dmg
Is salsatto the wave I assume then
I'd take the crit ngl
He doesnt
Does he have crit in traces
or 32% dmg overall
36% cd + 65% dmg on ult
Owomath .36*180
Owomath .20*160
+ 36% cd
When the wearer unleashes their ult, increases ult DMG based on max energy, .36% per point of energy, up to 180 energy
But giving dps char signature is best
I've paid like 0 attention sorry
I don't even own 1 wym
Kafkok's reign of domination
It's going to be a *long* patch
If it is they changed her kit
<:worryWadeva:454364877423902724>
Omg no more eyeballs and fingernail leaks
Bro
Maybe
These look annoying brih
Isn't that impossible
Wait how do you cause 6
*SEVEN*
They better not touch follow up set
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
Huohuo was the right choice
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
if you get another copy
they will
damn
his field procs this easily right
actuyally yeah now that i think about it
the er alone will feel really cozy
right
old one i think was based on wearer hp
i havent kept up idk
this heals less though, doesnt it?
for luocha ironically <:ohno:959752132905566261>
atk boost for user isnt bad but not needed i feel like
err 12% is pretty solid
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i really hate this clout culture
both of you living that maple life
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
jeez
that explainss it
wait thats def boots right
what the *fuck*
lemme see
i will soon <:prayge:863861301310652416>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
imagine
she is singlehandedly carrying my jy team ngl
has come so clutch
esp with that lc
same
yeah thats sss
ans sss /  2 musket / lot of atk subs to maintain that atk
i really wish i knew, thats *insane*
real
it isnt mine tho
you wanna see a crazy one
^
i like speed more
i went healing %
that explains it then
are you using atk chest?
damn nice gepard
im barely 3.2
4k atk on luocha wtf
6 in 1.5
thats why im fixing everyone <:deadge:975652771082698782>
how close are you to pity?
yeah you can vuild whoever you want now tbh
lol
but im not that deep into it
i think efficiency wise, its best for relic fodder
real and true
feels like wasted stam, but doesnt matter
thats fair, i just do the other dailies tho tbh
still worth tho
dont pre farm a unit you dont know if you want
enough to guarentee but lc dreams deadge
i have 75 atm, and 74 pity rn
its just barely enough assuming no lost 50/50
fair
eli irl
<:Cope:888647792434765864>
saving for e6 firefly
so im finally free
sustains is good, buffer/debuffer is good in bronya/hanabi/sw
5 gacha dps, 2 gacha abundance, standard preservation char
my acc doesnt need anything else
im done pulling for a long time
then i think after hanabi
she opens up some options
true true
infinite energy
im gonna use her with tingyun/jing yuan
this was the biggest thing for me too
i think she's stronger than luocha rn
thats too op
yeah i think i e1s1 topaz and try for that e2
what the fuck
its perma cleanse
e2
huohuo seems cracked
im deciding against hanya
<@416445660443967491> im taking it back
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
We're going back to pre 5.0
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Can she support herself in bed
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
Susannah dlc?
What is this split
What
So prob 4
One per stig isn't hard
No shot I'm trying that
s0 4/4 looks as an improvement over SSS ht 

But like that team lightning dmg +30% from s2 is gonna hurt missing
@
I'm not a seele fan but I might buy that outfit
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
She was skipped
This is good
I like this
<:whoasked:671554162324144158> <:02WhoAsked:860012007003652127> <a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
<:joewhoasked:767149691963047956>
Not that I know of
How will they build clout
But Nini
I was thinking about pulling on sw for eidolons to avoid him but that's be stupid <:deadge:975652771082698782>
REAL AND TRUE
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
I can't afford both
Rumored to be same patch
I want hanabi more
Kit looks fun
Shame the swan is getting skipped
Nice, extra levels
hanya stuff
She's too good
I am
i cant
okay im pulling ~~argenti~~ hanya
okay i like her ult
Delulu
<a:braindamage:1120357539511537795>
For ruan Mei?
So like no time <:deadge:975652771082698782>
She's rumored the patch right after yeah?
Just pull huohuo if you're short <:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
Like 7 or 8 in enhanced state
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
<:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>
Apparently topaz mains sub is arguing this same thing lol
Clara etc yeah that's 1 instance
There's no topaz footage ATM but numby hits like 8 times
Is what I'm saying
Enhanced numby is like 8 hits
For topaz
Are you *certain* that it is one hit
Uses skill
Ngl
It's pretty solid though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Fucking rip
Not eff res
It's max hp
Mistranslation
Oh my bad
It's basically perfect timing
Seems to be
12% effect res and 28% outgoing healing on skill use
Oh the event lc pretty cool
I'd be surprised if it wasn't
And 10% atk
Even then, 8% follow up should be better than 10% fire
Numby maybe
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
Good enough
Actually just those two
Well
So basically just jy/ topaz
I hate it here
And every messenger chest piece is crit with crit subs
For blade
I *STILL* haven't gotten a cd chest
Or traces idk
Ig I'm back to the ape domain
I was grinding stuff for sampo guinaifen and kafka

And this set kinda halted that
Wait I'm kinda fucked
Because if so I'll stop farming
Or any nihility 4*
Is that def shred for set for kafka
Ngl
I saw tet say Bing chilling and instantly stopped reading
Every follow up atk does 8% more dmg stacking 8 times
Like people pulled for ting on jing banner
Maybe by making hanya cracked it baits people into pulling argenti
Oh you know what
<a:bcaPatientlyWaiting:764167633234559016>
There's no way she's not getting adjusted right
Not in the beginning <a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
DX
Of rerun banners not running alongside new chara
I really wish they adopted the genshin model
I'd actually pull pls dont
I still haven't gotten fu xuan so maybe(?)
Can I find the strength to skip
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
But I don't want Argentina
God I want hanya
yes
equality
also you didnt post huohuo eidolons
but no ping
jay posted here
only names
i dont think its out
so planars too
there's supposed to be a new world
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
which means idc
then just a dhil set
0 clue
energy regen set effectively eliminates vonwacq?
i might pick up for qq too cause quantum aint treating me right
that first one seems op for dhil
SOLD
No details yet outside of potential effects
No
wonder what they do
hmm
new planars in 1.5
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
So nice
And not have to pick teams again
Which is huge
You can RESTART moc from In game
Also apparently in 1.5
So we'll see
He's hopefully getting a bigger part this upcoming patch
LOL
Since there's like 6
The other ships maybe
Yeah!
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
It felt like luofu was a setup arc
~~there wasn't much to pay attention to~~
Belobog chars were fleshed out really well imo

Stellaron hunters have had *some*

But imo, outside of jing yuan, no luofu char was really developed
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
Hsr in 1.4 already has more new chars than genshin did in 1.6

And rerun banners running alongside new char ones
At least in genshin you had save patches
I hate that they're pumping all these chars out so fast
<:life:1001518241610485781>
Pushing rope
None of these are hard
But at least
<:Harold_lum:657441749404221447>
I have to build my yanqing
Wait what the fuck
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Ok
The new one
Nono
Or no
Can you do the jingliu one in her quest
Ugh
Net loss of 2 for me then
<:deadge:975652771082698782> <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I'm already missing 9
But I'm doomed
<a:SAYUsleep:970435428001915051>
Something something zhongli Erosion
Brb killing myself
<@309634550273933314>
could it be the one he'd wear on his birthday?
i want her
Reposted jay so people don't get spoiled
Story spoiler for hsr 1.4
Damn we get to fight nini
Hsr chars

Old but other one got nuked
That seems right then
Ohh gotcha
Oh we did 6.7
Or am I misremembering
For hare?
We haven't had a jizo yet
But should be fairly accurate
May be *slightly* outdated
Should be there if she was top score
I pinned a schedule there
<#1069296932863877230>
<:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>
~~this is why you save the ult~~
I'm just backreading it all
<:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468> <:Copium:834822065231364156>
Why lol
None
I remember there being talks of like
How much
Her kits Been out for forever
Possibly, just not seeing a mention of it in the kit
No crit
Numby does dmg equal to x amount of topaz att
I only see that on the talent
Yeah
I'm assuming it works the same way the Lord does for jing
Lemme look
But I think that's all our, no?
Also doubt it
I doubt it
<:clueless:1036646575503581214>
<:TE_Clueless:915648441974132756>
<:ZT_PEPElaugh:1000016370957815848>
isnt this the summon
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
the what
it is yeah
busted
since her banner i've used like like 4 times total
she does but like
pull her
jingliu has some aoe, no?
ngl i feel like sw was a waste atm <:deadge:975652771082698782>
maybe change with hanabi <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:lewdTenshi:722117712666427442>
like luocha sw have been fine, and fx will be fine without sig
supports its been true
if said char is dps
i feel like im paying for 3/4 of a character if i dont get lc
while that is usually true for f2p players
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
we got enough 1.0 to pull both
i have s1 in the night
yeah
and she cant do that well on top of multiple spawning enemies
she's designed to one shot
but if you cant kill its annpying yeah
but i auto'd up to moc 10 with her since i fixed her
okay 3 days ago i would've agreed with you <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
what content ig
well
seele is fine what
What
Wait ely pulled luo
I am
Same
I don't think ruan Mei has one
Kits or
Ruan Mei is gonna be good, and hanabi seems op
More time to save
Good
You did good
If you need stuff translated if tai isn't here
Bump
idk about the er rope but some floated it around, i personally dont see it
she gets a lot of cr in traces and ssig lc gives cr too, so prob cd body
but prob musketeer/fire relics and def salsatto planar
coping for follow up set in 1.6
I think the play for her atm is 2pc Fire 2pc SPD/ATK 2pc Follow-up

Crit/cdmg body atk>spd boots fire sphere atk/er rope
rn im guessing spd
Either should, yeah
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
So answer is wait until live
TC said this too

If you have her signature and E1, I would say she is one of the best supports of Jing Yuan. Otherwise, she is a good option but as I said above Lightning Lord does not really help Numby because it is slow.
I haven't looked into the char that much but she seems flexible enough to slot anywhere
if you want cunnysuer just play mono qua

Lynx qq fx and sw
Clara topaz lynx +1
You're pulling fx so that should be fine for you
People are saying either hypercarry, or lynx/clara
Lemme browse around the sub to see other options
I really really don't like the design
But idk
But she gives energy, which would let you free ty
Nope
From the notaleaks vid dual dps seemed fine
Huohuo
The best support for him is the one I'm not pulling
She'll still work with him but his dmg backloaded
Wait for new follow up char/ play with Clara / topaz hypercary
But it's not gonna be that great imo
Fundamentally yes
wild
HSR Kit stuff 

<:borryLeek:457952086571745281>
<@309634550273933314> you hear this
there's snippets but i didnt share
pikawh<:omegalul:978056448569380925>
1.4 contents

New short trailblazer mission in Jarilo

New event: Aether battle. You basically collect badges from fighting enemies. Just like pokemon. You can also obtain a ticket for 4 star characters (Luka, Serval, Pela, Hook)

2 new field maps

New enemies and boss for topaz materials

Others: hologram update tool (they said they dont know what this is about. They are guessing something related to lightcone?) enemies are added to archives, auto-battle logistics optimizations

Rewatching story is possible from 1.4

Memory of chaos difficulties increased.
Before: Win with at least 6 rounds left 
After: Win with at least 8 rounds left

There's not much update in 1.4. They even put this as an achievement
[3:12 PM]
You're right they're just roommates my bad
Bronya's meal, yes
<:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>
E1 yq <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Is less ass than volume mean bad
Would you really skip ass
But ruby
He's pretty good dmg with his lc on basic and skill
Even with my mediocre build

>Yes, without the S5 lc
That just means ll shouldn't have had it
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
So like everyone else, cd chest
Stonks is what it is
I was gonna comment but I'll refrain
It's yq repellant dw
You have blade
Maybe I can pull on your acc
Surely streamer luck works
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
And like 72 for lc
I won e1 in 149
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Also yes
Rude
Nope! qq + welt enough <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
<@385655541248163840> also I mentioned this here lol
could mean nothing though
im guessing some combination of these are next after jing/topaz
like i would be horizontal atm since every banner character has somehow tripped and fallen into my acc
yee
actually wild
nokek
follow up attack crit damage?
time to invest horizontally again
they all want to die LOL
i think topaz/jy same team
actually
its good enough usually <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
i use this site if i ever need anything
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i cant afford to spook myself this time
could use march 7 to increase taunt i was thinking
and lc tet
though i dont like the idea of that
i guess though, topaz and himeko could work
shit
i have to lose a 50/50
<:LeahCross:784906176844398612>
no temptation
i dont even wanna read jingliu's stuff
link here instead <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
that kit i sent before was 3 months old ye
this?
we know next to nothing
yeah i really wish they tell us more about luocha next patch
e1 good enough
hmm
dont want a jumpscare
i dont backread here <a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
where's my clara
if im understanding right
march, clara, etc
this seems to apply to any follow up attack
bruh
so cr, follow up, and cd
this is what it used to be
shit
i havent even read lc yet
she has cr traces
yeah <:deadge:975652771082698782>
so stonks
man
im not sure
all stuff is up on honeyhunter btw 
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
~~watch the vid~~
thats her ult lol
<:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>
yeah 100
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
they did very well with these 3 chars
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
then streamable
https://
<:KanaSleep2:1101635869846294599>
Iirc
Ferryman was him consciousness mapping too much
Nope, captain and ferryman are technically different
I think they reran that twice yeah
LOL
Bio teriri
Topaz eating good
No, but the kit is very similar
Could be 0 could be 6
Though it's rng how much you need
Enhanced basics can hit multiple enemies
She uses skill points to enhance basic
He's just img qq
surely i can last 3 banners
no pulling until topaz
that cone has avoided me <a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
my landau s1 wym
esp if s5 <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
the dmg reduction nice though
if she gets perma focus she might trigger the self heal too often and end up running out
It shouldn't be the case that she goes through both self heals so fast and have no ult to get another charge though
she doesnt want to be the one getting hit
its the only other decent option, but ideally no
cause it gives er
with sig, yeah
without sig, er rope
with sig, no er rope
no
and herta shop lc works well with her
snow or speed, either work
you guys talked about this when the cone was leaked
would increase aggro on fu <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
wait you're getting both?
ye
more to show her solo support capabilities
max hp overall yeah\
they dont really need to
<@416445660443967491> 
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
Hoping is the same here
Genshin started rerun 1.4 right
Plenty of room on the topaz train
Yes yes come
Her damage scales with HP and 7k+ HP is easy, 8k+ HP doable and 9k+ hard and needs good gear.

Most normal characters scale with attack and getting over 3k attack (on a crit build) is seriously hard. That means a normal character's attack starts at 3k base damage but Fu Xuan's starts at e.g. 4k+. Her ult also originally had 130% HP scaling for e.g. 11200 base damage. Blade is the exception here, but he also has to deal his damage (without a skill).

There's also the fact that her traces grant a lot of crit rate so it's easy to try to use them.

In total it's an okay build. E.g. 70% crit rate, 140% crit damage and 8k HP should be doable with good gear. On average (crits and non crits) this results in 8k auto attacks and 16k ults. It's by no means comparable to actual (sub) DPS characters, but more than any other tank so far. In theory, with a quantum orb and godlike gear (or e6 :D) to keep the HP you should get close to 30k ult crits. On a tank.

But it costs a lot of defenses and I think having a rock steady Fu Xuan that still buffs her team is better than going for this bit of bonus damage.  



Dps fu xuan stuff I found eli
Effect res too
yeah hp subs work

Cause it has er
Nvrmind then
*if* you pull lc

<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
unsure if legit or shared a;ready hsr stuff
If you wanted to 3 turn ult still it's sp negative <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Or skill auto auto because I think you still get the 20 energy from traces

For both sequences (eaae), because the second skill didn't get energy, which is why I think it was cut from 40 to 20
Skill auto auto skill
But no resources<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I kinda wanna pull now ngl
Yep <a:thumbsup_hh:743612467384680551>
I think it's fine from what I'm seeing mathed out overall

40 energy that's never going to be gained is worse than 20 energy that will almost always be gained
Though idk if these people are factoring in the refund
From what I'm seeing people calc anyway
With just the rope, eaae+ 2 hits is 137
EAAE + er rope + s1 lc + 1 hit seems to be 137
I think the 20 enabled rotations better than the 40 but didn't look too deeply into the math
Er rope should be able to get you that, with the 5 energy ult refund
Or 136
You only need 135
40 energy would be insane if they left it lol
For overall improvement to her kit?
Eidolons got nerfed but that applies to nobody here
Tldr this is an overall buff for e0

Hot model was leaked months before release, mihoyo and others called it fake, made everyone takes down things related to its and it was actually real lol
I think people are assuming it's the hot situation all over again
Tbf
but damn
cause like
ult + eb2 + eb2 + eb1 would effectively only cost 1 skill point if you had the energy regen to maintain
you'd need so much energy
wait
if im understanding his rs right
i cant see you doing that no
okay cast
NA : 2 hit

NA+1 : 3 hit

NA+2 : 3 hit + 2 hit (+1 adjacent hit) = 5 hit

NA+3 : 3 hit + 2 hit (+1 adjacent hit) + 2 hit (+1 adjacent hit) = 7 hit

Am I right?
every hit was 1 stack?
honestly i havent checked out his kit much, but iirc his talent worked like swordplay lc right?
or wdym

Suddenly Xiaohu is sent back in time, overlooking LPL. Beside him is Uzi. So, how was the Unkillable Demon King?, asks Uzi. Beautiful, says Xiaohu. And strong, stronger than me, even... but I feel a bit somber. Uzi looks at Xiaohu. You? Sad for someone else? I'm surprised. Xiaohu simple smiles (and ignore all the LPL teams Faker killed). Yeah, he wasn't even able to go all out. I doubt even if his hand was still injured, that I'd be able to defeat him. Suddenly, it turns to the modern day. Xiaohu looks over the Nexus, as Faker approaches it. Satisfied?, he asks. Yeah, I hope this isn't a dream. We then see Xiaohu get one shotted, with Faker towering over the base.

S2 luna S2 HTR

Pretty sure this is 9s but you get the idea
<:Deadge:1073469031513862214>
The lightning affix really helps here too, always 10% extra dmg
And clears final stand instantly
But she just deleted p1
I couldn't believe it
You whale
<:mobiusworm1:1063791835882987572><:mobiusworm2:1063791832942776341>
HS lead,  it's more dmg during your ult duration but less damage on actives
Just depends on damage ig
Not even
<:OMEGALUL:827381886787518464>

<:worrynodamage:959797434282836028>
I'm fine missing 10 attack a piece nowadays, it's so much mats to refine a piece past 40-42
Those affix rerollers
Yeah mirage
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
Take 36 and be happy
This is why I bounty affix now

Can you work my job instead
<:worryVampire:786608702266277898>
every boss is a hare boss if you try hard enough
ohhh
meant this specifically
no i mean 7.1
thats whats coming for us
but actually yeah
oh wt
isnt she one of the expas
<:HareHappy:1157567752760983582>
they put one 7.3 to kickoff part 2
or, or
you're prob right though with one coming 7.2
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
iirc
moving forward in part 2, all servers have same anni date
glb no longer gets shafted
thats actually why iim glad at the anni change
6.4 was yeah
the mini dawei
ohh yeah you're right
i honestly dont remember
6.1 was the spending yep

was 6.0 a spending?
would make no sense running 2 spending events back to back
if thats what you mean
we get a top up event
i think
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
would be shocked if we didnt
we should, yep
Why not just hof wd
Wait, for you
Idk if newt can do it
Cause hot uses cez
You have a dupe cez right
I just did ht
It's fooking hard though
Yeah s0 Luna can 840 apparently
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
owomath 47824 +39760+31840
i wish i could have a fraction of the faith he has in luna in other things
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
i also dont know how counterside managed to make a WORSE gearing system
too expensive to maintain
e7 full of drama now
im not surprised lol
and play later if the bracket demands it'
yeah i think i just take the first run that kills
this transition is so weird
this
i use the mei build that makes her attack like 20 times
for me they're kinda fun
has the fastest tasks but lowest chance
wish sakura was higher
.
You've done great so far tho
And for what it's worth I think you'll do well
Hopefully everything works out for you
<a:hugs:1000015668504174592>
Are you one of those white noise sleepers
Ohhh I know that feeling
What boy has you up
What the

<a:AINTNOWAY:1072381924343037972> <a:AINTNOWAY:1072381924343037972>
Yeah I saw lol
<:02shrug:809888510143496264>
Just barely enough for a card
14+14+10
dont you have a vein to code or something
<a:modcheck:926226465782132736>
Insane
:mfw:
so it should be next
apparently it was fixed and cycle reopned
a lot of refs were bug though
any of those 3 should work
飞鱼
游弋集群
泥鳅 (this one is for couatl but some of them use it)
is why it does that
it has to hit something
o alice mentioned
it gives 20 sp
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
depends what time
i usually always got laser unless i was in its face
it feels like its based on how close you are to it for me
🪞
let him cook
shhh
LOL
brick is what abyss flower would be if we could 100% crit back then
which is why literally everyone is doing some variant of the same run
there's not really much you can do
okay fair
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
for ~780 anyway
well
its fine
<:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>
im just here to laugh and ban if jhe gets toxic
he does it to himself
i dont
ikr shocking
@ lumi guess the player
It was so tilting this cycle lol so happy it's getting fixed
Yeah
in 7.1
hrb qol
ruby
ic
i thought his whole career in maincord was beef
thats what pro sports people do watching tape
i can get impatient, like you can follow the sequence of whats gonna happen
but i agree with this
because those people (kithi) are really annoying
i feel like its less of watching a ref and more of im too good for a ref attitude that ruby means
@ kithi
idgi
<:borryWeird:668046528878870538>
i was around but not, i saw you guys talking about it
ohhhhh this
9091
dumb bot
owomath 600000 / 6600
not bonus
it only counts raw
its not 8088
god damn dude
idk about current cycle
721
yeah homu he was like
wasnt around probably
i dont think i did
if you're into 165 cm white haired women
90% useless
top physical dps in the game right now
lol
yeah okay im out
i got slivered at 797
<:madge:826898161334222859>
pb again is 4-5 points
not even close
this is shino's
but no way
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
its very slightly more damage
i matched first try
im gonna try hs lead
961 first ta ult > 894 second ta ult > 8 whatever third ta ult just after stun wears off
its too rigid
i dont see a way
i wonder if its possible without pb to get 800 lol
kinda tilted i got 795 with qte on and i cant replicate it
where is this on the damn combos
lol
this is nice though
i just do not have the damage lol
a 2 point gain at most
only like
this changes my entire run
bruh
i wasnt aware we turn qte off here
qte is off
no fucking wonder
okay i got it
it happens every time in p2
~~p1~~ transition it doesnt because you active before seele is off cd
its killing like 5 points for me cause she does the combo then i have to evade > basic
at 1:25 why doesnt his
its supposed to jump, but seele's qte trigger is an enemy airborne
the fish jumps every time for me
on the final rot
i have 0 clue how this guy didnt get seele's qte proccing
did you copy shino
ruby
its too rigid
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
and i still do no damage when stunned
im like why do i do no damage
it took me like 15 minutes to figure out i wasnt stunning the damn thing
my ass is getting cooked in abyss rn
or later today doesnt really matter
i dont but i can buy tommrow if y'all are aroound

Microsoft passing on buying said it all to me
Remember when everyone blamed Activision
I saw yesterday browsing the destiny sub then
O
Cata sent this yesterday no?
Luna I think is T2

You're getting props
<@416445660443967491>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I think just Kiana then, if you're still gonna be 2* ely by the time the next spending comes
But I feel like ice is due for a replacement soon
Vs Ely where 3* is closer to it fixes a lot of the 2* issues
It gets you closer to 4* Kiana, which is just 8% tdm
Ohh okay
And she's universal across 2 teams
3* Kiaelf will be huge for you
I'm not in town still but I'll see what I find
He's 9s
It's gcrow
Raks is 100% a better player than him too lol
Yikes
A2
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
It's the same disadvantage lol
Just with added Tf bs
SSS ma is literally abyss
Will make myriad
Yeah no shot anything less than 760
2 clocks in 1 patch pls no
I thought I saw
Brick did pretty good
Mobius is wolf
Oh right right
Wait, 1?
The valk I actually care for <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Though I'm glad hos is keeping all hers
What caused you to gain 35 points lol
<:Cope:888647792434765864> surely ranks is a good future investment
Dalao
I'm thinking Eden DMG is the problem
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Or affiz
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
To level
But I don't think I have mats
For esen
The hot ones are garbo
I have a second Handel set
You know
Yeah
Yeah
<:naruhodo:672405817164824605>
That's s0 HTR for you
Why would you level the middle stig ever lol
?
You're also running Handel Eden right
Try something like this <@416445660443967491>
Wouldn't matter <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
I'm not even around this weekend lol
He's mad brick took what he thought should've been hare bosses
Not sure offhand but like 18k (?) feels right

Haven't kept track
Ah ic
You're counting cards too as crystal value or just raw crystal
Answer is pe or elf tbh
30% lightning damage to team
~~truth be told I shouldn't have s2~~
Tyty

<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
<@180679257851166721> 190 pulls for s0 4/4 luna 4/4 brick
263 pulls for s2, and i got a 5th lightning line
Riku when playing phys
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
effectively everyone now has max dorm
Right
The damage isn't changed
It didnt
No
It's not bad tbh
For all the content you get, after spending hours hours and hours on youtube
Rip
Ah I guess that's if you're grandfathered in
Ublock still works I think
~~with SSS htr~~
I forgot she existed
Okay ruby wins
So I don't understand the statement
The nature of a competitive gacha though, literally every char becomes irrelevant after 6 months to  a year plus
Ice clock yeah
True kira revived that
Or even sw
Or carole
When's the last time you used hof
Me neither
Bye lol
In a competitive gacha?
1 single char that has been irrelevant?
Brother

I want my perfect season <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I'm gonna have to snipe
Smart
Idr offhand

I just know SSS was the big one
<:smug_wuzetian:885755258935078912>
Asking cause I'm basically thinking, you either 670, or score falls off a cliff
Which I don't think is possible to advance anywhere
Shino got that but he's s2 hfi, using this

Wait no, that's not possible
686?
Btw Ruby what does s0 s2 SS HTR get here
But yeah summon is like

Judah
Aka stand
Hs clone

Etc
Who's cooking in maincord lol
I think I'm being baited
I doubt tet is, but Does Kiana summon a bullet every time she shoots her gun
Why would it...
Yeah I didn't expect it to beat 5-6S
Unless someone figures out s0 HFI s0-s2 hoo s2-ss htr
I think anything below s2 hfi is dead
It's same D
Kira boosted her so much
On ke🅱️in
<@197871478950068224> ss1 hoh got 630
hrb
fragile said its +50% damage if you pull it off but temps are too high now imo
none of these runs except that last one makes use of lightning repel at all






except this guy, but non s0 hfi

even at 499
it doesnt explain it according to aka
pri is only lvl 50
not an excuse but
he has ss griseo i think
not like susannah is f2p valk of the year or anything
i saw that yeah lol
with 537
that last guy survived on vq
okay who apparently this is yumi
tab back
<:KianaSweat:550951037586898944>
if 793 cutoff
yeah that seems sound
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
what is sea
this is t56 rn in na
Just dumb
Yep yep
i think is nice too
i could see that
doesnt mesh that well though ?
the reds maybe
the arrogance behind that statement tho
its *crazy*
dude
devil_hunter1560
<@&1148979669950021692> not aqua, new chef?
what an arrogant piece of shit LOL
yeah no fucking way
get his ass carv
new chef?
of course its eu
thats gotta be ancient then i think
is that honkai world diva kiana
What the fuck
<:Harold_lum:657441749404221447>
F17 seems to be blob
<a:wdance:938285446155366440>
sss is the big advantage
why stop at ss2 i wonder
wild
he got the same score with hrb apparently
hs
he has no dupes
fragile's clone
eu is a competitive server
no
thats his own acc
there is none
but it looks cool
i have 0 clue what im watching
Yeah Drac you just ult
Not Drac
Ohh right you're using ppm
Who's using chains in transition
When you what
or you were too far away?
that looks like the elf might've poped it early
^
timing is weird
i hold directional ye
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
crimson love or whatever the stream was
wait shit i forgot about the stream code
cause too much competition
i think regardless of server i'd try my best lol
if i was on another server i prob wouldn't be as big of a whale tho <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
wym
?
and hes played a few abyss uncapped
bke he uncapped iirc
do what styx does
so like
but i mean even styx uncapped
half joking, they care about it
expect <:fpsscumhic:959744049546416148>  every once in a while
is all good
so long as iriya or nef doesnt catch you
ruby does it
other than that idrc
but thats like 500+ lol
and some boss behavior
high fps messes with dabber sp
should be
💀
and i refuse lol
i have like 1.1k left
if you guys are talking about the 5k
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
surely you can get higher
dabber 3 scored 801
but i like the way genshin/hsr do it
on landing page hit self search
phone > support
this lumi
yeh
lemme login
idr how to get to that menu either
technically there was one, but it was hidden
72 or smth yeah
for which
i did swipe for sss hos
i just used leftover crystal
i didnt swipe for my dupes
<:kekhands:699566615854841876>
<:kekhands:699566615854841876>
so i imagine also a lot of money
i just know 1500 USD for aladdin dupe
but nah idk them enough to know htheir cn account
eu kinda free
na is still competitve
this answers your question <:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
tet knows her voices damn
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
idk nikke chars <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
yes
they nailed it with the va
im liking ~~furina~~ fontaine a lot
ngl
this irl
i think thats the cn whale that changed name
lumina player
okay true
iirc
and cata invited me here
we started talking more after
i think so?
it led me to this server lol
prob not
what a happy accident
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
or 5th place in a keilo bracket
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
i have 3 bio kits
wait no i dont
i need for pericles
i have like not a lot either
<a:modcheck:926226465782132736>
never applies in practice
no lol
i thought luna was supposed to be it
<:peeka:1058877271420715118>
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
<:smug_wuzetian:885755258935078912>
I did
I laughed ~~cause you told me to~~
I did lol
Like bruh it takes *hours*
Idk why he's so insisting on *ten* runs
Yeah
Oh that reminds me
True
She's good but not God
He has a lot of misplaced faith in luna
I mean, no?
Dmg as support higher than DPS she supports?
They renamed it
<a:skillissuehic:1160098262204829726>
I'm guessing yes
Euphie got 836
Unironically true
No cap it's hard
<:Deadge:1073469031513862214>
🏓
Okay just read this
Man is coping
487D
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Are you in RL I guessing
Mei stigs hos
Man
Draco T shui mb right
Holmes Susannah though that's a tough one
I think is fine idt ruby cares about pings
LOL
<a:Nessie:1164016962595209306>
trying for it
also, this was elf ult after tambou first ult in p2
cause i couldnt get elf ult up in time to ult before
but i dont see a point
i can see an 814 here, and an 812 with hs
for 4* bd specifically
yeah i think s2 seele aladupes ~= sss hos aladupes
s2 seele
@ ruby
esp on bleed cycles
and hare cycles for some reason
10-20 points is tight
i feel like if you had either 

3-4* pb 
or
s2 seele

you were guarenteed t50 in my experience
t50 myriad
by that i mean, i was *really* close to not making kill thresholds
but i see it at t50 elf
s2 seele was a t50 rank at first, but disturbance has gotten so high it feels like its mandatory <:deadge:975652771082698782>
thats why people were saying it was qol elf at first, and it was cheaper to s2 seele than 3* punny
mhm
dabber ramps up (stacks) 16 seconds
pb instant cast 23 seconds
they're about the same for 10 seconds, then dabber falls off hard
pb doesnt and lasts another 13 seconds ish
mhm
and yeah
its always been 10-20 relatively speaking
<:AetherYikes:810278255336489020>
ch without 11th
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
with my 10 minutes of runs
i cant see past 807
100% it is
every run i've done has had delays or lags i havent had with hs
okay hrb is really laggy wtf
with aladupes
there's an 822 in sea i hear
or rather, about to
okay i tested this
It's fine I'm happy with ~810
2 rots in 1 vulnerability
No lol
So much dmg
Yeah SSS HRB is stupid
yeah\
its so annoying <a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
dude
i use mine asap personally, but havent played around with what feels better
ik what you mean lol
it sounds like you're taking too long somewhere
?
hs or hrb
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
okay rip
ohhhh
how much are you short by
mhm
full atk right
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but no pb ugh
im like 8 points lower than what i know is possible
im bleeding time p1
mhm
with hos
998-999
for enough sp to not need to farm
with drac you can use nebs 3x
nope
ppm if you dont need sp
i physically cannot go any faster without a better elf
maybe +3?
ok i think  im capped
this boss moves so mch
.
iirc
jww gives 20, be gives 75 per frag
doesnt need to be 4* to sell the frags tbh
nope
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
All the expas therw
Could just save for 7.1 if you wanted
Why are you pulling before a spending event
70, same as other awk
Yeah def staying hs
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
5-6 AM EST 10/26/2023 for east coast U.S.
after kevin abyss closes
<a:whalepat:899061677583122432>
Tell them you'll attend their funeral if they force you to come to class
165 pulls for 4/4
Still better than hrb
Istg
30-31k flat
By 7.0 I'll be at like
Gear is non-existent LOL
Since I'm at 68 pity rn
Luna needs 50 pulls
Depends how lucky you get on brick
Me?
Ss2 for me
I'm happy about hof stamps
Luna
I was gonna for hot since ss3 but
There's like. 4 or 5 left
I still haven't finished her er stamps
Dude
In 7.1
Well
You get closer next patch
So gonna play hs prob
I'm assuming >= s2 yeah
Akayuki double Aladdin got 827 on 487D
Holmes SSS got 804 on 504D
It looked easier than hs
Rip
The double Aladdin?
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
no more #SEAONLY or #GLBLUL
which is amazing
i believe so, yes
<:sleepywhale:1120460602947666033>
Ruby  is anything older
I played 2021 and beyond
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
Irrelevant doesn't matter <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I really can't find this discussion tho wtf
Looking back for hackers and found this gem
LMFAOO
In 6.0
I remember that
They'd happily fix your problem of not giving them money
Could contact cs if anything
Does it work with another card
Cause playing 3 hoyo games
She quit a while ago I think
<a:Nessie:1164016962595209306>
Real
<@309634550273933314> you better pull 4/4 in 30
It's doomed
I have 101 pulls
<:02shrug:809888510143496264>
Through Google play?
You get cash back right
Using jpn irrc
They just eat my money happily
I haven't had a card declined I can't help here <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
I don't think there's anything in TOS against it I mean
Also I've literally never seen anyone banned from it
You just go to the payment page on browser, turn on VPN, refresh browser, price change, buy
What the
Except for eli like once
Yee at the time

I gotta look again cause I have bought any big packs for a while
I tried on hsr like once
Ohh
Or hsr
For hi3
2.50 a month I think
Adguard is like
Adguard specifically but worth the money
Yee I use it too
Cause ublock and others died
Do you use adblock
<a:dalao:795864124907061369><a:dalao:795864124907061369><a:dalao:795864124907061369>
just use holmes hrb
alr posted
if you got lucky
or this
after like 3 patches maybe
neko this you
a ranks are lowkey more expensive than sp valks <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826> 

i never want another raven again
ye
only 5 patches apart
never backpull
i think just pray you offrate it
found it nvrmind
whats vq cap on kosma btw
if you somehow didnt have zhenyi you were fucked
cause ae fr couldnt work well on rpc
thats what happened with pv and specfically, rpc
i think htr will eventually be replaced, but not anytime soon
if you skipped vq and 7t somehow, she's huge for that account
i see after brick ig
i cant afford her
she was tuned to be >= SSS HoT with *attack* affixes

now this lightning affix stff boosted her another 5-10%

i think not pulling is throwing but like
.
loo at eden's gear
actually
i misread
oh bleed
gd htr it seems
time to learn the cannon dodges *again*
not the boss
that was brick
or do we just not get the boss
do you think that'll be fixed ruby
this was the luna does more dmg in transition one
rip
i already forgot
bleed huh
whats the weather
too many things out of the players control
i hope this boss never comes back
fuck
owomath 47904+39800+31946

who's the 20% this week
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
man i do not want to do aponia run
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
mhm
some notes there
.
it can be triggered farther now
they stealth changed fischl's qte
there's like no frames of leeway
yeah
needs high :57 clear on finisher
47920 is ridiculous
Anything higher ss HTR is mandatory
ss1 ht s0 htr sss pv should be 39920 i think
love you too boo ❤️
Darius is insane
He is but I got 763
In schisksal
Yes
Maybe Eli around
I'm at work sorry but can answer any question
  
Here's a rl vid
Gl finding an s HS vid, but ss shouldn't matter
This was the lesser evil
I guess between having everyone compete for 3 SS MA bosses 

Or this
We're gonna need SSSS MA
Bruh
nope
actually cay is in this server
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
and damn cherry gonna t100
prob really slack if he does
i havent heard this name in *ages*
mhm
<:worryok:696400820652081194>
oh neko what's my fourth slot for blade bronya lynx/luocha
the last was da in 4.4?
i have like 6 just rotting
if bio i can finally use my kits
cause i wanted s2 too but like idk if its worth rn
<:elycope:1118534055890272356>
and fire in 4 patches ish
feels like they're getting ready to kick her out of lightning
isnt it too late though
i'm gonna go brick and see whats left over for her
and i think i cant pick both
i really dont want to

but i really dont wanna whale either
jk
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im actually doomed
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
Nice!
to one and done
but dw i think is very comfy
they're both usable but hn will be faster and scores higher
?
why dw
o
you asked something?
?
so ready
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
but not *probable*
i think 763 is *possible*
i was robbed of 760
<@197871478950068224>
💢
Chaos plays every once in a while
The rest died
Smiley and rei I think
I don't wanna hear it
.
I'm not malding for 3 points <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
Okay gl lumi <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
I don't have damage to do the SSS hs rot
I wish I had pb lol
Yeah, just immediately evade
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
And missiles but I can't see anything
Maybe 1 or 2 hs bonk after ult in p1 to line up the cd better
To me it looks clean mechanically
Ruby is there anything you see on this outside of missiles


Dude it's so annoying lol
9 days
<@197871478950068224> maybe Ruby finds something but to me it looks clean

Maybe mald the missiles but that's it
He did have to buy the company new equipment tho
And he's been here like 8 years
Cause we can't replace him easy
No not fired
For like a week or two
someone actually got suspended at my job for doing that
I CAN HEAR THIS LOL
<:Prayge:824060134840991756>
If you recorded sure
Did discord die for anyone else
Test
Create a problem sell the solution
Cunny
I can't remember the last time I sniped
Like 753
Current boss or?
Wym
I don't think it'll matter much tbh
So I'm expecting Luna gameplay to be 0 mald
I really like that she has iron body
I was seeing mobi htr luna
Wow someone actually ran it
I'm gonna risk it
I'm star railing now
Pretty much
I think it's gonna start a new trend and that worries me
And I will
Come to america
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
That was fixed iirc
Until after everyone affixed attack lol
But no one uploaded
What are the odds that Luna affixes were found during cn beta
Oh ruby
Even bricked 3 bosses
I'm looking forward to brick so much
This was specific to after ult, which I don't believe we do here
Is my go to
That or 2 mediums
And a large fry
I got a 20 piece
Oh at McDonald's ordering sorry
Switching weapons, was gonna share of it wasn't known here
Do you guys know the workaround for that btw
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Oh right sirin has that problem too
I kept missing the first swing
I hate her melee
For me that was worse dmg
Nah
I use elf on last big rot
I ran into the same issue <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<a:classic:1124811119324831855>
Ice cream machine isn't working
Lol I'm at McDonald's
Cause pillar does the same but you lose DPS window
At SS it gives impair too iirc

Easier to do that  than to pillar
Coma


Lol wtf
up to A here, but glad you did way better than you thought!
2d shouldnt break most rots though
491 for na 493 for sea iirc
yeah she's great
<@416445660443967491> tericula event late doer
thats very fair
it feels like it is, but could be confirmation bias
isnt it the same reason gacha pulls are so popular?
Brick was a mistake <:KekDoggo:743295767262789752>
I wanna say stay just to get a feel for it but like

What are you gonna do for 4 hours <:deadge:975652771082698782>
With brick
It basically fixes the 40 sp that hos could gain
<@180679257851166721> 
Bug impact 3rd starting to be cleaned finally
👌
I'm saying I don't see why running wolf is weird
So if she doesn't top score she'll boost mobi a lot
Also you do know the s2 gives team 30% lightning dmg
That's lightning up wolf
Isn't Teri lightning
Rice and beans every day for 4 years

Ohh okay that's fair
Luocha should be enough to solo sustain, no?
You've died in su <a:modcheck:926226465782132736>
Yeah just seele can be boring
So seele or Clara ok
Do you have
What other dps option
Dorm too
I like su
If I was around I would
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
I did abyss and er so nah I should be good
Good job
I'm in stream yee
Idm
If you need to -6 go ahead
Rip
47920?
What's susan
Preferably without swiping
I need to figure out how I'm pulling tericula
Oh I mean for whatever I do
I can compete like everyone else did finally
So doesn't really matter
Fr is SSS 4/4 65 pri too
Or Judah or
With 4 klein
And just strem
Can try on mine
I have ss io now
I only recently unlocked her
I never used io
But with trio it's not bad
Maybe
Just evade third ring on htr
It's easy wym
Just need a clear
Yes
For s0 trio 47760 feels fine to me
Eh, bosses like wolf and bull are fine
It's kosma v2
Idk why they run this boss so much
To cap is kinda annoying
Ftfy
~~this start~~ playing wardens
I don't think anyone did
.
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>

Actually can you do dailies on both sr and hi3 too
I'm out of town again
Do you wanna 18k for me on the weekend of the 27th
Eli
Casc
That explains why the cn players do
Oic
Why did people call sasc Celine ascendent
Ruby
And s2 their support
Who the fuck ss2's hfi though
with ss2 hfi id be shocked if it was less
but yeah its clean
he could 803 maybe
Aka doesn't take complaining either
They don't take stupidity there
Well yeah lol
it shouldnt take 2-3 years to max dorm
would you rather be gated out of a strat that only boomers can do
this is great for new players
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
become the rot maker
try it
The way flat dmg on affixes works is similar to how Judah flat dmg works
Yes this
<:02shrug:809888510143496264> idk the math behind it

Just that double ele of the same type on the same stig is awful
No, can just roll or use the locks
2 of the same type
<a:AINTNOWAY:1072381924343037972>
Wild
And *three stigs* of them
Double ele
It's the rarest affix
Not surprised lol
He's the number one donator to hare OF
Man
The second one
That reminds me actually
For na
441
If I guessed maybe 44x
When I find I lyk na rl
But It is def not 480, that's almost our nirv temp

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
And both alus/spider are getting caught by hare basics?
No that timing should be fine - I do immediately as ta qte in though
When are you using elf
That looks like you're doing something wrong
<a:uihic:1160098262204829726>
It still is
@ catasaurus
Like tet said  if you do enough dmg he skips right to explosive
3 bars is sp drain 2 bars is explosive
Pretty consistently, yeah
you're in the server
you have it
though this is also punny
here's your bke run
<a:uihic:1160098262204829726>
i didnt have sp problems if i didnt get stuck in puddle
i dont think its needed here
which i think you'll have to do
this is working around puddles
i've stayed ~70 usually
dw does more dmg the more sp she has on ult
that hurts too
you might get slivered
maybe?
~ 735?
what t are you currently using
you have pb 3 right
dorm shop: 50
torus raid: 90 = 15 x 6
bp free: 40
bp knight / paladin: 40
abyss: 36 = 3 x 2 x 6
memorial arena: 30 = 5 x 6
elysian realm: 60 = 10 x 6
and new events
~400
from all sources, yes
were you leveling something old?
even without, we get like 400 per patch
how tf
i dont think torus is a good buy unless you're desperate for it tbh
how often do we get frags
he's what
thats the real euphie i think lol
husbanto old
euphie the new meta
done

He was the finest chef
His views paid for his bp/monthly
Like patpx
Some people did for money I feel
And very low views
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
There's no money in it for ref / vid making
But not nearly as much
Every once in a while now
But he still plays
He quit making vids
The fragile/neffr thing rubbed me the wrong way
I miss keeby
I respect his work but I can't respect him
Yee
Because they required more than 2 inputs to play
He hated all hua valks
It was ae
Ae
100%
He was a good player yes, but such a kek
This was kith
I like my supports to qte in and do nothing, I like to not watch refs and get mad when I don't do well, I like to flex my status
He was never chill about it
CCCCCCHHHEEEERRRRRR
Send in dms
He tilted me to no end with this
Dude
Or why boss or buff does x when y
How do you know the skips and shit if you don't know when to execute
It 100% is more important

Wtf
It's actually very well written
<@309634550273933314> As I stand amidst the boundless horizon of time, my gaze is enraptured by the profound depths of my soulmate's eyes. An ineffable certainty fills my being, for in her, I have discovered a love that transcends the ordinary and elevates my heart to sublime heights. This discourse is a testament to the ethereal and everlasting bond that unites us, as I conceive an intricate plan for a marriage that shall flourish in the eternity of our souls.

Our tale of love unfolded as if guided by unseen hands, a mesmerizing tapestry of serendipity woven into the very fabric of our destinies. As if celestial bodies aligned, our paths intertwined in the most improbable of ways, and I found myself irrevocably drawn to her magnetic aura. A symphony of connection resonated within us, speaking of an unyielding bond forged in the cosmic loom of fate.

Amidst the celestial stars, we embarked on the journey of laying a foundation fortified by the unyielding pillars of devotion. A profound understanding and cherishing of each other's essence infused our union, for in the embrace of our imperfections, we discovered the beauty of being human. With earnest communication and resolute transparency, we set the cornerstone of trust and vulnerability, epitomizing the essence of our profound connection.

In our shared odyssey, we acknowledged the sanctity of growth, recognizing that our commitment transcended mere temporal existence. A harmonious symphony of personal development played its cadence, orchestrating the transformative evolution of our souls. Our individual pursuits harmonized with the grand melody of our shared journey, as we urged each other to pursue dreams, kindling an eternal flame of inspiration within our beings.

Within the caress of time, we vowed to kindle the embers of ardor and tenderness unceasingly. Like ethereal minstrels, we performed the melodies of love, resonating through every fiber of our intertwined souls. An orchestra of affectionate gestures and spontaneous endearments composed a symphony of emotions, rejuvenating our hearts with the undying brilliance of devotion.

As in every saga, tempestuous gales sought to test the mettle of our bond. Yet, we stood unwavering, fortified by the resilience of our love, a bastion of unwavering support amidst the tumultuous sea of life. Our love became a sanctuary, offering solace and strength during the most tempestuous of tempests.

We mastered the art of empathic communication, skillfully attuning ourselves to the symphony of each other's hearts. Amidst the resonance of unspoken emotions, we embraced the profound gift of listening, perceiving the nuances of our unspoken desires, fears, and joys. The compassion and understanding we bestowed upon each other became a celestial dance, reflecting the boundless depths of our souls.

As we unraveled the manuscript of our future, we inscribed it with a kaleidoscope of adventure and exploration. Hand in hand, we pledged to embrace new vistas, to wander amidst foreign lands, and to savor the simple enchantments that life offered. Our expedition promised a treasury of shared memories, embroidered with laughter and ineffable moments that would endure through the eons.

Within the tender embrace of our love, we nurtured the radiance of individuality. Our souls, like celestial constellations, adorned the universe with their distinct brilliance. We celebrated the uniqueness that resided within each of us, for in doing so, our love burgeoned as a celestial ballet of authenticity and vitality.

In the chronicle of planning a long and eloquent marriage with her, my heart rejoices, for I have been granted the privilege of embarking on a celestial symphony of love. Our devotion, like a celestial sonnet, shall echo through the expanse of time, an eternal ode to the sanctity of love and unity. Together, we shall dance an eternal waltz, an eternal promise to cherish and protect the treasure that lies within each other's souls.
I'll do you one better

<:deadge:975652771082698782>

Looks like probability though, which I didn't like either from stats
Never heard of it <:EulaThumbsUp:837064323872063608>
Is that derivatives or what you rdoong
I don't like math

Here cherry
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Guys try this
But no stagger resistance man
I had fun on aka and hoi at least
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
It is, yep

Transition hasn't changed and then just go fast as possible
dodge with ht > htr active > either walk or dodge forward again with amy

cuz if you just dodge with ht you'll be out of range for the bk atk evade
Atm
Only ones I've seen with 39920 are window dragging, whether cn server or not, and even then it's only 2 cn vids and this


They changed the boss I hear
With the chicken wing gun
Sure
Run hor
Against tos since account sharing
<a:AA_Yoshino_Refuse:866896808591491092>
Kinda fucked
Yeah that left an impression on me
Ahhh
I mean the movie
Curious which it is
Keilo could mean 2 things
Idk how cutmeo got a perfect run
Gl with the hitlag
Mimi's hard stuck 798
Can try for it Def though
Get a 4090 first <:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
3pc
lol nope
with me personally
paga m is 100% the wave
okay im dumb
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
thats right
oh you dont own kiana
gonna go back to malding that
i think 3 set was the wave
this is with zaychik m and a worse run arguably, with paga m this was 6.13m
this is with paga m
dmg is
sp isnt the problem here my final ult does 127
s0 htr once again has killed me
@ ruby
It's a slow burn but the payoff is really good
Watch it
almost there
<@416445660443967491>
<a:CB_kiss_waifu:595320681319890944>
same <:deadge:975652771082698782>
though they had fuxi at the time
most miserable exp of my life
i did s0 -s2 vill v runs on a friiends acc
<:Pepega:945704815596535878>
sss vill v
s0 htr
the adv would get me sss
if i really wanted lol
i could do that next patch
and fragile mia with his masters
not a malder as much
not very but
well
also very casual
yeah
and darius has sworn to retire when i do
riku's dead too
<a:Smoge:808844088115068938>
all of our running buddies are retiring
icefire
but yeah
very casual rn
started the new semester doing engineering
he's in college rn
eli irl
<a:modcheck:926226465782132736>
Lol damn
Ohhh
This is the context for that
He's thinking of the ele lines prob
For ss0
That 712 is mental
And decided I'm out lol
Nope, I did a Holmes run in 5 minutes and contemplated suicide on the wardens run for 20
Cause I didn't wanna do ma <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
Look at my wardens score
Congrats <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
Let you live <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
Kills p2 shield faster apparently
Nvrmind
Esp by aka lol
He's been getting corrected in central a lot
If they really wanted
They could just run wolf or kasumi again
I'll do the s0 to set a run ig, then figure out something for the ss0 run
<:AA_Boy_Rizz:1110885649394966528>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
That is tight
I rewatched the ss0s
Ignite
Some of those were overkilling
100%
That would explain why no one ran it at low D
<:Towa_Sip:827222818239545344>
Maybe they kill elysia a second time instead
Scored 752
You right
I think you have to ativar o windows for it to work normally <a:CB_poof:595321900717178952>

Went down south for a week
Rn in the airport lol
Just popping in here and there
I've been on vacation all week
Until like 10 minutes ago
I didn't know
<:Think:366999782348292108>
For luna
Apparently ele lines are better
~~bit biased~~
Best is sols
No, most represented armada
Congrats lumi
Lumina is full of whales and tryhards
That's normal lol
The fight feels cd gated too
Self inflicted
Oh
Usually isn't it just wait for enemy to spawn?
That's an hrb problem overall
Ic
?
Hak into prostate play
And very very very hard to get rid of if not caught early
He's one of a kind
Yeah id save then
Oh is it
How often realistically does that +10 attack matter in your runs
Idk if that's worth
So you guarantee the weapon but forfeit luna
Well, how much crystal do you have?
<a:Smoge:808844088115068938>
<@309634550273933314>
Id rather have a geared support unit  than a niche dps weapon, plus the spending event next patch, better to save
I don't think it's worth unless you want +10 attack
When's the last time we used hor
but yeah prom
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
oh dabber 2
<a:modcheck:861417013993013269>
kall en deez nuts
brute forcing with something idk
you're using phys right
you can use prom
damn wtf
Like the procrastinator I am
I do but running tomorrow
Both sw and bill v were better at s1/s2 3/4 than s0 4/4
like even with sw tbh
s2 hrb, the sp is too strong
were at the point where some early ranks are better than gear
so it just depends on the quality
yeah lumi is actually valid this time
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
That's the one LOL
Oic
You mean hrb dps?
I mean
For vq, s0 hrb
And you need it for 888
The dabber elf sp is *cancer*
The highest I've ever gotten is 47872
It was always just short/never connected
For jizo and DXY and the mech boss I was tilted by the combo range
Because you don't have any to ult <:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
If you're s0 it's very easy to tell if you look at sp
Couldn't you check your sp
<@197871478950068224>
Yes
A streamer
Yumi
Yumi
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
I don't lol
Wog
LOL
Remember the literally who guy
Just a twice fan
That's misamo
I told you LOL
sure, im logged off
if you want to
and i dont wanna mald for +30
one run no ref got 770
i dont think i'll mald ngl
LOL
They called him out to
Apparently aqua done whaling lol
but yeah they unbanned him
they're making him a better player
Not like here
Those are actual lolicons
Okay but like
Wait you joined Central now to
There's a lolicon role dedicated
No, berry = gay
.
Yeah him
That coincidentally happen to be good at the game
But a *lot* of lolicons there
Yeah he's main active mod there
It's just EU lolicon server now, eu overtook sea presence in malding channel and other forbidden ones
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
<@180679257851166721> aqua is in central now
But full attack, 3 crit 3 attack, anything in between works
Crit is generally a more valuable stat
Lumi rizz
eastern europe is my guess
apparently
i mean in this context he isnt wrong i think
that uses bianka b
only for a tp jizo run
for a second hekate LOL
i was thinking of trashing mine
down for most users atm
Understandably so
Outside of general channels
Lumcord is armada role locked remember
Impossible for me to know
This
Idk what it is though
Aqua has to be referring to that one
Shirai is in a shittalk server too
No

Me and my bf are trying to conceive
LMAO
Looks like you were slow?
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
My guess would be tf extension but I'd have to look
Where is the rot collapsing
I have ss2 hr/ss0 hh and 9s tambou so for me 47712+39906 should be better
Cause  47632 + 39904 is worse than 47712 + 39840
And s0 hh
Yep yep
No lol
But ss0 gets 47712
Lower than your ss1
Dos
Even for s0 hare that was disgusting
I think it'll be fun 
Thank god dominance weather gone
Reading <a:whoasked:959994506017660979>

Last time 9s vq got 677, ss2-sss bke got 678, and hare is gonna be really good here
This one is a free for all
Abyss?
Where was she mayden
She's a bigger whale than me and ruby confirmed
But Cheryl got first
wog
<a:modcheck:926226465782132736>
It was one boss
It's not
He knows
I one run and done
Shut
?
Yes
Smiley is a good player
So farmable valks are the rest, wt etc
You only need ~272
A and SP are capped at 180 which is 12 valks to SSS
Not many
Be the change you want to see in the world
Make it
Find it
Yeah
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
<a:modcheck:926226465782132736>
its only like a 13-16% dmg loss from 3/4 to 4/4 sirin
0/4 on aka made myriad
if you're 0/4 on hoi, dead
the only issue is cn
ragna t / thales m have been solid
LOL
this is cope
only her afaik
?
only applicable to ma
40 sp, same as pe s2
lol
its just sp
essentially
oh ik
its the same as pe's s1
is s1 even worth
should be unless you get fucked
bruh
owomath 250*280
use columbus t and be happy <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>

<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
The damage isn't there
Not possible for ss0 without fps scam
You're ss1
Yikes
I'm not used to hold ult still lol
Same
Honestly
Surely
Ic ic
I can't imagine da doing well
Do you think she'll be another 6S trio or die boss like parv is?
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
Remember to complain about the boss being bugged and tanky too
3/4 vs 4/4 

And esp if no cn gear cause the 3 piece effect
The gear gap is bigger on this one too yeah
I have no opinion lol
Rime star was retired before I started playing
Kasumi kallen and hov should be fine though
Transition took forever for me cn kept going into the black veils on qte <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I saw that immediately lol

The bigger thing was wondering how they got sirin to evade from a rot I watched

Then I realized after like an hour the solution is go faster <:clueless:973756617109676032>
What I'm seeing is people proc the buff early and wondering why they do no damage
Pretty much, the only inconsistency is the spawn location of those crystals, which sirin doesn't have to care about
Is what I'm referring to
Not the location, the buff
Not the hitlag, not the staggering if you can't kill in 2 rots, etc

The majority has been with the ice
Every complaint I've heard about this boss is ice rng
<:Tiredge:1102446455098183740>
Why does everyone assume rng when they're doing something wrong
yee
seems
much closer to what you're looking for
this is bad
disregard this
ty cn very cool
ss0 got 687 at 498
but slightly higher d
8s hof teeam
looking for an hof buyt thats pretty solid
s0 did 740 at 498D
I hear it's much better now since kira
Cause Lee you need to ult first
Cry
Bruh
I can't believe this is an answer
Central got a hold of it
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
Was this the aqua site?
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>

Sounds like you're using rita
Yeah ss hfi SS HTR SSS cn

It's pretty much a 3 rot for most in p2
Yeah
Thought it was heki alt

Before kira
We used her on bull and assaka for a while
Yeah def the boss
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
nyet
Old and senile
It's too much to follow <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Oh wtf
It always bounces back
In the us anyway
This happens every like 10-20 years
I mean
But it's fucked yeah <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I can't agree with but I understand it
Yeah doomer posts like these
Rather burn it all than save it up
Everything too expensive
Like houses
People can't save anymore
Unless he was dropped a month ago
His acc is like 120 days old
It's only been 4 months
But yeah this is kinda messed up

Oh my God this is so annoying

Herrscher of friendship
I would wanna see that
Man I wish lyo complained this cycle
Lyo
I saw, yeah
Hasn't played in years
One of them is still a trial mod in maincord <:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
It isn't there
It's all jokes here
Okay yeah I only go star chat and here but like ruby said
I don't dare go anywhere else
I only stay in the abyss channel
Probably the best way lol cause that's true
Wait what the
But I'm not in idols or nubs
Idols was pretty bad too I heard
Yeah
But I backreads some tips sometimes or get refs
Mostly emotes
86%
But it's all lolicons
A *lot* of good players and tech is in there
Actual answer is a honkai server made in 2019, mainly sea accounts but some na/EU players
Tldr a lolicon server
They all are
Yeah
Don't ask Gresham I don't associate with them
That's actually awful rip
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
If you do try it just check this

And also you can skip the snap opening
Scored 732
It's kyo's old rot but mitsu said this worked 1:1


So is mimitsu
That's ok
because if you are i have a new rot
are you 3s hof btw
longer er for 10 coins
<a:modcheck:926226465782132736>

<:1ps_heart_omg:992562845025841162>
Better than me
<:leek:876314863767527445>
I quit
Where's the evidence, so I can dispose of it?
That's just awful
Rip
I forgot she does no dmg without shield
My hfs shield kept breaking
S0 was part of it but like
I figured out why htr did no dmg
Cause shino was so annoyed day 1 lol
Yeah Darius gave shino that one
Oh shino and Kyo updated
Or the 2% chance of all 4 being the same tile
You tell me lol I usually just shoot for tiles next to each other
<a:whalepat:899061677583122432>
that just means you're a bigger whale
like 9 patches late

lol
i got my 650 im happy

lumi here
except jy i think <a:pepelaugh:771978971155791903>
e6s5 literally everything
he just star rails a lot
when he feels like it
eh
curisu is 9s
just 20 minutes of playing the rot
no dying either
660 possible
lol
with ss1
exacty matched ref
ty ruby
i dont wanna do
and dying
thats so much cutting
i know how they got 640 but like
i think i just sss kira
a god s0 htr player = sss kira
there's no way
they *have* to have forgot
impossible
:myjkc:
and dropped +20 on me
they are s0
its the same person
im assuming they are - 1309 attack htr with all sp affixes
s0 htr
this
someone smarter *did* figure it out
how much sooner is it coming
\
its been 6 years
real
<:bedge:903014531268243506>
its legit at least 50 points here
my fellow s0fferer
okay nvrmind i copy
i've got the spcr
owomath 2.96+2.56+3.16
i can prob copy too
i thought people were meming i didnt know it was legit
i did lol
im already doomed to 4th when the comp players play
maybe if bracket picks up
i really wanna 63x though
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
i think an hour of my time is all this gets lol
goes right back into the beam on the next basic
and hof if you evade, she just
p2 tank is a killer
honestly the tiles weren't that bad for me once i started paying attention
man
maybe someone smarter can figure out a 640
632 i feel is highest
okay i flubbed but
s0 htr is fucked
9s can 740 prob, 8s can 71x
i hate this
this *boss* is torture
brother this is *fire* tank
but damn this is hard
if i could stay alive prob 630(?)
<:SadCatThumbsUp:806587729332011008>
-11D
-6 from ref
so fookin annoyin
and this is me
insert htr dies and/or hfs dies

what the fuck is this
not cause of the sp i havent stayed alive long enough to kill
this is actually cancer
yeah
ty guys
thats what i was thinking, ok
or this frame
this frame
what rank is your seele again?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
that could do it
3* your existing elves
ic
oh you only need 50k\
is that even possible
but i want pe stamps
i do not want teri
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

Time to go home and mald
Nokek

Ironically ae is easier for times
Cause I'm fucked if 3
Do you do 2 ults or 3
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I've seen it isn't pretty

in a few of those rots
he griefed himself
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
context
taking a year to upload
if discord loads
yeah one sec
or smth like that
but nyx is also like
the only valk to not be on a bp
yeah
they surely wont forget her like they did nyx
12 from spending yeah but i assume eventually she'll have a bp
so im getting all the stamps lol
when her bp comes that should be enough for ss1

expensive patch <:deadge:975652771082698782>
ok apparently my pe is 35/60 s1
just play the teams you like, slack the ones you dont
exactly <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
real
idk how i feel about skipping a anni valk though
gd's next on the chopping block
<:bedge:903014531268243506>
does that fix the ult issue? havent watched anything
with the v2 changes
she gains sp off field now too right
whats luna's cost?
neither can htr outside of trio team, right

125 sp kinda big cost
right now im leaning toward no for luna but pending v3 obv
is this even that big?
yeah <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
dont really have mats atm for a double pri patch either
but with my luck that doesnt matter
hmm
s2/ss htr > s0 lb > s0 htr
rank for rank new valk obv better
oh wait nvrmind, misread
if thats the plan
that feels niche
<:D2S_PeepoHMMMM:728081938044289086>
okay so cant do that
owomath 224*280
owomath 66+66+92
and 66 for card
its usually 92 for gear, ~76 for sp gear so
ok i go s2 pe and 1 sw stamp for ss1 sw
thats not that bad
owomath 170 *4
thats so much crystal
owomath 170 * 7
hmm
actually
so for me like

elves: no

s2 htr: possibly
senti dkey/gear: absolutely
s2 hoo: maybe if leftover?

s0 lb: not feeling it, but pending v3 

for goal of 12 pe stamps to hit s3, and/or 1 sw stamp to hit ss1
and i'd rather s2 a valk than pull 3* pb, i dont see much value there, and s2 is arguably cheaper
i want the pe stamps for s2 pe
was thinking of just pulling htr and senti stuff, no intentions of teri
and already own s2 hrb, just havent unlocked yet
<@180679257851166721>  what you think about pulling s2 htr this late in the game
<@516591030326525983> 
in and out of retirement
he's like
actually real
<@309634550273933314>
s2 is sp and ele dmg
breach
real
LOL
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
no one remembers roles except mods
jk lol
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
<:peepoTrash:1124842247792369706>
<:NadeLasers:835195931615690782>
amazing
i vaguely remember
like a week before it dropped
i quit b4 first dlc remember
another year another bug
i heard about that
its been so long
idk where my acc status is lol
but its bad manners in cometitive play
yeah im sure you can do dumb fun stuff with it
programming is hard guys
i saw that, yeah
how are people not rioting over this
i would be so tilted lol
why is this even allowed
crying
but yeah thats fucking stupid
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
bruh lol
<:terigooglyjuice:923066955164962886>
now buy the stamps too
fix your server
why is @ everyone even enabled?
probably, yeah
fhd wym <:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i didnt read when marisa posted
what changed
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
and i dont do enough dmg to copy kyo on final sirin ult
i cant cut anything or major dmg loss
yeah im capped i think
if only clones were real <:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah he was chatting about it briefly
that has his funds now lol
for the ult cd yeah
bruh
NA haas FOUR SSS sirins
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
once again
im handicapped by s0 htr
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Where if her middle chakram hit nothing it takes twice as long to come back

But fixes itself if you do Kyo opener
Yep this is true
There was also another openee issue with cn
He can play finally
He just got his third stig lol
Is stupid lol
Yo the amount of SS with 3/4
I think I do but I won't have dmg with 3/4
Well
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Idk how they get sirin out without triggering the qte
I think SS can get like 822
That's what someone on na has atm
you should correct her
796 now
better off not even playing
lol
i got 250
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
just in case
i also have a 3.01 sp line
ohh right oright
but not sp problems on ta
yeah
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i've never had sp problems
thanks dabber
or 92 or whatever
so its malding at 80% power
it is but i get the t stig tomorrow
rip
purana turg?
nokek
no hof?
i cant imagine well
?
why
not with 3/4 no
perfect
help
this is good enough imo
what fucking frame goes with sirin
idk why
i thought you had
also 2* kiana?
lol
omg
i assume s1
same disturbance s0 htr ss0 3/4 sirin
Yeah lol
I did nothing and got slander
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638> <:miku_pout:959751751249055775>
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
Below the cunnysuer what
Though I think I heard c Deez nuts lol
Whale
Where free jean
I haven't played it personally, but from what I've seen of it and from what I've heard from friends it's good

Short story but a lot of customization and replayability

And boss fights don't feel like pushovers - I think they actually tuned one down a bit lol
But bg3 is also really good so makes sense
Surprised you didn't pivot to ac6 like everyone else
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
Either way I should be good tho
8
Yep, bought the 60
Then the first time free + 6
Did I miscalc
Sunday?
Ragna T should be okay then ig I can compare sirin t
Well
Only 3/4
I'll probably play Saturday
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
But yeah even s1 has overkill
Oh god
all 10 is like 70
i paid 15 bucks for 2 stamps
i know aka ss2
gl
ss is another 55 bucks
cause s1 is still myriad
i dont think ss is worth performance wise unless you wanna save 15 weeks farming
thats why i pong
for 5 hours
i did
<a:AquaRunFast:648229846148841482>
but it doesnt feel that different performance wise
i find her really fun ngl
okay <@180679257851166721> i lied and got ss <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
mfw
but i cant do it for hi3
this works
okay so
Generally anything with hinges gears chains etc
Also used for metal gates
Needed it for the door sometimes
I used to drive a 2001 Honda accord
Yeah lol
?
shh
its fine otherwise
myriad a lot anyway
well
wog
a lot
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
yeah im gonna s1
i got wep + mb in 40 pulls
only 900, no?
My pull on sirin gear will determine her rank up
Haven't even updated lol
I've been at work
Mever
Are you using your al/aw for anything else
Where are your xtals
At least for this boss
Unless your name is herrscher of sentience no lol
And some hp loss
And the hare s2
Yeah it's just the PE s2
I thought it was starting idr
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
Nothing in abyss
Unironically if you're thinking s2 I'd just ss
And isn't it 30 bucks for both
Isn't it just sp
It's an awkward frag amount <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Idk about ss0
I'm going s1 personally
you mean ranged tank right
blame fps lowest settings and sleep <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
ah ok
the hp coagulation
but the black bar
oh not second ult
on that 2nd ult
when you use kira do you break the bar
lol
attack?
i dont think its att diff
mimi is ss1 as well
thats why i said 810 lol
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
no
where 810
the dmg is very inconsistent here too
congrats
you fooking whale
<:TE_WICKED:855224536500404245>
npnp
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
how did you both die
arent you ss1
just use her <:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
as you can see i did coop a lot
i used to do like 2-4 a week
o
i havent had a coin shortage in a very lomng time
not in years
there's no pri raid
wym how many
just ping
sure
🐦<a:birdgeleave:1128250401276301332>
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
In 6.5
There was
I'll be unstoppable
SSS hs
Yeah the brick matters way more for me
At least as it stands currently
Teri rank ups are another, too much of a gap for me to compete
At least sirin gives me more myriad/retain chances
S0 htr
I'm dead no matter what
Plus, if she's dps
I just like the fire teams more than I do the lightning team
Not even that
Yeah, that sounds right to me
Ngl
And sacrifice Teri for the brick
I think I pull for sirin wep
Cry
sea is brutal <:deadge:975652771082698782>
with 9 and a half hours to go
thats t51 rn on na
you called it
what is this
10 points from 5th in bracket
21st on myriad
You're so right LOL
This tilted me to no end
I've literally never noticed
Wait that is toilet paper<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Hold this king 🇱
<:worryWadeva:454364877423902724>
Every zoomer whale wants a rework
What about team aqua
It feels like he's doing it on purpose
I'm not sure if he's holding back lol
Ok lemme scope
Last gameplay I saw from him was sloppy
I haven't lol but I trust your guys opinion
35% fire vulnerability on 3set
Yep, ignite trauma charge +25%
I'm hoping they're nice after 161 pulls for seele gear <:prayge:863861301310652416>
Why would it be
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
5 / 8 bosses need her so far right
True yeah
Do you not have Lee still?
Oh okay
Fuk
I actually don't know
Is she a standard 50 per piece banner
Quick search at same D
 
Not gonna lie I didn't look
I think it should be fine
S0 did 714 at 515D for the boss friday
I feel like it's unlikely but like
There's also allot of lolicons in sea <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>

tight competition
who taught you design
this hurts to read
<@148145559897636865> you see this
yeah thats the same person
They hate kira too they probably already did it
Knew it was one of them
I misremembered, this was the hof hater
The one who made a 4 bullet point reason for hating
Lyowings or whatever theor name used to be
Isn't this the sirin hater
brother what
???
idk if it matters here
i used myriad yeah
c asc or sswords works
ideally, yeah
hs dies every 8/10 runs
i rage quit ngl
gl
okay yeah def not much
iirc?
i did 70 extra pulls and didnt get an m so like, maybe 200 bucks?
edit: it was 96 pulls for tttb
i dont remember spending much
honestly
~~jusst pretend they dont exist~~
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i forgot i had it ngl
jdr was the loan guy
different whale
no
i misremembered but close enough
that says enough
he spent 1500 on aladdin dupes
cost of living going up wayyy too quickly relative to the buying power of the dollar
yeah this
its ridiculous lol
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
wait this is a 45 minute vid
but lemme watch vid
more of this mindset maybe <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
<:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>
lol
thats just wrong
i mean
thats a rank issue lol
like mafuyu was
he just officially hung them up, he was here and there for a bit
i think thats more of valk creep than it is ma tbh
<:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>
watching your streams
man i remember this lol
they retired at 1800
ariaflux, if you know them
sea just lost another one
retirement maybe
that, idk
because its true <a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
now they're a grumpy vet
s5 *used* to be a great player back in the day
For a net new acc
Literally the only way to catch up is to spend
No fucking shot you haven't spent a dime
This is bullshit
Idr but something like that?
Like I think the rule was you can talk about valks but spoiler it, unless in cn discussion then don't spoiler
Idk if Teri is a spoiler maybe
<:yikes:1083856348875325510>
There's a Susannah husbanto too
Did he take out a loan
Where the fuck is he getting this money
Why is this also long
Brother
Sure
<:god:1001010336079564922>
You right you right
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
It's bs
Money *can* Lol
Honestly, in the current state of the game
ok
For our new std type valk vita surely <:Cope:888647792434765864>
Ice and phys
Ice feels in a good spot rn tho
That's a weird thought
People unironically wanting to plap griseo and it isn't weird anymore
Lolicons dropping the game in droves
Lol
Until htr died
I was with trio
Like that final ult would have killed if I had 5 more seconds
Most of my time was farming that
The Susannah team takes so much sp
True
Seemed to be from the little I saw
When it's bad it's really bad but when it's good you're literally God
Yeah that's qq gaming
Rip
Without buying the stamps
Is it possible to s1 by the first boss btw
Joewari da
Kill me
I hate this lol why is she dying so much
I think I just 730 and sleep
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Yeah that happened to me a lot
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

assaka  and jizo sure but temps were way lower

i posted those like last week
refs in ref channel

Someone: Hrb is just a time fracture that deals dmg
Everyone was banned, left or retired
The name is there

Get to it

Those are all EU btw except ryuu
The first one
Yeah they joke about it all the time
Which fragile did nt
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Well this guy pulled hrb
And his armada chat is crinjj
He only recently joined central and maincord
Apparently he's always been isolated
Yep yep
But he's a very good player
I legit think he's a clone
Same mannerisms
Same opinions
Relatively similar account
Euphie is a 1:1 copy of fragile
<:OMEGALUL:827381886787518464>
These peasants should be grateful I gifted my superior knowledge onto their plebian minds
I was right then I'm right now
No regret no remorse

Wait what the fuck
Real
For anyone else yes
For f2p definitely not lol
I did see you and Ruby talking about that
No I missed this lol wow
One sec
Uhh probably not
Turned up to 20
The worst parts of fragile
He's like
Not another one oh god
Weapon active
Man I do not miss this
I thought the only thing was the timing of the wa
Serious question
Does she?
<:bedd:1088683531921788928>
<:Deadge:1073469031513862214>
Make sure you get your credit
I would've done this tho
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
That's so bad
<:PeepoSnitch:1056688455079428206>
Easier to rely on yourself etc
Quite a bit of people like that
Yeah that's fair
Or whatever
Because x person took the class already
That's never actually happened but it's come close
It's such a mixed bag
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
And killed my project/participation grade
But then I had people try to do that and say I didn't do amything
I could see that
Ughh
I had a project like that
It can be fun sometimes tbh if everyone works together
I don't mind group work I mind carrying the group
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
Or you get the bums that don't do anything and don't feel bad
Or like the ones who picked the project and dropped the class so you're stuck
This *tilted* me so much
Bro
Amazing
You brag about sss valks, but cope when others have SSS valks
yes lol
i mean...
nah this is all vill v problem
this is s0 s0
you need the mantis to pick up the rock

p(roject)b(unny)
not sure what you guys are talking about though
if its a 3* pb ref thats the difference
way to brag about it
im telling you no one wants to play kosma lol
then im deadge
so doesnt really matter unless its trio or any dps after hoh
the server *is* my bracket
i mean at my spending
yeah lets switch
Getting better
Probably -1
Maybe that helps ?
Try free or normal
So auto
Are you using free?
What camera mode
This uses 2 hekates and bianka B  though
I think 47792
Would probably be better but trio works
Just use hh lol
Honestly
Lot of tight inputs
You too <@148145559897636865>
Nyx couatl
Blast from the past
@ ruby
Yep
Yeah lol

Infuriating but entertaining
At least he's entertaining
I almost would rather listen to velvet lol
Yeah I know

She's just being intentionally ignorant bc they benefit from it.

difference in scale too, myriad is 100 slots, retain is 10 slots. so anyone getting piloted higher than you directly impacts your position

you as an individual eating meat doesnt make nearly a big impact on the meat market like what ???
<a:braindamage:1120357539511537795>
Idgi
But to her piloting = veganism
And some other girl in sols
Was one
You'd be shocked
What really used to tilt was when people did that and their acc was piloted to that score
some of the regulars in ~~central~~ maincord have cosmic egos and forget they're ~~top 100~~ ~~nirvana~~ rl players in a small gacha game in a non-competitive server
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
If they knew they wouldn't ask
Exactly
So I guess it's better?
The other way was to embarrass you for even asking the questions lol
Ie aqua
Id rather give someone all possible options but I can see how that would be a problem if some whale or f2pbtw player thinks otherwise
And yeah it rubs me the wrong way
I mean Ken's last message specifically
In the old days it was more dense
Sounds like it
That sounds toxic
I wondered where the profs went
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
There were vid floating around
Yeah
9s hare on huodou
<a:duckass:1058846574454788177>
first he apologizes now he's flirting
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
Dunning–Kruger effect
dont click stuff if you dont know what it is
yeah thats all i mean by common sense
issok <a:patpat:943375983002677290>
usually you dont wanna click on random links
seems like common sense
i got ponged on this but idk if needs a pong
i mean
you can say this about literally any recent valk except for trio *as a team*
new age whales jesus christ
<a:joedead:799447032959729715>
That's even worse
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
Why am I the third option
I'm not, I just pop in for recruiting
Ruby is
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
Just another young whale with more money than gray matter
The profs don't like him either
Who is this kid
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
Or pulled and never used
Everyone who skipped back pulled s2
Yeah see that's the problem
It's midnight I should be sleeping
I did earlier but can help out later
im good lol
i hate the mantis
because no one bothered to read the mechanic
was kinda funny the first time he ran and a lot of people was tilted 
because their *fischl* was the one breaking orbs, not *hot*
its the same thing for sss actually
basically
the more you have the more damage you do
and if you're using vil v, htr's drones can too
elf can steal kosma stacks
yes
<a:bedpls:1056688663846735892>
i thought you were asleep
<a:worrystick:1070023228287889418>
im not expecting much
cutoff was 616 at 485D last time
*low*
not t50
oh myriad cutoff
on na imo
probably 660s
sleep <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
genshin feels like a full time job
if i didnt drop genshin i wouldnt have played either honk game ngl
only played like 7 patches
i retired in 2.1
i hate the mantis
but i *really* dont want to
i'll probably play more if more people wake up
gl
no T for ages
i had zhenyi mb vcause i didnt wanna spend more
and turg
zhenyi shitsal specifically
i spent on bad banners cause i didnt know better
yeah
from release until 5.5
and a benares tm tesla B hot
for forever
okay that i dont remember
i just remember using an arias lee tb thales hof
something around that
now we get 500 per ten pull
yeah
before the changes?
i didnt know you know take ss
and i didnt try for hof but i *did* try for hos
ended up getting s1 from a 10 pull
25 for hot
i did starter supply pulls instead
okay so like
and figuring out what the hell the menus did
yeah same, story was kinda interesting
ngl
everything is a blur now
or whatever they were called
did you use the exp boosters
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah like 1 day
yeah idk <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
i've only missed maybe 3 or 4 days ever
august 2021
i started like
it took 210 days
wym quick
prommo, no
retain, probably
i used hof ae hb
i remember the boss vey well
no no
yeah, that sounds right
it was hitcount clock if that helps
its been a hot minute
mine was whatever patch this was
like the first two bosses or smth
last one was in 5.9
and esp checking if its on right char lol
a bit more to keep track of
thats fair
with ae/nyx and ae/hof
i liked that boss actually

i thought orb rain was cool
nvrmidn
<@197871478950068224> can you raid
ok, sleep well
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
<@416445660443967491> can you raid
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah
this is the argument i hear the most
but korath hated everything before retirement
wow dead server
lol
honestly
send the fund <a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
those mobs hit hard on the last wave
vill v died <:kekhands:699566615854841876>
it is if you arent expecting it, took me a couple tries
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im guarenteed myriad, but scoring lower than this
timings are fucked
yeah i cant see past 735 ish with an s2+ rot
for obv reasons
s2 ss0 scores higher than ss0 s0 lol
im fucked
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
<:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>

from what im told
better dmg and no kafka cd
with seele
ely tb children m
this was earlier
yeah
that i know of
funny enough, the highest tp was 734
sweaty bracket
kyoshiro?
yes?
yeah
kinda annoying esp when he kills on the *last* hit of the qte
like what darius did here 
yeah this for me is just wait for the damn mob to spawn
-2 yeah lumi
or you cant clean kill
kyo got 706 but you actually needed pb
i bet
sea *super* sweaty on hare bosses for some reason
bruh
i just went down to 67 lol
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
its still sub t50 <a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
but its hard <:deadge:975652771082698782>
well, 7
9 points of leeway
s0 seele cap is 770
ik
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
i kinda wanna mald for that 1 point
its almost crazy that 750 is *seventh*
all these late players
i went from t50 to 65 in 3 hours lol
i lost too
if it makes you feel better
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah its joever once they finish sides
cata about to get sniped
im surprised icreative didnt play
they have trophies you dont
gogo
one up lumi
lol raks
who's left
you havent shifted
get him cata
oh rip
uses kira
<@416445660443967491> can you do this?

husk is killing you
yeah you'd be good
ah i see the problem
<:looking:721221928215642173>
i *really* dont want to
man i havent even touched ma
i  dont wanna mald 10 points <:deadge:975652771082698782>
im doomed
nokek
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
no 3 sets yet
i have kafka tb benares m margrave t sirin tb shui tm
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
roll it on my acc
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
i dont own it
this is such a dumb build lol
isnt that just the board behind her
time to score 720 and sleep
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
swapping to mei though
i have hua kiana teri to 80
i dont use raven
i cant beat otto on padoga 4
wtf
Boomer
amazing
thats not great
no wonder
its scary
they have the same mannerisms, same speech patterns, relatively same acocunt
yeah euphie is just fragile but different account i feell
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
except he pulled hrb
there's this guy called euphie that is literally exactly him
fragile cloned himself btw
that i know of
like 6
well
still a lot yee
yeah thats why i said that lol
just keep bronya alive
for that stage
trio is my go to usually
everyone eventually will find a use
but nature of a turn based game i suppose
i still use march and wind danny
honestly, the free chars are pretty solid
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
im jsut happy she was free
agreed 
i dont own bailu either so more partial to natasha
<:NatashaEnjoy:1088824300976476200>
natasha still carries me too
tingyun and gepard are really good, yeah
not good as a result
same for like half my roster <:deadge:975652771082698782>

i've built so many characters to 75/80 and 5/8/8/8 traces and lc's, but their relics are just
i think dot is growing on me
shocked me when i ran her and sampo
she actually does quite a bit of dmg
and kafka enables a completely new playstyle with sampo and/or luka
it gives you options at least
supports go so much further in this game
yeah i think my dps days are done <:deadge:975652771082698782>
he does stupid damage at low talent levels *addendum this was with lc
6 is fine yeah
but i dont like making decisions off of unconfirmed information
rumors are reruns might start soon so you could also bet on that and wait
if there isnt anyone you want coming up soon, i think going for the lc is fine
i personally think more characters are better for f2p accounts, 
but i think there's merit in beefing up your existing characters with their respective gear
though to answer your original question
i've played a lot  of minigolf but not actual golf no
wtf
golf?
?
that lc is okay for him, works until you get his or the herta shop one
fall of an aeon, yep
you already have s2 hrb, which is more important
yeah, waiting is better
i want people to think in terms of value
i know but is that potential dupe worth sacrifacing your current crystal count for the next patch
its okay for him
is a dupe worth x amount of crystals?
you never answered this btw
what lc do you have
18% cr and 6 energy
his lc is mostly for comfort
fall of an aeon s5 is good for dhil
sounds like you have your answer
mobius' briefcase
do you want to make your existing character stronger or do you want more characters
<:teriderpmelonswag:799381275051032576>
etc etc
vill v's turret
susannah's bear hoodie
<:AquaDisgust:1097181740839211210>
yeah
its literally just a recolor <:deadge:975652771082698782>
i wish the stand got a better skin
just was frustrating for me because of that
because animations, sfx, everything is really good
also helps that she can crit now <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
but she's been a lot more fun than i originally gave her credit for
not bad for a walmart elysia huh
<:joedevious:822243320826298389>

either way <a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
either trolled or like
learned to play well enough to drop 820, though i think 9s is 835
+25 points on this boss
i really hate that s2 is like
the audacity <a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
also unbridled kinda annoying
bennett is usually in mine too lol
dude follows me everywhere
at this rate i might not either

from reddit
This game doesn't have a pity system but instead a spark system. Every pull you do in the rate up character banner you get 1 gold ticket. Once you get 200 of those you can buy the rate up character from the shop. If you get lucky and get a rate up character or a random ssr (like your biscuits) when pulling; the spark system won't reset unlike the pity system. The gold tickets don't expire so they carry over
<a:nou_hh:833500436526530570>
6:14 PM - 744

i mean chip space
its blockade
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>

they always miss the spider
these fucking flowers
you know what i despise though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i dont see much higher than 751
elf timing man
my first try was 671
LOL

I'm impressed ngl

No she can't!

she wants to see if guys like girls shorter than them
Sure but I'll need a 2000 down payment
Do you know how expensive whaling in 2 gacha is
It did once hsr dropped
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Hsr plays itself wym
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
I saw earlier, yep
Which no one here has
This is higher but 4* pb
But it's easy
Rino is literal god
Yeah rinos
S0 though
That's fgo
You're right the are everywhere
Bring me back to jizo
It's fun


Also lumi are you searching bili properly
Petition to unban ruby and ban this guy instead

No
Lol
That's 47904*

Oh I'm bugging
Probably 792 but I despise the run
Fun times

Is that guy still relevant btw
Tenten <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
If bad why hot
Lol
You can say this about electro too
Oh I mean how everyone called him mid then the patch later they were all dickriders
At the time*
The 4* venti
Oh right
Who was that?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I tend to crack a day or two before
For 20 days
I did
Yeah
Real
A lot of people say nord
I'm using proton VPN personally but there's some good ones out there
I could've saved 3k over my account lifetimes <a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
Depending on your card or bank shouldn't have fees, or at least they shouldnt outweigh the savings
I'm gonna start doing that
Oh does anyone top up jpn here
Insane
20% attack on loucha
40 energy on sw, or 35 idr
E1 feels fine in this game ngl
Tet and carb play
It's literally Nini main game
It looked strong
I'll e1 on rerun
He was 
he spooked me <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
<a:duckass:1058846574454788177>
It's okay I'm reminded every day
I told you blade was an accident
I did
I like the variety
E2 seele
E2 jing
E0 blade/dhil 
E1 kafka
E6 qingque

Just spin the wheel
Honestly yes
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
Even with mid gear
E0 s1 hits kinda hard
Yeah, I might honestly finish him
Why are people like this lol
What?
Now idk who I wanna play
I built too much chars
Yo I actually have a problem
Yeah what lumi said
Okay
Prob kasumi
Everyone quit
Who will tell the chat to keep themselves safe now
Sounds like the mods were bratty
Lol
Playing game /== modding doscord
Yes?
....

Khai is butthurt about everyone

Also just saw what it was that got you beaned lol
Need to correct the mods
<:OMEGALUL:827381886787518464>
Xerxes and icreative good too though
Maybe lumi but seems free
Duggle and raks take a spot
or upcoming
recently i think
holmes was in bp
we're losing to triple support btw
skem
deserved <:deadge:975652771082698782>
because you just +1'd me back
also ihy
there's like 6 people yeah with 812
Idek how to comprehend what I saw
<@148145559897636865>
Most of us are
Nokek
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
Like before she bedge
I sent her a sticker too
Just someone who picked caelus
It's the former it seems
To the other me
Oh right
?
Stelle
I don't think kira is better here
Sw is also really high if you want
9s hh is 840 SS is like 813-826
They're all on bili
??
Yeah, not sure why they aren't rerunning older bosses
i think its elf timing
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
no more of my time lol
i tried for 23 minutes until star rail was live
nty
5 hours for 812
1 hour for 811
<a:NONO:933902239200858133>
i kinda wanna go back in because everyone went to 812
but i cba to mald for 1 point
the more you describe this cycle the more im happy to have finished early
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
because by that point kira should be nearly off cd anyway and hellmaru should be around... 3x bar?
i dont have enough runtime to be helpful <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
well used
i use it immediately
Actually goated for hos
She kinda hurt
<:lewd:959737567119556618>
I wouldn't invest too much mats into it
The sp line is kinda wasted though
I wouldn't reroll them
You have 21% crit dmg
Yeah lol was about to say
Then you get to rest eternally
Any more is wasteful imo
You only need enough for your body to feel restored
Me, casually getting 4 hours a night
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
He has a blade pfp surely he's trolling for reacts
<a:crydead:869102726716465202>
Gg tho
You could've probably trio it too I think
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
except for maybe akayuki's way of doing them
easiest mobs i've seen though
thats a 9s vid
~~just ignore the 9s~~
this might be easier for you
oh lumi
there was 2 triple supports though, you're right
no there should  be an hh one too unless im slacking
the ref one that no one remembers
prob easier to see in action
there's a vid in the thread
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
like an hour ish of actual playtime maybe
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
time to find that dubai friend
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>

istg
i really do not like assaka
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
hopefully we never find  out
i could see that
i've literally never seen one lose
somehow she's also a guarenteed mvp in co-op lol
the valk
imo anyway
same for aponia too btw
for 3 patches
every patch
and it helped that we had kosma like
shame couatl never came back though
yee
honestly even at s2 she was a really good investment for my acc
its been 20 years
i am
and yeah now that she can crit, she's a problem
i mean
she's strong enough *without* the dominance buff imo
there's a banner up
sounds like your answer is yes
and phys now
you are on ice cycles
s0 is nice, esp as temps get higher
s2 is a myriad thing
nah
for any chars you wants
realistically you could use it on 
a) a char you really like and want to get stronger
b) a recent psy char that could use the attack
shes img
and are they your favorites
are either of those chars s2
for who
She's fine until you wanna cap her
yeah
i think kira's still better in that case then ngl
hoh?
wait what dps
or 60/65?
?
max pris im guessing
what rank are both?
but yes that was the case
i answered you in the next line lol
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
Why
Spread this spread that how about they spread some legs
Elysia dies so quickly
And I just want to be done
Man
I want to every time I play but then like
Where's my compensation for playing
This is only true if you're ulting every rot, no?
Ngl
Oh I forgot she existed
Preferably .5
It's fine if you get a .4+ sp/s line
LOL
Hos is very very efficient yeah
Everyone dipped after 2500
Ic
I'm stuck in queue for hours
How are you getting games wtf
I think s0 io was solid
Right
S0 vill v was *not*
S0 aponia was fine
I wanna say sw maybe but I don't think that's correct
Ohh
Even with af
I would've said bk personally
What does her s2 do
Really?
<a:AA_Shoko_Bye:848470658085552188>
Ughhh
Nvrmind again Mimi says hh easier
This is the second time
This needs 1 spcr line on sushang
Nvrmind
This feels true
Honestly
Jesus time flies
456 na 457 sea
No it was indeed 456
Hmm
Or maybe I don't have it recorded
It was fucking 456
Nah
478?
I think last maru was like
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I'll try both and see how each feels
I might just do this instead
Okay shino saving me
Bruh
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
You always do better after a break
Good luck soldier
That sounds so annoying
Oh  wtf
Road to 500 is painful
We find out in 7 and a half hours I suppose
Yeah that
<a:modcheck:926226465782132736>
I didn't check one sec
I have 1430
I'm doomed
It's very strong but it's insanely optimized
And that was what I noticed on ref
1440?
What's yours
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
The only other 840 I saw was ss usage
Yeah kasumi
And it thought it was the coolest thing ever
My first gacha weapon that I can remember is an offrate bri pri
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
I'm happy about bke too though
Everything else has a workaround for me but you're locked 786 without it
Because it was the only strat I was gated by <a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
I outlived DoR runs
I just can't believe it's possible still
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
<a:csgiriewtf:1000666104127045642>
I don't wanna fight her
I'm actually so annoyed by this lol
Icic
If you want you can login to mine
That SSS bosses were a mistake
It would take you 3 tries max
The games trying to tell you something <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
I hate you
True
Outside of like sim battle
Then I remember I still haven't used the first
I thought about a second sleepri
Look at this

Night lumi
It still is for tp
Well, basically ignore it
I can't believe we just ignore the clone now
Yeah that's what I thought
And dabber sp mald is something I wouldnt wish on my worst enemy
The only non PB 47888 I saw with vq used Aladdin dupes
Here
One sec
Yeah that works
Which was cancer
With SSS hs
For the old 9s rot
She used to
She doesn't need sp
Ruby can correct if wrong though but dabber takes a bit for stacks

PB is instant cast
Looking at ref and what Keilo sent
That's just elf diff
Oh
Oh?
When you evade she throws out 3 flowers and those flowers need to hit jizo as well, it builds bar faster
I think some of it is positioning
That'll do the joint attack then hold ult button to ult
That looks like evade spam basics hold charge once bar is full
Icic
Is Keilo gonna be retiredbtw now
-3 yeah
owomath 47712 /1.2
if its the one im thinking of
47712
interesting
i wanna see something
then see what happens if you just shoot the crystal instead with charged, instead of ult + charged
maybe just swap in and wait a sec
so at the end there instead of ult with kira
and that killed crystal in 1 shot
this is from a 1300 attack kira
where's the ice damage
lemme ask around
yeah mechanically i see nothing wrong
every ref i've seen has killed at 1475+
one sec lemme watch
and ult on kira to kill the warden
use active/follow up to kill hitcount
you could just stay on jk
alternatively
or else you break the crystal and boss has a sliver left
because of that hp loss effect
for this boss specifically
1490
you're gonna want like
but its hp loss for sure once i double checked
whats your kira attack
he really wants the new teri
yeah darius whaled a tad bit
cookiezii is s0
he's s1 rn
he was s0 until 2 days ago
yep
using turg
yeah lol
something to do with hp loss idr
after kira ult its 5 stacks of the hitcount left, then a charged should be able to clear it
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
hb turg tb paga m
yes
i dont
kira really helps her out
she's fine now there's just 0 sp
even before kira came out and everything was cez locked
like for reference this triple support run looks harder than any s2+ hh run i've ever done
amazing
trying to escape?
<@309634550273933314>
esp nowadays with kira
but majority are the same thing
like some need 1 spcr line on jk
some others you want to be careful how you manage/farm sp
there's very very very few that need thought
in abyss or ma
hasnt been back since vill v debut
nope
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
bring couatl back
yee
<:02shrug:809888510143496264>
they're still an amazing player and have been for years  but that score isnt possible to get within the game by conventional means
its probably scam lol
if styx didnt score it
it externally freezes the game
you know how you can minimize app
with task manager
or whatever its called
you just spam that
keep goingin and out
velskud's score is not legit
also to answer you earlier lumi
still got it
and retired too
ik
i saw you scored on lumi's acc
gj btw keilo
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
why is there never anyone playing the chibi shooter
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
idk if this is too whale for me or just really fucking dumb...

context of this is would you rather x or sss your favorite character
arent they just at the start of the level?
i dont htink there's a tab but could be wrong\
o
?
but it just works
i dont understand it
apparently they 800+ in nirv
im using triple supports
<:naruhodo:672405817164824605>
but i wanna see pain
i look forward to your hellmaru
<:waldhands:834890758724780032>
<a:dalao:795864124907061369><a:dalao:795864124907061369>
that should be 807
<a:whalepat:899061677583122432>
i just assumed it was fine <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
this is one element of the fight i actually didnt pay attention to ngl
i just had pizza actually
eat hot chip <:ohno:959752132905566261>
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
it was lumi
fun tiems
<a:aworryRun2:601196179878969382>
real
i saw bruh got muted then banned
i remember you guys were saying bad words in different languages there
this was like my 5th message here lol
yee
oh i remember that
nothing just looking at quote names
griseo
??
also
yeah
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
he nuka channel
was that the one jayson and kai deleted
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
even keilo
you did in sols tho <a:patpat:943375983002677290>
nokek
and im like ohhhh i get it
i questioned this until we played jackbox games and heki was racist
cata was my gateway in
<:teri:963697103853486100>
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
meanwhile, in other servers:
the sss is kinda big
also isnt eli sss prom too
but achievable goals
its probably higher yee
731
but yeah thats sols
fun backread <:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>
what is plaque challenge for this?
only to be disappointed that i cant pull it off
im trying this first
i take it back LOL
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
wtf is this
this had to be beta or something right
<:ElysiaGrab:1099324478007296000>
elysia time
or dps rc i suppose
yeah literally use whoever so long as its not nyx
and this was ss htr
actually this is on same D

lemme find s1 htr this was s3 
  s0 doesnt do half bad here
what do you have to use?
I thought most retired but some came back
JK I forgot EU had whales <a:runfast:959995921305829466>
I skipped a grade
No
And chaos
Fragile smiley rei (whale one) and Neal are the ones I was referring to

Oh solit too I suppose
Real
I know of like maybe 3 good EU players
~~No~~
That explains a lot <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Wow camelva's still around
But certainly right about kek
Not gonna comment for my sanity
I'm just
Alan again
Just need you to send that first
Sure, but she charges $50  fee
I can't even fund myself
I just reread it yeah lol
Wait what
Should be fine since s2 seele yee
They literally fly into the boss
The fucking basics gather the bombs
Dw is BS on this boss
S2 seele
S1
But sp is still a potential issue on some rots
I just save time not having to do combos
Because it's still cosmic cd gated
SSS isn't really a huge advantage here
Yeah
The one run I saw do that had 1.4 sp/s 9.02 spcr
Sp is really tight
Probably not
If you're ss0
7 points maybe?
Chain should be like
I see things as hard when the player has the opportunity to influence it

This boss for me doesn't feel like that at all
Then the problems start to appear
It's fine until you try to cap it


Here
Speaking of
Savings up for hellmaru
I'm not that maso
I sleep
Fuck that lol
<a:whalepat:899061677583122432>
Whale score
mathematically cdmg should always win out iirc
i used cdmg
then hos pillar for the second wave sinc eit sounds like you're fast enough to do that
you use basics > joint attack (the first one) to gather bombs anyway
how much health is elft
tericula stocks
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
he's sniping
he got 760+
i hope so
not because of qte but the boss overall
dude darius and mimitsu were so tilted lol
this too
thats crit in general yeah
if you dont need dmg sure
im die forever
moves too damn much
i hate it
yes
ahh
yeah that is annoying
interesting
i didnt have much issues doing either
for me personally anyway
thats a major problem this fight
like not coneected
could've just straight up missed tbh
hs ult expired?
nokek
<a:Smoge:808844088115068938>
rip
and the blinding is worse than dfault
if it makes you feel better it took the full 10 pulls
<a:modcheck:926226465782132736>
there's a banner up
yesterday
@ carvalho
capped at 5m
yeah they are
10 yr bans
no but we can remove childe
LOL
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
1370 is rough <:deadge:975652771082698782>
but thats strictly because i dont have damage otherwise
on p2 instead of ult > evade on the mobs then combo > ult
im doing ult > n5 > combo > ult
oh, also im not doing what i think most refs are doing
sss hs continues to be the most useful valk i've gotten
saves so much time not having to farm 40 sp <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
<a:dalao:795864124907061369><a:dalao:795864124907061369><a:dalao:795864124907061369>
but all stuff you probably notcied
~~basically prayer~~

you should be using seele combo (dont use the joint combo after) and then 1 pillar toward the end, to gather the mobs

but for me my hits finally connected and got the boss down to that 78x point at half a minibar
basics for seele combo then after they gather hs pillar > evade > spear for me personally

but you're probably already doing that

im also using elf earlier: i was using dabber when prom qte in for the final rot on the mech
instead, now im using dabber when the mech flies into the arena again after transition

the other thing too is the mech seems to take more damage when its landed: consistently seen higher damage when that happens so for me

i kill cube while active is still on cd so i just 2-3 basics, active and by then the mech is mid fall *without* eating up too much of hs ult duration (this is when i use elf)
im not impressed with s2 performance in comparison to s0 hrb or sss hs
its a break glass for me rn
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
why hoyo
against a boss that moves so much
she moves so much
the problem is more seele's animations imo
like i said havent needed to <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
-3 points but whatever
get me out
figured it out
everything works
its a bloodbath
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
i actually cant play this event
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
after the initial patch day everything else is i feel like gamba today
so right now i dont see a reason personally
most of my scores are within 10 points of 3-4*
actually, no i maintain that thought
lemme reword that
well
not enough of a difference in dmg to warrant it at current disturbance
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
she would actually fix that 1 bar of dmg for me
<:archsakenbroke:1067090346263183431>
<a:modCheck:843977786568736789>
most of the attack would come from reaffix stigs
for a boss that shows  up once every 2 patches yeah
maybe when teri comes out
when sss hs has kept me afloat
i see no immediate reason to rank up
also s2 hasnt really impressed me ngl
neko gets it
^
im still s0
?
1370
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
but i really dont wanna mald for it
so *maybe* 740-745 finish?
this with cleanup kills at 770
idek how i got 737 anymore
its so annoying
dude
that makes sense
yeah we +0 last cycle
are you s2 btw
yee
s0 for now
gl
this is fall guys all over again wtf
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
surely this doesnt impact it
both
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
but no one online
i wanna play shenzhou
okie
really
for the floors
dont you need 3 people
no pots?
do you need dkey too
💢
god that outfit is so clean
not turret lol
and most of her dmg locked behind ult + cannon
ult at 50 she starts 25
she takes a while to get sp
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
ss2*
yee
this guy
i was not LOL
my like
im out
like there's an invisible wall
idk how it works it just does
all bosses like that yes
shoot basics kira gets sp
they're besties with mimi
ask eli and tet to ask
like ae and hfs did
different buffs do, no?
iirc
impair is the one that overrides
breach can stack additively
finale just fucking slow
okay im full of shit lol 740 possible
on par with ref cause my seele 1353 attack lol
i think i can 724 maybe but i def cant see much higher
prom just eats too much points
yeah this kinda hard
yes
What
Freedom at last
<:RobocoCute:654023331900686346>
Might wanna keep this
SS0 = SSS
<@197871478950068224>
You too <@385655541248163840>
<@309634550273933314>

If p1 he's using active
P1?
But where
Lemme watch
And Styx has a 9s rot
But there's a ref in thread for ss0
Idk how 9s does it
Pog!
Which externally freezes the game
They did window dragging
This is scum btw
Ss1 ht s0 htr can 840 legit
There's a new one actually
Or the 3* chakram
Ironically that's what's used
You have to NOT deplete the shield iirc
Yes
That run is toxic yeah
What the fuck
<:ppnosp:1139594235138539620>
Also sp doko
That looks like you're too slow
Hfs bd rc
Should be 733 still
Nokek
Also what game you want me to swipe in
Lmk when you want me to login
Also tyty
<:susge:853371579185365022>
Good attempt soldier
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
💢
Something something correction
So they can get aka <a:runfast:959995921305829466>
S0 trio meanwhile <:LookingFren:1016313455017463808>
SS trio has dominated a lot of bosses, and snuck into ones they shouldnt have
By far
Exactly
I think I get *why* people say it since it's 3 s ranks to function, but it's realistically no different imo
low-key they aren't wrong about hare pe stigs tm Elysia B work ~~if you have ranks~~  but man what a show
Actually crying
<:AyameWaiting:816695456436322376>
<a:bcaPatientlyWaiting:764167633234559016>
Ruby wya
Kkonaw
So much more invisible timers to track
SSS ma and abyss it's basically a different flavor of the same problems to me
Ss ma yeah that I can see
Until hrb anyway
And less competitive So I stuck with that
This used to be me but like I realized phys is just easier to diagnose
Though they're right Alexandria is not a strong stig set <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Why do people without the valk recommend cope <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
~~also stig set is wrong lol~~
These are the people that hate crit but love spending 12 hours diagnosing why kira B or turg or ppm isn't getting applied like it's any different
I love this comment lol
Man
I'm reading shino and hzri trying to figure it out
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
Oh I mean on that conversation<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
But I sleep <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
Its so ridiculous lol
On sp
Those runs are tight
 s2 770 prob

 s0 740 prob, higher with SSS hs
One sec
Yep
I meant to update them
Prob higher, those refs are bad
S0 can get like 715, 730
<a:TE_NOTED:982012501950615583>
Icic
And no, very very casual
Lol how did you get this
Different server than main cord, but on mobile can't grab <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I fucking hate these people
> valk bad/dead no bosses
> Explains why exactly they're wrong

Which is an activation condition
Sirin just ignites
Yeah
Because I couldn't copy with sirin
I'm 100% sure
There are refs that did it
Wiki says fuxi forces fire qte
There's no shot
And sirin force qte
I think fuxi reduces cd
Idr which tho
There's a fire elf that does
Extremely low topup
Really really good player
Boomer
Rip
<:7Csoontm:628344479178424330>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Why not the s0 htr one?
Nvrmind
Oh rc
You don't need
Cause the shield
The hof rc ref is cancer tho
That feels like a 733
:notblind:
You can use it
It's 2
No no
<:TE_PepegaBlind:967928246878502972>
It's 3
Oh nvrmind
Maybe this Eli they don't show elf tho
Does rino have anything
Probably
Joewari da
It's joever eli
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
2* elf doesn't exist in cn
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
Just don't be poor
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
You elf ult too late
The s0 one unplayable yeah
Eh, should only be -2 or 3 overall
Yesterday
I wanted to kill myself malding dabber sp
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
You're right I don't own it
You can save a second cause you don't need to do the thing s0 does
This is s0 3*
Lemme find a 2* ref but my guess is 47856 for you
<:feelsgusman:928924973937090580>
If you have Aladdin M can use that tbh
At least in bleed team anyway
Which is better than 15% phys still lol
20 if bleeding is the thing
Stupid bot
<@434737143395516416> Susannah T
Yes
4* pb tho
But 47872/47888 possible
Or SSS seele dps
That's using susan
Oh whoops
Need a better elf maybe but I can find rq
47904 is possible with s2
Yeah
<:garbedge:1026336100064706560>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

<:shh:1043975780050423908>
cant disclose that info
im omnipresent
i know everything
youve been playing a while
rest up yeah
i wanted to do dailies
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
If s2 4 atk 2 cdmg
Preferably 1.4 sp/s
Sp/s if s0
Was pretty solid as a character in the mangas
Non horny reasons aside too
Yeah lol



<@197871478950068224> ignoring transition on both fights this is what my acc did

2 different p1's, same p2
Why is it so scuffed
I don't wanna get out of bed
Same
<:ppnosp:1139594235138539620>
LOL
<:PepeLaugh:945722811928952842>
Until she needs to ult, then ult > extra charge if you need sp
Literally
Active > charge > that's it
Yeah no
!steal <:ppnosp:1139594235138539620>
In this channel actually idk
There
<:ppnosp:1139594235138539620>
Me lazy
No you
so real
So kinda important<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
It also fills up the herrscher bar
Oh, something I forgot
When paralyzed, enemies take more dmg
It gives sp, but also paralyzes (rather, fills up trauma, which then paralyzes)
It's called susanoos frenzy in her kit
2 mini bars <a:runfast:959995921305829466>
No no, I'm a liar
Maybe slightly less
There's 95% of a full bar left
During that sequence
P2 is like, gd ult > charged > ht qte > htr
I fucking wish
If you don't have the dmg then yeah, that sequence you described
P1 is dead on qte, no need to shinzan for me
Well, I'm talking about the hold (combo), not the horizontal slash (n5) whoops <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
This
~~The n5 I believe is combo~~ meant the hold atk here
When herrscher bar full
Shinzan would be the charge ig
Shinzan, etc
Idk the technical terms <:sleepywhale:1120460602947666033>
n4 > evade > n4 > shinzan > combo > ult
Or fragile's old ss0 ht run
This is the sequence
Like in this vid here
You don't wanna do that until just before you ult
Should be ~195 sp when you ult
Just be in middle
Nothing to learn really
You're bleeding time in p1
Ic
<:bedge:903014531268243506>
And p1
When you finish mobs
What the
What you said t was
Idr
Ss0?
literally got it in 3 tries after a break
Complaining always works
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
solid s1
im like
for mobi
this is linn btwp
~~just buy bp for s2~~
^
i cant bring myself to hit play lol
i lied i cant do it
16
150-134
134
29+105
1 elf card is 105 frags
*at s2+
time to hoh for funsies now
1 for 3*, 2 for 4*
2 cards, yep
8% tdm
4* is like
that explains it
lumi
?
do you have kiana 4
optimal is evade twice , laser to hit 2 of the barrels, evade again, hold basic, ult
yeah
like if it was *consistent*, 750 is doable
the hitcount is so *tilting*
<:KEKWTRASH:856863762702663690>
745 possible, fuck this run
about to throw my controller
im done lol
for some reason
ss1 hoh sss jk sss kira = ss1 ht s0 htr here
issok
they score identically so
ill give a couple more tries  and call it
it is maldy
okay 740 is def possible but
the transition is pissing me off
i hit 730 but like
issok
i literally just finished sides
ill just stream it
le sk ht
yes
yes
we have the same team lol
730 or bust
Hoo?
Nirv bouncer
Oh, yeah
They bounce here and there
?
Completely f2p player
He's really chill
He's in our armada
Sairaan
Hoyo community so weird
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
Like berating gets the point across
That sounds right
Something something f2p valk
Max cores
Farm for sss
I got her to SSS to literally use her twice
Im so mad about that lol
I wanna get ch ss2
I just got hor to ss2 too
5 weeks from sss
In time to not use her
I'm leveling up tp
Nice hua devotion though <a:dalao:795864124907061369>
I thought you were ss2
When the hell did you sss hs
I grabbed locks personally
.4 sp/s 2.7 spcr
The same
Id be surprised if not in sister state
In NY it applies to salary anyway
I believe so but I'm not sure
It's like 40 or 50 bucks a day
They compensate you
I mean while you're out of work
No no
Oh God
Hopefully they don't give you a date though
It's what, only 40 bucks a day?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Can get creative
Or something
I'm actually lightskin Dominican
You get out scot free
Just say You're racist
Maybe they don't give you a court date
Rippppp
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Just buy 6 le frags
Lumi living up to their name
And it can be fractional
Yeah
Or to get those
There was no easy way to get locks
It's better than the old way
Or less
It can be .1
No
to get to 23
this is for 22.7+ stigs
if the line is under 22.5 you reroll it anyway
yes
not *rerolls* lines
it only *enhances* lines
for favs, etc
same principle
use this on a valk you'd use a 23/23 on
Maybe hit 500 by 6.9
Expected to keep going up
491D lol
You morbed all over them
I'm hiding in conference room
I'm not even doing my own job
<:GriseoSob_lum:994026245069230161>
I will throw shade though <:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>
^
I don't like bm people
Lol never
<a:ZHONGASS:922143463917617182>
But has been nice to just sit back and <:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468> sometimes
For me anyway
Nirv is more fun cause you can invalidate others complaints
<:worryDasRight:595540930212397057>
But very chill rl player
Who knows
LOL MIDNI I just saw
Cab still plays
Yee
With some pulls here or there
That's 2 years worth of crystal
Basically
I'm not joking
When yae gets a herrscher suit
Man do I have news for you
You guys thought Eli was a saver
Abyss opens in 5 hours
Er opens in 15 minutes
So next reset 7.0
They just reset this season
Run was 830+ then
Yeah lol
If above 3k
They just reset every 2 or so patches
No excuses for shield crit
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
Just Otto is enough
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
Too much bg3 huh
Adv doesn't give essentine, no?
You right
130
150 frags from adv I think
You'd need to be ss2
You won't have enough
<:SakuraLewd:1004292247203885146>
You hated that I thought
Owolick
<:lewd:959737567119556618>
Licked?..
Yeah that's the way to do
real
what the durandal doin
\
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
you can s et nicknames in hhi3
Just getting logged in
Pri right
Dk is always left
Okay
Or pri
Is this dkey
Then bedge <:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
I can though just need to login
Reset is in 3 1/2 hours
Knew it
Is my guess
Raid
Why
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
isnt kira just hb with controllable stacks
thats true
right
this i agree with though
for me with playing on controller

HS has to press 3 buttons at the same time some rots
hs feels like playing friggin beatmania but with only one finger
buggy yes with the   weapon swap sometimes  but thats workaroundable
not even lol
she is easier than ae though imo
she isnt that easy
if you're doing her cancels and shit
hs is like the second hardest valk mechanically
if dps kinda
s0 trio
im s0 yeah
whale
with the cancels
otherwise yeah just hoo i think
sushang maybe if dps is kinda tricky
yeah
bk was after ae, no?
well
ae was fun
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
tell me about it
cause slower opening for s0
so its automatically -10+ points
just opening
nah
because seele qte
people have the audacity to still complain about crit
the fun part is though
now you just die if no s2 seele
yeah
before you could sneak past higher rank ppl
that sounds right
i find that that hardest trio defenders are the biggest phys haters actually
since 6.4 esp when he whaled 6s trio
but yeah him and a couple other people in sols dont care too much about it
<:02shrug:809888510143496264>
black elemental magic is fine but everyone cries when they see they miss a crit
like most people before hrb dropped
pat doesnt care about phys
yeah vq
id assume vq why
omg our resident dalao
And stat gates that much
I don't like dailies
It seems fine but
~~this is why I paid to do it~~
I just reset raids endlessly for coins and dk mats
Most people
Well
It's how we got ether fuel
M-F
Tactical open on weekdays only
Thanks hoyo
Replaces fischl
Boss specifically made for fischl
No but she should be
One of those vids
<@197871478950068224>
Probably
SS = s2
i noticed, was gonna save for dress
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
oh whoops
<:worryok:696400820652081194>
toooo relatable
<:ppnosp:1139594235138539620>
my new favorite emote i found
oh ruby
real
best i could find
here <:gaycherry:1142832988502106142>
no one know who that shadowheart guy is
yeah someone was bitching about that too in another server
<:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>
But I keep quiet about it since he's central server problem
Blamed dorm and dkeys entire life of account, then when those got fixed, blamed lag, fps, buggy inputs, bad tracking, bugged bosses basically everything except that he's mechanically missing something

Even not correctly doing rots and swearing that he is until you watch the playbacks side by side, and not taking advice because that wouldn't work

This isn't me hating this is just who he is and he's been since I knew him in masters
Tldr on riku is that low population phone game meme
Yep, pretty much
But <:meowzippermouth:380086047981174784>
From the day I met him it's always been like this
Why do you think I always complain
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
*score*?
Kill? Yes
So
and killing with active locks you to - 2-3 points
i keep getting slivered
<:sleepywhale:1120460602947666033>
its hard with 1549 attack
its a cat
achshully
fake teri fan
version update or whatever
literally promote it when it was showcased in 5.7
didnt they like
hekate maxed 4* ss
tm are 45
only one
<@416445660443967491> you see this
sure
no
someone actually just dm'd me about this
ok
do you wanna do it now?
but im out
3 points puts me at t10
772 possible maybe 773 but fuck that
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
imm out
with aladdin mb susan t
its way easier though lol
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
this shit annoying
soon i can play
styx is a literal god
yee
next
by the time hs swaps in the mech should've already spawned
that means you're killing too slow
i use free
so your elf isnt gathering properly or you're using it late would be my yguess
if you dont have enough even after basics, you're not hitting all the mobs
real
15% phys
extra damage
he has an elf i dont
which i cant match
yeah
im gonna try in a couple hours, hopefully can match mimitsu
imagine
<a:dalao:795864124907061369><a:dalao:795864124907061369><a:dalao:795864124907061369>
I respect it
Just like nini
THATS WHERE VELSKUD WENT
<a:WhatBlink:402587805869408266>
i like it a lot too
100$ for a skin is a lot
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
or misremember
i blame aka for misdirection <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
i blame aka then
last year was 6 days too wasnt it
<:TeriHangMe_lum:606740581900746763>
And yeah if you're playing bg3 you're not touching other games for months lol
This has been an amazing year for games
Surprising for a really old series
It blew up
I've heard nothing but good things so far
Like what, baldurs gate or?
Rare
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
<a:aworryGaming:945537650146824242>
You gaming
What the
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
Unless you just barely can't meet a threshold I'd leave them as is personal
Her cycles are vicious every time I look at that server
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
That would be 2nd on na rn lol
I didn't unlock mine so 24h cooldown
I play tomorrow with the proper dupe set
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
i need 772 though
hmmge
i can prob 770 when i get the m dupe tomorrow
9s seele team 795
+10 over 4* dabber and aladdin tb ppm
4* furry elf and susannah t aladdin mb
this is 773
understandable
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
you arent supposed to at this d
neither can i
you already have 750 dont you?
thats basically my rot
it might
idk if you have the dmg
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
thats dupe strats
nvrmind
wait wait
yeah evade > spear > qte in vq
either way i use dabber after hs evade
are you doing the  way i sent you or something slightly different
LOL
i got bored
p1 or p2
which
ss 4* but 4/4 max pri
she's 11/15 so its easy
lumi you can do tp if you want
in er
i'll pay you extra if you level up my mobius too
tet
if possible
i was thinking of how you could've recovered
right
yeah nvrmind you would be fucked any way i can think
no shot gris had enough to do another ult hmm
what was hs sp at
in your ss
however though
try this
no shot you would
if i cant one rot with aladdin
yeah thats right
is it a damage thing or positioning?
susannah t holmes mb?
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
@ ruby wyd
<:sleepywhale:676703084625264640>
okay im happy
<:hmmThinkers:860882439513440256>
seems to be 5
and just do that where you need extra sp
fitting in attacks when you can

for ss you can swap weapon and use basic for +2 sp
no u
idk if the extra pokes for sp is worth
his is s1
cause i cant one rot
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
proven
exactly 10-20 behind s2
maybe 760 but lets wait until tomorrow
not that i've seen
i have to wait until tomorrow
my dupes are locked
im so upset lol
even 9s uses cosmic
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Or you mean just one is gathered
Is she launching them to the moon
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Ty ty<:heart:1083977303299731527>
this lineup has not been good for the s2 rank
so just stick with that for me
9s hs team is only 10-20 points behind s2 seeles
cause im  using hs
you wanna try my acc?
why?
yes
not logging in until 5 est
im off
<@309634550273933314> did i kick you out?
LOL
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
You'll get fair compensation
I haven't even started <a:AA_Nezuko_Run:853217911648550942>
Sure
Define a bit
<a:crydead:869102726716465202>
I thought Eli posted bleed sets earlier
I used to for old blob cap
Haven't needed it with the new Mei set
Yes
Though I think I just get rid of the sp/s
The attack one is vq, I keep that
Both of which have come in handy
I have a .5 sp/s and a 3.07 spcr
Idk which one to reso
I'm actually a clown though I level and affixed 3 Ts
Damn right I do
It doesn't work great on her but seele yeah
If you do not have Aladdin dupes use hs
It seems
So yeah, dupes s2 seele > 3s hs > dupes s0 seele > Other hs
Was curious if ss mattered but doesn't seem to
Yeah ik this
Still lower but wow
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
With holmes
What does SS hrb do
Hrzi got 759

But if you had dupes this would be it

Just do this I suppose
Oh wait no no
Hrb needs dupes too lol


Cause 10-20 points less
You only play hs here if Aladdin dupes and 9s
Hrb is better
ik ik
i didnt say anything bad
what the fuck
Otherwise you're locked into 893
Yeah
based
lol
Help me pls
You guys have cadets?
Real
Apparently there's a wasp nest right outside my apartment window

Nini has caused absolute chaos
Issok though was like a week ago <a:patpat:943375983002677290>
Can't give an answer to a question never asked <a:modCheck:843977786568736789>
It's so refreshing
No excuses with him either
Yeah Kyo amazing
Surely I'm better
All he does is swipe
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>

<a:joealive:840595350121086978>
Either or if s2

<:sleepywhale:1120460602947666033>
i'll go for 760 wed
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
i wanted to +1
okay first try -2 lumi
3s should be like 780
context
LMFAOO
i forgot
oh my god the fucking dragon in the circle
i think she'll have about 4 use cases
and steal aka i'd imagine (though thats not hard)
she gets her own bosses
we're in 6.8
6.1
fragile just finished too
most everyone should have
ik
thinking ahead
because you didnt
*if they farmed her*
thats why i said
ahh'
everyone should be sss by now if they farmed her
where did you miss 4 frags?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
for book
i did stages and dipped
nope
for reward
and reset it
if you pick tactical, you *can* do raid
if you pick raid, you *cannot* do tactical
other way around
yeah that usually means tactical was picked, not sure when it would've happened tho
hare too
how'd you lose to carole
also
ty lumi
unless you reset it
you can still do the raid, you just dont get much rewards from it
re sent inv btw
because mine says this
today's challenge available
you activated tactical
i know the prob
wait
click soul rq
it should say activate now
you're postive you didnt raid earlier?
thats really weird
tactical
did you uh
sure
okay activate now <@197871478950068224>
maybe one sec
unless you did earlier
activate the raid i mean
not unlock
did you
no i know them lol
nos tay we do dkey now
okie
is pri + dkey okay?
sent inv <@197871478950068224>
okay
anyone wanna raid
yeah its possible
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
You'll find a snack
Just look in the mirror
Good job me
Called it LOL
10 minutes
I don't wanna do er though ughh
Not enough to actually want to pay someone <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Can I pay one of you guys to do mine
According to wyv
But yeah what Eli said
Idk why
It's like my most used emote rn
Okay fair
I don't miss old ss ma meta
Damn orange
It's broken keyboards
Yeah
Picasso tm is right there
Real
Sushang, our resident ice valk, needs shui mb?

Ss1 rank is stupid damage for hoh
748 maybe
Oh then nevermind
Wait lumi is your jk sss
From you
I expect no less than 765
That's what akayuki said too
Makes sense
im getting tired of these 5 week patches
he demoted *from* nirv *into* rl
lol
unless ss
trio here is suicidal
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
The desync
never know about that menu
did you
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
the main one that comes to mind is counter:side
we saw lol
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
you're stuck with regret
nono
that think that way
there's actually a *lot* of players surprisingly
idr any specifics
genuine boomer brain, its been like 6 patches
its been so long  im not sure, i thought i remembered bunny could proc it
like jst tm newt b or smth
that was my bigger question than the turg thing lol
wouldnt htr be better suited for it
yikes
it actually takes an eternity
fair, way too new
do they not have turg
is that newt B?
i dont think its a bad idea to jump start the g4 process
but i mean, if there's nothing else in bp they want
f2p set tho
would take 1 year for a full set
right
but isnt lee farmable
arias lee tb thales m was my cope for a long time
arias?
on benares
if anything if you have 2 geared dps you can ignore the third bar
wasnt edison bad anyway
just finish the boss basically
there were old beta vids with kira and hot scoring 47840
you suffer lol
that does *not* mean use my resources
yeah its highkey disrespectful unless someone explicitly gives you permission to fuck with their account
Slack bracket wtf
Never ending bonks
It's so funny when it's out of sync
I did
but still nice
granted that valk will most likely be out of meta
28k for an ss valk is pretty nice
pulling valk plus all the stamps should be enough for ss yeah
if  you dont own the valk
its me
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
there's a banner up
obv not mine but i'm so upset by this lol
<:sleepywhale:1120460602947666033>
No excuses <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
It's even using dabber
But that should work
<@218762069338619906>
Looking for 712
But I assumed so
Carb pls
Hallo
Lemme see what I can find
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I wouldn't sink too much into it
Now it's all adding up, okay
3*?
What about elf
6% fire and -1 line
Oh rip
But how much dmg is missing
Would recommend it
Yep
At s2+
Real
A lot
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
This is why I don't share my hsr pulls
Banned
Something something balanced as everything shouldnbe
Trash game
Hard pitied 3 stigs
161 pulls
S2 and elf
Tbf
<:chickwhip:858276464705536011>
Get farming
231 pulls
Bricked acc
Real
i think this is the highest i've ever been
Damn boomer
Same thing though
I was watching fair's
Then found this

<:sleepywhale:1120460602947666033>
But all that for -1
Or like

so prometheus evades two of ottos attacks, seele attack hits after the first evade but before the second.  TA ult after second evade removes the last layer

you want to evade with seele ASAP for the TF, but you should delay her 3rd normal until later, if you do it too early it won't line up right.  so that's why i evade with seele twice, first for TF, second is cause you need evade to skip to normal 3
Some refs apparently pb hits after prom dodges but that way is consistent above
basically your seele normal 3 has to hit after your TA evades, if you want to do it 100% of the time i would recommend you evade with seele twice before using normal 3 and go to TA since you have to wait for Otto to attack anyways
I figured out what caused sumeru to reduce too finally
Win more elf
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
But I wanna watch shino mald
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
No more stacks
God I forgot
Cause same for this one
Yeah
Weird wording but that's what's happening in the ref
Was he trying to say hs was the dps and hrb supporting
I'm annoyed lol
On fgo
Also apparently 4* dabber can't 888
The annoying thing is the damn startup <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Idk what dabber looks like but I can't imagine any worse than 10 points ish
3*
That's with bunny though
S1 pe s2 hrb seems to be 86x
Looked how he turned out
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Same for tencent
But I haven't been in main cord in 18 months
Tooru was a good player
but idk why im only breaking 1 bar
the dodges are fine
well
i get it now
There's a banner up
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Sp also doesn't matter too much if hrb always gets >100
24% phys dmg to bleeding enemies and 55 starting sp vs 24% unconditional phys dmg and 25 sp
And 24% more phys dmg
Doesn't she have starting sp
Beet m should be fine
But yes they use it
I think you need to watch the vid <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
I'm just guessing I haven't seen any refs
+3 maybe
Uhhh
Oh ma
Depends on the strain
I'll wait to see what copemeo cooks up ig
Surely right
Noway
Yeah he changed his name a while back
Omg it's fragile
Tka
Ohhh
Booo
I hope you're in my bracket
sk still paired with a (3) bio mob, just not as tanky as ninja
the ninja removal made it easier too, but hrb power levels rn are stupid
lol
its called hrb
insanity
on myriad
6 points moves me up 13 spots
its old nirv

4/4 unowned
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
after i get mobi i should try mobi
140 and 150 were *cancer*
130 was ok

kallen was awful
but only reason i finished my valks pre 5.4
i dont <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826> was cancer to set up

nono, this was a thing
weird to me <a:Y_Smh:977594042995068998>
????
oh im just unironically saying she should get *redacted* because its fun to hate on her
why do people hate on characters and then withdraw once they get  called out of it
i learned how to evade lol
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i had 500 hp fighting elysia
and used kalpas 1
im dumb
nono
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
but kalpas uk
idk man seele has died too many times in er
so 24 vs 20
i didnt think she counted
I mathed it wrong
<:AA_Noted:637988261163171840>
Where are you getting 25%
Is it?
?
~~i dont do that on guys~~
I'm trying to avoid bait
You use it for the cd reduction
It is ma lol
No interrupt resist or anything
She has the same thing as hoh
Lol nope

<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
Lol
omega deadge tho
<:sleepywhale:1120460602947666033>
793 now
okay yeah im just bad
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
another waste of time
unless im missing some hidden tech
yeah s0 hrb dps is not it
hallo
yeah there's a bunch
okay time to try hrb dps ig
<:worryBrothers:900213853479124992>
sniped
yeah i told you
who that
?
im gonna get sniped
no no
not for long
old nirv all over again
5th in bracket
74
with 1.4 sp/s
idk if i care to play hrb dps
im at 783 rn with sss hs sss prom
wirth the 4* dabber but <:02shrug:809888510143496264>
and s0 hrb dps can 796
im being told s0 s0 can 793
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
bro
my ref is 770
this is 780
will prob be retiredbtw <:7Csoontm:628344479178424330>
not yet
but issok
lol
i dont
afaik
fragile doesnt even own the valk
actually true
no responsibilities to worry about, so can spend some more
thats where mona's at rn
repeat
sleep
work, spend money
life is fun when 19
well
<a:aworryRun2:601196179878969382>
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
mona's a bigger whale
i wouldnt have gotten 3* pb personally but
well
mona didnt have 4* dabber i think
s2 hrb is cheaper than a 3* elf thats only slightly better than a previous gen 4* elf
thats why people arent recommending this elf, and just to finish your dabber
yeah overall nvrmind
wait no no
overall
so scores arent gonna be *that* far off from each other
btw 4* dabber vs 4* pb is only 3% more dmg
s2 = op is all that matters lol
the higher +10-15 point scores are with pb
the elf is redundant
with 4* pb
yes
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
the s2 on hrb is actually ridiculous
both
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
also found this
+ more personal dmg
+ no stacks or precast
longer duration (23 seconds vs 16 seconds)
the s1 s2 got 840 with 4* dbaber
the s0 s2 got 850 with 4* bunny
you gotta specify elf
its just the s2
s0 s2 got 850 lol
s1 s2 gets 840
800+
yeah <:deadge:975652771082698782>
what a waste of my time
s0 dw sss hs sss prom is better
... gachaplayers
fragile wasnt kidding with the ss hs scores higher on short fights
this scores higher
apparently 770+ with dabber but 0 clue how you have the dmg on mob to do that
s0 s0 is kinda low
*sigh*
?
?
Nah I'm still here lol
Gresham just needs time away

(Read: not using discord as heavy)
That hasn't changed I'd say
Whatever you used to for before ig
<:joethink:839337073592631326>
Basically ping if needed
there is no tea
i'm really not happy with the game rn, im *really* not happy about the 231 pulls, and im getting way busier outside of gacha gaming

anyway, this is my last patch probably reporting it
obv not quitting but distancing from the servers unless needed
Lol
<:TE_Bedge:978706362940944414>

Why is her evasion cd 15s but 15 sp cd 16
Also like
LOL
But idk
That was what Marisa said
Herrscher of Rebirth's initial form is switched to Soul Crafting Form. When initial form is Soul Crafting Form, and HoRB is in Soul Crafting form, when team members attack enemies with Withering Gap, gain [Crit Rate to Crit DMG conversion mode], however the max limit for the conversion of exceeding Crit Rate to Crit DMG is changed to 20%.
But it's not in game anymore actually so idk
Cause ik for her own damage it's 60%
40% or 20% cap
And if so how much
This is cdmg right, cause ss buffs crit rate ratio I believe
<@416445660443967491> you around
That button is holding on for dear life
Time to morb?
Oh, new valk stuff

<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
feels L instead
i was always fine at 60 until someone mentioned you could adjust it
same
like 8 months into the game
i used that and got like 60 before i realized you could adjust it
i could give you my old an acer travelmate
jesus
no wonder
time to pack
sr done
meh scores but idc
<:sleepywhale:1120460602947666033>
okay ma done
so there is some
ie husk
eh, uncapped makes some bosses wonky
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
omg the top players in a low population mobile game are mad at me
but do what you want
some consider it cheating yeah
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
mfw
i asked neffr and he told me to steal the emote lol
what server is that
star rail feels fucking *weird* at 120
though i will say outside of hi3
LOL
<:seelepls:1069254242554093618>
good enough for styx good enough for me
ruby's explained this for the sea perspective
you have to or die
he's right
apparently also pc launcher came with game uncapped and mihoyo cchanged it lol
i agree cap is bs but until mihoyo changes it, meh
and that it doesnt matter yada yada only slight advantage
all the mmo players are coming in saying playing 120 is bs
apparently
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
even styx uncapped

Welcome to the club
I should uninstalled instead
After 231 pulls for s0
Not as good for hare tho <:deadge:975652771082698782>
And general usage I suppose
So good for ft
Ah
Idr
Is she combo?
Just use Elysia if you're considering this <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
fragile just explained what was going on
styx figured it out
probably new engine
if opener if the issue
i posted notes
did you check ref chat
500 for s0 4/4 is aint it
i might go to rl
it si what it is
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
0 time manipulation
she had the same problem vil v did
dw was never alive here
s0 too
47760 with triple supports
<@82358863155703808>
the gear was godawful like that though
s1 was 40 pulls
not same <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
hey same
like 500 bucks with 21 expa 30 focus 22k crystals starting out
nah im over it, just taking the L
thanks game
for s0 4/4
too much is the answer
and trio/sushang fucked me over too
worst luck i've ever had in this game
231 pulls total
161 pulls for 4/4
shit game
Hrb ta and whoever
But I'd be shocked if there isn't
I haven't looked
Or around that
1.4
I'm tilted
Because I spent $300 for s0 2/4
I swiped and didn't get her gear
Agreed
Cause that gives cards
Unless you pull sp valk
Well
Pulling just converts to something, no?
I just save them for whoever
I don't use tokens really
<:terifrownarms:960001216107147345>
Who's laughing now
Y'all laughed at me when I said I was farming valks
And ss dbj
Is ss2 wd
I think my only non SSS, that said
Actual kraken
Yeye
I get the sentiment though
But it's the gambling nature, so can't be mad at it
I would argue it matters more when using wallet, because you're paying for a product you don't have a chance of receiving
But every so often tm is used in SS ma
It's very rarely used in abyss
Let me rephrase that
Do you care more about a 31946 every so often or about getting a brand new ignite dps who'll last longer than that stig
How much do you care about ss ma
And I don't really care anymore
I'm traveling this weekend
I saw
I'm actually really pissed
I think I drop to rl
jk
I'm banning you
Which is okay
70 of that was the valk
In not even mad about the valk, just the gear
2/4 s0
178
Still kinda pissed
I'm gonna finish hrb later ig
Non vil problems <:sleepywhale:1120460602947666033>
Ic
Your hot doesn't exist either right
Idk if that can 946
Ah
You don't have spa right
nah fr
178 for s0 2/4 so far
how my pulls are going
valk at 70 gear 108 so far
im getting fucked
yes
i've maxed the spending and im at s0 2/4
great gamae
but hrb fixes the crit issue
just crit maldy like every other non susannah phys valk
she was fine before hrb
i hate this game
if anything she's ascended
and the new herrscher guarantees her crits on largely every hit
she's absolutely fine at s0 lol
even played her??
have you
why
yes
wild
meanwhile
i feel like some would ask for rent or smth instead
expected though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
nice nice
me, who hasnt had to pay since covid:
idk why its still around
too long ago
it was a farmer thing <:deadge:975652771082698782> from like
and said we'll put it toward next month
hoodwinked your money
vs before when they just
so you can actually pay toward principal now i think
if you pay on time
cause that was the interest doesnt accumulate one
the second piece, not the first
i think the student loan one was pretty impactful lol
but who knows if that bill actually passes
its supposed to be coming to an end
slackers got punished
and maintainence and stuff
because abyss closed an hour earlier
i only remember  because people were *TILTED* when daylight savings hit
but idr
the 12-6
2 versions ago was daylight savings
i feel like 3 versions ago it was 11-5
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
so this is a lie then
12am-6am?
isnt it 6 hours
<:02shrug:809888510143496264>
Fair
To move
Toove it
Cause you don't need to reinstall
Are you on pc
<:peeka:1058877271420715118>
you can uninstall without being dramatic every day about it?
thats just a base really
we're -10D
I usually skip to end if ranks aren't in beginning
its literally in the vid
10*
13D higher
there's actually a lot of dmg because this ref is like
and more team/sp buffs
im using this tho
not for ss kira, no

idr how you get to it though, but it was there
something in cs records pulls up to 6 months

for me immediately
just reset and pray, but usually works for me first time
i was oone of them then a friend baited me
a lot of people didnt wanna learn the dodges lol
and most can just use mei stigs, which was dirt cheap
most have ss hs by now
most have sss by now
its vq
they all will be i think
the slight delay?
when griseo is attacking blob
in radicre's vid i shared, notice at the end
like blob for example
my lines are mid lol
1549
i always assumed yes, but varies with hitlag (kevin, blob)
i'd rather that though, cause at least i know i can improve
yeahh <:deadge:975652771082698782>
or a combo aa combo aa combo a combo
i think the a combo aa combo a combo aa combo is the fastest
he was malding the 744
twins
someone called him out before lol
but he does shit like this
no no, you're not
like lowkey the most annoying player i've ever met
because he inherently blames everything but himself
just the riku mention pisses me off
no it was
i ever understood why people made a big deal of it
and 2% damage is supposed to make up for that?
dorm wasnt the reason he was 1% away
just be better
riku complains too fucking much
yea
what is this ost choice
wait shino in his iriya days

Now you don't even have to watch
For the ELF, I think the direction they took with it is a lot better than before. It's not that much better Blade Durandal and mostly comes with some quality of life improvements. Its team buffs last longer and the debuff applies immediately upon casting the ultimate, unlike Blade Durandal who has to stack it up first. Both of these are not really a huge deal when you're minmaxing runs but it's definitely nice. In terms of performance numbers (5 runs in the dps test mode, averaged and corrected for crit inconsistencies):
1. 4★ Project Bunny - 100%
2. 3★ Project Bunny - 97.5%
3. 4★ Blade Durandal - 97.2%

Not a huge difference as you can see. 3★ Blade Durandal would be around 96% but its cooldown is 13 seconds longer. This might matter but it's also possible that it doesn't have a huge impact (or none at all in some cases). I think this ELF is only worth pulling in exactly 2 scenarios:
1. You care about top Myriad rankings and can get the most out of that ~3% increase.
2. You are a newer player that has no Physical ELF yet, you are ok with spending a little more on this game and you don't want to wait for spending events to rank up Blade Durandal. 

For everyone else, I think it's much more efficient to skip this one and rank up Blade Durandal to 3★ or 4★ from spending events.
Also for elf more essay
This is from his notes lol
extremely difficult to avoid picking up SP packs sometimes. This is extremely frustrating to play around because it makes such a big difference.

Considering the 2nd point, it might not be the worst thing to skip this character if you're a Redlotus player or only care about Nirvana retains (and not Myriad). You will definitely be fine to keep using Herrscher of Sentience instead.

The 1st and 3rd point pretty much completely nullify the removal of resetting for crits and the last issue is most pronounced on the fights where an SP pack drops directly where enemies spawn. In the Aponia run I showed a way to drag the boss away from the SP pack to delay picking it up. This is also possible on the Otto Apocalypse fight by using the ELF ult in a clever way to drag Otto away from the SP pack as soon as he spawns. This raises the score by 13~14 points, but I honestly just didn't have it in me to spend that amount of time on it. Any boss that drops SP packs at certain HP thresholds will cause an issue with this as well.
Now for the new character, Herrscher of Rebirth. There's a lot of problems, really big ones. 
1. She has no interrupt resistance. You can get interrupted during that sequence you see me doing at the start of each run, as well as right after her QTE. This introduces a lot of new reset points, as it completely screws over the SP regen.
2. Her startup is extremely slow, this sometimes makes her not beat Herrscher of Sentience in lower disturbance ranges, including this beta. All of these scores with Herrscher of Rebirth are lower than what I got with Herrscher of Sentience instead. This should be the case until around 470-480 disturbance, where the higher damage will compensate for the slow startup. This slow startup is no longer there with the S2 skill, you can probably figure out why.
3. The way her SP regen works makes it very bad to pick up SP packs too early. Certain moves in her kit set her SP to a certain value if she's below it. Her evasion will set her to 100 SP if she's below that for example. So evading and then picking up an SP pack will leave you at 115 SP, the other way around results in 100 SP. This is a massive deal and can save up to 15 points on the abyss clock. However, it's extremely difficult to avoid picking up SP packs sometimes. This is extremely frustrating to play around beca
And the fucking sp pack problem
It's just the opener sequence from everything I'm seeing
Something something correction
Cheap patch
To 4* dabber
I don't have to pull the elf either, seems roughly equal at 3*
So I'm deadge
I'm committed to s0 gaming
Lol
The club
Join
Lol
Yes
That's all
Nope, keep attacking until you get enough sp/reach a breakpoint/buffs run out
Once pink your attacks recover sp
You keep shooting to get the bar to pink, this is called climax approaching state
u can read from here but  tldr making 3D mihoyo porn while being in China
saw it yee
ty
just project bunny?
whats the localized name of the 6.8 elf
<@416445660443967491> you around
i like it
<:5thumbsupcow:959437796416815135>
Yeah I think sp
Okay so nothing really from active
Shit bot
<@434737143395516416> w domain of genesis
<:deadge:975652771082698782> rip
Can you ss the pri effect btw
Is there?
You're thinking of incandescent
That's hof
Domain of what
What is hfi 's pri called  again
SP id assume
Purana turg is *okay*
But my money is on cn
Neither are really used heavily
Lol
Nothing important
or forced qte or whatever
3* has the switch cd yeah
arent trials usually good enough for max
mei makes it so much easier
yes
crying
7
there's like
you want to roll for the fastest opener
are you trying for 904
Jk
Okay whale
Take me home
God rl is easy
Only reason I can ss mobi is cause I have 10 frags already somehow
Need starting frags
Yeah <:deadge:975652771082698782>
or take the -20 points and just combo at the end
either figure out a way to get extra sp throughout the fight
and the hitlag is *cancer*
you need 4 ults
yeah
for this fight
I still can't believe he 671
~670 if you're a monster
~650 if you know what to do
Pretty sure tenma is s0
Yes
Damage basically
Before you call me out <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Though for vil v, I liked her
Why am I paying to play the game lol
Damage you can make up a bit
Sp is nigh impossible
If the valk needs a rank to fix a major issue it doesn't deserve my money to rank
But I'm long time removed from ranks
No lol
You think I can afford ranks?
Why is s0 trio hard to believe?
Kyo made a ref on my acc and it was the maldest thing you'll ever do
Bad
Bad value
The mini spendings are just
But yeah cny and anni are the big spendings
~~if you scrolled down a bit I corrected~~
What is this
At least bili only asks you to sign up
Yeah
Though I think it's just spending events in general

ok wait maybe that's actually normal

5.7 spending event
2800 xtals = 40 tokens
70 xtals per token
12 tokens per frag
840 xtals per frag

so some spending events are not worth
6.1 spending event
2800 xtals = 100 tokens
28 xtals per token
20 tokens for ELF box (2 frags) = 10 tokens per frag
280 xtals = 1 ELF frag

6.4 spending event
2800 xtals = 30 tokens
93.333 xtals per token
6 tokens for ELF box (2 frags) = 3 tokens per frag
280 xtals = 1 ELF frag

6.8 spending event
2800 xtals = 70 tokens
40 xtals per token
40 tokens for ELF box (2 frags) = 20 tokens per frag (wtf???)
800 xtals = 1 ELF frag

2.857x more expensive
Apparently spending is more expensive now
So then I could see the bundles making up the difference
You pulled the skin too what
That looks about right
SS(?) Trio, Aladdin and a dupe, prom (kinda free) and kira
you mean like every character after a herrscher lol
yee
i dont even got myself
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
since its the exact same as valk
some people say 66
in which case, carry on
unless you love the char
s2 with no elf will always lose to s0 with elf usually
generally, no
<:WEIRDCHAMP:974474932299915366>
s2 a valk before getting the elf is kinda
its like 66 on average for valk, 92 for gear
probably not
unless you get really lucky
my trio is still s0
^
<a:whalepat:899061677583122432>
I malded for 3 hours and said forget this lol
I'm glad it's over <:tericross:902580093304586320>
s and ss trio is tying if not eclipsing said characters *on their own bosses*
sss trio idc, thats expected of any sss character
but s and ss should not be able to do that
and even then
trio set a bad precedent
why bother when 1 team can do 99% of all content
the most dominant team in the game should die when its time
good
Just use fragile's from last time
(jjk reference)
So is miwa but we love her anyway

s0
never thought i'd see the day
i liked his amnesia playthroughs
like look how young he is
god i feel old
ryan higa i still liked then too, but he's stayed consistent
feels like he changed a lot
i liked markiplier before he got 1 mil subs
i was big into roosterteeth lol
i dont think i saw markipliers
at the time i liked brownman
yeah highly recommend
saw and scream were always on tv
yeah that sounds right <:ohno:959752132905566261>
me neither
gore and trafficking/abuse hit way too close to home for me
i guess desensitization?
if you watched any of those
literally in the name
there are like 5 movies with that
okay see but tbf
hard to watch
anything with that is always just
that was brutal yeah
i watched like 3 lets plays
my favorite game at the time
but the embed lets me watch it
i have to sign in on yt

black mirror
thats a pretty good boost
ye
LOL
but still tied me
you sunk it
save it so you can qte sushang in faster
i think on the hoh charges
you dont need your elf there
okay so
before swapping to kira
can also qte in sushang for more dmg
you snipe twice
evade > tap basic a couple times > evade again > snipe
the first black bar
you dont need 2 snipes there
also like
after 5x bars
ely dives
wait until like
you're using kira too soon
ahh
oh have you not done this
this is why i dont backread

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im maxed dorms now\
but also your attack is way higher so that could actually be it
every time i watch you play
you straight up outdamage me
hoh ss1 > jk sss  (~~fake~~)
and this is missing m
its the same score lol
i dont see beyond 794 possible

time to copy fair ig
and the full -10 here i ult at 807
and -2 overall until this point
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
im -6 this
this is kira ult after breaking the big hp bar
but he breaks the bar in one charged
fair's is faster
not much deviation this round
this is the same rot i did lol, but slightly different
i copied mine from bili 499D
there's like
since ss1
you might lumi
im  like -4 points overall but i dont think i have damage
why does ely just stand there after ult
so uh
yes
man now im hungry <a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
idr
i havent been in like
unless im craving something crispy
thats what i do nowadays <:sleepywhale:1120460602947666033>
chicken and lamb you're in for a fight
fries is fine
depends what you're doing
also like
the basket i mean
but it can be timely scrubbing it down/soaking etc
its not super greasy either
if you clean it every time you use it its never bad
so like
cleaned my air fryer
lowkey same <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
LOL
so its been grubhub every other day
cause i havent felt like shopping with all the rain
i dont even wanna look at mine
it adds up

and whaling on kbbq and stuffs
i wanna get back to thinking $100 for a aaa game with a season pass was expensive
and im 90% sure my gacha foray begins and ends with hoyo
if im playing a gacha i'd rather start within 2-3 months of launch <:deadge:975652771082698782>
i didnt bother playing past the tutorial
well
but i've never touched it <:02shrug:809888510143496264>
peaks at 17
12? 13?
its a slog until like
i heard others say that yeah
but no <a:SMH:1021112056063213648>
and i dont like seeing the polygons every time i open the game
i wanted to but its too grey for me
playing 3 gachas haha
is your kira sss
just as free
486 i think
I do actually
But obv rare
And the s ranks bricked their rotation
Because they were doing htr dps on husk with a rank kira
If it costs you -30 points 
I remember a friend mentioning this
Envoy
Just to disable it
Idk it's better for some rotations I've seen
Iirc
You can turn that off
Also
Technically yes
Is that why all valks don't wear pants
Congrats carv
Whale
lol gs
chakram
though if i had to guess
qua to spite you
they arent doing the sd/fr thing again
its gonna be a farmable in 6.9 lol
you want 4 sp valks in 5 patches?
cute
You did it
Omg
<:worryPopcorn:411066690021883915>
Poor Eli man

That's exactly why it was funny
I did
That was so funny
Wtf
Did you end up getting mcc
And I remembered I could just export my PS4 saves onto pc
I wasn't leaving until I killed it
But like
Yes
It's not a hard fight mechanically
Why the fuck does a horse have a shoulder charge

most people dont notice it until you get stuff like heph or aponia or etc etc shill boss
yep, correct
but the powercreep thing i dont agree lol
which i agree
yeah they mean every valk this patch feels shit
my response, then there's, then mine
in regards to finality in er
update on s0 life
i think this was a cn whale that came to na
look at the uid
the repel wont line up
now that the faster Mei combo has been removed
all low rank rots have been bricked
im *doomed* for kevin too
disturbamce too high to kill in 3 ults anymore
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

Omg lol
<:worryExit:783190311987970118>
Can't do that with pb
Cause you sometimes need to pre cast dabber
Yee
If I could I'd swipe for SS aponia ngl <:deadge:975652771082698782>
If already 4*
Elf is a marginal upgrade for dabber at 4* only
No
If you're going ss it isn't for support lol

this boss is trio food now
just trio it
<a:TE_modCheck:797886575635202069>
i dont kill
okay tested
for me it just opens the link
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
we both got tilted too
actually same LOL
well
with phys it is that too, if you mistime impair
at high level anyway
with every other element you gotta read elf/stig/valk skills to see what went wrong  timing wise
with crits you just hope numbers turn gold
its exactly that yeah
always slivered
but i felt like that using trio on parvati
crits bad tho
idk if it'll kill if i skip active
thats what i did
and idk if that kills so i used my active
well
1.3 really
i still have 1.5 green bars
and here you just straight up have more damage
but im slower here
by 2 points
im faster than you here
im out
complaining works
okay i couple more and im done with this cycle
this is tilting
i cant get past 783
this is ss
i cant imagine s kira coag
for me anyway
its a pita to mald on lol
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
like its near the clone
i also dont understand why im not breaking the bar sometimes
i hate ice
okay turning off damage numbers
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
this is the most annoyed i've been in a while
ridiculously punishing
like
this boss is ridiculous lol
first run finished 780
why is this so much more annoying than para husk
bro my fucking ely died
but im not getting the break
it is
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
im doing that
When P1's HP is nearly ended, you switch to Kira and use her charged when the clock is near the clone so that your charged shot can kill the clock and also damage some of the clone's black HP.
like i havent finished a run yet
this is *annoying*
okay nvrmind
its just the hp coagulation
okay this isnt bad
cut(cope)meo
onemorebox
im not gonna mald this
nah im good
you used cope's ref, gotcha
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

Well
Shirai owns it
That's an armada

92 for gear (non sp) 56 ish for valk
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah
wep > activve > repeat > next floor
also last patch was the easiest er clears of my life
i like her animations and the boulder sfx
aesthetically she's nice
with crit emblem i felt like lower lows and higher highs
lower highs and higher lows
myriad damage felt more consistent too
fuck sp packs
but i used myriad
yes
so like
it assumes you wont crit LOL
i didnt do the second one but



do you need a ref or just wana play around
oh yeah
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
do whatever you want really
just dont brick my stigs <:deadge:975652771082698782>
sent
but in exchange for greater player engagement its fine
i think that competitive aspect of it (ie lower ranks edging out higher ranks) will die off
who wants to spend more time rolling crits
phys was the easiest cycles imo because it was just
yeah, exactly
without reading
with elemental, if your damage varies, you have no clue sometimes
at least with phys you know its just crit more
the crit rate buff with hrb is going to be amazing for everyone though
phys is fine in its current state imo, just people got too lazy after being spoiled by all the elemental stuff last year covered
there's just too much variance in her runs
6.8 she'll be way better though
aponia/vil added more, as much as people hated them
but i cant say she's a good release
i think she's good at what she does
without having to mald paragon stacks
her power  level is around ss2 bke
i think right now
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
up to you im done malding
you wanna try hare?
fireworks tm cez b
it is
<:worrySit:667144191192727592>
look at my parv rot
in iriya's testing too
is the best for hare
bianka tm ely b
no
im kinda betting that hrb makes her better
stigs do absolutely nothing for her
but iriya was right
which was exactly what i needed
cause i got wep and a dupe bianka M in 30
though i do regret going past wep
not at all
far and away the most infuriating valk i've ever playd
yep!
though if you mean if this is the first cycle im using her
<:NadeSnicker:413907801799131136>
nope!
but yeah i pulled the last day of banner
so i never lied
i never said yes or no lol
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
notice my non answe
wtf are these
i saw better hoo refs than i saw hot refs ngl
could do hoo if you wanted / had the ranks for it
but yeah aponia and its not even close > hot for retains
i feel like the only other paralyze valk in the game would be sufficient enough to answer that question
i mean like
were you around when aponia dropped lol
?
@ tet
<:FuHuaSmug:1061942437435670579>
easily the best valk in the game (at that time anyway)
tl;dr though ^
- Augment of Valkyrie Accipiter. Read more: .
- As DPS, needs as high Core lv as possible.
- As support, Core lv doesn't matter, but aim for at least Core 3 (S-rank). Used as support on MA Heimdall.
- UE A B A B => highest damage Combo loop for bosses, enjoying the effects of Riposte and Zhangheng.
- A A A B B => zig-zag move, used with Paralyze set (Fuxi M Cleo B) for mobs.
- UE B-hold => highest damage Ultimate, enjoying the effects of Riposte and Zhangheng.
- A A A B B B-hold => Ultimate without having to UE, generally only used if cannot UE because there is no Riposte.
depending on what game mode you're doing
there's a couple different ways
die

You need to do story forbit
Lol
everything else is so much worse
this
in all honesty, triple supports is second best
you dont
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
kira
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
not that much more work
havent really needed instant replay/shadowplay/etc
what i do is just play in blocks and record while im playing
i like obs better
nah
i really should record again
idk where i saved time
i was ~738
i never got 742 again LOL
dude
idk why they stopped doing guides


nowaying
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
good luck
ew
those stigs if you have them are next best
cherry
so like normal
i see
is jizo's weather changing or something
bianka tm elysia b
you're in rl its fine
everything else is a joke
triple supports barely 400
s0 hare s hs ss prom can at least 600
what i *can* tell you rn its hare or die
i have no clue her current power level
i stopped looking at betas
~~that everyone forgets exist~~
there's a ref in thread
bad
i dont own aponia
no
why the fuck
bruh
<:nokek:1014211961292083240><:nokek:1014211961292083240><:jerry:960001749693915186>
i dont think it wont be fun or different or a way to switch things up i mean that i dont think much will change overall
though you can also prob use sn
<:terifrownarms:960001216107147345>
use the non augment of mc
i dont see much changing
you can retain phys with white comet in rl already lol
i mean
every patch is the same with a new ~~valk~~ skin slapped over it
~~it really wont~~
Next time
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Ah
947 is ideal
?
So on the first kira ult I'm 975-976
My goal is to be before 982
you could be 10 points higher overall if you tightented up but nice job overall
you should be 5-7 points higher here
you lost a lot of time in transition
Why are you still malding
Not try in rl too
You could just
Why are you promoting into aponia boss
So uh
bad
everything else is just
s0 hare is ~670s
 ss hs 3* elf
 sss hs 4* elf
yeah just 18k and sleep
idk how griseo does
yes prom hs and carole
just -2% ice
everything else is maxed
not maxed ice yet
730-755 is a good enough range
lol
lumi dalao
if you go too fast you miss the crab
yes lol
google cloud i think articles saw
<a:kiano:1073951389597827072>
<a:bcaMoney7Rich3:592612554082353173>
LOL
Okay gotcha
Ohhh
Weather change?
Idk how either do at this Disturbance <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
Close enough to vil, at least at the time
Qua whale and couatl she's still great
At least until they run a non kosma/tony boss again
Nyx
<:norry:492341241695043594>

why do i need an account to sort comments when old reddit is fine
its so annoying lol
yeah not on old.reddit.com
for me like all of them are collapsed by default
yeah
i was wondering why reddit was doing that
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>

seemed a bit low so ty
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
cutmeo said cap was 648 too
lol
but i dont trust that i can kill with one active so moot point anyway
the way he did it he doesnt need sp/s though
bricked
he's got 15 attack on me
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
ssg shino
<:cope:779911755983093780>
aat least transition doesnt crash your game anymore
agree though i dont wanna play keep the dragon in the circle anymore
i forgot about rgb
dude
12% yep
one sec lemme login
definitely
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
though i prefer mobs tbh over 
'use the t0 option or you cant play the game
and aponia
like the new sk
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
how would they kill old valks otherwise
but lumi
and the crab jumping is *still* a problem
its 2023
i bet it is LOL
just have to adjust timings slightly
752 feels better
the 752 not the 740
the run i used is in ref thread <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
meme still needs ss
everything else is
im not max ice
same
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
-8 points
i did not and opted for wa > ult
he had confidence in his ult killing
rip
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
if he scored 10 higher with the same loadout
toma has more attack than me
<:AA_Kokomi_Sleep:1110545945248137328>
im done this cycle
LOL
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
<:worrykms:398047795732545536>
the initial one on spawn is fine
the one when he transforms is just
fucking behind him
so tilting
dude
not counting aw/al valks
my only farmable non sss are wd gm (miko) and dj
i think my valkss are at boomer status now
<a:kiano:1073951389597827072>
<:sleepywhale:1120460602947666033>
-10 points from ref with weaker hh, weaker kira and -2D
im satisfied
okay
banned
no
i didnt realize how much was rank locked
i do yeah
kira
i needed an spcr line to compensate for that
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
that explains my missing sp
i didnt know this
okay
only -2 or 3 from cap
nice rolls though
okay you're banned
the 50 missing attack explains a lot LOL
max attack
shafted
arent you 1600 attack mpe
whale wtf
attack line T stig
1538 with all attack
1521
no
the 740 i feel is weaker
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
which requires an sp/s line on hh to compensate
both use 4 elf but the one i copied uses sss kira
i posted both refs in the ref thread
yesterday
lumi's better than me damn
what the
i havent pulled since 6.5
yeah ss
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
w.e i sleep
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
consistently
im getting pixeled
i didnt need the sp/s
i really really wish
i have a dupe t
lol no
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
i need a  fucking sp/s line for my run on hh
dude
it is
and yes
why do you ask btw
but ~776
maybe 78x
77x
nah nah
or smth silly
also has +1 crt
so naturally the days are less
because myriad is harder to retain
It's different from myriad
Frags
60 sp valk pulls got 30/100 ss0
69 gear got me wep+tmmbb
Okay I have good luck again
Bp frags/stamps/card
130 / 260 over the course of two patches
In tutorial
Pretty sure trio atf buffs counted down too
Try an actual encounter
They did that for all valks
S0 hh is better *if* 3S Kira
Or dps htr
Triple supports actually does better lol
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
elemental doesnt crit
correct
its less in practice <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
15%
nono, 15%
10%
granted this is s1 but
w/out dkey and emblem right?
lemme see
oh
there's a formula somewhere
idk the math <a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
still AWFUL
after griseo
AWFUL
before griseo
Haven't looked since v2
I haven't checked any refs or anything
Idr fully
And she can just snipe it
It's one barrel now iirc
In 5.1
Lol
It ran once
They changed the barrels
Ice rpc is probably 6.7
Probably
That's hh food now
I don't
Hard to mald
Easy to score
Like all vq bosses
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
But as bleed instead
It came back
LOL
Where the fuck is couatl
Yo
Actually
Lemme dust off vil
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
Where qua bosses
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>

Or drac
I used paga m I think
<:OMEGALUL:827381886787518464>
I'm wishing well that m whenever it cones
TTTTMBB
I got fucked
Nope
I don't even have a dupe m
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
Though idk if you can do that here
Just tapping basic on hs I mean for +2 sp
You're short on sp
You can swords instead of spear too I think that animation is faster
On hs
I'd say pokes
Idk why
Before live you did
It looks like 4 attack 1 spcr?
What affixes are on kira 3:17
Ruby
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
eli's back
wtf
unless you got a .4+ sp/s line
most of the power comes from the elf, and you have no sp
not good
s0 hoh is like
maybe hoh was a one time thing <:Copium:875793728055418942>
i really hope not
but either way is still slow <:deadge:975652771082698782>
unless you do the third weapon every time or finagle it somehow like kyo did on kevin for the 4th
you only get 3 ults max
there's just not enough sp for these fights at this d
<:dead:959684324179996722>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
if i could've figured out 6 more points i'd be myriad too
im surprised i snuck in with s0 htr
<:AyakaSweat:809679718496075777>
you already have 56
100 frags for 3* 150 for 4*
Lol
Yeah 9
sss hs doesnt need to
you use chains before spear for sp
okay yeah 888
this was the old run
actually idk
prob 872
Highest ever was like 27k
It was at lowest 2 cycles ago
not a big deal if you're there already
eh, at some point you care less about profit and more making the counter go up
my brackets kinda fucked too 
sleepy cycle
but ss2
same LOL
honestly
yes he is LOL
dead on bracket generation
its joever
you got lemon too
bro you cut it off
oh wait
and maybe ellie/snake eyes
ice jdr and beefy
i wouldnt worry about it
and a couple others
abyss only styx really
pretty dominant in ma
lumina has most of the 9s whales
thats eli yeah
Needed it lol yeah
Afaik
Yeah
No SSS gets 5
SSS gets 6 sp on active
It's lower than average I think
<a:dalao:1110262708282069113>
Gj lumi
last one was armada maze one
and yeah its been a very long time since the community has done an evennt like this
so you can see areas to improve
eh, good to have a reference
<:MemUwU:1099797295781912626>
i will when you make one
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
ganbare catalo
should be just barely
tf is that sp
pe had enuff to ult p2 without giving a fuck about the projectiles
Lot of interesting people
I liked chatting in genshin
LOL
Good example specifically
Si qte > vq qte > vq charge should do it
Or with everything on low
Have you ever played without dmg numbers
Put lowest settings
Figured it out
<:sleepywhale:1120460602947666033>
780 5 hours later
753 first try
I'm done for tonight though lol
He said he'd keep trying
Yeah very talented player
But not a whale no
Very low spender
He's not
Full of shit lol
Proceeds to drop over 2k in hsr
game too expensive
They burned out pretty hard
Lol
Clicky
9s tambou 946  doom
lol
you may be right
that isnt 120
i can count the pixels but
its slightly faster than it should be
yeah
are you standing next to a turret
right about there
at the very end
i have no clue how he switches si that fast
i watched this
you know
i had to chip at the boss
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
ss prob 750's though there's just no damage
where's huodou
<:FelisOk:1047083219587182682>
but ik how to evade now
such a finicky boss
you cant trigger tf either
yeah it is
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
im good
tied me lol
this is t2 rn
780 is possible
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

<a:kuruswipe:1120357172518322228>
Die
I shouldn't have started late
Wtf
prob wotan
instead of buying like 2 figs
i should've all in'd on the fish
the figures were a SCAM
you might barely make it
that score is still t50 somehow
also i take back 646 myriad cutoff
i didnt realize how much it was

I need to quote those
Also this gem
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
You should know the answer
If you have to ask
iirc
but yeah better to forge stigs then reso
you can buy the affix mats
i mean from asterite shop
idk the conveersion but the old way should be better still
100 per 500 asterite
you pay 140k for 100 mats
i literally did nothing

its the same run as the first one, just at higher disturbance
anything important like dmg breakpoints maybe
aka got 827
actually this seems right
cause we're around this temp -ish
well
this was 487
this is what i expect for non cn server
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
this guy wrote a fucking dissertation
gotta move these links
oh i forgot
<:Sweats:959781948274909244>
or s1 pe for a maldy 770
do i want to play s0 trio for easy 700
man
lead scum wtf
yee ik
like this one
and i understand none of it
all of these runs have hw
yee
na opens in like 6 hours
aka was saying after dw he's wont complain about pe again LOL
ty all
yeah that sounds right
>PE QTE no crit and even charge attack no crit
ik what the stigs/valk + ranks are but idk affix or anything
can someone tl for me?
pro tip btw epi
~3-5k
i feel like carole contribtued a good chunk of dmg for me
the guy under me
the valks arent
the score is bad
well
bad
it was 407 this morning
this guy has been chasing me for hours damn
LOL
  s2 pe ss prom ss hs
 6s trio
伪神奥托
on bili look for this
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Have fun keilao
Rip
From what I gather it feels like they're trolling
ik this is in jest but still lol
that reminds me actually
wild shit
that was ridiculous
these last 2 minutes have been a marathon
what is going on
yo ruby
i can see it
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
the damn polygons
visually yeah
both cn/jp imo
yeah her voice actor is really soothing
i thought that was pgr LOL
i legit had to do a double take
is that aether gazer?
<a:downbadhic:1008015831722102854>
.im Xiao Lin
that was nice
even 2 years later
that meta units dont really fall out of meta there
i will say though
like e7 or smth
cause its a pvp gacha
even if cheaper
acc upkeep is harsh
counter;side was fun with cute girls but
yes
not my type of gacha
no no
ohh
no more gachas though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
this and the train game
yeah, i'm still in honkai hell
afaik
and strongest acc too
right now he's the biggest whale there
cause he got to far involved in a new gacha
then by that point he barely logged in
yeahh
maybe 6.1
back in like 6.0
nah, he retired to coomerside
ty candibandi for making me backread through karto's messages
this one is pretty funny looking back
yeah <:deadge:975652771082698782>
i have something even better
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
~~literally scroll down~~
i didnt pay much attention i lost interest in v1
it seemed like kira was being designed to force pardo out in v3 right
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
they're all coming 6.7
i need them for lvl 60
ty
can i have a small loan of 5 million star rail credits
eli
its insanity
to re-affirm dominance with the shill valk the boss was designed for
<:worrykms:398047795732545536>
the crit variance throughout a long run is
the mobs are cancer
at least fgo is next
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
gj carv
Oh god i forgot LOL
He's been doing this for years
Coffee had a glossary LOL
I don't mind it i just don't know if it makes sense
That's fair
Yes better support too
Ht was cause time fracture
Vil wasn't even the top score
If you remember when sss kosma dropped
Lack of time fracture
And retconned it
This man wrote his own lore
I have no clue anymore LOL
But she suffers from what people clowned vil for
Base S with SSS hs SSS prom scores over 700
Abyss she's fine yeah
Yeah
It's bs
SSS has that though
Why does base s score around the same as triple supports
She has no time fracture her *entire* DPS phase
Hare s1 for him
Demand isn't there imo
All of 7 people here still play
I don't think it makes sense to separate memorial and abyss into two different channels
Time fracture
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
She has no timestop
Though hare literally only exists to do well here in abyss
Iriya has 1/4 too and made myriad i think
Channel thread same deal info is available if you look for it
It's a thread that was made for questions
~~check the ref channel~~
<:worrywokearms:885296664955478026>
You don't get to complain
You own hare
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
not a soul has played yet
if its reverse sweep they gonna be gassed against a fresh nuggets team
it feels like heat arent even trying to claw out of this hole
<@180679257851166721> yeah you might be onto something
?
3rd decides it
we see
<:anakinhic:943087643070189579>
and i dont trust them to play 4 straight good enough games
its too deep of a hole though to climb out of
its over
celtics remembered they were the 2 seed
they let them get hot
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<:monke:894386711071719484>
Watching ref =/ good score cause you don't know why the ref is doing what it's doing i admit
Monkey see monkey do isn't always the case
Nope
Or in rl, anyone you want per usual
The next highest is prom/hs/si or sns
Unironically
Your tears
~~i posted a million rots/ranks on the ref channel the knowledge is there~~
You can't do anything
Doesn't help that for the first 5 seconds
Aponia by far is the hardest boss in recent memory yes
Or 47 even
Surely you can 47.2?
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
Sureky
It's what I'm shooting for
Maybe 47.5
47488
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
heat in 5 instead
the brooms put away
they're making it a game ruby

im not excited for beneres
this boss is very rot locked
though tbh
not optimized
no
disturbance matters a *lot*
and yes esp on shield bosses
do one of these
the 2nd one is ss0s ss0


you're ss right
lol
oshi no ko
And ty

Ohh i see
Weirdge
They haven't chatted in any servers since April
With your fam, did that improve at all
Any luck ruby
Oh that reminds me
No waiting for someone to finish a set
In abd out
I like non crowded gyms
I mean when i used to go out was like 5:00 am before work
So not really
No no they're good prob
Just tight financial struggles
So prob quit
I remember now though, they have no internet for a qhile
No no i haven't seen in a while
Kith
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Idek what happened to that kid
Hos sp isn't bad but the char is hard for a lot of people
Otherwise you run out of sp by the 3rd (4th if S2+) ult, yep
This is what happens when the game plays itself
Idr 100% though
I think that was for cross play on the PS4 at the time
Higher fps fixes this unironically
Like ~140-150
Ty
It's the imgur link
Just woke up but it's in there
I mean for training mode
Yeah that's fine
<a:kms:639428905400401930>
This is higher than s0 trio?!!
Wait
For the trio
And s0 was 47760
I think 6S cap is 824
Use mine
Hard to copy hw
Idk what cap is anymore since literally no one has consistent ranks
?
<@148145559897636865> <@180679257851166721>
She plays rock paper scissors with them lol
No worries
Ah
Isn't this parks and rec
Why would you
ig the logic is high powered supports balance out the temp changes
We went up almost every cycle LOL
Honestly looking back in sowolstice
When the new supports got released
You use senpri if you don't need the sp from cosmic yeah
I wonder why
<:peeka:1058877271420715118>
But our rl didn't
I'm surprised that our nirv shot way up
And didn't claw your eyes out
If you know
What were stages in cn
Wait ruby
Since iirc this is benny
I think for the stages this time
It feels thick
480s is hell keilo
Than they ever were with pe
With trio
The img stages are way easier now
It's a nice vacation
My b on wording
Ic ic
Ahh
For obvious reasons
So we cleaned that up
100%
Yes
But this time was particularly bad and extended
Nah they're known for it
Oh its exactly who you think it is lol
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
The joys of management
Since most decisions are my job to make now, not help make
Technically speaking lead is basically a vice but my responsibility shifted a bit
And God role for armada leader/overall administration on server
So we have assistants for moderation stuff
Na/sea vices for armada/game stuff/mod stuff
I've been armada lead for less than a month
A couple weeks ago
Which I'm trying to combat
To my knowledge no one's left because of toxicity but people have left for doomposting, horniness, negativity, etc
Or at least get back to acceptable levels
So they were demoted and i was brought in for damage control and to clean up so to speak
A recent incident was a few people left because a previous lead was being ridiculous on the stuff they were saying
Moreso sols has always had a reputation of being honey and other stuff so trying to clean that up
Kinda not really
Riku's next on my list <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
Too much shit recently and too much people leaving
I'm fucking sick of it
When you wake up later and send to me
<@416445660443967491> can you record your kallens run
<:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>
<:worryGetBackToWorkSlave:780487618588442704>
get to work
you're -1
def is good
told you
<:BASED:916110117374689330>
Keilo reinstalled?
What the fuck
<:hmmThinkers:860882439513440256>
there was something you had to do to go faster
i forget the input
tap then hold maybe
iirc
need to hold the button
<a:bloodlao:959706412685099038>
dont really wanna play today
though tbh
1 cd 1 spcr 4 attack
nvrmind
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
2 spcr
but my affixes are brick
i wanna try it
i saw that lol
apparently this boss is free
fragie got 780 in eu
pretty good numbers
yeah
bruh
prob not
it guarentees whoever replaces hos is a crit buffer
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah variance on both is insane
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
well griseo tho
bk crit is worse i'd think
and no paragon
with less sp issues
hare seems to be just a spray painted bk
same lol
im not at the point anymore where i sss on release
i'd rather farm for it though
mhm
its ridiculous lol
stupid
my prom staying ss too
right
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
gotcha
oh you want everyone maxed
or was she 2* too
you didnt pull ely elf right
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
i'd give you mine if i could
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
that makes way more sense
ahhhh
which ig you havent
where are your skill mats was the question lol
obv ss prom released but you should still have some if you've bought whenever they showed up in daily shop
im legit confused
for asterites?
were you burning some
i mean
i still have 150
how do you have 0
?
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
<:peeka:1058877271420715118>
I think taihens been saying that for weeks now
i really cant believe sss is just 60% crit
sp needed for +1 on blob but thats ma and whales that use mei on hos
but full attack is fine
she *usually* doesnt
and i cba to fix it
im running 5% sp cost on her
yeah lol
im tilted
a friend got this in 44
mostly an ma thing tho
cause she uses the set sometimes
2 is good for hos
1 sp cost is okay
all attack
late response but
Ain't no way
Bruh
Jesus
A 2 months delay minimum
That's like
<:peeka:1058877271420715118>
to no one's surprise it looks nothing like her except the hair
that beryL has asked for
its the ely skin everyone thought they were gonna get
Who renamed the server
It died
<:kekew:1084510710756806737>
People abbreviate krieg?
Ark knights?
Sounds like affix mats
<:peeka:1058877271420715118>
should be
even then, s0 struggles at these temps
its literally hare or die
you don't need to do it with anyone else lol
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
spend it on c2 r5 chars instead
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
imagine
every time
literally
but she retired
nini was
you can prob use her during the hitcount phase
depends if you need it
they didnt try lol
kr rl
what the fuck
But ss1 got 744 on na
Ss2 ofc higher
Ss1 da did pretty good
Actually
I was thinking da or trio
Oh right right
?
What's the third
It's bs
And yes, ss trio will beat non S2 aponia from what I'm seeing
HoT doesn't do good here
<:worryExit:783190311987970118>

<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
its just been mid spenders-whales
i also havent heard an *actual* f2p tell me about how f2p it is
kills my immersion
and i dont like the fucking polygons
all pgr seems to be for me is burnt out honkai players
i keep playing star rail
pgr doesnt interest me enough now
if pc client dropped before star rail then maybe
i wonder what excuse we use now
intern kun hit the button by accident <:02shrug:809888510143496264>
We -2 kosma while sea+2
483D
Abyss is easier in na again
Nah
At least 760
9s cap /= s0 cap so want to specify
what ranks are you asking for
depends
I'm a star rail player now
Too late
Ew
Insane
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Owomath 60 * 280
Or do you want +10 attack perma
Do you want to be competitive for a boss or two every patch
Impossible

<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
You what
And not torus
Convert gacha weapons to shards
Or do the whale thing
Just get 150 ae imaginons
Time changes people
Like a year ago
He *was*
Too scared to go into other channels
It's the funniest in Honkai vent
Except when carv is there
I honestly dont remember lore not being bad
Wasn't this always the case?
When you read haku's comments too long*
Waste of crystal
What's next, you're gonna tell me hare *isn't* actually a hare
Nirvana retains doubtful for bosses and weathers that valks aren't tailored to
Im surprised he never found imy vid
Kek
Which was well over. A year ago now
At least when i was there
Well
But known in gameplay help
Just average player
Too much time with vampy
Recently
Also tooru has been a kek
Done with this guy
I did
It wasn't good lol
But it was first time haku commented
I just guessing through the ss
Mimi didn't know either
Yes
Ma
<a:patpat:943375983002677290>
No it all helps
This is haku gameplay btw
LOL
Bro
Another haku like comment
I remember the comment though lol
Whatever vid was between March 1st and March 6th
Mimi said that, and that was the response lol
No drama, just someone who thought they were better than mimitsu giving rl advice to a nirv player
Idr the vid lol
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
I ping you shortly just gonna drive to work rq
Haku Impact • 4d ago (edited)
Sorry mimi, i thought u were in red lotus, so my comment was based on it . My apologies . But i keep my theory rotation. Im a guy who can retain nirvana .when i say something i hope newbies following to shut up and respect. And im following u and talkin to u, not to them. Your videos are really good. Again my mistake, i should pay more att.
Next time. When i share something is with you , not with the rats kids that saddly watch your vids . And sorry again for my mistake.
Pd, for the ones asking for proves, got my channel with a lot of examples . IM a guy who can retain nirvana, got top Ma every week, highest Er diff. and top scores inside mini events etc. If most of u lives in a box and dont dare to try different things, is not my problem.

<:SaluTao:1046248230192697354>
i havent been ignoring you i havent had anything to respond wth
mpe is okay ig
hn or die this abyss
<:letcook:1083029418185859133>
im gonna scream
so apparently hs weapon swap gltcih is still a thing
its great <:FelisOk:1047083219587182682>
10 points of cleanup and relying on hos crits <:harold:671028554074423350>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
the run i want needs sp/s on susan AGAIN
im gonna kill someone
bro
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
the run is so tight on sp
this bleed whale is toxic
wow
mei m is better but mei m on mobs is *cancer*
paga
Oh btw idk where to put thsi but maybe new hos tech
I heard about that yeah
Learned my lesson with honk
I dont wanna start an established gacha from scratch
Another 90 minutes
If i do play I'm buying an account and learning how to play lol
Ic
Ahh
Red is best yellow is okay blue mid
Based on the stage right?
I was watching someone mald wz
Where Luna banner
I'll keep my eye out
I like it, that game
Not bad at all
Honestly
Okay
Lemme watch
Fishing for orbs looked like cbt in pgr
How bad is orb rng
Oh btw
That sounds right
You have gameplay?
Haven't heard of it
Probably won't stay tbh
I give it a few days
How long will I actually play
The real question is
In 20 years
No pgr until PC client
Gresham is playing hsr
No
And plume
I'm gonna start pgr and make a giga cope ice team with wanshi and s rosetta
And Liv too
The newest one
What about vera
Sadge
Tet can I borrow your sss Rosetta
Why is there always polygons
Maybe pgr can actually get some graphics
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
ppl are buyin wuthering waves cbt for $250
Speaking of
And corn drinks but that's a Korean thing more so
They apparently have fish broth vending machines too
And 7T
I forgot LOL
Breh
Because you can actually compete
Imo it's better for lower spenders
And how time consuming just *one* SSS boss is
And with how *expensive* it is to build those teams
9S ma imo would probably kill the game
For all the people that want it
Yee
Vil if you count her too i suppose
I don't see any of them out of style anytime soon
But fire is just Kiana/htr/cn
She's not actually bad, just dies when a blow of wind touches her
<:02shrug:809888510143496264>
And start over ig
Just throw the whole element away
Lol
Anything fire not hfi
<:letcook:1083029418185859133>
Amazing
Sp is ma only
All atk
Yes
Iirc
72
Shattered throne and duality are meh though, and can't speak to gos raid
Raids and dungeons are also pretty good mostly
It's too basic for all the stuff they have now
Vog is mid if you didn't play it in d1
Kings fall is great
?
Maybe gild iron lord idk
Could grind quests and exotics ig
It's boring AF once you've done all your pinnacles
On d2 break
I did not but I'll check it out
I'm out of town <:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
Have fun with bke guys
<a:KEKWGOOSE:872822696763883540>
Dependa on the missing piece
4/4 always important just depends where you want to play imo
<a:BronyaBoring:933189843729674310>
Gib free sw pls
They're def the more complex rots in recent history (if you own the valk you know this, most people just assume what i said though)
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
Wdym you don't just hold a and let her float
At least you didn't pull her stigs and skip the weapon
Until someone put out a ref no one broke 550 with hot lol
Man that run was *miserable*
I meant how aponia dominanted
Yes, but not well
Or even abyss heph ig
This is basically the paralyze hit count clock if you want a comparison
She has type AND weather adv
Any non vq is dead here
I feel like i sent one here
On bili2
<:Copium:875793728055418942>
Even trio can kill
It's a completely different boss
Yeah lol
Well
But mobs are an artificial difficulty i agree
Rip bke and jizo
Fire tank img flower and clock at least
Kevin <a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
Rip korath
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
Just wait till the whale spawns the little ones
Man
<:worrykms:398047795732545536>
Mine neither
I know what I'm in for already huh
<:ew:960016221636530206>
Wasted Handel and zhenyi <:Deadge:942802905046581248>
I still haven't used my second set
Abyss yes ma no
Tank should be fun at least coming up
Well
Forever mid
<:Deadge:942802905046581248>
Insane
Yeah
Depends on the week
Or 1 SSS 1 ss
1 ppm per SSS boss if needed
I say second ppm
2 newt on ss boss
You can live with 2 ppm 3 newt
I've needed 3 ppm some weeks
Personally
oh right mpe
yeah def then
so unless you had dupes or wanted to brick your existing set you were locked out of it
you needed sp/s for jizo
~~actually it wouldnt~~
3 sp/s 3 spcr
<a:bloodlao:959706412685099038>
damn cata lao
i doubt it
based on this
<a:CB_pandafightl:651893508868669450>
<@385655541248163840> ROUND 2
how do i dman it
this was the wrong cycle for rng us
yee
<:Hildead:1071073034997342258>
gg nini
as expected
Gotcha
But fun watch
Only 6 ep
It's got an old charm
owo's dead
owo died
oh it wasnt even by much
pe dlc wins again
~~9s pe~~
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
Surely
Bastet B
But to each is own, just chill <:keqingsleep:884663408450998312> until you can compete properly
I know people who mald every cycle and end up quitting because of sunken cost fallacy / imposter syndrome
I think that approach is best
Until all of my teams were rounded out
When i was aiming for nirv i just tried to promote on the weathers i had the best team for
Yeah don't stress about it too much
It's so dumb
After that shield otto cycle we learned <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Same tbh
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
When you could use trio every week
I did the entirety of 6.4 lol
Leaderboard
It's about knowing when to pick your battles
You can't expect to mald every cycle with a team not built for that cycle and retain
Accept the ones you can't
Dominate the cycles that you can
Just care about the experience not the lb
?
if not then disregard
or ss vq
oh <@82358863155703808> are you ss hs
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
nini's 5 minutes beat my 1 1/2 days
im putting it there nvrmind
idk if this goes in wotah channel
bruh
and *definitely* has bosses designed with proper targeting, physics, and especially no game breaking mechanics
the avenger that shows up after the fighting is over
surely this remains the case
honkai impact 3rd is a great game with difficult and enjoyable content that's designed for all teams to do well
surely
bleed whel fun
<a:Smoge:808844088115068938>
can someone give me this i need it
yee
<:worryBrothers:900213853479124992>

now that you mention it i havent seen them in a while
<:02shrug:809888510143496264>
i really cant believe people are just finding out about the sp cost not working lol
but high level fight is this
you can unga
s2 hfi ss htr sss hoo
<@385655541248163840> <a:Korone_Wakeup:970480615919087696>
s0 is impossible <:deadge:975652771082698782>
but rl should be fine
as you can see in ref channel
gl on the sp though
obv +3D and higher gear/ranks but maybe can give an idea
<@781539392039682058> i posted this for lumi who's doing the same
since you're not using trio though its gonna be harder
if you're using trio team high level its this
click on boss
i posted this dude earlier
no way LMFAO
its like using hof with shamash all over again
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
wouldn't even bother
oh just saw this sorry
cause the sea rots do not work
on na d yeah
<:Deadge:942802905046581248>
mono element feels more painful this time
i had someone try my acc and they got 671 lol
s0 trio 4* elf i only got 650 with
oh i havent logged in yet
i was at the time nini hasnt played yet
its easier for tesla for mobbing but ppm usually wins out anyway yeah
^
or ppm
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
you'd never use it if you had tesla
grindset mentality
@ nirvana players
bruh
and he's the one losing brain cells
surely they know what they're talking about
a nirvana player
i get it now
niche and literally
words of the days
is niche just a buzzword now
<:letcook:1083029418185859133>
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
just get pc client from ehre
actually dont check general
keilo check general
idk if its just on the epic games store
im looking for standalone launcher
gplay/app store
surely someone will spend 40 mins an acc
yee
hsr pre dl is up
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

nyx pv goes HARD
actually not a bad trailer
<@416445660443967491>
no one wants to do this boss lol
this one i had to downscale from 
lazy standard rot is like 630
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
should be somewhere between 650-660 on 483D
okay s0 s0 s0 4*
sss susan sss hs
yeah i fake 9s this patch
i dont have a spare aladdin m but yes
bleed whale come sooner
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
temps were 484D lowest around this boss
def not in bili
it doesnt matter they both whale
or maybe that piece was cutmeo
with plans to s2 hfi iirc
he's s0 ss1 ss1 rn
that man has been swiping like mad
keeby isnt exactly the standard s0 anymore
well
s2 would put me at 660+
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
btw
at least for nirv
if it was cope it wouldn't be posted lol
if sirin's not 4* dont even bother lol
4* elf is a free rank up
s2 hoo s2 htr 3* elf
you can get some idea maybe
oh that reminds me
im stuck though <:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah mimi got 688 s0 s0 s0 4* elf afaik

she's what got me into the game tbh
and didnt need an elf
im glad we got supports to showcase her potential more
at least for heim
revolutionary back then
hof was like
i always needed the sp
and the floating mobs thing is annoying too so i get that
hfs is kinda hard to learn though ngl
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
right, which i'd be fine with if he didn't include and i was following a ref
tells me you're bad
but idk saying i followed a ref, ref didnt work, valk didnt do what ref did, shit valk
ignite you had basically rondo, and ae's fourth
airborne i kinda get
3 different conditions
it has like 4 different trigger conditions, no?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
lol
i was following that convo train briefly
oh i rememeber this

But it should downscale okayish
Yee ik
Ko
Do
946
This was what i used last time this boss was here
I used shui last time and it was *okay*
Sns is mandatory here i think
Prom/hs/sns
Triple supports is pretty good here
She couldn't hurt kevin
500 more than <@385655541248163840> will
No fookin way
I don't see why not
Probably

Get back in there
Only -1
Why?

But that's 47808 (jumpsec hell)
I've only ever done newt rots lol

Well
Depends on when she falls i suppose
5.7 was last yeah

<@197871478950068224> us looking at <@385655541248163840>
Actually impossible
I cant on mobile
When I'm home
Okay yeah there's actually no competition
Since when
What the fuck
<:mKKOmgHide:748278818288173117>
S0 S0 S0 4* elf
Vs
s0 HFI SS htr SSS Hoo
The smart money is on nini
But s0 has become unplayable in na
They want us keeping up
Yes
I have no power here
@ ruby me this cycle
ITS HAPPENING
<@197871478950068224> <@385655541248163840>

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i heard the chapter available first day
hallo

<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
never again

why is this a thing
heimdall with sk is fucking cancer
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah its so bad
Enjoy your 8164936471 weapons
That works too yeah
Regardless of ranks
So probably hh
Depends but most of the time, you'll want HH lead on rots that you won't be able to ult immediately
Really depends
For this fight
Hb lead is better imo
<:02shrug:809888510143496264>
Maybe Turg sushang jst hb
Nothing else seems *great*
Yeah i honestly don't know what to do without standard or Turg
I forgot the activation condition of bronya B
Gg
Okie
You mean for the hoh team
Turg?
What is CN using
Oh sushang
I answered already
Bronya tb paga m
You will if you aren't s2
They're literally half of the gacha skins
And dudu has 2
She has like 4
Surely Kiana can spare one
<@704867526877904908>
.
LOL
Kill me
I had to level up like 10 stigs this patch
Bro I burned so many affixes
Whichever comes first
Or kira
I'm gonna try to commit to not using any until 7.0 comes too
Jizo sucks <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I wish I had more locks rn
And save battlesuit shards too
You never know
Save them
Learning the transition
The sp gave me ptsd
~~though your Mpe was kinda weakge~~
In p2
Paint from griseo didn't transfer
Not the instant kill bug
The paint transfer bug
No no
Iirc
That was the paint transfer bug
<a:ChikaWhistle:564504969537912832>
Or whenever new hua is
I don't exist until 7.0
Not me
is that fucking arc riot
have fun with the stacks
surely you get a higher score now
dxy im too zoomer to really know the pain of her
kallen was annoying af with mpe
idek which of thsoe i want
honestly
im dreading that release schedule
a phys boss probably every week
new sk will be interesting i suppose
well both ottos probably next patch
aponia doesnt exist <:deadge:975652771082698782>
hmm
hoyo wild
but man
im surprised she isnt getting the sw banner treatment at this rate lol
nah nvrmind its fucked
well
mpe dreams are dead huh
THANK YOU
IMG FGO: Otto will exit invulnerability state immediately after the countdown ends.
bruh
im reading now
<a:AINTNOWAY:1072381924343037972>
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
the worst of that for me was her just
rising into the air super high for no reason
there's 3 possible transitions
the best where she allows you to break the shield
the not best where she jumps instantly
the worst where she evades your shit
then instantly jumps
v3d??
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oh you were way slow okie
did she jump by this point?
well
<a:modcheck:861417013993013269>
hof
hof is less maldy
all hoh ranks is pure mald
and dont forget your hb stacks
the mald is 1) mobs
2)  kasumi teleports
3) kasumi walk
4) kasumi red circle
or a solid alternative rather
they'll never *not* be top in ma
^
if already s2
but yeah idk about ranking hoo
spina also had stamps
i feel like SS HFi + s2 HoO is higher value than s2+ SS HoO
but in my personal opinion
6s trio surely
neko's gonna commit whale next patch
do you plan on using hoo as a dps?
specifically
寂灭霞
thats it
pretty looking stigmata
nah nvrmind
or actually
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i have tbb
i scrapped my m a long time ago ugh
lee
yeah
for g4
should i be making linn
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i cant even get UPrate
no
fook
is that my cez B
holmes huh
sss herrscher seele
do we know offrates?
gl gl
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
same price as last time
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
thats ss
and whatever i get i get
and finish off with prom sp banner
probably gonna pull prom gear
i just want the 1 mobi stamp
its only $20
<:sad:854800429572554753>
fund me
eli
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i need 16000 crystals next patch
surely i get from firepower
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but i whaled too hard this patch
for a 4/4 sw
i kinda wanted bronya b
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:slap2:960028061246586940>
Nini op
She said the thing
Look mom
All the newbies who want to be competitive and krakens are going to na
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
All the newbies who want to be competitive are going to eu for that reason
:Harold:
Mg attracted a lot of people
Mobile sucks
4/28
Next
What's left
Just like <@416445660443967491>
SSS hos cost more than Susannah and dupes
S0 4/4 susan with s-ss hs and Holmes is fairly cheap
Only if you wanted top performance
And Aladdin overall is new best bleed support gear
Aladdin M is the new Beethoven M
I also didn't answer fully sorry
Tru
For an sp valk
She is way too expensive to see peak performance
You need dupe for hos
But if you go all in on Susannah
Aladdin is yes
That isn't trio
Tbf, what dps is nowadays <a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
A ranks unironically are more expensive

Iirc
She wasn't that good for her time and a lot of things have changed. Imo there is no precendent for the strength of an sp valk, and Susannah is the first to set the time for new age valks
DJ doesn't even count
This is the context
Hide it from hak and ruby
Quick
Another server I'm in
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
Dorm endgame is real
`The blue interactions reward 7 Honkai Blocks (Legos) plus 0-1 Home Materials randomly and can be triggered up to 7 times a day. You can get over 150,000+ coins worth of materials for free every day. That's 1,000,000 coins a week in savings.



    The main trigger is connected to claiming your daily quests. Each time you collect 50 BP worth of daily quests, you can head to the dorm to interact with your chibis for a gift. This must be done after each claim, as it will overwrite the trigger if you do not. `
People min maxing dorm interactions
Bruh
Ah
You're ranking one of them?
On equal ranks hfi is def better
That idk
S2 hof = S0 hfi
Wasn't it always 3 griseo enhanced anyway?
Just not as cracked from what I'm reading
Aponia is still good
Yeah, they're overhauling quite a bit i hear
You could do it now before the rework in 6.6
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
And you have the er valks you can grind out too
Probably
14.5k in 4 weeks
I was gonna say Lilah personally but duchess is nice
So yeah <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
Everything is like 52-56k
Interesting backstory but that's it
She bored the fuck out of me in story
Tbh
I want her because i need the typing but
Because I'm not getting her after all
That's also why i doubled down this patch
Skipping
And 6.8-6.9 dead
6.7 dead
But 6.6 I'm dead
I can be a good player when i want to
Actual playtime anyway
But it wasn't that *long* really
No
So i got 836 with Holmes then pulled dupes and 840
He 844'd and i 845'd like 8 hours later
Hmm
In hours like?
Took like 1 1/2 days to mald for 10 points
That t1 reminded me why i wanted to only retain
Yeah fuck that
Surely
So a patch of dominance and then relax until new hua in 7.0
I had this convo in sols already lol
I'm doing in 6.5 what everyone and their extended family did in 6.4
<a:TE_DonoWall:854581664570015775>
So anything after and including trio basically
Jk new DPS valks are staying s0
Not until i take out a loan <:PeepoSupreme:1053548021650038875>
.
I committed heki
Oh true
But I'd advocate for fire: wayy less mald
To which that answer is use the team that's better geared
Because it's either hof cn htr or hoh jk rc/hb (both teams use paga m)
HTR DPS or?
?
<:FelisOk:1047083219587182682>
i just copy pasted citrus youtube run
nope, sorry
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
2 patches give 130 frags
hell
<:Deadge:942802905046581248>
LOL
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:Deadge:942802905046581248>
just circle around them
i honestly
?
but im happy with 761
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im gonna try for the 7 missing points after all
i need streamer luck
i'm gonna stream it for a bit
thats what everyone has said LOL
i just reset as soon as i see that circle
ah, rip
issok though 941 good enough
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i cleared at 947 and everything got pushed back
yes
but i dont wanna mald it
765-767 possible
okay
wtf is this boss
you get punished for doing the mobs too fast
man
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Too good for us
Gone
I literally can't spend for two patches
It only cost me hare
<a:AA_Kitten_Vibe:853239408177709066>
Ripp
Nini did you see my reward btw
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I have to do it again on bleed whale
<:5thumbsupcow:959437796416815135>
Tyty
??
? Ban
...
Yeah same
Sorry you went through that
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
This cycle is cancer
Good call
Are you gonna t1
<@385655541248163840>
O
Dupes??
4
Surely that's enough
Take it
Just steal my luck
Without ae
I wonder what the orb mechanic looks like now
Lol
5.9
I can answer that
Wait nvrmind
When was the last couatl anyway
In 2 days
I still can't believe Nini did 24 runs for kevin
Fair
Skip the cow mechanic
Can't you just
I actually don't mind that we can pick the boss now
Husk clock hits so fucking hard
By miles
They improved it for newbies
But it's the same for them as it is for us back then imo
100%
It does
Or smth
Inferno was like 90D
Then they made it free imo
Er was cancer pre 5.4 for me
And i was barebones acc
I remember it being harder purely because i started 3 weeks before er came out
Realistically probably not
Flying benares that two shot you
God that was a toxic cycle
Da and SW 
Press B to win
For the wrong signet
I wanted to die when kallens chased me for 10 minutes on floor 7
For me it was always mobi
Ik you were lol
Weren't you?
But you were resetting for Ely doors
I do *not* miss that
Man
I've been at work
I haven't logged into the game today
The only thing that changed was mob tankiness
Er has always been shilled
Eh
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
We GAMING lol
It's great
After dark is just pure mald
Betrayed
I thought you were a hua stan
Keeby made like 3 vids about it
<@434737143395516416> v azure
Nvrmind
Are you
?
Hey i know him
4* sirin is kinda big imo
4* kiaelf is stupid lol
eLysia
Whatever fragile did last time
Look at sushang icon
Same boss
Same rot



Lemme get a comparison vid
It's 8s now
It used to be 4s
Other way around
No
They didn't fix it
Sushang bug
I lied btw
<@197871478950068224>
<@416445660443967491>
<:letcook:1083029418185859133>
give or take 2 points
t50 was like 818 i think
794
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
hua worth
<a:kianacookidle:653596605622124544>
21 pulls exactly
too much pulls <:Deadge:942802905046581248>
i wouldnt
and got 2 cards
i did a 10 pull on hoh because i was bored
i got <@213811388546678794> alt
switch was some pretty fun games
?
i remember when i thought 15 bucks for a dlc was expensive
take me back to aaa games
i refuse <:deadge:975652771082698782>
rather play a jrpg if i want turn based combat
i'd trap myself again
i thought about playing star rail seriously but
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i pulled way too much in this game
this is the 2nd time its ever happened for me
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
cant wait for the shit nin's about to give me
<a:ElysiaSax:959721471633162290>
i committed heki
oh eli did you see
preferable
cause ai needs the 3 set if you had her 4/4
its fine since you've no gear
is what people are using
paga m on bonya
maybe he lucks out
its so bad
yeah thats fine
wait you have ff
well
def do this though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
sushang?
<:Deadge:942802905046581248>
you dont have fire or ice gear right
na is jsut as bad
eli bracket?
rip kasumi for you then
i few tried in mine
i got a whale bracket
nope
get ratio'd
LOL
<a:WHAT:1094619178289352784>
which is even worse
we have sss aponia
oh just you wait
pishacha is really annoying without susan yeah
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
then done until 6.7
6.6 should be just enough to get a mobi stamp through prom banner
so im done
im at 77% of the xtals i spent in 6.4
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
but im throwing either way
i actually had to calc this
<:OMEGALUL:827381886787518464>
nice tho!
i would've went  for the sp valk if i was choosing personally too
get from spending event
what happened to
but i think
17 pulls (not with crystal) for ss
7 pulls for the last 2 frags i needed
nah
i got fucked trio patch jsut baseline s0
~equal tbh
literally ten minutes later
okay i did
^
for whoever mhy throws at us in 6.7
wog
at least you can retain
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
i havent been paying attention ngl
probably
i dont have a dupe cez for the heph run
nvrmind
its 210 essentine per frag
500 essentine in a 10 pull

nah fuck that
im 2 frags away lol
i actually might if you fund 20 pulls
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
just take it and run
im not getting that lucky again
no
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
tyty
i was s1
i havent looked
idk
idk man
<a:AINTNOWAY:1072381924343037972>
i pulled ely banner with 96 until pity
i stole your luck
lumi
bro
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
use your 51k crystals to replenish
nice
what the fuck
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
1 susan boss a week in abyss and ma
<:Deadge:942802905046581248>
phys shill and qua shill cause susan covers both
<:sadge:790100711206682654>
<a:chadn:977032787087482962>
i can retire like celinelao did now lol
but was worth skipping hare for that t1
cause styx beat me 2 kosmas ago on karto's acc
rn 1-1
it'll be run back on jizo and whale lol
<:amnou:797040672003325962>
<a:pinknou:808554999168499723>
sp economy is so much better
once you've played both
hb ss is unusable imo compared to the sss
yeah
so it shouldnt matter too much
you're also ss hoh
well
no ff = no dmg
you do use turg cat if no ff though
for this boss
ff hb is just better than turg cat
nvrmind
i see what ruby meant
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
if in hot team, hot is *already* using handel
and why would gd use full handel
why wouldnt you advies ppm?...
wait
idk the context though
how would they have handel if they dont have tesla m
correct
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
is all
its mindset coming from other easier games
with spin2win roza breaking the gears
i liked that clock rot i sent some time ago
but you can be creative
def finnicky
its easier to blame everything other than yourself
but looking back at the older vids
i wasnt born yet
crazy to think about now
you jsut had to know buff timings
or when everything was a newt bargain sale
man remembering when br/bd was used
pretty much
100% wallet difference
yeah keilo
<:FelisOk:1047083219587182682>
im watching light mode and dark mode fight apparently
wtf
so all the bouncers became retainers
instead of 5
10 retain slots
so all the rl players migrated
that was the nirv change
at least pre 5.9 anyway
its actually harder to promo in agony/rl sometimes it feels like
its free in eu
esp in sea
*he doesnt know*
i believe it
except that one cycle with heim
ai chan imo
i think you could do okay with purana
oh actually the reason i posted this
we had a chuckle about it lol
which, why even pull vq at that point?...
he's skipping weapon cause he wants 4/4 hare
this was funny too
and central he called them (respectfully so) loli/cunny lovers in another server, and that no one should associate with them
which someone screenshot and sent there and aka saw that lol
maincord he posted leaks
hive mind
kicked from central banned from maincord so idk where he gets his info from now
retiree
2% ma
rl player now
he is
thats the same vid that velvet is upset about lol\
ig
people saw susan and assumed that was the norm
idk what people expect lol
active is pretty mald too lol
or the slam
same energy lol
iirc the math adds up to 45% on cn vs 41% on hof
though they're both using the wrong lead
watching these two it doesnt seem like a big difference?


cause tank is lke 2 weeks out
guess we're testing on kasumi
seems like a long sequence
i wonder if thats situational
ic
<:naruhodohic:640949385840295936>
and from what i can tell, a different hfs sequence
they're testing buffs  on the hfs cn htr team
is there anything i need to take away from this
idk why
sea been going dumb hard recently tho
i think you'll be fine lol
aintnoway
lumina stole this
wait
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
it'll be 13 ss instead
there wont be
The two most whaled herrschers ever
They're always competitive
It's an hoh cycle
It's like 2-3 point loss per hb ult after the first one
Copying a ff rot
Like if you're a malder
It's not bad per se just annoying to work around
For the active
20 second cd
Now granted this is extreme but
I didn't realize how bad blob was with minimal gear
Also man
I remember people bitching about crusher and about hb drones
Afaik always hb
Preferably hb uses ff and paga m not crusher but hoh wins out
The team that's fully geared
cute <:RoseCute:865078114824749086>
time flies
<:KKPeepoMeiBoomer:748630077914480730>
hawk's non augment
we've come a long way from va fhd use
nothing's ever easy with kasumi
im honestly really excited for this cycle
raven just straight up 🗿
true !
what does this say
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
dont suffer like us
i think hare is better for you anyway
then stig box is 4/4
just pull 3/4 in 1 ten pull like the japanese
but s2 is wayyy betetr
s0 kinda less pain now ngl
bruh
wtf
i think hoh wins though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
fuck it i run both
for sp/damage
last time we had this boss non s2 hoh was painful
im not worried about the shield im worried about damage btw
4/4 cn bron tb Paga M
though this uses 2* ely
they actually are extemely close
the hoh team uses it on hb
just use paga m lol
why wouldnt you
tahts what i want to find out
s1 hoh ss3 jk ff hb
or
sss cn s0 htr s3 hfs
actually what team is even better for kasumi
30% fire + 15% elemental, or a flat 41% elemental
which lead is better
yee that too
so my attacks missed
or like levitated
for me it teleported a lot
usually sp issues means that the boss moved
abyss?
for ma?
this sounds like transition is messed up too
do you have sp issues in p2
yeah paga m is pretty good here honestly
no shot
if it was like 100+
so i figured i could go a bit more
but it took 54 pulls for 4/4
yee ik
<a:modcheck:861417013993013269>
didnt you swipe asterite for the sp valks 5.6-5.8
its not like a spent on sss elysia or something
she's sp
listen
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
no shui in 2023
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
hs can use that with qte on, may actually be worth
does that account have shui?
gtocha
not until you use bk you dont
<@434737143395516416> w twirling gaze
so what's the griseo piece missing?
do you happen to have cez m?
ahhh
do you have susan's weapon at least?
hallo
the 6s players had a noticible difference on wolf after buff
was about to say she got another one
oh
20%?
3* is gg with no ranks
4* elf also helps a lot
but also
s0 hfi is okay, i changed my mind on her
kinda
s0 htr is work around able
s0 hoo is painful
like all new valks <:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah we die on that
so its fine
we'll get more phys
and doubling down this patch
im skipping hare with ruby
oh you missed it
its figuring out the cds
this boss isnt that bad to mald
honestly
<:FelisOk:1047083219587182682>
96 pulls for 9 points
yes
idr
or 14
we close in 13 hours
no fooking way
cutoff 813
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
<:letcook:1083029418185859133>
welcome!
approved
search 1018
i literally just woke up
lemme login
you're already in server
wait rbuh

misremembered
just happened to get a dupe along the way
nvrmind
yeah lol
<:SaluTao:1046248230192697354>
well, you can holmes tm aladdin B too now
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
150 gear pulls total this patch
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
so next time banner comes i can use wishing well
500 torus
and like
96 pulls for TTTB
I offrated linn T too so i have a 4/4 mobi now

thats the only relevant items
no second m but im not pulling more
<@516591030326525983> 
<:FelisOk:1047083219587182682>
bye bye hare
<:FelisOk:1047083219587182682>
the deed is done
its just a timing thing
its pretty consistent
<a:TE_PepegaShake:562530316107907073>
time to pull dupes
alright im locking my decision in
i think just support impact 3rd until the new phys
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
so
and im not exactly at the point anymore where i want to make myriad every cycle
and 5.9 guarentees that you can retain every cycle
you just die on aponia
yeah
~~just ignore the sss hos~~
but i think i can cope, dont really wanna swipe anymore
i kinda want her cause no bk
i think a lot of people are
i dont look at the icon just the picture
<a:blind:998945545810886707>
tahts the M design?
wait
when aladdin come back
he can get 4 m's at least
well
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
in 2023
playtesting
<a:SMH:1021112056063213648>
also unrelated but man
someone got fucked going for aladdin m
pick a hill
also zoomers:
zoomers: we want 3 sss ma bosses and we like quickswap easy teams
its a feature
that could be why
did you do the bug
Mobs can be annoying yea
<:worryGetBackToWorkSlave:780487618588442704>

<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>
I had a ruby moment
The mindset more so
Just tilts me because stuff liked that *increased* my spending level and *decreased* my competitive value because everyone must be a pauper

It seemed the base attack was lower
I know that much, but yeah idk about the dk
<a:SMH:1021112056063213648>
Idk how they calculate the attack values
That's true yeah
It reads like they just unga bungad and got punished for it
New player doesn't know what they're doing means the game is trash though?

I hope is what they're really asking
QBQ: i can't afford to pull both hare and prom, is hare worth the investment
I wonder if a new DPS with a new shill weather and directing competing with an older DPS is going to be relevant to those weathers
*let's get this bread*
So I'll prob crash later

Xored did the same thing
Like literally every fucking zoomer whale
He's in the same armada as the loan guy
I know this guy
Wait
But the in depth stuff I'm out
I try to be about things i know about
Nini had a copypasta for this
Then pull it
Skip it?
But he helps a lot ye
Fragile is really helpful, just his tonality through text can be condescending
Someone who isn't even in that channel anymore i mean
I bet i know who too

You'll get more weapons than not
Also though, probably not
How many crybbals you have
Insane
Like timestop
vq gets it for her entire dps phase
Ngl
I think she's the new queen of ma
It's impossible to get the card without buying bundles

She's very strong in her niche
Not more so outside of that
I wouldn't go for her

Come patch day
I'm probably gonna roll <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I'll see how I feel
Just like Nini and lumi and ruby

Cardio def helps with that too - breathing and blood flow in general really

Because if you're lifting, you're gonna *gain* weight for a short period
Depends on what exactly you're trying to do
Losing weight varies for everyone

that's only enough for ss0
there's 130 frags  if you do this
as high as they can get = ss0 if s0 / no mobi

mobi isnt in bp until 6.8
not in adv
in *expa*
That's an SS solution i think

S0 trio = ht run lol
Menaces
There's an mpe run i posted tho

Why pull at all
Wait it's a skemsal
As much as i love vil she only has two bosses
Also that yeah
What's the 1 piece of cn gear

1.5-2k
sss is like
that *is* a ranked valk
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
hot can work but that needs ranked hof i think
893 is free though
thats all i saw
i was looking for a non magty 946 on io, a non spa, a non hfs/aponia/eden, etc for someone
just wishing it was this easy for ex
surely it is, right?
?
is this masters
For animation purposes
Default has slower animations
Apparently I'm hearing the skin is better for susan
Also guys
I haven't seen since the technical test
I'm actually curious
?
<:cheerhic:955352315706081320>
Is Nini free?
Ah
Does that server have nqn
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
I don't think i have a summon entity character
I'll think about it
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
Sounds like you can afford hare
Nice

Anyone over 805
Ssg

My employer sent us thanks a latte stuff and i don't drink coffee
?
You want Starbucks codes
~~just watch the anime 5head~~
so i never notice it
i cant speak to her gather because by that time hfi has already gathered
still has the best gather of all elfs somehow lol
yeah
imm shocked fuxi wasnt first
was hoping i could avoid and save the balls for torus or smth
so i need to buy the card from bp
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im 88 frags off
i was calculating sss hos
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
the numbers were all correct
yeah 105
i think 150 per card but i could be wrong
i did the math wrong im good
actually nvrmind
guys what do i do
wtf
im shocked that that score is only 81 in sea
<:fpsscumhic:959744049546416148>
just like 9s hoh and the hot teams
9s can get 906 though
no
Vill V bad
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
then i can retire in peace
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
she wasnt looking good in v1 then all around nerfs in v2
hopefully she gets adjusted
<:letcook:1083029418185859133>
if you pull i pull
or are you skipping both?
does that mean you're pulling hare?
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
it happens every patch
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
are you pulling susannah nini?
though 2/those 3 imo seem easier
idk i simp hof <:MemKneel:931522692895617024>
im not whale enough for hh 906, and the hot 906 boring to me, and too zoomer for mpe 893 cause kallen
neither did i until yesterday
candy is annoying
though im ngl
this one was easy, just the transition annoying (like every other run <:deadge:975652771082698782>)
the raven run was cbt
that was raven remember
well
that run isnt even hard (and its -5 <:FelisOk:1047083219587182682> )
what is this slander
?
i want that griseo sticker
<:wot:998941267041996862>
meanwhile:
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i miss rl
:maincord probably
it is !
surely this will help
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
im not even 600
1200 xtals
also s0 vq is like
<:unshut:1003475647005462570>
how long have you played e li
940 <:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
You can kill before transition LMAO
Sinful solo
<:kianasmuggers:1084870521675583488>
Then the game let me win for once
Double weapon pulls
I honestly thought that would be me
300*
Aka got *reamed*
200 pulls got him this
A na whale in infiniti armada
It's Ocean
200 pulls ba bee
@ ruby
That's mocking na players <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Could be 100% wrong though
Didnt see anyone with it, that i can recall anyway
Usually you only reach it for a certain breakpoint
Or vil v if you're poor
Or Tesla M
That's ppm
Who's using avo in 2023 outside of ma
Get Carole's weapon imo
... gachaplayers
~~thats the joke~~
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
<:wickejj:1083018875538509844>
It's all nini
Nini Nini nini
There's quite a few
Tet heki nini
The one time i commit to a valk they nerf her
483
I didn't read it n but i really liked the anime
is wide awake
<@416445660443967491> however
tet's asleep isnt she
maybe in your game
later!
i opted for da
i wasnt whale then
even if i was, she's boring
i already started farming affix mats from mirage its too late to turn back now
true !
i need a mech phys still
s0 bke aint it chief
yeah
guess im riding alone on this one <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
sp gear is release or wait 10 patches
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
thats already over 60k xtal
since you also plan on getting hare & prometheus next patch
personally i would wait for an offrate or something
its extreme case but aka got fucked lol
alternatively, you could holmes tm aladdin B hos
so that you can pull for hare more affordably
mhm
theoritically
i dont think so
no
oh idc
im good at math i swear
9000
i dont wanna though thats mad crybbal
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
owomath (280 * 62) + (280*82)
owomath (70 * 280) + 900
+ another 900 crystals for ss prometheus
70 pulls max for fake bronya gear <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i think i might pull hare after all
you know
its highly unlikely that anyone with ss hoo will have s0 htr
what boss?
30 xtals
NEWCHAP
M is best overall
B is best dupe for this team with Holmes tm
Do you want a marginally better beet M

I remember pretty well I'd think
That was the first banner i swiped on
I'm like 100% sure raven only had the 30 pull guarantee and refund
They do ! Water quality is mid tho
Today's a nice day for a drive
What's in jersey to do?
5.2?
Til aslaug had a stig box
Or mei now, rather
Isn't it the same as raven
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Base A more expensive anyway
I would but I'm a simp
Sswords isn't gonna do much for you
Bleed doesn't crit but sure
Or Holmes tm newt B but that's for bosses without mobs

I had a meme for this
True !
Such a stupid fucking take
Nah let him cook clearly vil v is barely hanging on and is about to be replaced
Ain't no WAY bruh
Has to be
Compared to the ss2
Can someone check if this is ex
All i hear are excuses

Hi cata
AE vs HTR
I tried hs DPS too
Tilted me off the planet
I did
I think it's more swords not scaling well with the rising temps

O
Are you above 150
<:worryHugged:949574510795972649>
Yee
It's rebooting
Ruby did too but Abyss is harder in sea <a:runfast:959995921305829466>
Nah
Round chin
Just crit lmao
If not 120 your scores are irrelevant
If not competitive who cares
Someone here does it
In na

Jst cez is easier iirc
I've literally used it only once
Take mine

All of the above

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Ty kei
Roku prob has a ref
If you twins kallen
Mpe can get 893
Non SSS gets this
Owomath 47856 / 1.2
SS gets 47856
<a:patpat:943375983002677290>
That's the keilao i remember
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
Pick one
We used sigma
Oh morbseph
Because it scraped convos from *all* servers, not just one
Sols adding something like this and it almost doxxed people
What bot was this
Just like dante
Bonus points if you know what I'm referencing
The bot said Microsoft
Wym
LOL

<a:RubyVibe:706895274945282130>
dont whale either or we wont help cause we mock whales not help them
dont pull anything because only whales or nirv players need stuff
then actually found a proper advice server
then found maincord and tanked my acc
i used to browse both subreddits a lot and hope they were accurate
Yeah this was me for a long time
It's a whole thing, surprised your first time seeingit
It was a thing back when sea was higher than na so people use it when anyone complains
Is a meme to mock that servers players
F2p can't compete
Bye what the fuck
Owomath 47824+39893+31946
Fuck
That's what I expected
Owomath 47744+39893+31946
Because that's ch bb ft
I'd just double sleeper 946
If i was a boomer
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Ugh true
Because a while back we could've done either and everyone did hoh tank
I remember everyone complaining about this now lol
Yes
Guess I'm playing mpe
Damn wtf
Wait no that's right
Brb
No way
Owomath 47872 / 1.2
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I have to look it up
Mpe cap was 47872? I think
Hoh SS was 47856
Hmm
I think I'm mixing the scores up from memory but i thought s1 hoh was 39840 and Mpe was 39800
Nevermind hoh wins
I'm thinking heph ugh
Wait why the fuck did i say hoh
And htr locked to flower so no ht
Mpe can too but it's a harder run
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Meh
Owomath 47728+39800+31946
Hoh?
What's the move for tank
s0 trio is not scoring higher than maybe 700 ish
jsut turg mei turg it
from last time
copy styx's ref
i'd da it
there's no shot s0 trio beats ss3 da
not to beat a dead horse since its been talked about a lot here but man its a lot of work consistently capping 
for essentially abyss with time fracture
i could see it though with 2 sss ma  bosses
not a single person who's serious
the rewards for the malding they do not care about
if you ask literally anyone who malds in this game
yeah
to see how far you can go, i personally believe
why do 100 laps in the pacer test when the highest passing value is 60-70ish
for me the value is pushing my account as far as possible when i was actively malding for it
relative worth and value are different things for different people
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
literally 49/50 players in t50 are trio
i tend to stick to one. play it multiple times over (if sngle player), move to next game then never play it again
or very very seldom if i feel the urge
i couldnt see me playing a bunch either
fair
and im not that into d2 anymore, its boring without friends
rn my only games are honkai and d2 so i've time
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
and then im done with gacha
i think my spending is going to bp + monthly on star rail
what else is ther elol
you already myriad
i've nothing to prove anymore
i dont see any reason i need to keep whaling ranks
yee
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
account building stuff, not valks
outside of 5.5/5.9/6.1, most of my spending was on gear/asterite/affix mats/etc
the only ss i actively gacha'd for was ss vil v and the adv for ss hs
and i felt disgusting for the ss vil v in 164
has *not* been on valks lol
all of my spending
tbh
which is out of my price range
the only painless trio is 6s trio
well maybe the 736 one at 482
yeah no ref i posted one rots p1 either lol
its not even an affix problem
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
on both teams
s0 trio is bad
and ss hs is frustrating as fuck to play
im legit tilted
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
when im doing er
yee
im gonna kms bye
im malding with the er emblem on
wait
yes
why is this valk fucking paper
wanna watch me struggle?
hmm
there's just no fookin sp
until mimi posts me wrong
full s0 4* elf i cant see higher than *maybe* 705
imo
s0 trio is mid here
if it makes you feel better
the girl cant take a punch
sounds right
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
He said that too lol
Kallen yee
It was baban
But i don't rhink Eli said it
I remember that
I feel like that got thrown around quite a bit

Oh it posted out of order
If you want to try on my acc

How many is too many
6s+ all have it, everyone else doesnt
not a soul on bili that went for ranks has 4* elf
man
<:nanamismugjuice:923464478761300010>

<a:AA_Kanna_Fire:786673549053263873>
yee
looking through bili a few refs are 482D
wtf
when that server had this boss
we're only -1 from cn
wait
surely trio is better than sa stacks depleting
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
you *could* use hs sa si
481
cap
you would've been 4th
673
this was +100 in my bracket
ay you made it
gatekeeper
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
yee
they didnt realize oz stole stacks
so many people malded about no damage
it was funny when people didnt know how the balls worked at first
ngl
i took a look at that run and decided i'd rather swipe to never do it
s0 is dead but s2+ eating good
so she wasnt that good in ma
well her old team had 0 timestop
so im not complaining
also its made hof way more fun though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im fine with that but man
yeah
its a bet on the future and it makes vill v stronger for the time
im madge about it
its not
its fine anyways im pretty much done heavy speading
thats a lot
hoh, double pri patch in sushang + soe, ai chan
which im fine with that trade
ss villv is why i have s0 trio
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
me included
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

Nice
<:peepoCheeks:855905285813829633>
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
That's just regular 3v3
<:garbedge:1026336100064706560>

Ma Benny became way easier to fight
Abyss Benny crashes your game
Oh btw if you guys still play

Aintnoway
Are you banned in maincord or something nowadays
^
Fragile had the same genshin opinion i think
Exhibit a
Idk the context but tenci usually reliable
He's recently been annoying tho
Hallo
Oh taihen is back
You have elf?
they play and +0 in nirv nowadays
thats it lol
the only cycle i remember them actively trying was a hof one
*sometimes* he can be helpful in gameplay help but meh
then doesnt give a reason for it?
etc
NO
FAKE
WRONG
inserts opinion
he's always been annoying and arrogant though
he literally just came back to the game from retirement
isnt?
he
its easy
why
L
aintnoway
for campaign
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
fuck
i need legendary runs
i stayed up all night to finish a project i had to finish in office
pls
yes
nice
work has been crazy
first time playing all week
was gonna do pinnacles
nothing atm
<@416445660443967491> are you doing anything in d2 atm
Are stupid lol
Mpe and hot
esp on easily repeatable bosses like heph and ice rpc
it diluted a bit because of sushang ranks i think
and the first couple times were pretty much all ss/sss hoh
everyone is speaking to myriad though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
@ lumi dalao confirmed
It's not even masterworked
Idk prob
<@416445660443967491> <@704867526877904908> this was my friend
<:kekew:1084510710756806737>
Sw
I wasnt kidding lol
True. !
<a:run:645294270974001153>
she's only relevant in captainverse
<a:TE_NODDERS:854581762276720681>
Phys is harder to replace though isn't it
AE and BKE actually long af shelf life
20 patches of dominance
She had like
They just get replaced by another hua
Hua suits don't die
~~seele niche support~~
<:TeriTeehee:1061942177921519736>
She loves Walmart elysia
I think <@385655541248163840> might pull
It almost certainly will be
And promethus stuff
I'm probably gonna pull Susannah gear
Wtf
23k i think
I'm at like
The game forced me
<a:Smoge:808844088115068938>
It takes the fun away
And dmg overflow is insane
Theres not much variation in rots
But ik what you mean
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
I didn't lol
So the rest of us have a chance
Mainly the ones who've been fucking abusing trio every cycle
Everyone is burnt out I'm hearing
It's possible
You got a weak bracket
<a:patpat:943375983002677290>
you gto this
ss is free
everyone -2 yeah
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
its boring
last time was 4 months ago at 463(?)D
yes
Oh wait shit you got dixxy too
Arc is gonna be like wtf
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
<a:GaeunProud:1071073019411300504>
Hey that's what I did last week
<a:patpat:943375983002677290>
you got your wish
luigi's always tired
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
trio is just too dominant
its felt so much longer
bleed is cheaper though
~~neither~~
yeah
expands pickup radius, really only for niche ma strats
you dont have homu m?
but he talked about going back to rl
caught me off guard
ye i mean 17 different ways
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
wtf is hzri doin
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
not griseo paint
vil v bug is
no
ni
oh
yes
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
imagine having her
oh, mobius adv is up
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Not a qua valk

<@434737143395516416> v herrscher of human
addict4
<@416445660443967491>
but i could be rotating wrong <:02shrug:809888510143496264>
i started seeing a difference at 55
personal experience is roughly equal
<:NoU:834906774015574017>
ss1 is plume does more dmg
s2/ss2 is just lead
closer to sss
i'm sss on this next one tho
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
if i finished i'd be ss2 rn
80 pulls to ss then stopped
i was s1 when i started
i really wish i finished that adv for hos
so long as people dont glitch it
this boss is free
my myriad shot is here
i have to actually try this time
But you have ss+ hoh, so Carole for you is right imo
HB isn't used that often anymore either but i value the extra sp you get feom the SSS skill more than shield breaking bosses that don't have shields
Id say hb personally
Carole is used in abyss like
Once every 3 patches ish
Very
Sure
You +100 I'm pretty dure
Oh btw
Cap
Mf down horrendous
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>

Btw
Yo eli
Smoke him
Do it ruby
That's aboose
<a:PRIMOSTEAL:1042623116280594532>
Before nirv was as big as it is though
And has happened before
It's definitely possible
unless 9s, then you get a decent score
no
I'm broke
No
Or 100k
I don't even have 100x
Do my stages
<@416445660443967491> your time to shine
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
I actually might not make it home to do abyss again
<:OH_peepoMagnifying:720101150283661393>
This accurate?
@ ruby
<:worryDasRight:595540930212397057>
You'll never get sniped if you never do abyss
I didn't apply for this one
No interest in susan
just logged in
alr
now
when
How badly do you need cubes lol
Is that the base for dos
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
He's flexing
<a:cocoshoot:742727810304573460>
Round 2
Yee
VoG did not live up to my nostalgia
Happy natsui noises
What's the farmable raid btw this week
And yeah
Tbh i think the best way for me to learn is to solo it
I figured it out mostly lol
Surely I'll do something this time
Sure
If you mean watch you two do it
I can't play until like 6
Die
Oh nice
Its immortal banner this weej
Oh btw
Tet ban his ass
Bro what the fuck
all bosses
thats like
100 crystals
5SPTFE372QHX
in 10
lemme finish trials rq
lemme
i can rq
rn?
,mute
not hard but logn as fuck
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
all games are 9-11 rounds
okie
yes
sure
alri
literally nowhere to duck
who the fuck thought it was good game design to have an open environment with enemies that one shot you
no
this mission fucking tilted me
if you want
<@416445660443967491> im trying trials now
go back 2 genshin
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
right
and in some situations you kinda have to
i dont think there's anything you can do about p2
in p1 im guessing is the friend problem
how you do it
well
but a lot of the time he either jumps or runs to map edge
depends on the rot tbh
these fucking wyverns
i actually ccannot get past the deletion part
:ddeadge:
i want the triumph
the exotic one
<@416445660443967491> this legendary mission is fucking toxic
leak for starfire nerf
<@416445660443967491> 
and not handel gd
im assuming you're running turg gd
personally
i'd say its fine since gd already is using turg, so cant put that on htr
cause mobi really struggled with that pre cf/htr
does pv have cf
which was pretty decent/good scores with f2p stuff
i remember keeby did a series back in the day for budget ma
weapon doesnt count since every valk needs it
why not is my guess
unless trying to show someone its possible with f2p stuff
best way to have fun in honkai is to not play <:worryDasRight:595540930212397057>
i dont own mobi or ss htr
this isnt me
nirv lol
yes
1 more and bounties done
cant win a fucking game though
crimson dropped for me in gambit lol
kk
i'll trials it up tomorrow
first time im logging on all day
time for gambit and defiant
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<@704867526877904908> you see this

<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>

elf hurts but sp is killing him here
0 sp

temp is 476
Not the real aka lol
Arent you a da owner
No mobi
I'm dead this cycle
LOL
Literally just me i think
Ss0 HTR is huge here
I doubt they break 500 ish
You'll beat S0 trio though
Io wins on equal ranks
.
S0 io SS HTR scores higher than SS trio
S0 Io S0 htr scores less than SS0 trio
I think
On equal ranks
IO > trio > solo hoo
Less than SS trio
Believed to be
LOL
weeb

Pog
Apparently harpies can fuck you UP
The entire dungeon
Minotaurs drop liquid, you stand in liquid to get a buff and you follow wires to shoot nodes to connect a path
All I know is follow the wire lol
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
kwtd

Ss0 HT with 7tr and s0 htr is like 770+? Iirc
Tbf here though almost everyone has minimum ss0 ht
6 slots already occupied
In this instance because you're hot gated i wouldnt
I always ask if i need to
Yeah
I assumed not
Is what I expect here
Everything bitches about Otto but 750+ minimum
Just scores are gonna be cancer
This boss is really squishy
Doesn't have to be per se
With max pri
Do you have SSS gd
Although the question is
Scarlet and jiayou pretty good
Yeah campione and Zetsu are 9s
There's like no context on your ping
With what..
What am I doing?

ngl

no
dps doko
hey we're on third encounter too
pog
<:KekDoggo:743295767262789752>
I can't take it anymore. I'm sick of Trio. I try to play PE. My Trio deals more damage. I try to play HFS. My Trio deals more damage. I try to play HoH. My Trio deals more damage. I don't even try to play Nyx. I want to play HoTR. Her best team is the Trio. I want to play Memorial and Abyss - both want Trio. Trio grabs me by the throat. I whale for them. I swipe for them. I give Kiana Turgenev. She isn't satisfied. I pull 4/4 and elf. We need more ranks They tell me. Give me more elf ranks She grabs Bronya and forces him to throw himself off enemies. You just need to swipe more. I can deal more damage with SS. I can't pull for SS, I don't have enough crystals. They grab my credit card. It declines. Guess this is the end. They grab Kiana ELF They say Kiana, get them. There is no hint of sadness in her eyes. Nothing but pure, no id pyro application. What a cruel world.
new copypasta
i'll see what i can find
don't have pull though <:deadge:975652771082698782>
for sherpa runs
its only 1:30 - 2 hours
i think 1770 was minimum?
i give up on spelling
nono
thats what i edited
*contest
on non cintest
6 rat kings beat the boss
i barely made make it with s1 lol
yee
6.1
idr when i got it
also im a beet b owner
really want this and dsc to get me into raiding more
probably gonna run again today though
friend is gonna sherpa me and 2 newbies
planning to in like an hour
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<@416445660443967491> this honestly didnt take long
lumi op
<:FelisOk:1047083219587182682>
<@148145559897636865> this argument again in my server
but if you wanna see darius do it, idk how he and ryuu got 600
you do
im underperforming LOL
nvrmind s0 pe got 602
i found that way to be best for sp and not need as much cleanup in p2
820?
with maybe ~810?
and on that otto just swap to hs > swords (optional) > spear (mandatory) > carole > tap for paga reapply > ult > swap hos > chains > ult > qte pe > charge > lance > normal mode > charge > active

should kill p1 pretty easily
try this for opener maybe:

swap hos > spear > swap carole > jump > (use elf) charge (for gather) > ult > 
swap hos > chains > ult > 
qte pe > evade > gallop for a second > tap ult (for normal mode) >
charge (use elf again) ult immediately (dont use the weapon active here) >
then weapon 4x > charge > 
swap to hos > swords > spear > swap carole >
tap to reapply paga > ult > swap to pe >same sequence as above 

that should give you ~870 - 875 for first otto
ok
im guessing yes from the vid
are you 4* dabber btw
the game paid me back for the bad luck on her gear
i know for a fact both are s0
and rein
thats what darius has
This is like so different than my opener/p1
I bet you have sp issues doing it this way
Lemme watch
But you should still be 580+
Well first I'm s1
<:weirjj:1083018921063485490>
Every gacha is coomer now ig
<:felisokhic:957243524183625748>
not bad for a nirv only valk
just not very well maintained for obvious reasons
apparently those servers are still up
<:oldge:958678264468078603>
damn those were the days
i malded the fuck out of prison of elders too
back in my day
it was fun orb running
i used to be a sherpa
<:oldge:958678264468078603>
i havent touched that since ttk d1
nice
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
someone asked me today but i havent done any encounters
im watching datto's guide rn lol
i will tomorrow
was their response
a friend of mine
<@416445660443967491>
<:binoculars:1048675942261858304>
not just mida
scout rifles were op at some point
i havent touched either since y1
ancient relics
i wanna starfire protocol
kindadont wanna play campaign again
i kinda wanna do warlock
thats not happening for another week
oh
im good now btw was eating
i'll have to check it out
LOL
pinnacle grinding baabee
im 1810 max
yeah
is it not just 1810
i am but im lazy
people were asking earlier
same
from what i saw
its just ad clearing
that sounds right
i still need 5 more
nice
<:naruhodohic:640949385840295936>
ic
does arb work
like galrahn
i thought you were gonna have him walk off the edge
i see
ofc you can cheese it
in a bit sure
pick one
,
no
thats what she said
is way too long
this vex weapon quest
eli
<:meisip:833970844958720010>
fuck that boos
good
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
this in t10 in nirv
<:Hildead:1071073034997342258>
or are they just super low rate
do red affixes only spawn on the expensive reroll
pog
and heph is gonna be annoying with all the elysia
im def dead on wolf, i dont own aponia or s2+ hoo
is rpc still ss1 hot
since some genius decided to have sheilds crit
yeah
not designed to scale this high
me neither
carole ult cd too hard to work around
which is like pulling teeth
you have to bruteforce it to not have to do a mini rot
585+ i think
someone said 600 but i cant see it
darius did one with s0 too if you want it
kyo posted a run with s1 pe s3 hs
you have s1 pe?
def in na
391 <:meowbandage:439762956243435520>
these faces LOL
i feel like i mentioned that and someone said they were the same
im not interested in either
idk lol
look pretty
if prometheus an hare as expected i'll probably just sss hos
what the 6.6 valks are
but ig wait till see
ik lol
i should be ss2 by the end of 6.6
i'll see how my crystal look after susannah
prob not i dont wanna whale anymore
since the first hos advv
?
i mean go ahead but i dont approve
that doesnt mean its garbage?
or homles
you also dont need a second aladdin
sswords is still fine?
what
if you wanna affix game
keep
dupes of full set
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Feel free to try it
SSS or bust
Don't even bother
That's what I did last time
I think paga m gris is fine if no full paga
She gets sp at ss
0
It copies like that
I hate mobile looking through bili site
Wrong link
Bruh
That also helps
Anything more than 3 rots probably
Impossible
Thats
Didn't know they added stickers
Oh this is new
I'm stuck at work
Gres doesn't have refs
That's not much lower than my 1560
With Turg paga hoo
If you really hate yourself try trio
Maybe?
680s?
SSS pe ss2-3 hos
Hell 8S PE was barely 700+
And crits on shield
The guy is just omega thicc
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<a:aworryGaming:945537650146824242>
KR gaming
For the trials things
How to use kebin when game makes me use bronya/kosma
Yeah, it forces you to use certain chars i saw
Ty
Ok, probably just going to hard invest into Kevin for now
It feels like anyway
Isn't mei just a better bronya
Too close range for me
Mei is fun but
Say less
?
It sounds like Kevin and seele
I literally just started 2 days ago
Guys who's the best for the chibi event
<@416445660443967491> this exotic mission is fucking long
Go for fhd then
Because buy it if not
Do you care about SS hos
I still owed you one
I bought you bp & monthly
Not priority imo
You can hold off though
Yes?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I'm at work
or 90 idk
100 i think
past ss0 ranks dont do much
ss1 prob, then stop
ss0 imo is good enough, ss1 makes life easier
no
agree?
also look
im 🇧roke
yeah i'd be lucky too if i swiped until i got it
whale
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I got pinnacles in d2
I'm mia today
No
4/4 hfi
preferably <@416445660443967491>  but i can if he cant
Not both
Lightning DPS or fire DPS
If you don't have hfi
Just use one team
What
Corny
It better be busted
Sure
LOL
I will
Rn I just been reading d2 memes about the expansion
I'm out tonight and tomorrow
Thursday sure
If artbook is anything to go by
Na+eu is still sub 20-25k lol
<:TE_KKonaW:988762034877378561>
Well, for established players anyway
Maybe someone with non max pris and 2* elf will struggle a bit
I don't think t10 is hard at all
I think nirv is large enough to where this doesn't matter on non whale teams
According to fragie it's just as bad
If you accept mediocrity though it's all good
Relatable
4* is only 20 more points lol
This shit is hard lol
With triple s0 4*
Maybe 680 at most
But lemme see
Id imagine ~700
I do not but can prob find it
S2 Mei too because s0 does no damage so the bar is insanely maldy
Even s2 makes a big diff
Yes
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
and how they forced you to play
its cause of story
same
probably
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
idk why i doubled down
same
honestly
<a:KiaNo:1082414311563075706>
not mine im bad
🔪
steal em
yous cammer
that was last cycle
wait
adding them rn
based
that too, but what i've mostly seen is people spending for the fav chars or to have an easy time, their account floats them up, then they lose interest altogether
lol
why so active
they dont have the hands needed for nirv
the whales tend to congregate in agony/rl
wtf
:madge:
i dont wanna play honkai
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
steam wont open
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
wait i cant play d2
flashbang
i forgot pe had a skin lol
<:Hildead:1071073034997342258>
skin is pretty nice ngl
ah
watch the show and find out
dont you want your future da to be stronger
when you do eventually get her
you can get da ranks though
noobs
then you dont want da
stamps get you closer, or at least closer to ranking her up
you said you wanted her
.
whale
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
now time to not do abyss
ok done
ngl
bro this is elite
<:KEKW:687227645301227540>
have you tried doing more damage
based
it starts with fu hua art
it also shipped from il so go steal one
kinda want to not unwrap it
ngl
<:PeepoSupreme:1053548021650038875>
Scuffed pic
Shit is scary
I know someone that did this and had a seizure
<:PeepoSupreme:1053548021650038875>

<a:Whale_luma:458386265776193536>
i forgot cata has s2 hfi
<a:SMH:1021112056063213648>
nope
i do lol
i honestly forgot lol
but its possible to get from here
its very very rare'
im a liar
afaik the witch orb shop is the only way
:vafflao:
hey its vaff
the big whales value one of those at $1000
they'd make so much money
or made it directly buyable
if they implemented 23/23 a way to get it more frequentt
yeah
yeah
it's a random line
oh that
but yes, 23/23 from events guarentees both lines
yeah if naturally rolled but thats only if you're using affix wafers i think
but that's moot
well technically that 23 attack line can be fraction
yep
will 23/23 both lines no matter what
there
45
<@704867526877904908> er done
i forgot how to play black hole spam but hof kinda slaps
wtf cata
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
she was at 5 until hard pity
now gonna do er
there
how many
s0 doesnt make myriad lol

except on qua whale
i dont think anyone came close to vil scores lol
i mean
no you
though i had a bad game
one of these players added me lol
sure
crucible
yes
+10 attack helps more in long run
personally get dk
just saw this sorry
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
yes
kek fucking L
<:PB_galaxy_brain:769652930499575819>
just score higher
<:TE_KKonaW:988762034877378561>
<:Hildead:1071073034997342258>
or the national equivalent
she's gonna have her own tv show on nat geo wild or animal planet
knew everything about everything about it
i used to want to do that when i was younger
thats actually really cool
genuine interest and maybe a complement or two and you're in usually
^
yeah thats where i struggle with too a lot
yee
more points of commonality and way more people
yeah
and eventually some of those turn into friendships i suppose
idk about friends per se but i like to think im good at having conversations
cap
get his ass cata
That's really nice wow

Whales

Once a week good enough personally
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

479
Isn't that just mob bosses in general
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
Ae
Hallo
Every mobi i saw was htr
The team you listed has no gather, so not much people will play it
Sure
^
you also dont have any other elves so
dudu elf is better here anyway
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
better gather
s0
4* elf
mimi got 766 with trio
no clue
because its too mald with klein
people preferred dudu to klein there
yes
klein was painful
mobi actually has a gather elf this time
i'm gonna try trio/hof/vil (cause she worked last time)
i think s0 mobi still wins there
til aster plays d2
Yeah LOL
Vow seems annoying
That was fun to learn
Oh i did dsc yesterday
The dlc expensive
Not my fault
Bro
D2 took my funds
Gresham broke
No
Since I had 4500 xtals
I did 3 more ten pulls
Well, gentlemen agreement
We're not allowed to in NA
Lol
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
The comeback starts now
You got this
but unsure
could also be you're not actually parrying an attack
ah
cutmeo?
what rot
i havent played since beta i wouldn't know
my guess is that you're losing time on the transition though
hoo dps?
<:PeepoSupreme:1053548021650038875>
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>

Yee
At least you yeeted over jason
<a:MatsuriFukireta:707350846899355789>
You saw my pulls
Same
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Yeah, s2 is the never worry about sp again
Wtf
Personally anyway
If you have another roller I'd use it on b
Tbh when's the next time sk comes back in abyss
Idr exactly the number
It saves a lot of sp over the course of a rot
7.8% or smth
If you have like
I'd go for sp redux
Btw S2 hoo= s0 trio
What is going on
And na higher d than sea
Apparently s0 trio 780+ in eu
Idk if that or hoarfrost better
That exotic
I got icefall too
To unlock stasis titan
I'm playing beyond light campaign
Yee
That's why I got it LOL
Everyone did
CC is actually insane
<a:AA_Bye:848470658085552188>
The stasis one
650 doko
And whatever the trace rifle is
Also a fun one
I picked up ace of spades too
Witherhoard and izanagi are some of the most fun I've ever had
On the bright side
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
I was whale pressured again
Very quickly
I hope hoil and cuirass drop
Then i got good
The ogres beat my ass for like half an hour yesterday
I despise it
I'm doing lost sector farming
Cata

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
not that it matters s0 is dead anyway
bakatuna is good too

That thing is busted
Calus something

Mf bough his team enough time to go from 25 motes to kill primeval
A good invader invalidates everything you do
It's awful
I'm also changing my opinion on gambit
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
Best gun in the game
Like i don't think I'd even dare to do it or fight barrier champ without arb
Why are overload champions so aggressive
Hoil farming tomorrow i think
For solar titan
I want lorely at some point
Not even close
Which i dont
I got 3 new exotics in 7 runs
Yes

Rates are pretty good though just for owning the gear
Fucking solar shanks are my new hated enemy
Bro
My new hated activity is lost sEctor farming

<a:KianaWaiting:959737183353307216>

there's 1 full minibar left following kyo's rot
yeah i think im about hard capped
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
before i start balding more
<@171082989046988800> im good now if you are
The rot doesn't change
If you're using the trio team is basically do the same thing you did on bull
Sure
I should be home in like
2 hours give or take
I'm at work
No balls
You won't
Do it
Prowler emiya etc
There's a few
Yes
Boomer
When i started it took  less than a day to hit level 30
Same lol
You could already do that
Ic ic
You want the 300 crystals per account
Oh
Damn
I remember using ch sp ya
Why does no one have the weapon
Looks like Eli already did it
Soon
Such a dalao
Omg
I'll watch later
I'm not in a private room lol
This
Actually are either of those even here
Where's bocchiW
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Yeah
Remember that episode
Black mirror
Carrie's ex did nothing wrong
Who
Now battle storm ref
First phoenix ref
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Could be why
Though i do enjoy her animations
It feels better but it isn't lol
Not necessarily the result
I mean her flying all over the place
Imo
It's fun though
Yeah it is
yo for real
its with 4* sirin too
<a:worREEE:960029171323645962>
he nopes out of there
as soon as i use my weapon active
or like
it always seems to jump on the very last rot
im sick of this dragon rng
i dont wanna go back in though
LOL
ignored it
i literally just
thats what my ref did too
its suppsoed to be cn > htr (ult) > hfs stuff
no wonder i hit pp damage
<:Sweats:959781948274909244>
i fucked up rot 4
oh wait
are your ult damage numbers
where the fuck
bro
its literally the same run
i cant beat pat either
i wont even make t100 lol
so that hurts
im also not ss htr
im leaking damage somewhere
im s2
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
ah
are you s2 hof
i see you now own 4* sirin
<@291907279291285506>
praise trio
this is tthe fastest i've ever done this stage
2 days per rotation
i think it last like
.
the a team
this has beenanswered like 3x now
But I'd wager around 730ish
Unsure
back to hell with me
nvrmind trying hfs again
Gonna try later
A friend got 725
Yeah, I'm just bad lol
i defer to nini ruby
idk if mei's personal damage matters in the trio team
ofc
ah
dont you have furniture to buy
also around 700 ish
i wonder where i messed up then, i didnt watch a ref when i tried trio
hmm
tomorrow prob, not tonight
LOL
so she can keep him in the circle
she acts as an obstacle when beanres lunges
however
okay i sleep
okay yeah s2 hof = s0 hfi, both good for ~700 with the exact same rot
mpe gear was not
mpe stamps were in bp
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
in my experience
yeah s2 hof = s0 hfi
because hfi PUSHES benares out of the circle
htr cn hfi is even more mald
so
attack isnt bad at all on her though
for sk 1 elemental affix line
generally sp/s / spcd
but keeps fucking jumping at the end
im short 10+ points
omg
hate the lizard
Jk i have no clue
Duh
It's setsuna
Should be 9% team tdm
No way
I told you
.ban
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
I'm still at work
S2 hof >= s0 trio
S0 trio outscores hof yeah
I wanna go home
Why am I still her
Unlocking yes leveling no
But might be painful
You can use anything you want
Try sirin first I'm changing my mind
Actually I'm misremembering nvrmind but the damage window is large enough
Iirc
Also
You can do that with sirin
You don't need it
Vs 13s of fire vulnerability
9% tdm
Cause i think 3* dabber is like
I'd try with both tbh
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
You don't need the trauma
You might need the trauma
Who are you using
Found it
Idr what sirin 2 does
Just dudu yeah
Ew
What ranks
What
My answer is below that
.
Look at all the not owned
Omg
<@148145559897636865> 
Duck is actually pretty good
If you have the answers why continue seeking them

Or hoil
<@416445660443967491> i think im getting ashen wake
Ah, I see

Who's waltz partnered with
Phew
Wait o saw dragon in there
What the fuck
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Yeah that sounds right
Old accounts literally have 0 coin problems
Boomer
<:PeepoSupreme:1053548021650038875>
Apparently the outfit isn't an ass pull, it was included in the London holiday manga and it alluded to her being of middle eastern descent too 

so it's not *too far* of a stretch for her to be a dancer, although she's stated to be clumsy

Anyway, outfit is fine, color scheme can change, animations are clunky but it's V1, i expect them to be smoother
The actual dancing and movements flow fine, idk how I feel about the gameplay

Not a fan of the osu game, and not a fan of how much damage a free valk is able to spit out (though V1) 

Last sp valk was dj and last real good free valk was hawk so no real precedent for it ig

Tl;dr i like her, but idk if I'd pull
Double was only a stage effect for  6.3
Enjoy your one ego signet start
Okay i have an opinion now
<:TE_KKonaW:988762034877378561>
Oh definitely
Spin 2 win
Apparently aka already dropped 831
<:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>

Whale

Better question

So it's fair yeah

<:MiyanoCheer:545769909934751766>

<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
ahhh
shenye/ayaka right

LMAO
3.7 was years ago
Can't afford ranks lol
And I'm not swiping outside of bp+ monthly anymore
Ss2 does nothing
SSS is okay
Inb4 290 pulls for 4/4 + valk and i uninstall
<:A_PainTao:801197005975060480>
That's with the box though
92 for 3/4
I was off slightly
790 yeah
It's demoralizing
Off of 152 pulls for s0 4/4 htr last patch
S0
No
Yeah
It took 10-15k more than it should've
For everthing
I still did worse on average
Vs Keeby who got it all in 33k
Over 75k for everything
It's 30 points if you do somehow
You're 768 with no elf
That's what I thought
You're s2 right?
Ask anyone here
Very
Yes
But it's fun, i like
<:worryTrauma:792772342278389780>

ss trio gets 790 too
cause this (ss1 htr) scored 790
ah
before you activate
enemy needs to be on field
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>

<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
that was only 3 patches ago
i'd uninstall if we did
nah
not bad
max s0 att around 1478-1480
owomath 6.9+.2+.3
ok
6.9 basically
owomath 46 - (21.5+17.6)
or ma
i dont wanna do event
or play d2
should i play more
do it
meanwhile my inventory
but yeah themes are ae/dj
ahhh
they did
just read comments
no didnt watch
just found a ref and poof
i played beta so have a good feel for the valks already
you and eli were planning/coaching
tbf
i do too nini
the person above me
twinsies
from stigs outside of mirage
we could transfer affixes
i wish
i only have enough for 2 rerolls
i want 1460 on her but i have no locks or mats
<:Hildead:1071073034997342258>
hfi has 2 dead lines
slight
okay fixed my affixes
same
same yumi
I wasn't kidding
Oh 9D dominating everything
Too much d2
I've been so out of it though
On bull
I think ma s0 trio scored 47776
The bull in abyss
I think S2 HoO won over s0 trio
For this boss specifically
Actually
Again idk though
But i think s0 trio is better than s0 mei / s0 Kiana in their respective teams
I haven't paid much attention cause d2 ngl
But it's dominating everything LOL
9S yes
Otherwise its fine for the basic stuff
Not s0-ss
And it all works because it's 9S
And it's slow for mei
For hfi the buffs run out
For these valks
Tutorial is garbo
<:OMEGALUL:827381886787518464>
Owomath 1 + 8
I get the joke now
<a:nomballs:1056949905127637002>
You cant copy shaft
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
Sleeper patch
Nevermind i saw it
Off to work i go then
Something to complain about later
What
I just woke up
Saw what
Switch CD big, does pretty good dmg
Dabber gather significantly better
It's rumored we get a phys elf soon too but
Ye
2* dudu isn't bad i think
Ye
Wedge still used in nyx team but desd otherwise afaik
Fuxi is somehow still barely hanging on
Sirin died this patch yeah
if you do get klein you're pretty much stuck until spending events to rank up eventually
Why Klein specifically
you get a switch cd but the forced qte is 3*
2* klein is useless mostly
ik
something to consider
2* kiana is comparable to 4* sirin/4* klein in terms of damage
dj at this d would be miserable
3 of them are husk
but idk how much free stuff we get
i wanna say its a long shot
oh 0
how much you have now
hmm
so max for both basically
depends what pities you're at now
so great patch mihoyo
and im pretty much done swiping outside of monthly/bp
like everything is depleted
its the only reason she's maxed rn
in 50 pulls it was weap weap t t m
i pulled 2 weapons in a single ten pull
cata ask eli
Except maybe rebooting
Everyone except Tet had cursed pulls
<@416445660443967491> was talking about that
Garbage game
Over 15k what i expected to spend
It took over 75k for s0 4/4 hfi, mei gear and 3* elf
I had 34-36k i think? I have cards and stuff too
Two back to back shit banners
I stopped counting
At least 130
Hfi gear?
From 73 pity, so kinda bad
HFI took 60 ish
Which isn't bad
Elf was like 60 - 80 for base > 3*
60 for hoo gear 3/4 iirc, whoch isn't bad
Disgusting
Apparently beta is delayed too
@ nini
clears in 55 seconds
sss hfi
so she isnt getting a rerun this patch'
yeah
this is now incorrect
a mod should probably post this in annoucements
btw
who knows
my account is a barren wasteland
25 25 25 25 
60 60 60 70
yes 250
carry me
<@704867526877904908> <@416445660443967491> lets play this weekend at some point
Use it for your most favorite valks
Save
If anyone wants to see
Oh i recorded my annual report
You did that for a whileee
The hot fr pv
Mecha tona
Remember tona
I like her a lot
<:smug_wuzetian:885755258935078912>
She overperforms in proper hands
Fr for sure
Yeah, just a bit
It was shadow dash nvrmind
Shadow dash
Or some mei, idr which one
I remember back in the day we had the best danzai player on the server lol
Way different
Hor cancels from the hor guy
Ns cancels
I could see that
Oh 100%
But rn d2 is king there for my time
Like it would replace smash or other fighters for me
Would be a very fun side game
It usually is
On the high end
Tbf
I'll actually uninstall on the spot
I think honkai would be a dope hack and slash
Ngl without the gacha
That's fair
for this new fu Hua suit
My hope is really high
If the rumors are true
Not this qte in swap out stuff
I'm similar to keilo, i like the more Technical stuff
Pretty much
I hate that it happens so often
You feel strong
You can evade and not retaliate for some bosses, which was an annoying part of it

The actual gameplay is very fun though, i agree
I just didn't like retaliation
I forgot it can miss LOL
Ohh i see what you mean
Oh?
And ns to an extent
SSS tp
Yeahhh
I remember that
To those bosses
It basically eliminated all alternatives
For the game i mean
But it was well balanced before that imo
Abyss flower was so bad at the time
Imo
It started with bk/sa
In all honesty
And iriya
Phi and Theo yeah
Mihoyo got too big
But it definitely ain't the same anymore
<:TeriGalaxyBrain_lum:624389598801428480>
Ahhh
With hf
Cause it was fun then
Were you a 2020 ish player?
I'm a whale and I'm pissed about it
You should be
Is how I see it nowadays for the actual Gacha part of it
I'm uninstalling because i had awful luck
Vs
It's just, hey i didn't get Uber fucked this time
Yeah ik what you mean
Or counter side
I can't speak to other Gacha like priconne
For me I live for the competition in honkai specifically
And fun when you're competing or pushing your acc to the best possible performance
It's fun when you don't shitsacc every banner
I havent seen any graphs
Whatever citrus has
Fuck you keeby
All the zoomer whales burnt
Idk about ice but he's not whaling hard anymore either
Campione maybe
That's it
Zetsu
Velskud
Styx
I'm feeling burned out
Starting tomorrow

Wog
So much time off and pto
I miss schools (state basically)

Yee
Well
If i pull weapon last
If i pull the stigs I'm fucked
I'll stream this pulling session too i think 
Mei gear > 3* elf > Kiana and stuff
True
S0 forces you to learn the animation cancels
Nvrmind
It's good enough for us
It's good enough for mimitsu
Yeah mei gear should be like 40-50 pulls i think
I don't have 2800 for honkai
6-700 per person
Also this patch is like
Can you believe thursday is update day
His 100000 monthly checks
Yeah
it's only 40 dollars plus a little extra uk
I thought we agreed with <@309634550273933314> and <@416445660443967491> that your bf was funding us
Cap
For short fights
There's a reason zhenyi tb was recommended on literally everyone
Yeah lol
Well
Beta made me not want to play honkai until we get the new chars tho
Actually added everything
Twas fun when they uk
Also have been busy so never got to tell you about beta since you asked
Actually nvrmind carv is gonna bonk me

<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
i think it has nqn too?
but that wont work for stickers
its got really good emotes
join the server
2015 was eververse
you're right, the first year was f2p
people always bitched about that
with the cosmetics
havent they always
even back with crota in d1
i remember legit every expansion being ~40 or 50 on release
its always beena problem i mean
oh i know
idk
this new game is just like
just not spending anymore
tbf honk i enjoy a lot, literally the only game i play
when stuff you buy literally gets removed from the game a year or 2 later
nor is it that good of an mmo
this is not a cheap game
yeah
72 bucks for 2 dlc packs is insane though
ic
quicksilver?
i'll probably finish witch queen today and pre-order lightfall
yeah
but i could get all 3 when legacy goes on sale in a month or 2
exactly
ya
actually nvrmind i wait for legacy collection
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
why is standard + season cheaper than standard
regular is 18.50
deluxe
<@416445660443967491> should i buy
<:worry17jail:1074828651176140843>

I did try mpe yesterday though
Outside of the bull was okayish
It feels like a chore with every valk <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I can't escape
<@416445660443967491>
That both teams played defense
Just wish uk
Yeah, pleasantly surprised
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
<@416445660443967491>
riku's pic and acc yeah
cause a lot of bke mald was that
and not retaliate
did you ever do evade
100%
its feathers
for me its like
if im scoring that low with the alternative then why bother playing the boss, uk?
s1
even alice did better than me
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>

hopefully thats enough
im going into 6.4 with ~60k worth of crystal
destiny 2 dlc

with ely tb carole on triple supports
it takes two rots to kill p1
but i cant be bothered
someone is sniping so this is cutoff
fuck this lol
cant kill the boss
i actually
yeah, they came out of nowhere
they should have the conditioning for it to not matter *too much* but
red team defense has been out a lot the first half
<@385655541248163840> 14-28?
destiny brainrot took all my honkai time

We're having
<@704867526877904908>
Omg
I can already feel the ring rust
<a:naruhodo:842387323336917013>
What is gambit
Back in my day
2017
Like
I'm *ancient*
Probably not
I know light fall coming
Light 3.0 good to start in?
Nini redownload the game with me
Warlock was fun
Oh i remember
Bitch ass hunter
Pew pew
I remember that one
I remember
Copy
That was the one i remember
Ohhh, so wtf is the slam
Wtf is the missile
Or defender for raids?
Not sunsetter
?
You said striker best
Fuxk
Do they still have t Rex arms
Good
But i hate hunter
I know for hunters, if you have the right void build you're permanently invisible, if you have the right arc build you're permanently regenerating
What's the best class nowadays
I might reinstall d2 on Friday eli
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I opened 3 pictures and it looks like the loading screen for d2
Never touched really
I heard of it
True true
Oh right, i forgot about that game
Unless you count like borderlands 2 or something
Not really that I'm aware of
We just said clan for fps games
Basically the same thing as guild etc
For clans though for me
Man this brings flashbacks
I don't know if I ever played an MMO proper
Where's my +25 wep ruby
Relatable
Was a mistake
I replaced it with gacha
100%
A lot in d2 pre forsaken and just 
Got tired
Thousands of hours in d1 alone
But i relate so hard to this
I have to look in depth
Prob
Hunter
Idr
It's a leg exotic
I was deceived
Oh wrong name
I think
Bettet
I hear it's busted
What's the new exotic btw
Can I still kill an entire team
What about striker titan
Wtf happened
What
Is void warlock still cracked
Keep me away
Ib trials crucible etc
Vog wog
Ik
Or how much did they change shit
To level up light
It takes forever though no
Cause ei have a P4 still
Oh ok
Is cross play a thing
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I retired in 2017
Never
Eli when vog
<a:TE_docGAMING:900711568084451338>
Solit yumei and a couple others
I know neal
Uhh, idk
Like buz or kestrel
Another whale
Ziazis
Yeah
Shark
The booba one
No
Idr which
That was in like one of the harder game modes
I might pick up cs again
I tried for 5 minutes and couldn't be bothered
I wouldnt know
Pgr
Not to play
I meant for guide
Mte
Are the crystals even worth the effort
Until 4* imo
Sirin is mid anyway
For trio
Yeah sirin is garbo
<a:aKKtouchgrass:954049690901544990>
First time i ever missed a login
I didn't play honk either yesterday
I'm busy irl
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I haven't touched beta in days
That's <@416445660443967491> and <@291907279291285506>
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
Who uses 2* elves in beta
Probably
Honestly
I didn't even read the 2* skills
Idk what elf stuff looks like
Probably 400 ish
Yes, ryuu
Almost certainly aka posted
I can find it
Wdym clearly mods know better than us plebians
Only monthly/bp
Same
Glb will
Yes
Buy everything in 6.3 so you can be f2p in 6.4
Instead of splitting it the way I did
I'd be broke
Honestly if I pulled the 150 fully on htr
Not counting expa/foca cards
31k
I think i have like
Did you rob me in my sleep
Excuse me
I might get lucky
I want the 8% tdm
It's good enough for me
It's good enough for mimi
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
Use tokens for 4* Klein and s1 hof
Pull mei gear > pull 3* elf> pull hfi and gear > pull 4* if there's enough
<a:crydead:869102726716465202>
<:gasp:586922305515421709>
Owo 8ball will nini fund me 6.4 valks
<:FallenQiqi:1017560028451983501>
<a:QIQIShoot:890718532524990546>
You've got the strongest char in the game
Trust
I'll rank mei instead
But i do
When you topping up my acc
~~i dont mean you~~
Thats what aster said heki
Didn't you people not like epi anyway
T3 is cq
T1
Hey a name i recognize in rl
Everyone whaled
It's hoh
I think type counter weather specifically is +20%?
+30% damage when you counter the enemy's type
I'll watch later
Oic
Uma shocked me
Idk where this is from though but i believe it
a non whale *physical* durandal
fair
maybe we'll finally get a non whale durandal
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
trio would be the one
if you had to swipe for one patch
trio taking over everything
my money's on hr
type counter hos
no no
bleed hos
which is insanity
there was a 9s bke strat that needed literally every hit to crit
not *that* much, so long as the big things (weapon active and qte) crit big
thats actually not that bad of a run iirc
but it really showcases the level of skill these guys have
the only mald is the dodge on hos after griseo cross drop
back when nirv was rl temps it may have been this
prob this
lol
but i can find the highest scoring one
that depends on disturbance
right, but you dont have to waste points swapping
cause you'd apply that purple in p2 for the big rot
nah, you're good with ult/yellow
cause you have to reproc cez anyway
ult then purple is right
sss ely?
at least 20
probably enough for t15
the sss would net you an extra 20-30 points yeah
ssg
because the spcr = reduced stacks on hoh = reduced damage?
ah, so switched to attack
<a:bloodlao:959706412685099038>
great job
hey i called it
shut
are you kb or controller
after they delayed it too
thats awful
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<a:patpat:850500624630022154>
yeah, you did good
ahh
you'll end up t30s
its early
nini is the 9s player here

ree

<:Fubuki_Grabby:828297136927801374>

he does try to help, and genuinely cares if you're willing to listen
they've both said that too lol
oh 100%
tbh that's a *lot* of the higher end honkai players (not directed towards fragile btw just in honkai)
its boring since marisa left

@ cayjunn

Well duh

Ryuu and sickle only
I just backread this is so free wtf
No
in a short  fight like this imo
at least 30
i think you'll be okay though
is pretty big lol
sss pardo
for lumi
myriad should be free yeah
impossible for me to catch you
im s1
2 runs got 747, idk if i really want to bother improving that
kinda wanna dont
i kinda wanna mald
up to 47% ice dmg vs 12 tdm 26 ice
that, idk
i always just math'd it out
though i cant imagine you'd ever *not* want ss hoh lead
i havent seen anything about this boss since last time though
it was last time iirc
<:02shrug:809888510143496264>
minimum maybe
800
umm
oh ss1
780
Made one for pe
Karto
Or keeby
Like Iriya
But very strong player
Not comfortably recently
The man is a day 1 player
BP and monthly
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>

<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
When new hua suit
<a:MobiusWave:959751826335486023>
@ mobius
But not a priority
Ss1 is nice for the extra bar
Not really
I hate it
SS hor sounds good
This is the most annoying part of this game lol
Unsure <:02shrug:809888510143496264> but probably 50?
I think lightning, maybe one more if you can spare the al
No shot you get SS ae, so that's -2 fire
If you have SS hot lightning would be good
Ice will take a while
Phys will take a while
VK PX BR AE fire dmg dealt 5% at S, 7% at SS
SK LE HT lightning dmg dealt 5% at S, 7% at SS
HR 6S Meme ice dmg dealt 5% at S, 7% at SS
GK KM VE SN phys dmg dealt 3% at S, 4% at SS
MC BN total dmg dealt 2% at S, 3% at SS
AK CH DB ele dmg taken (by your own valk, i.e. useless) -5% at S, -7% at SS
Stealing This pin
-1 -6 -6 -6 -4
Cause usually the answer is invest in the team you use the most
And what are existing dorm buffs
What team do you care about most rn
Depends
It was a good run
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
But i haven't seen or tried
Prob can too
If you wanna try the hr jk team
Hr can prob clear this too
Unless the spider is rampaging when you're using it
That stage skill is a boatload of dmg
You might have to delay somewhere to get it
Because I'm wondering if you're using that
That's *with* the stage skill?
Is it a damage issue or are you running out of sp
Non max pris huh
spiders are no joke without bk
shit is hard
yeah everyone has that complaint
<:omegaLUL:963414821984935937>
my score is garbo if you wanna improve
i did 2 runs and left
@ finnix still nirv lao

i have too much damage in p1 so i have to gimp it
with sa
this hs dps is fucking mald
bruh
for like trio team
so i have to keep cutting
i keep trying to do stuff at s0 and its too much damage
i cant imagine anything higher than s2

My kills depend on if he stays in circle or not
That happened to me earlier

This was the most whaled valk for a long time

Yes
it looked way smoother from what i saw
sea gaming
damn
with the amount of ss+ htr and hof on this server
i expect benares to have an insane turnout
well
pe and benares too tanky for na i suppose
this is 66
there's 3 ss+ htr's in there
majority is this lol
maybe 9 people snipe
dead server
sub 600 might make t100
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
i should've finished this b4 jumping in area 3
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

i think either holmes tm newt B or swwords if you cant one shot
holmes drac is a lot of sp but like i think you'd run it if you cant one shot anyway
<a:whalepat:899061677583122432>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

I got it only for the art
It's been a while
Fu hua knight M
Cause p2 is so tanky
PE or cope

Newt i believe
There's seele pics
Eli will like it
I forgor
Oh that's right
I vaguely remember someone saying i did way more damage with SSS
Was it you btw nini that i was streaming for
Mainly cause of the paint thing
That boss was one of the harder ones
Go for it
Oic
Unique DPS for every boss
Probably the best schedule in a while
I don't think we have much unbearable bosses imo
Anyway my policy hasn't changed between tolerable and unbearable bosses
The boss or the character?
?
You seeing this
@ keilo
pe's i think is the worst offender
just dont lose to meow
spirit is kinda good
gwent is good too
duggle curisu and tka huh
mostly fire cycles
you even used hotf in off weathers in singularis
dominated all content
hotf/ns/sp yeah
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
why is the only 474 vid ss pe
yeah
this is rl though
abyss compilation
ohh, i see
nvrmind that was hod
i think reptar did okay with triple ice supports
pretty much
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oh shit right refs
its not a bad idea
if stream doesnt make your internet go to hell
well
by not plugging her headset in
nini just chooses to ignore me
way easier than typing
its just
you decided to go after all
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
you got this
<:OMEGALUL:875231356160978964>
rememebr when we had the study corner
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>

what actually happens in my city
that arent 484D
time to look for fgo refs ig

i forgor
abyss ended
ohc shit right

<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>

<:safe_hh:710968174887305311>
<a:kree:809653433455214632>

Congrats though
Where'd you get the asterite
So uh
I can't even top myself up
Gl though
Wtf
Actual kraken
Granted I couldn't find anything lower than 484D
The gloves should make it fine i think
FGO
Ssg cherry
Hoping lol
Well
I'm assuming that's the case
He said he did but he really didn't
It's not the same channel anymore
Yeah I noticed that literally every mod and cc hangs out there now lol
I can't even do mine
Is #cn-pin-discussion still a mess?
Same tbh
I wake up on kosma
Either s2+ htr, 1.2ish+ sp on htr s0, or have 2* fuxi
Of these, i have none
I'm so annoyed I'm locked out of 946 aka lol
Fuck
I need to 680 huodou
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
Owomath 47664+39840+31893
Iirc
That's her B stig
she used to 946 huodou too
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>

<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>

Ic
Oh you're maxing that weapon
I did for rebel blades though
I didn't swipe
Shut
Just enough
I have like 500 left
Ah

I think i may have bricked my account
What the fuck
<a:ChillBar_hairflip:1002335682095743066>
Ic ic
Damaged?
I do mine like every 3 weeks
Ssg
Waiting for a haircut
I'm not home yet but you can
I'd probably turg
Yeah gl lol
<@434737143395516416> s bastet
You cant freeze assaka easiky
Gotta lower that purity somehow
T do the same
It's trying to inspire you
Mine seems okay
HTR op lol
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I'm 4th there too
Damn
And not mine like us peasants
She can swipe anything she needs
You're talking to an oil tycoon kith
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I'm like 90% sure i +0
Kith will happily do it lol
I'm a krill in an ocean of whales
This is rot limitations
Even more so than hof and pe
*easily* the most whales valk on na
But i also don't focus on myriad when hoh is involved
For me anyway
It's always been good enough to +100
Can't relate
And I'm the whale
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
Just take the L here and come back on rpc
And 5 mobi frags
3/4 mobi too
And no sw
I have 3/4 sw lol
Not my fault I offrates it
Wtf
I still have cb tho
And it's slightly more damage
It's easier to kill mobs that's for sure
I got 643 with cb and 651 with lvl 50 fflare pri lol
Maybe a few points fastwr
It's about the same
I like that Nini ignored the millions remark
I can't afford Herman Miller
Bro i thought I was getting written up today lol
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
The only thing I'm buying is BP and monthly
I'm not swiping
Not as much as Nini's millions <a:Smoge:808844088115068938>
<:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
Guys i got a raise at work
Like this
Conductive op
Gloves are flexible
Mag definitely
Maybe
Of the io runs
I just posted a vid heki
My link
Oh wtf
You dont
With htr
That's a 946 now
That's actually viable lol
Hmm
No io because you use le io on aka
You ignored her
Actually mpe is pretty decent but uh
Just use PE 5head
Imo save
You don't use Eden In Abyss for the rest of this patch
And only 2x more in ma
Bring back JST Newt B BD abyss
Still better since you need to qte sus in
Somewhat weakened by hb but
Htr lead is pretty strong
Try that
JST?
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Turg if you have it
Miserable
Rc works but God she is
If hoh then hoh sus hb
If htr it's htr sus hb
But cez ig
I wouldn't use RC here
People shat on it without figuring out the optimal rots
Yeah its fine
i did mine lol
keep
still very impressive to me
i forgot about this
which makes sense at 484D
its ss pe
watching that vid again im blind
oh wait
iirc
but only twice or smth
i think it stacks
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
owomath 47632+39853+31946
sss otto
jesus
owomath 39853 *1.2
but dude had holmes cez B on hos and cez tb on griseo
there was a holmes s0 that 700+
 new gloves sswords
 nebs sswords
 senpri sswords
this is just silly lol
iirc s0 was pretty good on fgo with these, would have to look
they moved mkp's passive to a weapon active and just threw another 30% for a passive
i see why the new gloves are so strong
ic ic
so sss cn s0 htr s2 hof 3* elf > s0 hfi s2 HoO s0 htr 3* elf
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
<:_omegaLul:827537466109853737>
holy shit they botched the cutscene
i see what you meant now lol
lvl 50 pri lol
okie i done
already?!
<:susge:830321489064230952>
if you need help with abyss
i can be but idk the sw runs
good bye im done
assaka just combo'd me to death
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
the missiles have to hit a mob
you've gotta wait in the beginning
but who knows <:02shrug:809888510143496264>
i matched his score at +5D with HoH
yeah i dont buy it
cb is fine
ah
so her stigs are gimped
you cant freeze assaka easily
yes
she's kinda not that good at s0 anyway
but im not buying it
fragile says s0 htr > s0 hoh
this is s0 btw
with 1 atk line
better than i expected
hmm
or 1/4 sus
no one told you to s0 sw
<:Harold_lum:657441749404221447>
what the fuck
why are all of my er runs garbage
sss skill doesnt even help here
sw rankups are garbo past ss
9s aponia is scoring over 800
beyond ss0 yes
sw/apo > hoh
I'm logging off early lol
Oh I'm not kidding
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I haven't even left yet
<:Thiccpensive:1002519673163747338>
<:teehee:610396865611038730>
Well you can but
Resistance dummy high
You cant freeze assaka anyway
I think I'm logging off early
~~if you didn't enjoy it~~
Im gonna smack you
Wtf
Madge
Is REALLY good
HTR
Nini get me out
Wtf
Last minute meeting until 5
FUCK
Omg
I think you're okay
Mimi and agent are wildcards
Tenshi is okay
Ryuu is god
Good
Feoran is goo
Weak bracket again
Wtf
I did not deserve to +100 lol
But keilo right bracket determines your retain lol
Not just sw anymore
Because this is now a sw/aponia boss
Who's in your bracket
About the same as Nini not SS'ing mei
@ ruby what is this
Nvrmind it's SSS Huodou
Probably not
cmere Nini
Just saw this LOL
Big and soft
Of fucking homu
The return
Bruh
<@309634550273933314>
It's so hard to update pins you know
<:meisip:833970844958720010>
<@309634550273933314> do mod stuff
It killed eli
Well
<a:whalepat:899061677583122432>
The eu kraken
With the hu tao pfp
Not Harv, the other one
And that other strict ass mod
Bring buz back
Main cord
Make
No
Worth
Okay that was a lot
Wtf
<:TeriJuicy:959782559376617502>
Wow you aren't kidding
But i really wanna see
I really should be working
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
Nini's pimp stage
?
I'll slap you instead
I think
Idr 100%
Or smth
The 10% for trio ult
She has 0 support capability until ss
Also
<:terifrownarms:960001216107147345>
You caused this
Ult lightning damage +60%
Degens all of you
Good thing I'm in break room omg
<:madge:861416927095422996>
ie I'm taking the bait
Only reason I'd thinking of ranks is cause 50 pulls is insanely cheap for s2
Vs ranking one of them
Yeah id rather s0 all elf and get 3* elf too
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
Guess I'm going for 4*
@ catasaurus
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
From another server
Trio team is not the wave here i guess?



Hmm
This mf plaing honkai in class
Ssg
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
6s is one of my favorite valks personally
glad they added her
i think adori opened with mobi here
but im not sure <:02shrug:809888510143496264>
try mobi 1 if anything
mobius1 eden2 should be her strongest cores in general, with stars 2
i like his how to vid though
oh nvrmind, for the one run he has he opens with stars too
i liked citrus more tbh
the rentry one?
and dont mind your chaaracters sharing gear
i think what ruby said is good then
ogier/glut T fu hua musician mb if you have them
yeah thankfully
top was 744, close for literally everyone else
<:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
just 0/4
like no turg and stuff or
define no gear
ah
unless im misremembering
isnt that tomorrow's chapter?
and kallen obv
i can only think of sheild otto that needs it
ie is it worth me doing a discounted 10 pull next patch of it if i have M already
is paganini still relevant
really bad
bad
yeah
oh you whaled her right
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
there's like no s0's
hh boss cycles are vicious
so i'd imagine a lot more people are struggling
not a lot of balders either
t100 is top 100 scores on the server
t100 maybe
thats not that surprising?
eli wanted competition
which is like 66 pulls
no worries im just gonna assume its same as valk
or a teleport like one similar to hod idr
there's a head swivel move it does that may have iframes
so it can dodge your ult and charge aetc
well the bull can move around a lot right
yeah the ult can miss LOL
just dont die
bleed hos is bio
melee hoc is da
so i can make fun of her
you can try it
if you beat joy
i gonna laugh
<a:gaeunclap:850940986972307477>
i wasnt there
decipher this one now
this?
vs s0 s2 and 4* elf
s0 s0 and 3* elf maybe 4* if crystals left
plans changed
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
i dont mind though i really badly needed that torus
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
i'd have more if gear didnt absolutely fuck me
since i didnt pull beyond s0 htr
raw crystal is most of that
only have like 44k
<:fake_hh:710968174979317861>
i dont wanna swipe if i dont have to
nah
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
lot of really good ones
bundles next patch, + 
Special bundle: 5 focused 100 crestl, 980 b chip. 1 per day, 10 days.
Elf bundle 1: 5 tix, 300 chip. Unclear how many tiers.
fuck
i only have like 44k worth of crybbal
LOL
ic
set up like adv right?
thats still over 20k xtal
someone said s2 is guaranteed at 50, and hard pity for her gear is like 40-50
assuming worst case
if s0 4/4 hfi + s2 4/4 hoo + 4* elf
i need ~85k then
oh kill me
whats the average to s0 4/4 a valk
the nini strat
not whale
im trying to not swipe in 6.4
moret than enough for my spending event target but ugh
thats already 56k jesus
+28k for s2 hoo/gear
fuck
owo math 150 * 180
but still
40+70+70
o
assuming 50+70+70 for 4* i guess 190-200 pulls?
however
i cant actually find this info
im just assuming 70 per card
which i s like 75 per card ig
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
it took me 150 for 3* ely
thats not bad
not mine but damn
from a different player: my elf average is 92.667 for 3 cards
does anyone know the average amount of crystals for 4* elf
or the average amount of pulls for an elf card
who knows though, esp if the hof htr ai team works about as well as hfi htr ai
but thats inting for the other bosses
if these numbers correct 
trio 9S gets 821
trio 8S (ss htr) 810+ 
SSS HoO (ss htr) ~800
SS HoO 780+

S0 kiamei S2 Htr 761
SS HoO SS1 Htr 780
because ss0+ scored around the same as trio team on abyss bull
someone considering ss0 HoO instead of s2 HoO s0 HFI
hm
hot can 946 heim if you want to mpe tank
how
LMFAO
teri hub
ya
<:susge:830321489064230952>

<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
i hope its ganesha
<:02shrug:809888510143496264>
isnt that assuming you clear sides
you lose xtals going to nirv dont you?
not promote
you can just
but she isnt really good
i had a vid somewhere
she did 500 in cn
non sss is inting
a good one anyway
mpe isnt even an option
yes
but assaka sucks without aponia or sw
thats up to you
f2p cant afford every banner
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
pog
but i like the feeling of being actually threatened
ss htr easily takes top in my bracket
besides i like this style of play more
i'll tell that to the 8 kosma's we've had
for what lol?
1 boss we never dps on again?
have nini donate it to your charity
not +0
i want +100
oh shit let me check in i even retain
i dont even like doing mine
i can post in kei's channel but i cant edit their messages
assaka
So no real loss
You can just use that for hfi pri
Also if you still have the other weapon
Yeah lol
And he's always used wedge
Even Keeby got Ely elf here
Without elf
Jia was missing two full bars in p1
In nirv anyway
Ely elf *really* matters here
He's fucked
Jia got 705 with ~same team/stats
Somewhere between there
1328 or 1347 or something
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
<a:praygirl_hh:757338631747928161>

He has yt if you wanna watch
And ss3 jk
Riku s SSS hoh
I'm 681 lol
Pog
Really?
But I'll look again later
I didn't see any hoh refs this time
I saw 1 htr ref that scored poorly
Assaka waiting room
Not gonna look into it <:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
I think ss1 jk s0 htr can do it just not my acc (this is with using rc)
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
Fragiles s0 run worked for mimi but that mf 3s jk
This is s2 but strong run
If you have ss2 sushang you dont
Well
It's annoying
You have to clean up
No
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
For s0 it makes this boss have the same mechanic as ma clock 

The gears/orb
It's honestly not bad
So i tried htr dps
i wouldn't
if you avoid skins its a pretty normal/good game imo
the worst of it is limited to skins
if you want it its there but
like
way more
i just enjoy xl and hilde
i dont even have steam installed
i like hilde ok
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
hilde my new pfp now
sorry hua
look
rude
context
4/4 in 20 5head
o
and burned them on ss ely
remember when you had all those crystals
and floating enemies
no core to oneshot because p2 *is* the core
if not 9s
pe is garbo yes
s0 wastes so much time farming sp
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
700+ is free with s2
its not that high <:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah fuck this back to ht
i wanted to play around with ht
nono
not ht dps
use htr dps
i lost so much time sp farming on ht
i should actually htr huh
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
that extra sp matters here
im copying s2 rot with s0
no fucking wonder
im retar
oh nvrmind
the rot itself is easy but damn this sp management on htr annoying
ht dps is fucking hard lol
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
this is the real game
you're weird
Nini this you?
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
I do Abyss tomorrow
<:bronyapogjuice:923467239259271229>

<a:aWorryLurk:687722154598465551>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Imo anyway
Like these recent boss releases have been some of the hardest we've had in recent memory
With everything being so braindead now
I think what they did is that they moved the difficulty from the valks to the bosses lol
🚑
not yet i woke up not that long ago
its been out right?
but yeah i think sirin hasnt been worth in a long time
<:TE_PepegaBlind:967928246878502972>
oh aka said that
yeah
sirin wouldn't even work with trio that well cause no two fire
akayuki on kiana elf:

15% more overall damage than Sirin (just without the ignite); and
8% more overall damage than Klein (without Paralyze and forced QTE)

Sirin is really bad because her bonus skill to increase her fire damage taken from 10% -> 15% does not work in Trio because it needs 2x fire type in the team. Sirin's debuff also only lasts 13s and has this massive lag on use that everyone hates. Kiana ELF also gathers (what the aforementioned 2 ELFs can't do), and covers 2 elements at once. In fact, if I remember right, her Ult CD is also the shortest in the game at 31s (the standard was 35s).
[12:26 AM]
wow lol
where'd that leak go that this would happen shortly after 6.4?
🐌
oh jayson posted this already

<:hildeconfused:844846746461798430>

It's kinda annoying ngl
Transition
Isn't that every boss for you?
But you dont watch refs anyway right?
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
@ ruby more kr gaming
cause the bars mess with everybody differently for different ranks lol
i think the ma one is actually the only boss in this game right now where you can't really share rots
but abyss is easier now without the fps mald
i still think the ma one is toxic
both
i'll just take the L this week and on huodou week
dont really have time this weekend or next weekend to play much
i'll try again next time ig
<:worryDasRight:530043361411989514>

vil is pretty undertuned though
i dont think people realize how strong hof is LOL
hof scores way higher now too
amazing what happens when you have modern supports
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

kasumi also just
its just so much more damage
yeah i have no clue how to 786 this
why is kasumi so much harder with sss lol
im actually asking though, it would just be the bonus phys?

<:tericross:902580093304586320>
but i havent seen any negative either for abyss
i think people were confused because it can apply to husk clone and the bke shield hits in ma
isn't it better most of the time?
<@416445660443967491>
maybe i should join that server
damn marisa beat me to it
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
join me nini
im f2p this patch lol
i thought this would happen to me
this is why i didnt wanna go for ranks lol
crowdfunding
i still want my seele hod <:tericross:902580093304586320>
or rushed there rather
it feels like we limped to the finish imo

if mihoyo didnt patch it
it was stonks
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
for that bke rot
2 on hos 1 on bastet m one on aslaug
actually im a liar
idek how i burned 4 \
i should've kept those sp/s ones
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
an attempt was made
breach idk but she has a shitton already
im thinking ele damage diluted <:deadge:975652771082698782>
also true
i havent seen much ss gameplay but isnt breach a bit diluted, if you're thinking about the hof team?
mine isnt even ranked
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
i got fucking 6
i'd have given you
if you had asked on thursday
honestly i have no clue
<:JeanThink:891876044406153226>
cause this is on bull 
on non bull content?
you even have a spare for affix gaming
4 stigs in 30 pulls is nice
just use crusher heki
~~this isnt mine i fucking wish~~
<@385655541248163840>
Eli do my ma
So moot point ig
Okay fair got 624 on 474D
Just get 33 more points
Wog
If you use jk
?
At 473D can you even break that shield
Wait
I think sushang has problems with mobs if you mean on tona
Still should be best option though
<a:kms:639428905400401930>

i havent kept up with her performance there
i kinda wanna see pe on bull actually
+100 points ish?
the trade off for no sp is like
just like with carole gloves, yeah
yeah
the 35%
<@434737143395516416> my kissy pillow
we use those gloves on hos
no no
good thing im s0 then
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
ios and kr are insane right now
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
this should fix that issue for s0
i think there's value, esp since if you're trying to score and gated by one shot rotations
for img only though
its basically a better mkp
fgo/hod
i want the gloves asap but i really do not want to do this lol
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>

Common mei L
Kk
All v1-v2 stuff obsolete basically
V2: Upon casting Joint Burst ATK in Herrscher Form, all enemies on the field take 12% more Total DMG for 10s, can be refreshed. When host Combo ATK hits the debuffed enemy 5 times, the debuff is increased by 24% for 8s, can be refreshed, five hit counter resets when you exit.
Cause uh

They moved her buffs to stigma huh

That has paga
Fookin whale
No one told him to make da pri or fflare pri
So he has no mats for it lol
Miss me
And the SP blocking mechanic
Hos crits
SnS crits
QTE crits
MPE and PE is God awful
It worked for Mimitsu
Just crit harder
With full paga
S0 is 715-720+
Yes but that's compensation for shui carole
Just crit harder 5head
I have 724 using shui carole
Like ruby said triple supports is literally painless
It is
Only YAE slap her ass
Phys kallen
No
That's really bad though
Keeby did it on husk
This feels recent
.im Raiden Mei
Why is aster doing this again
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
Isn't it 4 frags and 2 more if ss?
Just need a run or two

I need my da stamps
Sure
Do mine too
Guaranteed drones
Zither pri when
Miss me atm
And it's fps stuff like Turg rc again for that so
Not *that* good
When it doesn't it's just
When it works it's insane
From what I see with the pri in ma it's a coin flip for the off field Turg extension
Because aponia doesn't use those rotations lol
While tranquil rhapsody is just bad
For WHO
<a:nomballs:1056949905127637002>
disgusting
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
make me a mod to balance it out
he's right
like they have 4 sets
idk why everyone says turg
just not that good compared to bronya as expected
tbf turg and some generic m isnt bad at all
LOL
its like 600?
at this point in the game
than go gearless
i'd rather kms
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
though tbh its the same shit if you go focused and focused goes bad
depends where i end up here
1. Crystal <25k
60 expa pulls to get one stig box, no matter having luck or not, it is recommended to get full gears later

2. Crystal 28k~35k
1. Getting HoTr after 70 pulls, roll until 110 pulls to get stig box, you can use Turg-Mei-Turg in the mean time
2. Getting HoTr before 60 pulls, reach 60 pulls to get reward, and then go for focus supply, decide wisely whether you quit early or invest crystal full for 4/4
3. LUCKSACC GG F2PBTW, just go to focus and fetch your gears there

3. Crytal >46k
1. All in Expa, if you managed to get S2 before 170, consider your option to get the stig box, then go to focus banner
2. All in Expa, if you managed to get S2 only after or until 170, go straight to 190 to get the box safe.
probably 110
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i just want s2
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
like 10 or 11
ye
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im not  even funding myself

i hear the htr strat isnt nearly as bad
<:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
now sss pe <:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
triple supports is pretty painless
if non sss hs
in p1
you've got to gimp damage
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
~~someone hasn't ran the spa dxy strat~~
T0 is just better in every way though <:deadge:975652771082698782>

SSS Carole with shui is good enough
Scroll up

Cope with shui
These are what I'm coping with



It's a hos sp farm simulator
For non triple supports
Nebs i think
But Carole is mandatory
Triple supports work
SSS PE works
Top score is mpe hos carole
SS+?
What's mpe
Oof
<a:darksideslap:786450895378317342>
Do you not have Carole?
Omg

i get worried doing that
if ever
nowadays its like 2 drinks socially
15 shots and a 40 ounce malt back in college
i remember drinking like
i dont remember where my limit is and i dont want to find it
it just makes me really quiet
fair
<a:SMH:1021112056063213648>
arent you supposed to be out drinking rn
my little lenovo legion 5 i just shift over
ah right you guys have pcs

It looks pretty good
I'm out atm but i can in a bit
Ohh
The one that floods
Did you climb the tree yet
Where in ori
Though I'm not sure if that's north America exclusive
There's also stuff where cities will pay you to move there
Or out west iin cali
That sounds right
I know what program you're talking about
Depends on the state
Cause there's unemployment, social security, etc
Define mooch
Having malded these bosses i can see the fuckups
Also I don't like many of these refs at all
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
I'll just be f2p
Meh whatever
Across 3 bosses now
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
SS htr seems to be ~30-50 points over s2
i gotta find an s0/s2 tonatiuh
well for now
no more refs today
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
that took way too long
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
finally
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
use fuxi
every s0 htr ref
why does
trio is giga expensive though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
cn is still hard required though
for the dps
so much more flexible now
but its
looks to be
aka
you weren't kidding
wtf is this boss
even vil v ggets 700
wow
ty
yeah this is exactly what im looking for
that makes sense
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
ty
vil stonks in rl
yoooo
thats a 6.4 thing if anything
bro im not even ss
wtf
where are the non ss htr
why would you do this to yourself
wtf
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
寂灭月魂 is vague
what are the characters if i wanted to find nirvana aka with htr gameplay
genshin copypasta from my armada 

When the counter is near pity with a guaranteed event character/weapon, Vil feels that his rng is at a great advantage and thus he does not hesitate to pull. When he has to do a 50/50, Vil thinks that his rng is at a small advantage, and so he pulls to secure the 50/50. When the counter is not near pity at all, Vil thinks that his rng is at a disadvantage and so he looks to pull to build soft pity and better rng. When pity is at 0 and he has no saved gems nor focused guarantee, Vil thinks that the banner has reached a desperate situation and is only waiting passively for his death if he does not pull.
thats a c6 r5 eula
<:KekDoggo:743295767262789752>
just do this
ic ic
did you ever get that ultrawide btw?
nini fund my ss htr too

s2 or die huh
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

its almost like she shares the lead sp with hot
i would farm le to sss nowadays still personally
vke used to be strong
yeah
when each floor took 5 minutes
or like with the old abyss system
im thinking like pre bk release
most himeko valks
never good is like
bn and db were strong with hand of tyr
in boomer times
yeah
for the state that acc is in
that topup is stupid high
bro
1 card is like 30 frags i think
for base  s valks
took a year though
on epicnpc
sonju sold his for 3k cad
hs too
fr and da are next
i usually go for the non farmable option personally
worse than base until then
needs 65
nebs is fine at lvl 50
<@704867526877904908> already ahead of the curve
iriya
LOL
if riku's anything to go by
hoh should be your qua valk too at sss right
the same place they put hof bosses
<:felishoryshet:959980144263581696>

all hp sponge bosses
outside of qua it doesnt look like a bad patch
dw though HoO is qua <:kek:513083585809350667>
vil v havers eating good
im looking forward to this patch
<:meihue:960024977703313439>
prob hot yeah
she has really high base attack iirc
cracked affixes
wtf
somewhere around there
1600-1602
i think max att for sss mpe is like
assuming she's the gen 3 elf, yeah both
the way sirin was with hof
right, bella was released with hot
that makes sense
interesting
tesla came after bella?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
it was selune > fuxi > tesla > bella right?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
~~jk ik what you mean~~
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
as big as rabbits
i already have those in nyc
while i get to tend rabbits
i was thinking of mice and men

<@385655541248163840> are you gonna record/stream pulls
that thing's gonna be nice
fookin whale

show me when you get home
about time
both of you <:deadge:975652771082698782>
im like 2 days late to the party apparently
and htr in 6.4
or bke/ae
to dorm valks in cny
surprised they didnt add hot
looks cleaner overall though ngl
they took mei's halo off lol
basic/combo ignites yup
snap and ult
yeah
kith gave me misleading info
debunked
elf doesnt ignite
and flashing lights
i just see bronya > kiana > mei > kiana > ult
i have no clue whats going on lol
im hoping for this
<:02shrug:1001147147703562260>
Kwt was listing the rank ups and he put only the tdm on 4*
no clue
hmm
another v2 vid
they look to have lowered ranks required in v1
seems to be from that vid
i imagine its klein all over again
i'm only going 3*
it better be
only the 8% tdm skill is 4*
elf translations are also wrong
but no one shared afaik
then update skills when beta drops
i think they just used it as outline for rentry
ss1 da good
 <@82358863155703808>
shocking
lol
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
?
they removed the bayonetta pose
wait
should probably ping someone about that
and forgot to update when it hit the actual beta
probably what happened is they used the closed beta test leaks for the skills
translation doesnt have ignite in marisa's vid or on rentry
<:safe_hh:710968174887305311>
debunked ai chan still good
<@291907279291285506> explain yourself
wait i actually got scammed
so stupid
in that vid it looks like elf is doing the ignite
ffs
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im using them separately out of spite
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
elf perm ignites so no need for her
with the new elf
trio team on benares
<@416445660443967491>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Wait when did they add this
<a:nicolewhalehic:1004991312845623397>
She's holding them hostage
I said it was routed back to Nini
Shut it SSS hoh

<@385655541248163840> do my abyss
like hb basically
cause the project bunny
she cant *proc* turg, but htr can constantly *reapply* turg
htr can
its not a bad piece solo though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
jst newt b probably better
outside of ma
i keep forgetting jst exists
oh right
oof
i dont like marg eden cause you have to ult every time but if thats what you got i guess its fine
tesla m prob too
she's fine with turg
turg probably
which i like
now that htr is here
but there's a lot more teams to play
no clue tbh, have to wait and see i'd say
yep, thats correct
i dont see her  being used very often though
which isnt often <:deadge:975652771082698782>
depends on if they choose to run her bosses
but sw works too still
assaka is a aponia boss again with her
fgo
5/6 bosses are htr bosses so far lol
yeah it is
both seem to work
寂灭龙虾
found it
nirvana quantum lobster?
so like
or good enough at least?
量子龙虾寂灭 - is this correct if i want to search nirvana tonatiuh?
but htr seems more damage, faster, better sp regen to me
if cflare is needed pv works just fine
ht htr gd
ya
htr completely replaces pv most of the time
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
and that keeps jump sec me
i keep having to dash to pick up the sp pack
after gears
how the fuck do you get close to husk
oh keilo
i cant speak to abyss i havent seen anything <:02shrug:809888510143496264>
htr run
run with new pri
i dont quite recall how it messes up the bk rot but i had an 893 somewhere with the new pri
specifically for the sss husk though, off field application messes up because it applies to the clone
but its like turg cat so
like 16 seconds
when it works, the off field turg application is great
plenty
hyper railguns
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
any that can be reso'd
it messes with turg too
which is important in sss husk, no?

Fragile notes on htr
Great for tryhards
A bit of affix mats

Since su +2
I'm gonna max VKE today and do tp this week
~~to level 8~~
I finally did tp btw
Yeah I picked those too
Did you see the one where you get damage if you crit
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
But <:02shrug:809888510143496264>
My guess is they have to be onfield
Nice
if you've seen them affix streams are just disgusting lol
6-7million
or pulling banners for affix mats
whaling dorm to get affix mats
i bet you 6-7 of that is solely affixes
idk if fake but sheesh
instead of one or the other
so you can apply turg on both
oz determines the close the mechs spawn together
this is actually really cool for people who dont know about this trick
have fun

Better than I thought it would be tbh
SoE is cracked lol
I never played her in nirv, just going off of what I've seen from malders
I highly doubt it but that boss hasn't shown up in forever
Was only really useful for arc riot so far
SSS skill not needed here
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
ss2 hot
but who cares i wanna fight bke
i cant figure it out

<:prayge:863861301310652416>
trust
she's good
use your vil v
and kalpas is psy
ranged weather
you're gonna kill 800 metals or 280 torus for 1 boss?
why?
also nini and ruby better players <:deadge:975652771082698782>
what are you looking to do?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
at least from fragile and pat
but more responsive than ae, etc
the only hard part is animation cancel
yeah
arent all ults pretty long nowadays?
s2 is kinda big here
even better
sushang prob
i changed my mind i thought you had sss mpe
hoh i guess
so its worth to me
and i think htr and ai means faster rots with no sp problems
i enjoy hof a lot more
honestly same
still believe it <:deadge:975652771082698782>
i said this <:deadge:975652771082698782>
trust
you'll get 4 cards in 4 pulls
since its gonna be htr ai hfi
i also said i was pulling ai lol
i didnt say skip htr i think
he has a hitcount shield too
i'd try mpe ngl
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
you need to freeze
and the mpe team is mpe hos rc
what are the missing pieces
cause supports make the difference here
show both teams
<:TeriPoint:1054294858866638918>
sw
<:worryPopcorn:411920421982568468>
support for 2 team, dps for 1
imagine skipping the most busted support in a very long time for a fire sp
i saw lol
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
<:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
i got ss2
reposting this lol for deep trial 2
She has paralyze
Something like that i gotta rewatch clips
I think you can't trigger the qte in any other order
Based on what aka was doing
And it seems like you're forced into Kiana dps?
That joint qte man
Like you said earlier that team is gonna be hard to learn
Seems like s2 is good on both, not that I can afford it
Also just read hfi skills
That's funny though lol
It felt stiff on aka's stream
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
On s2 and ss
Damage taken tdm
Wow
Brb
Let's read
Ty
All o know is SSS is whale bait on both kiamei
I wanna see mei s0-ss
Does anyone have ranks btw? Curious if those got tl
On top of The most oppressive schedule we've ever seen
Yeah
Or img regisvine or whatever people are calling it
I'm not a fan of the Kevin boss or the oath of Judah pri boss lol
Which isn't bad
Idk if it replaces the current gen elfs or extends shelf life but it reads like a souped up fuxi
But no shot elf is weak
The trio team is gonna be Giga expensive , and didn't show elf since it wasn't seeded yet
If 6.4 i wait for v3, a lot looks unfinished/unpolished. 
Suits looks strong per usual, skins are great but they need to fix the hof cape
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I sleep i saw enough last night
if they're forcing bosses that need 3 elements
i think it'll be the latter
<:slap_hh:743649008140156929>
nini how did microcenter go
<a:whalehunt:1056948641618731098>
yeah that sounds right
rn its event testing
they will be a giga whale team
idk if 9s or not but for sure
i think this is it
yee
nonexistent
alice?
<a:whalehunt:1056948641618731098>
unless something changed
keilo doesnt have game installed
It's 463
so 463 or 464?
na-3 or 4 prob
yeah thats a nice feeling too
unless you wanna tryhard
affix isnt that needed
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
iss fine
<:Lumine_1Mora:795762964024131634>
and yeah affixing is a whale's game usually
awaken is 600 i think
4500 for all 3 da stamps
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i gotta do more er
shit
ye shop
?
in er for base s
its 1500 per stamp right
~~took way too many affix mats to fix~~
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
and 1.65 spcr for huodou
its fine i got a 23 line
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i bricked my stig for no reason
im coping hard, the additional (element) on hit isnt needed on hoh neither
if you need a ref
oh btw ruby
yeah you were
<@82358863155703808> were you the one coping hov?
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
-7D and only ss sushang though
i matched ref
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
but not for my hands
ok it is
i dont think 700 is possible even close lol
attempt number 2
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
just finished stages
<@385655541248163840> im gonna set a score first
?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
or fr
i remember him true comboing me to death every time i swapped into pv when i was new
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
dudu dlc v3?
that guy is cancer in nirv at these temps
i hope abyss jizo never comes back
he'll swat you like a fly
sw yeah lol
no husk no assaka sus once a patch
how would they keep aponia relevant
oic
husk isnt bad otherwise
the cancer is gears
honestly
jizo is one of the easier ones for sure
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
jizo before griseo
so long as you can get max rewards anything works
i dont wanna learn something i'll never use again
i would be fine if htr wasnt when we next have this boss
do not want to
really
and i
i gotta fix my benares
i wish
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but i can conifrm
pretty sure its mpe hos rc
i havent seen the test
bro i just got out of bed lol
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
eli's going to lower their purity
sure
lol
should be okay i think
s1 hoh ss0 sus
yee
even mpe isnt using griseo
kalpas needs those cause he has a hitcount shield
after this cycle
oh i am
i hope its for just that one boss
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i have a 23 waiting though
<@385655541248163840>
most refs used sp/s and spcr
i think so
better scramble like an egg before i fold you like an omelette
yes
logging in game
one sec
when huodou is coming up
i bricked her again
smart
2 if you're bold
you should have a hitcount affix on sus
just like with arc riot if you arent 3s
did you see?
oh nini
Idk
?
Seems like The “shield” that’s up makes him weaker to that element
But it looks annoying af
I'm assuming this is 9S
Just newt instead ig
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Yeah
<@385655541248163840>
It wasn't that annoying
Actually
Kk
I really should get out of bed
Mobile bili is. Annoying tho
I can check the sw one rq



That, idk
Sure one sec
I'm tired of bricking mine
I really need a dupe sushang stig
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
<@180679257851166721> 
as far as the conversion goes?
isnt it basically the same?

kalpas
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

<:prayge:863861301310652416>
summer hod seele

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
where hf v2
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
i see
but i take word for it
this feels off
?
so <:02shrug:809888510143496264>
i feel like its always been morning but i've also not paid this much attention to beta b4
tbf its friday for me in 2 hours
we see in what, 2 hours?
LOL
combined elements
at the very least its great for new players
need to ask a mod
you need a role for it now neko
i imagine this one is like fuxi but better
with the new budget elf
<:worrykms:398047795732545536>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
he just beat me down
he was actually the hardest for me
i forgot we fought him in story too
yo
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
i forgot about kevin boss
i done now though, we sleep until beta
yeah
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
ss+ sw > sss hoh > s0 sw > ss hoh > s hoh > mpe?
depending on sushang rank, but on equal ranks it seems like this?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
and you saw an ss run
every other vid is on higher vid, s1 ss1 or s2 ss2 or smth
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
hoh
s0 non ss sus
thats with newt b though
s0 ss1
ss ss
from what i saw on bili
it is
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
im not looking forward to this boss
gotcha, ty
i dont know what the sp gen is on that rank, otherwise i'd guess s1/ss1
if you know what s2+ hoh looks like
its a cez B run
i dont know the hoh rank
i know its 469D and at least ss sus
can you look at this vid for me?
gotcha
its not literally those first 5 chars right?
whats htr name in cn
oh ruby you're here
i didnt know this existed
rip
kekL
but not the same
honkai will still be alive
<:Deadge:942802905046581248>
forever captainverse events?
i wonder what happens after 6.4
wdym?
?
And is lightning/fire
But this new elf has gather
Idk either
I'm 59 away lol
if only
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i think you'll be fine
and thats about average for 3 cards
takes 168 pulls for 40 frags of essentine
i think its like
keilo can run the numbers for certainty
depends on when you get the card, but most likely yeah
ew
at worst its like 90
when's the last time someone went to full pity for a dupe though
ss in 190 would be pretty lucky though
thats usually enough for s2, *just* short of s3
its extremely unlikely you end up at s1
if you go the full 190
so maybe closer to 80k?
7 foca cards and the 15 (expa or foca) cards this patch yeah, and whatever we get for cny
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
owomath 30800+64000+11200
owomath 110 * 280
and whatever 110 pulls gets you in 5.3
and maybe 11.2k ish for HoO
so assume that for hofin
64k
average for s0 4/4 and 3* valk is like
only this time you cant skip the bronya
its 5.5 all over again
<:SadCatThumbsUp:806587729332011008>
but thats keeby yeah
lumina server
i just thought the px line was funny
oh im not convincing you to do anything
this person is understandably pissed though
specifically that last line lol
<@704867526877904908>
actually i'll dm you
so i guess start at the beginning
hmm
ssd generally is best yeah
what exactly are you looking for?
have you built one before?
LOL
elysia wasnt too bad and hare's kinda easy even on hard
the hardest npc fight so far was otto
also ngl but unrelated
i think they're thinking worst case scenario
why are you like this
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
nini pls fund ty
but uh
whoever sent this forgot elf
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>

<a:nou_hh:833500436526530570>
<a:worrysweat_hh:770947100174843904>

disgusting
and there's still 10 hours left
776 is t50
For phys and ice
Honestly
I should've been f2p and done the triple support play
Yeah
Triple supports should be okay
No pe
Probably 465D again
Welcome to hod eli
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
I hope you pull every valk at 90 pulls
I forgot they didn't have hoh
Didn't read sorry
Oh, triple supports
Because 659 is a rotation/gear issue, not dorm buffs
Are you s0 Ely and 4)4 RC?
Nice job promo!
You should retain yeah
That hasn't played yet
No one else is a concern
Lu is good
Lemme see
I'm sure you're fine
Who's even in your bracket
<:DEADEYE:948674882516963398>
No genshin/honkai
Sometimes I wish I could tell past me that
Honestly <:deadge:975652771082698782>
And got banned from there too and quit the game
Then did the same thing in honkai official
They got banned lol
No
Then they started asking how to play the game after they made the bad decision
Or just linked them the old messages
So it got to a point where we started to tell them to pull what they want cause they're waiting for us to tell them to pull the thing they want
Oh it's solstice armada server
But they keep asking what to pull and what to save for like 4x a day
Sols
Constantly
There was someone in our server that did this
<a:TE_DonoWall:854581664570015775>
All of them
Addicts
Agreed for sure
~~Ngl this used to be me~~
And you barely get double that much a patch as a whale
That's not even 50 pulls yeah
From what I backread
That entire chat doesn't seem to know how to save
Ngl
Bruh
it's. A gacha gotta do what you gotta do
generally want 38-46 per stig if affixing atk imo
that was pre griseo though, idk if thats changed
atk or cdmg i think
<:worryok_hh:770950253658636329>
issok
12 hour cd <:Deadge:942802905046581248>
just have them join the server and ping @na vices or dm me
yeah
like px for ae or db for hr (before hr was farmable anyway)
for leader skill if its used
base s doesnt need it no
you eventually want to farm up the ones with awakened forms though
specifically
VK PX BR AE fire dmg dealt 5% at S, 7% at SS
SK LE HT lightning dmg dealt 5% at S, 7% at SS
HR 6S Meme ice dmg dealt 5% at S, 7% at SS
GK KM VE SN phys dmg dealt 3% at S, 4% at SS
MC BN total dmg dealt 2% at S, 3% at SS
AK CH DB BK ele dmg taken (by your own valk, i.e. useless) -5% at S, -7% at SS
6/16/21/28/21 are max for each
when did the enabler verbiage change to driver?

<:nokek:1014211961292083240>

Both??

HoT isn't full lightning I think
AE>HB> Nyx

Apparently nyx
Spin2win

wog

bastet b if ss sus

4/4 non ss sus and 4/4 sss hb score similarly, yeah
3* elf and sss hb would net you 770+
sus doesnt have gear right?

If they can't hold it I mean
I don't even drink anymore lol
So it's funny to see others
I didn't think I'd work at a place that was a reflection of my freshman year
Idr the rest
There was a few more than 3 nvrmind
One of the funnier ones was like a colleague of mine and his wife, they got pretty drunk and they were having dinner and spilled some of it on the floor
So the husband tried to clean it up and spilled his beer in himself too

There was someone who just sat at the casino all day and won 11k

There was someone who literally just smiled and waved the whole night, they were feeling good
Then passed out as soon as they sat in the taxi home

There was a guy who fell off a table after dancing on it or making a toast or something
Well there were 3 I heard
I bet she's wonderful ❤️
People are wild
I heard some stories from the last one
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
So a rags to riches story instead
Next to a hotel for anyone too drunk to drive home
At a casino
We just had this LOL
As expected <a:dalao:795864124907061369> no wonder you have connections in dubai
But it's been so long
And have fun (reasonably) there
I get a bit of freedom, I can come to the company lunches and dinners
Well
The last time my office did something like that were mimosas at breakfast time
dry. Shaken, not stirred
Nini would drink me under a table
Ohh damn
Wtf
You're at 5 already?
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
🙂
Have 5 glasses and tell me
Probably
If you got good sangria it's like 12-15 iirc
Actually, nvrmind
Depends on what kind
That's not even acoholic
Boring
Nini is on one rn
Slay
Yasss queen
Just naming names

Eh nvrmind
Okay fair but
I'm legitimately asking btw
How to even get into honkai nowadays?
Honestly
Yeah <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
And other freemium games
Cookie run
Well
True
I didn't escape jail just to watch them go
<a:DuckSmh:931628395656249345>
If I see them playing gacha
My kid is having a talk
In that server
All Gacha whales are in tech or asian
And icefire
Saint too
Cs yeah
He's in Cali with skype
Could be an L7
I just don't know what specifically
Ik that much
Oh, it's tech
FGO/cs/honk/genshin
But he makes enough to whale massively
Idk what he does
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
@ kartoffel
Imagine
The only guys getting days off like that are the ones about to retire
It's fucked
Than wfh
They would rather us take a PTO day
Fridays off
No no
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
Ic ic
10 hour days for the last off
How do you even abuse it?
But only a few people used it so they cancelled it
We used to have 4 days on 1 day off here
Ohh, nice nice
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
My company only does that if you're sick
But I can't wait to get out
Just napped in our conference room like nithing happened
I almost fell asleep at my desk yesterday lol
Get me out
Same

spot the problem
atmosphere changes everything
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
^
Pardo too strong on release
Lol
Yeah
Idr anyone else that was meh
But to me it was fine
I know people complained about griseo
She doesn't but she was def not designed to dps
Neither is ai
I didn't like er with roza
Carole was pretty meh in 5.3
Well
She's the only one in recent memory this has happened to
But there's like no shot she takes anywhere near the time ai chan would
Just don't pick wolf
There's a couple options
Sushang should still be strong enough
HoH and hor too
Da if you have her 4/4 is okay
I think HoF could be good here
And yeah same, it. Took fookin forever
The weapon type = 20% damage
The other buffs
What are the buffs
You had mobi so spa wasn't needed
Jk
Just get lucky with offrates
How are you 0/4 lol
She's been out a year
Honestly I'd say the opposite imo
Interesting
Use spa instead
LOL
and you can swap affixes
reso is most likely useless to you (referring to exchange house stigs)
id keep it
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
and hot should be easy for you too
this is sss nini 
ss but thats the idea
not sw
oh wait, hoh
bastet tm newt b is fine i think
do newt
two cez b week for you huh
oh, you do
i dont believe so but one sec
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
gl
keilo how's retirement
also i dont think keilo did it
nini wyd
esp when by the time it comes back, it'll be hof (or new fire dps) htr cn
but this boss isnt worth malding
s1 should be 700+
s0 can hit like 680-690
im assuming
or even 3* sirin
if they swapped leads its them easy lol
them
me
we're fighting for highest s0
with whoever duggle is
thats me
next time
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
is this separate from the one we got in the story?
now to save
but yeah early anni boxes
🐌
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
heim was bad, kasumi felt *awful*
its so bad with moving bosses
but this is fps scum
specifically the second ult here, damage everywhere else is almost identical

i could try that, because im missing about 400-500k in one of my rots
that makes sense
~~its not like fire is getting bosses to warrant an elf~~
hopefully in 6.5, though people are saying 6.4
smart
asking because she slows everything down
do you have sirin?
like the rc ult timing is annoying
this tilts me too
ik exactly what you're talking about lol
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
idk why
cannot bring myself to play tp in er
i physically
dorm buff wise
i meant like
ohh
phys?
why?
what are you farming now?
so you get a break at least
no more fire after this
tbf
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
i do too issok
you have to do a bit of cleanup right?
but yeah the 16% missing fire is scuffed
65 rudder is pretty nice
to answer you though, i'm not sure personally but you could probably wait a few frames somewhere or cut moves somewhere to get a feel for the timing
if you want consistent buff application, (if you're using rc cn), swap their weapons
damage is meh but more consistent buffs cause constant application
its stupid

like hunter's mark cd will be up, but the icon will still be on enemies for a bit for some reason
specifically, purana triggers the B piece, but turgenev doesn't refresh
it just disappears if it triggers while enemies have the mark already

it doesnt happen at 200+ fps, which is why you'll see a *lot* of player refs on bilibili
 like on kasumi/heim/here, etc run uncapped fps on these bosses
fps influences turg duration on rc
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but idk
for that box
i think it was the same thing
do you guys remember will of frost last year?
ice resist
yes?
hakcer was right
oh wtf
not there anymore
it actually is lol
its literally on the honkai impact 3rd fb channel lol
who knows
its on the fb
prob for glb anni
also
i dont even have sss cn
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
and i am for now
i wanted to be the highest s0
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
<@291907279291285506>
but still
i only had 1 core
granted
ai s ucks in er
alright
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oh, lead
since when?

TOXIC
<a:AAsalt:594598396128526357>
right on cue
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
ah, right
why are you using avo?
looks like eli has competition
<:worrySharinganEyes:787657477646843944>
i stole it
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im not in the server that has :pes2_pepeascend:
<:pepeascend:960014403854549025>
its not even a week yet
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
i think thats how it works?
more sss = less valks in the pool
so you can get the ones you want more often in theory
it depends how many sss valks you have i think
<:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
the chicken/brisket is amazing
i wanna go back
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>

:KusaSmol:
this is cute
what is this thumbnail
omg
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i did
did i already link this
wait
non ss sus
cez B s0 hoh
okay finally
this is the sidestage
toxic
like literally only 2 vids so far
of non ss sushang
lack
a distinct
im also noticing
here's a cez b
oh, hmm
but no one is showing the damn boss
so type advantage
is my guess
kalpas is psy
lol
sss hoh is almost s0 sw
same for sw
like this 8s run 
its bastet tm *Newt B*
people arent using  cez hee
interesting
im prooly gonna sleep yeah
i know you have sw
if you wanted to hoh it
thats for you
<@385655541248163840>
but benares is tilting me
i prolly could
ty
yes it was!
if i wanted to search what would be kalpas in cn
this was reptar
from when i used it
i think its just swapping endlessly
confirm
<@416445660443967491>
nvrmind
he's psy
no wait
so you'd need a ranged ice dps that can freeze
i think so
the weather is ranged
hoh kalpas seems ok? from what i heard, havent seen any footage
and no sw yeah?
i think thats where we're headed
but huodou and kallen bad for them
maybe dps rc can clear at 468D
well
i think bke is the easiest of the remaining bosses though
ninitoxic
oof
hot hoh pe sw or hot
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
apparently benares can dodge can
true
they could've played heph
if they held off one more boss
im pretty sure they just take the L
kek better use of time
i wanna try spa but she looks not fun on this
at least with da he doesnt dodge your wa
setup is a *lot* longer though, and buff timing is bad cause no timestop
da takes shorter rots to clear
na anyway
466
yeah..
they cant clear main stages either you mean?
though that sounds like sp issues
hoh jk si maybe
wouldn't the hof team be weaker than the hoh team?
<:meisip:833970844958720010>
spa gris (sos?) and i guess ae/rc
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oh, nirv?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
its bleed
you *have* to use griseo there
is si hs mpe not good?
also is this you?
i remember cause of your discussion with keilo
it isnt coming back for a longg time so its fine
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
the paint was the variance yeah
not bald per se but the biggest pain point is the paint transfer doesnt work
the vill v fight is annoying
but the playstyle the boss enables
not necessarily the boss
you like bosses that let you rotate quickly
i see now
ss spa sss ai
not mine
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
and its sub 600
there's literally one
Yeah ss ai leader op
It's about the 40 sp
Its not about the breach at 3S lol
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
gl
like 40% increase over ss ae
all the baked in support stuff, and the stigs are *actually* op
thats what i've heard, yeah
are the impression im getting
s0 is good for most people if they wanna play in nirv eventually
s2 /ss are myriad ranks
glut mei newt *maybe*
ogier fhm
glut fhm
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i remember these days
it feels good to play different teams ngl
now that i can actually do it lol
yeah, i'm slowly starting to like ma more
ahh, yeah
or p2?
before transition?
p1?

did they?
guess that shit is hard with temps that high
also lots of people posting side stage clears
ios is not fucking around
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
cause you need her for kosma to 760
which would get me third
its actually impossible to get third without 3S Ai rn
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i malded ma for you

i'd do something about it

if it were me
you gonna take that
damn
so for you
ss spa/s0 hfs get low 6xx 4/4
the ss is intentional
hof > sspa/da > vill v
prob not
<a:no:963351594785706024>

do you have the cabbage?
hof s0 outscores
if she's not bricked
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
You wanted a challenge
But just looking at refs anyway
S0 HoF comes ahead
Whale DA / SpA (SS) are relatively equal it seems
It was the ER Benny with the ice tornado
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
You know this thing was more toxic in beta?
Maybe 660's
SSS da gets like 650 ish though
Fun huh

i've literally never heard of marg griseo
ngl
shui is still pretty strong, just not really used anymore with paga/cez
anything that needs hitcount or dmg ya
though it doesnt look like any boss this patch *needs* it
is it worth still making/maxing hekate
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
hotf
take me back to hf
i'm 🅱️roke
no me
idek how my topup so high
i dont wanna quit like everyone else has been but
im def not spending as heavily
it'll go a lot further there than in honkai
im taking my sp and dip
ohhh okay
meh
if im mathing/reading right
SS
-Fire/Lightning breach state: 14%(S0) > 17%(SS) Elemental breach, last for 16s.
-In Armed mode, Herrscher of Truth gain 15%(S0) > 18%(SS) Elemental Breach

SS1: When Herrscher of Truth exits the field, consume [In the Name of Truth] to buff the team. Team gain Fire and Lightning DMG +25%(S0) / 30%(SS1), and all enemies on the field receive +25%(S0) > 30%(SS1) bonus Fire and Lightning DMG, last for 18s, refreshable.

3% elemental breach for team fire/lightning
3% personal elemental breach

5% fire/lightning damage team 
5% lightning/fire damage taken
with cny coming up 
im trying to whale less
i really dont wanna spend to 190
110 prob, 150 if im really unlucky
and just finish focused
i think i stick to my original s2 and cope plan
i havent been too far down beta vids though, but support herrscher strong
its like a 40-50% increase across the board from what i saw
hell her stig set alone is almost as much as ae
everything ae does but better
i withhold commentary till keilo sees
bro
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
and meta feels way longer (as in you can still use old meta chars from 1+ year ago)
but a lot less time/money investment to have a fairly good account
also a tad more coomer
kr games way cheaper
yeah
also awk horizon / minestra / replacer queen are all op
base chifuyu stronk
hallo
wym?
ty for the acc
no prob <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
mpe does better here but she's a hard run to pull off
yeah <:deadge:975652771082698782>
this scored 623
.
you wont have fun lol
try it
you need it to collapse though
which sus cant do
since you need to extend freeze
hoh rc hb with collapse cannon then
\snowy
no
either
i'd just 18k and sleep
thats up to you lol
you got hoh with hb & collapse cannon
mpe with ss and collapse cannon, (mpe is *mald*)
or fr dps, which is mald
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but i need the 893 doom
good enough
owomath 47728+39880+31893
I think my worst so far is ranks don't make up for hands
It's great
I have them all the time
.
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Old meme but relevant if you pull just sub some words out
But CN makes it good
S0 kinda mald pre cn
She's by far the easiest cycles you'll ever have
Even at s2
I'm lonely
Like the only one here with her lol
Yeah
I have my ps4 still inf I wanted to play
Oh rip
Do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it do it
Where gear
That's valk heki
Do you guys play ps4?
Unity was okay
I liked 2 and black flag a lot
Fair
I havent seen you in weeks
Also hi stranger
Don't talk about it be about it
Do it then
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>

<@704867526877904908> you're not alone anymore
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
Htr who
Do it heki
<a:Smoge:808844088115068938>
On top of all that
For 10/15 cards
Then expa/foca packs are like 30$ us
Yeah that sounds right
Same
<a:darksideslap:786450895378317342>
It's $1000 in their eyes minimum
Like ask a 9S how much they're willing to pay for 23/23 affix mats
For whels yeah lol
But got those nice hs stamps
Nini actually despises vil lol
🧢
But I suck
If you're fast Klein is 893
Very impressive<a:patpat:850500624630022154>
That's only what, -2 3* Klein?
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
Can you show me? At work atm
Kith kith
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
999
Freeze might help extend collapse but idk
If you wanna be weird use fr gd Turg rc
Gd?
Who's the third
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Or is fr the dps
Turg fischl isn't *that* good
Wait who's your team heki
Fair
No zhenyi?
Wtf
Then Styx dropped 20 on me
I was done last night
Generally ppm/Tesla band M is more
With who?
This seems more fun
Tbh
I gotta start the event
<:meisip:833970844958720010>

its a lot of damage
yes, actually
top would mean cn
s0 vil s2 ae
this is 680 on na
well
wtf
night heki
same
idr who but i just remember nyx/vil/hoh
nyx is very strong on whale
well, nyx boss
that sounds like its your fault then lol
you should
its been over a year
her targetting on the snails this patch is really bad
otherwise just mpe it
if you're a whale hoh is nice
since she doesnt have basics
partially
jk
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
killed by only basics
ded valk issok
just dont :ScreenshottingScum:
i wouldnt know
prob but
tap b to get off turret
weapon active switches turrets
to get on the turret
you have to tap a
once she swaps/qte in
no
and targetting feels bad
the frames drop on the damn mantis
the kosma boss is fucking me though
i havent had any issues this patch
you can?
<a:Fukbywei:993370439445385299>

<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
you did in v2
maybe

I haven't started the event yet
Lol
My Ellie bracket
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

Does rika still have admiral
Oh shit my old armada
~~thats why you do it on monday~~
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>

60 > 110 > 150 >190
if you can
from 0 pity to ss
sure
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
that people ss in 190 pulls
low chance
there's also like
trash gaem
but that was moved to ss1
i was planning on coping with s2
this
im still tilted by the v2>v3 changes
im not even getting myself bp
lol
Rip
Assuming you buy bp
You only get like 400 torus a patch
Eden/HTR/kiamei
Actually 1600
That's 1200
Eden pri
6.4 double pri most likely
6.3 is a pri
Then save wtf
Spare torus?
Do you have torus or?
Cause you can retain/promo with lvl 50 pris lol
Generally though, I think I've said I prefer support pri levels over DPS
So I wouldn't level nebs
The extra damage from cosmic levels doesn't matter until nirv anyway
Ae is getting retired literally next patch
You mean to level up?
I would say crusher yes
I don't have soft pings lol
And weapon
I'd shoot for s0 4/4 personally, but at least tb
Ic ic
Are the servers still up?
TB are very strong, M is personal dmg (a big boost to SW if you pick it up, she can prob use it), and 3 PC is an extra 16% elemental damage
Ya
They're pretty strong
HTR's stigs alone are about the same as AE's entire kit imo
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
wolf fucked my season up
rip
they will
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
i got you and audrey

but i cba
i wanna clean up cause im way below what my acc should be getting
mood
honestly
<:felishoryshet:959980144263581696>
And this ma seems chill for me
I'm looking forward to it
Then we get those 4
Kosma is next
<:KroniiGrab:961171258853187584>
But if they don't you're coming to kosma with me
Maybe Z?
I remember that name
Roasthi might play
Who's left?
Take me back wtf
she would constantly proc overdrive
hot > hoh > pe cycles <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
or kosma either
no one wants to play that
its heim
i do not
A bad costume would do the job
They wanna kill her off forever
.
But idr
And s+ was crybbals
I think A was 92 and S was 147
To spend in dorm shop
The things you do to get the yellow cards
From the dorm
Work point cards
Hi heki
<:meisip:833970844958720010>
i dont think they'll let na fall that far below sea
probably
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
hmm
owomath 39683 *1.2
they gamin
at 486D
7 point difference
t1-t100 in myriad is like
its ice huodou but
what is this hell

okie
owomath 31840 +39880 +47744
yeah not happening
owomath 31893 +39893 + 47760
~~now suffer on kosma~~
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
good job
heim bad
Sirin/fuxi are pretty sizable buffs
Elf
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
This still infuriates me
I hate this game
<a:Fukbywei:993370439445385299>
And I'm pretty sure now both arent burst mode valks
In 6.4
I think it's still gonna be a double s rank
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
That means vill is missing like 
Potentially 55% fire dmg
I'm not happy about the basic attack change
Hof and SpA should be fine
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
It's routed to Nini's acc
just a lot of ranked players for whatever reason
nope!
usd
which is insane
maybe 500-600
thats about 800 bucks if you do badly
s0 4/4 is a pretty major upgrade from what im seeing over ss ae
its only a nirv problem realistically
but no support utility on her ranks at *all* until ss
but this is bs
i *was* open to pulling s0/s2 and gambling on foca
we always get a farmable valk after herrscher
they were originally meant to be farmable
we're still waiting on ae/hos for example
gacha valks arent generally farmable until years after release
esp with no box
and they are pissed lol
no shot she's farmable
im actually so tilted
i hate this game
literally gutted until ss
im actually pissed
v3
v2
what the fuck
v3
v2
want to cooperate lol
heim just does not
i was baited by shinofey
i cant even do mine
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
or rest at least
go get a massage
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
you suffer with me
no
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
you're fucked
but yeah those are the options
i gotta look on bili for a non whale hoh
here's nyx if you want to kill yourself
since you're only ss fr you can try either ely's
mpe is torture though
yeah pretty sure its mpe fr dps or hoh (ranked)
mpe works
fr dps is the usual i think?
but thats a whale solution
i think people have used hoh
i have no clue
i own vill v
if you get s use spa
🙂
welcome to nirv kosma
pog
fund me
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i played nini's acc too long
also i forgot how to s0 hof this boss

Lemme get out of bed
Ok
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
I'm just assuming everyone has ranks
Trust
Now she'll 800 next try
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>

Ngl idk if s0 cracks 700
Actually

One sec
I think s0 is fine
<:worryExit:783190311987970118>
This is the treatment I wake up to
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
The rich get richer

<@385655541248163840>
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
fragle did this
nope
this scored 735 in eu

Big whale
A player named doug
it doesnt make sense to whale hard and play once every 3-4 days uk?
i think is what i'll do
spend less then play less
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
make someone else fund
@ nini this is for us
if you already whale and want to spend less^
On heim stage
There's an ignite mob too

:bedpls:
for seizure warning
ss spam
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
15% on sss
skills/stigs, etc
before anything else is taken into consideration
yeah
at it stands in v2 anyway
so her value would be stonks
and it sounds like you dont have ae
even at s0
to fire/lightning for you
she would be a solid boost
i was hoping htr/cn/new kiana
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
o
?
sombre gives crit too
<:TE_PepegaBlind:967928246878502972>
actually maybe ve
should be tp?
tp
but idk for her
its in there
lol
if you care because 6.4 is believed to hold a fire valk and you want to build that team go cn
but yeah if fire bad and dont care go griseo
and people stopped saying she was a nirv only valk
this might be why she's so much more widely used now
crazy right?
10%
yeah
ty
pin this?
or actually
can we pin this btw
thats huge for mpe
ngl
but i think griseo is the move if you dont use/intend to use fire
no
exactly
griseo would make that almost 50%
33.6%
owomath 160 / (80*5+75)
so like for my mpe
if you can continue coping on fire until htr i'd go griseo
then i'd recommend griseo instead
cause if mpe is your most used valk
how often do you use fire team
however
and i dont really wanna do that
since its not crt
you have to manually calculate crit rate
honestly idk but she has a shitton of crit dmg baked into her kit
mpe?
yeah
sss griseo is damage and team 15% crit rate
s cn sp doesnt exist
ss cn
bitch ass arc riot is waiting
wym
looking at you ely
id rather no gather than negative gather <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
imagine one rot mobs
dudu is comfier cause of the gather yes
its way more bald
klein gets you a higher score but
technically
tet big brain
yes
But it's like 20 bucks if you pay for a skin
Which you get naturally
Some use quartz
Most are paid
Green scarf
Black jacket
I like a lot
The quartz one?
Weird
She looks weord
Me neither
Yeah it's good
The new years?
Coomer
They're pretty cooker
Also ignore most of the skins
Strong ranger
Gaeun is pretty good
Chifuyu?
Who
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
.im Xiao Lin
I just liked Xiao Lin
Was mostly f2p
I didn't
No need
But I can still answer most questions
<a:JailedTakoWantsToLeaveButCant:869950055044505650>
Honkai
It's a really good game but
Now you have it
I dm
Bet
Why
What
Channel
The sakurawtf emote
Quanta
Cafe quanda
In cq
Go to cs channel
But
I can get you to decent spot
I retiree from cs now but keep up with Game still
Oh
In cs
Wog

It's fine
I'll be rich
<@416445660443967491>
Hook me up with your travel agent friend
Get me tf out
I haven't had a proper lunch break in 2 weeks
Bro nini
<:meowbox:587999111022641162>
Thpe husk, ok
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Too many
Interesting
Hitcount husk in ignite weather
Also depends on the gear, like you wouldn't do a Turg rot with jst newt or bastet cez
Depends on the boss really, I wouldn't say that's a hard/fast rule
<:KekDoggo:743295767262789752>
And no io bug
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
Use VG instead
Really just two but 3 if vill v
There's only 3 fire bosses so far next patch
Cause gather and beach
I think without either, she actually beats s0 io
Hor wins if you have s2 jk or ele affixes on jk
i dont believe so anyway
no
same
yeahh
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
shut
i sleep
okay good enough
on sushang
is this good
question
wog
maybe spa still
pe can do okay ig
hor > io > everything else
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
but i imagine its painful
cant find one yet in nirv
426D
so get to work eli
IO


its close to our D in rl
this was months ago but
rl^ last two
nirv first two


i just yatta
i dont read her skills
<:02shrug:1001147147703562260>
its one or the other
75/50 or 50/35?
im certified f2p
you saw that whel index
like eden's was for me
day 1 sss worthy
but not like
for dmg yeah
sss doesnt look that good
i think i just ss ai chan
i aint tryna catch a case
thats assault
shake this
ty for the hw
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
i know its not c

this one i remember
ty
i dont remember the exact values
guys help
i hate the 80 so much
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
i could see it
well
really?
isnt that a ft strat
therefore i never retire
im not good enough to cap
see
in a dead armada
i started the game malding sim battle
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
ya
2 of them
unironically enjoying sim battle
i havent even openedd abyss yet
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
He flexes on me
His is ss
Beefy is ancient
He makes a lot of guides
Idr tbh
Like rose or riku
The newer players have the higher topup
I think it's interesting
But dude was a ginormous whale
This leviathan named kestrel isn't in there
In there
There's someone with 21k a day
Whales are a different breed
Carv
Xtals
That's average
From day they started up until 5.4 last week
How much people spent
Lemme grab
One sec
Wtf happened between 5.5 and 6.1
I was looking at the whale index on solstice from 5.4
I'm done really after 6.4
Same
I've just gotten disappointed
In a better game probably
All we really do is assign dailies
Ye
Autocorrect
Vice*
Would you be interested In a nice position
Nini
Tl: I wanna flex kei
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
No prob
From what I hear
So does tears of themis
Saints row IV had that actually
Wanted to find the nearest rafter and a rope
This is a boss I never paid attention to, I SpA this last time
Idk s0 io though
No clue
In rl
Still did way better than I thought ngl
What a surprise in 2022
Ass makes money
But source is top left
Just view this

For hor to work
Sushang needs her gear
I mean
Ic ic
KR games fr
Never heard of it
I'll play of story driven and good
Anything from ori and the blind forest to like
Until dawn

Those are vastly different games but I don't mind either
But that's stupid money
Me neither
Guys what's a good non gacha game to play
Like that's still an absurd number
They advertised that game real hard
I'd believe it
Honestly
Sensortower
Downloads as well
Revenues of Gacha games
<:ExuHyperStare:959721549101940746>
<a:darksideslap:786450895378317342>
You don't use beet B often
I think tesla
I mean
<:teriripjuice:923472148243296286>
~~every break patch has been sp~~
with how hard they're pushing story/banners
im still curious like
where do we go after 6.4
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
yeah
i think for majority you wont *need* the ranks
but if i had to rank i'd rank htr to s2 at least
i'd rather go wide
prob not
shameless says no
and ruby
styx played
<@385655541248163840> 
apparently this
i forget specifically why some are called ios
there's like 7 different cn servers
so that <@416445660443967491> stops saying how easy it is
rl 440D when
<a:AA_Kanna_Fire:786673549053263873>
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
i havent seen one
phi and ginger didnt play yet though
my bracket is so slacc
that works
ya
heki brackcet when
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
i get arrested for beating a texan man to death
i guess im pulling s0-s2
ssg honkai refmakers
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
if day 1 cn should be 1800+ days
<a:OH_peepoParty_Cheer_Birthday:667537705990619150>
wtf
you didnt tell us
oh it is
what am i seeing?
all of you
zoomers
.im Kiana Kaslana
LOL
<:KekDoggo:743295767262789752>
which is stupid
unless i like whale dorm or smth
so im gonna
nothing looks good in 6.2 outside of cn though
i can save but shiny ball syndrome
nini funds me so i dont have to
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
im certifiably fucked
10 weeks to save huh
or is 6.2 another 5 week?
6.3 5 weeks
6.2 6 weeks?
whale
could try it
damage will be an issue
ely tb loses a lot of the stuff that bianka offers but i dont think that
ely tb then?
the most importatn one <:deadge:975652771082698782>
t is like
you dont have pe gear?
what
mpe wins
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
not even a pv yet
but its happening
no clue when she drops
awakened chifuyu
since doing it
i've literally never used her
i actually really regret sss mc
i thought you were relatively newer anyway?
i just might retire with <@148145559897636865>
depending on how 6.4 pans out
you know
it's the only one i neglected
my ice dorm is actually nonexistent
for me to bother trying
too many people have the gear/ranks
s1 actually is s0 on my acc
or hor cycle
ive never been t50 on an ely cycle i think
when lol
same for ice tbh, since fookin everyone has ranks
so 3 is enough for me
its not even worth cause my myriad will be bad anyway
so much competition in lightning
and theres like
thats all i care about
you can still 893 bke with 3*
this late in her lifespan
klein 4 isnt worth
my klein is 3 lol
okay this is cap
im a minnow
fund me
i havent seen anyone cope with turg to test yet but prob viable
her stigs look like a *lot* of her own damage
prob misplaced but its there
i have faith in the cabbage
well what im doing is just pulling cn 4/4 and getting her to ss 
and s2 htr
sss mpe scores higher though
ss pe ~= sss mpe
good enough to retain
yeah fuck it s2 and sleep
im not happy about the 3% being locked behind ss though
ss without breach just reads like ae/hos
i need to recover from my bad decisions this patch lol
good enough for me
good enough for iriya
i think i s2 and stop
10% elemental damage only good for dps?
S2
-In Mecha form, Herrscher of Truth gain 15%(S0) > 18%(S2) Elemental Breach
-When Bunny or Bunny-Transformed-Mecha is on field, all Valkyries will obtain [BUFF2], All Elemental DMG +20%(S0) > 30%(S2)
3% breach huh
oh
with her ranks
where's the rentry
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
what does the ss do again?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
fuck that
did she ever get a box?
i dont even like my own ma
i do abyss
thats keilo
hod ma is here too
<:Kappa_lum:605646609056923649>
yeah
100 million boxes
she has like
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
nini wtf
okay i actually have more crybbals
So did you wtf
Put some respek on her name
<a:KroniiSMH:913330944704929842>
They just see you as a wallet
This too lol
So Nini is right
I'd opt to upgrade support pris
Need for someone or)
Is my question
Why are you looking to upgrade either
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
700
Pog
If they do it's gonna be a one and done
They don't like playing mpe
Pats sleeping this boss LOL
No iriya did something else
One aec
I think iriya did
~~thats why they have 355~~
So whale wtf
That's a new player
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
BKE did 685 somehow
Scored 650
She actually did ok in nirv
The f2p savior
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
Below ss
Also PE isn't good here
Wyd Eli
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
I've been in and out of this channel
Vaguely, yeah
<a:bloodlao:959706412685099038>
Like the 60 sp thing in handel so they don't revive hawk
It was specifically to lock vke out lol
Lol
Oh we have that sticker now
<a:darksideslap:786450895378317342>
She's also garbage below ss
I don't like malding gears
But I remember the husk runs now
Honestly forgot you had her
When did you make falcon pri Eli?
Ic ic
O right, that
Honestly never knew fr gathered
I used her like 5 times
But yeah try fr
Cause it's io ae fr if not
O okay
You have zhenyi right tet
You need gather
It's cause lightning (for example, zhenyi) is single target
SS0 io wins out
Cause hor beats s0 io now
No hor?
Would be very hard to find on bili lol
I watched kyo do this one lol damn
It's possible
<@148145559897636865> 
Ded bot
<a:monkaSTEER:820080079438741525>
you're prob right though
it feels faster for some reason
thats also the fastest herrscher to starter supply holy shit
two of the most demanding dps valks
thats kinda fucked LOL
you know
i actually have the affixes for the HT parv run now LOL
not a high week, great
owomath 47680+39880+31840
i physically cannt do these inputs on controller
824 tank it is
okay fuck this
cant copy ref, is scam, reportedBTW
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
so that when it does appear (the big one) it counts as already being filled
to do the bug, you must do this *before* the trauma gauge appears
she taps attack to proc qte
mpe is enabled by si ult to bleed enemies
the answer is this though
i doubt a lot of people are malding for a bug on this boss
wolf bug i know people did but
im assuming not many if any are
<a:SUSS:896295548729057280>
are you bug abusing
no non whale comparisons
on like the bull and other bosses but
i see s0 htr dps
yeah i got nothing
wtf
s0 dmg comparisons do not exist
bro
i'll see what i can find after this though, finishing up a migration
<@309634550273933314>
imagine having s0 valks in beta
kith sent in <#973924771727290399>
you saw one this morning, no?
but brb
i dont wanna finish my work lol
iirc
thats klein
pog
and most need dor or rc nowadays
because the hfs runs are cancer
but yeah if you used hoh on tank you're fucked for kasumi
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
not a big deal
you realistically use it like 3x a year if even so
its an asterite weapon i believe
it appeared i think
like april or may
and have it
i started sept 2021
there's like no shot it hasnt
its like a 1-2x a year thing
yeah
her own gloves work
unless <@148145559897636865> has a better idea
for 680
you're prob looking at something like this though
never owned it to test
honestly dont know
active is too slow
no
and ht is locked to bk this week
because most 733+ runs need rc or dor
i think you eat a 680
hoh or mpe or hfs
what did you do for tank
more importantly, dor
you need ss
if not i can help after
i've got like an hour before i gotta do work stuff so now is good
but im so skill issued on the fucking opener
p2 isnt bad
the transition and sp pack arent bad
i hate mpe tank <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I kinda want this again next patch
Could get ruby to confirm since they read biangs
Diff symbols
Yeah
<:AyameGaming:923996054226092044>
Time to t1
Wog
Same thing, 2 gives fast, 3 gives ult
Like 1-1,1-2,1-3 gave you all 4 qte ones?
Do the event stages
kill me instead
you can do it
tet
i'd be sick actually
it comes next patch
imagine
with eden/hot/fischl
i just unga bunga
nope
it works LOL
badly butchered
i have no clue how to do deep trial 2
im gonna
with mobi
how do you like & hate homu lol
<a:dalao:795864124907061369><a:dalao:795864124907061369><a:dalao:795864124907061369>
wild
9s huh
i wonder if that scales down to 6s/7s
but i dont really want to either
i kinda wanna go back in
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
her acc is ancient
i wanna be as old as <@704867526877904908>
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
i did lol
hawk and ns for sure
zoomers smh

how
<a:darksideslap:786450895378317342>
<:DuduDerpNggt:996935323013619762>
you dont have pe
oh thats right
you should have vil v missing but not much else
im missing nyx sw aponia mobi and db
me neither
but its free
i mean i dont either
its not even that bad
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
ah
4k from fall guys
1k from carole
2k from forbidden battles
ye
i just got that today
carole stig
so close
damn
did you tune them
but yeah you need the sync
hey its the DoS wont be dead guy
and no elf
hell this guy did it without cez
because of that first line
M is the most important piece here
glut T / Tesla T might be okay
actually heki
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
yes
i guess you'll be okay in rl
you're fucked
because you need the bleed
the more important piece of the fight is 4/4 griseo
cause no elf i'd say 650-660
or no
dabber?
good job though
720 doko
with tp
wow
spin spin spin
after 6.0
everyone has bad luck
lol
you saw what happened to me lol why did you do it'
dont blame me for your bad decisions
wtf
i didnt make nini do anything
LOL
oh
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
was that focused card worth it
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
by beating her
~~which is better than mine~~
have to use trial
no
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
use DA pri
its hard yeah
ya
doesnt fully buff burst mode
t specifically
<@434737143395516416> s elysia
that may be enough
could ig
cause she's burst mode so ely tb wont fully work
ely b
or marco tm
i think i used ely tb and some M, maybe marco polo
i managed to do that
hey
im good lol
gresham got 720
no
Lemme turn on my laptop
Kk
Are you playing now?
Just use near a cannon
It's 15 sp
Don't save it
Me, yeah
When she have bad SP everyone did, so I'm guessing dodges restore sp for team? But idj
At least that's how it feels
Like how much sp you get in transition
That depends on hs
Well
I'll cheer you on
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
im assuming

Relatable
<:durandaldick:959721397331050536>
Car🅱️
I heard fra gile talk about it
Yeah
Gl nini
Or even left the office yet
Jk I haven't played yet
It's called being bad
Is prob what they mean
And that was good enough, or pull last piece from foca
In the past, you could get 3/4 from 110 with these banners
Apparently
Lol
but hfs kasumi is always cbt
its inconsistent
yeah i never figured that out either
the reason we use dor is cause the damage breaks the shield and it has the fastest animation
and no clue about ff
the animation
soe is too slow
680 and sleep
riku having this same problem
you're fucked LOL
880 for days
I get it pretty consistently now but
Yeah
3* klein
i also dont clean kill with shinzan in p2
im slow somewhere ugh
sure
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
you wanna see?
fuck
instead of ht
swapped to eden
i accidently
and i fucked up
i finally got it
i fucked up
i only had 3-4% spcd

That even Styx wanted to sleep
That's the first boss in a long time

<a:JailedTakoWantsToLeaveButCant:869950055044505650>
Get me tf out

It's like
F2p
L
Me and Nini are literally saying not to lol
You're giving up htr frags right
You do realize
And Ana hoh
And what does ss do with fflare hor
If you wanted to skip you would've pulled sus banner
It's not that deep lol
Bro
It's literally 2 weeks
What's the point
Im saving even if I could afford to pull
I just think it's funny
Nah
I dare you
You wont
Do it
C6 unknown god when
It's been 3 years lol
<a:darksideslap:786450895378317342>
S1 does nothing for you
If you can't retain with s0
For hof rank ups
Wait till bp
We got HoF/time runner/sw
I'm surprised we desync
He didn't do that
Minus the chargeback
It worked for chy
Then charge back just to be sure
Spend $600 and uninstall
630 doko
That's fine
<a:darksideslap:786450895378317342>
Another qua?
PV with zhenyi should outperform
You have no need
And fully geared lightning supports
But since you have whale hoh
In raids
I use her
Nice
872 and 786
And IDK about crusher
SoE is slower
It needs DoR I think though
Nice
You're ss yeah?
I stopped at ss2
I did with s2
If you're SS0 you should 800 though
If you want
<:worryDasRight:595540930212397057>
For 3
Just whale
What would you even pull lol
630 doko
When it's cooked right
I like turkey more
No cap
Honestly
But duck/turkey was good
The one I had the chicken was bad
But usually chicken dry duck oily turkey somewhere in between
It depends
Twice?

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i could be 1500 s2
if i had 21 on each line
man
and pe last time was cancer
i dont own mobi
im gonna have to
this though
i just assumed vil v was an mpe boss
havent even looked
honestly
1499 ss0 is what riku has
but 830 possible still
you're gonna be attack issued
kekw
why everyone have bad attack
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
no lower than 830
for runs at this D


surely its better than my 1480 s2
her rank ups dont really do much
what attack?
he is
he's 857 rn
but you just watch styx
i linked you a couple 9s runs
really easy
its
is this the lumi that's here
run
is that the 9s screenshotting
skill issued
So 320?
The top up next patch should be another like 60
260 frags
BP is like
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
High scoring week
Fuck
Owomath 47872+39880+31786
Two examples
Pog
S0 or ss0
that i brought up here
and he's about to explode
i mean after you kill huodou
you dont need to
riht
vs what i assume is predation > ult > cez > sus stuff > hor
because durations longer if you predation > ult > sus stuff > purple > hor
but im more interesting in the transition
you can test without sus ult to see if its worth
that sounds right
or *after* sus
do you apply cez here
im guessing you predation > ult right
i have an idea for cez btw
but the tradeoff is a few more points spent on mobs
ss0 shouldnt need to
do you use sus ult on mobs
also
o
i could prob record rq if you want
idk rng really, just depends on when you kill
cause can took freaking forever
then swap to sus
on hor
like when he did his blast i evaded
i had to wait a min lol
s2 problems
and elf for sus qte
charged i mean
actually slightly slower but i tried it like twice so
well
i found the yellow > purple > predation slower
as soon as he died p1 i went to rc > tap on him for can > sus active > attack (A) > HoR charge (elf here) > sus ult
and hopefully thats enough for can to land trauma so the rc ult freeze
oic
mine was off
and is rc qte on?
rc tap on huodou (for can) > sus?
how do you transition after the 3rd spin
cause it takes me three
if it takes 3 then
hmmm
im actually surprised
really?
trying to picture timings
for p1 huodou
and im guessing you kill in two spins by the sound of it
thats a tricky one
hmm
is it possible to delay?
how long do you stay on sus?
yeah i can see the problem
ahh
when does the second cez application end for you?
okok
i think mobs > p1 > p2 for some reason
not mobs
i mean huodou
wtf
how fast do you kill p1
1480 s2 p good i think
and obv max dkey
Hor > Sus
i should probably fix that
and 4.55 crit dmg for some reason lol
mine is running 2.83% spcr
she does if you need to ult more than 3 times in a run
not bad i think
ish
2 1/2 hours
but im not malding that
maybe 804 possible?
did it in one try lol
i took a break and came back
done
<@416445660443967491>
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
not bad I think
-29 from fragile at +5D
ya
cant be done
lol
idk how to trauma
i like legit am stuck though
i hate that im malding this lol
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i wish it ran away
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
happy

<a:darksideslap:786450895378317342>

I think ana should be okay
🇱
Sounds like a
Dalao
I don't wanna PE this stage
My 1560 att SSS MPE should be fine?
Well
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
MPE huh
O
What is it
Eli norv retainer
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
Cause if he's bio then it should be sw by default
Is huodou even typeless
I don't think I've ever seen a not hor valk used here
Ssg kithwhel
Star destroyer and vil v pri look pretty different from base I think
Not a priority imo for sure
After this
But it's fine youre prob not seeing huodou for a long time
Lvl 50 even would help
You prob will need a extra rot on p1 & p2
Ssg
Not even jst
Wait
Any bastet stigs?
S2 hor?
Do you have sus gear at least?
You can prob go 850+ on RL if you have an invested ice team
This is a bit high end but generally you do something like this
Freeze him
But like 9 or 9:30
Idr offhand
Something like that
They did last year
I can only afford 10 frags at a time
Why is legacy so rare
Trying to max fire/tdm asap
I think I've abandoned ice
SN/ all ice (3) / HoV / BN / VK
I have like 7
Whale
depending how it go i'd go for htr, she looks good rn
but wait till v3
wait till v3
ruby wild
LOL
HoT/HoH cycles unplayable
so expected on top of everyone and their ancestral bloodline having this valk at ss
s0 ss sus with fflare is ~790
ya
same whammy
what the fuck NA
764 t50 cutoff rn
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
why does everyone show up on ely cycles
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
2* sirin?
Save it for huodou
Issok tet
That sounds like it would work better anyway
Nice
Just in time for bleed bosses

Pog
<:worryGetBackToWorkSlave:780487618588442704>
where's the other 100 points
this boss literally melts
should be
with himeko
sent this one to you
i also uh
just dont ult first
but they play the same basically
prob not
what a tough bracket
yo
im cleaning up my old pc
<a:JailedTakoWantsToLeaveButCant:869950055044505650>
i wish
i wish
it was still on my old pc im still stuck here <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
here
why do you have so many coins
but ss jk will see more use in the future, so i'd listen to ruby and our generous donor
assuming you can maintain that legacy income anyway
yeah
130 - 23
hey same as me
but im s2 hor s3 sushang so a tad different pers
i'd get frags for HoR
if you can tolerate non ss sushang
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
v3 when
im still recovering from vil v
on htr
i really dont wanna pull ss
hod seele <:Copium:875793728055418942>
like benares seems to be
esp if we keep getting hp sponges
but a truckload of damage
no sp
like bastet/irene b or no?
do her stigs generate sp?
me neither
you also have s1
there's still 0 shot that new fire team isnt htr new fire dps ai chan lol
mihoyo wins again
this could be you though
fragile reinstalled but feels like he'll uninstall again lol
well
him and fragile uninstalled together
i dont think he even pulled
do what chy did
yeah
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
per usual on these types of banners
also not impressed with s0
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
the ref even had it
turg tb paga M HB
yes
since anything 730 is lower is s0 jk, no fflare s0 hoh or you're bad
makes sense ig
what the fuck
myriad woke up
wait
kasumi isnt bad though
i never wanna see assaka again
you use hb enough to warrant it
i dont think
should be around 730
thats the general idea
since +10D but
this you'll need to adjust slightly
<@148145559897636865> 
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
the high rc's are s1
hb is higher score
thats a lie
well
730 ish
they're around the same if s0 sushang
they both can be annoying
neither
with fflare?
hoh jk hb?
who you using
<:worryExit:783190311987970118>
this is why you dont win degen games
maybe like 630?
at rl D
ssg
turg paga sus
jst newt
welt m huh
but you should be safe
these two might
someone might snipe
who else in that bracket
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
But I think t50 cutoff will be ~760 anyways so I sleep
I do f2p damage
Ya idk how you 733 with rc
i see
ohhh
she has 3?
3?
like last wolf was the first one without the bug too
post cflare it just became tankier
so much sp farming
twas bad
thats actually not bad
cause cf solved mobius sp problem
like imagine the wolf rots again *without* cflare though
like atrociously bad
and the type counter variant, that shield is stupid
wolf sucks because the moveset is so randomized
but i've only ever played it with 4 star sirin
i've honestly never had a problem with fire tank
but the fucking mobs are cancer
and kosma i dont mind, kosma itself is fine (remember i own vil v lol)
your answer is here
i just listed the ones i played in nirv
which kith prob did
homu my guess is the gather on the mobs if you're running io ae pv
inconsistent damage with hof
also prob cause tank changes every time we get this boss
~~no sirin 4*~~
<@291907279291285506>
if i had to pick, bke?
bke and aka are by far the most consistent bosses i've ever played
i like couatl's mechanics too actually
i dont have a favorites i think
that i dont like playing
most of my bosses are mob bosses
Of the bosses i've played in nirv:

bosses i'm fine malding:
aka
couatl
kosma (the fucking snails kill me though)
shadow knight
mecha tona
fire tank
hod (*way* too competitive though)
otto
fgo (*way* too competitive though)
bke boss (*way* too competitive though)
benares
qua whale
kasumi
rpc (boss is fine but way too competitive)
heph (boss is fine but way too competitive)

bosses i despise malding:
Homu
Wolf (both variants)
assaka (ranged)
nocturnal knight
hellmaru
padrino mobs  bleed weather
shield mobs
ice elysia
sushang
husk (all variants)
you said fflare hb so we use the second
both s0 sus cause ss sushang doesnt exist in rl over there
rc is first / fflare hb second cb19 hb third





here's the respective rots
kk
ping me when ready btw
damage output is similar enough to compare the two
well
without the 1 enemy restriction
monet is like a lightning jingwei T
i dont think people would deny that
thales was always good standalone
before they realized how strong she was
iirc people were mad at ft
lol
remember the snap no one uses ever
i dont i started that patch lol
im not worried
yeah
but i havent seen s0
the gameplay looks awkward but seems fine overall to me
yeah
esp after 3 sps back to back
not necessarily the valks
i feel player dissatisfaction is mostly tied into this schedule that we're getting
right out of a spending event into another one
for htr to need ss on a whale banner is a bit much too
miyoho isnt doing players any favors
pulling aponia only to not need her after 7t a aptch later
but used in ma every week
when she was brand new
hfs hasnt had an abyss boss for months
even 5.0
you can go further back to 5.4
i mean hoh kinda deserved
if you're talking about since hoh was dropped
what are you referring to specifically?
because i dont see miyoho shilling the dps htr
we'll have to see then
no core mechanic
that htr replaces pe lol
i honestly doubt
or rl
are you in nirv this cycle
if you rc it, even with turg
most of the time not able to freeze for her passive to proc as early as you can before doing a lot of big damage moves
its fast
ss0 sus can use the fflare hb strat then
cause idk the hb rot
and/or do you have ss0 sushang
are you using rc or hb (hb if fflare)
darius says sc2 is pretty good
starcraft
not if its best for your account to pull
i also said im not skipping
<:worryDasRight:595540930212397057>
trust
you'll get 4/4 in 20 pullss
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<a:KroniiSMH:913330944704929842>
yeah nini
do it
idr
like 15 or smth
o
cause if you mean buying then
you mean that we can buy out?
leaderboard according to nini
i thought lb was pound earlier issok
timeswirlpasses
im at like 1200
take mine
surely
you're a better player
<a:OH_Mods:731220935142539304>
rude
i cant break 700
do my abyss
eli
and all the cool kids are using bastet cez
or bastet irene
~~also turg cat~~
might have to change the rot caus ewelt m
this will work for me
sus ranks dont exist until ss anyway
cause er stamps
i'd be shocked if there was s2< in nirv
sus s1
s2 i think
I FOUND ONE
WAIT
and no sushang <:deadge:975652771082698782>
this took for fucking ever to find
not in nirv anyway
i could see hot
hmm
i thought you meant like fr/sus/mpe etc
not like new ones
wt
oh
a year from now
define farmable
true
wtf
does ss0< even exist in bili for hor
but who knows
may have not known
to discord
i dont think  he was tied back in
~~i think thats all he had~~
liu qi mb welt t was ok
well
but idr
like ana
i think liu qi is 3p or bust
cause s2 feels bad on hor
i wonder what houdou will be like
ssg eli
LOL
hey there was a bili ref like that lol
i dont own that either
or ss sus
i dont even own sss hoh
april 2018
where's your t1
eli
interface was a *lot* different
i havent seen either of these in forever
omg lol
2018
that was may 2019
this is ancient
wow
every patch
hunter does too i know them
lemme see if i can find again
there was a streamer i was watching pull the other day
and gameplay stuff too



these two channels do a lot of pulling vids
sp banners dont count right keilo
those views are nice
yeah
LOL
oh foca banners
on those banners?
in general?
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
wtf i come back to
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
hot op
<@148145559897636865> 
other than mobs ig
well
the walk should be the only bald point i think
or whatever
go get that 835
<@385655541248163840> 


<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah
marisa said yes but i wanna see a pulling stream or smth
do we know if we get a box yet
thats so stupid lol
no wonder
thats actually a different valk
wtf
40
20 for transforming?
but at sss she gets sp right
i meant for the benny vid
i think thats 9s actually
htr op
yeah im convinced
idk the ranks but she destroys benny here
wtf is that link
sushang looks faster with her 
hmm
which is which
its routed to nini so thats fine
looks bait
also i saw ss1 hrt
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
i really believe new fire dps + hrt + cn is the new team
i think you can cope with the weapon, but im not gonna skip
im gonna sleep till v3
im tired of losing trophies to an ancient valk
hoping
they'd never replace the mc
from ewhat im seeing in other servers
ya
i think phys is in a good spot
to replace ch lol
2 years
it took
she's squishy but damn are her iframes annoying
also i dont like this kasumi abyss
<a:JailedTakoWantsToLeaveButCant:869950055044505650>
there's like a million messages
im backreading
nini's whaling 200k crystals
something something cherry
v1 HTR op
Norman kinda annoying though
But I think harder is subjective
The main difference is pgr encourages not getting hot with a faster playstyle
Kinda?
For the ranks that vid has it's fine
Crazy though
So many messages
I missed a lot huh
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<a:OH_Mods:731220935142539304>
ban him
or carv or cherry
or am i misremembering
it worked on houdou
<a:bcaBugcatSomberCry:992292392973639750>
seems to be
1x is the sp
.5 she locks in
i already did abyss so
actually lemme test rq
idr exact value
its like 1 hp bar, somewhere around there he takes the form of the element that did more dmg
yeah
cause the meta team rn is hot gd pv
whats the main dps
way overkill
you like
also tested cez, idk how to make it work
he takes the form of that
whichever element does more dmg to him
this was the old way
one sec
i think actually that rot is fine still
3 months ago
yeah
is my guess
prob 415 rl
eli's in nirv this cycle
who knows
465D in nirv
im not kidding either lol
you could if you had sss sushang/hor
i think its actually impossible to find a non paga ref
paga M is on ae on that one
ssg
heki using hof
ic ic
you needed the sp
oh
why not bastet tm cez b and turg tb paga m on hb then>
why bastet B
its cbt at this D
gl lol
omg someone played hof
and ff hb
but every rc i did see was paga turg
i dont think i saw any hh rc hb rots
ew
but how no gear
rank doesnt really matter
hh jk rc is the wave for you
you dont have sss hb right
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i almost failed it lol
where you defend the pillar
ya
granted lack of gather didnt help but omg
that was stupid thick with HoT
wtf am i supposed to use on the second stage
<:worryStronkL:403557896589148160><:worryAngryStronk:690379024400121896><:worrystronkr:451807355097579530>

after that sick burn you roasted tet with
cause he's burnt
<:beanieburnt:900127435859841094>
ic ic
oh
?
felt
who'll fund us if you die
no
so will i
LOL
yeah
<:eBKlaughkitty:670817287132938250>
<:lewd_hh:710968174757281833>
she feels sp starved even with s2
that hurts aponia no?
but i opted for the winter princess stig instead
same
<a:KroniiSMH:913330944704929842>
i've seen your 500k
show topup rn
sw and vil were skippable though yeah
i meant the bundles
better times
neither was i
it was this bad last year
why is everyone surprised lol
the usual black friday bundles
yeah, wasnt planning on it
no
and also wanna pull holmes but no point now ugh
thats silly
lowkey wanna pull time runner to finish dorm buffs too but uh
s1 wouldnt do me any more favors over s0
ik ik
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i wanna pull adv but i shouldnt
lol
fund me
nini
With ai chan
9S team is stupid lol
Half the People in that server are cunny lovers
Ssg akayuki
Like 2 lines is good
I think higher rank uses crit more, no?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
something i cant afford to pri
No fflare gaming
I wanna test cez / paga / that one ppm I saw
I actually really wanna try kasumi now
But should be fine on lower D
Its like double the elfs output or smth
yeah
i think it'll be more like a pe alternative if anything
i cant see a scenario where kiameibronya team gets more than like 2 bosses
only viable team
not
thats top score though
but who knows
im assuming its gonna be kiana/htr/cn
not counting the sp cards
thats like 8k crybbals i think
if she gets nothing else i may ss then
the 3s sp skill looks to be personal damage
i havent read skills
but im maxing her day 1
oh i have no clue
its fine
i dont have to sss day 1 sp valks anymore
wait actually
i hope that 6.5+ leaks arent true
happy nini
monthly/bp only
fine
trust
after cny im f2p
game too expensive
i dont even wanna fund mine
s0 hof is gonna be rough though
if ever
im just gonna wait for bp
but
i wanted to pull that
smh
just ss
i dont think so
yeah
oh daily drill
what ranked one
hey thats mine too
plus if we had to drop a fire support in usage, its certainly not her
and she's a good enough score increase for me
we're only gonna get more ignite stuff
im def not skipping ai lol
i dont wanna whale 6.4
kith talk me into skipping bronya
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
and the spending has still increased since 5.3 ish
constantly broke
im like
for the 3*
i did have to pull a copy though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i got my klein from spending event currency
whale
qte for days
just gd hot pv
owomath 31893+47648+39733
what is this
at 467 someone used ppm
oh shit
oh there was one with wedge
majority are ss+
but 4* ely elf
this was the only bastet i saw at s0
if high hoh rank
some use bastet cez
rc uses turg paga yeah
cause people seem to run hoh/jk/hb (if fflare) or hoh/jk/rc
oh but no sus gear huh
do you have fflare
type  kasumi
<:OkayuGrab:749933032479391744>
cmere eli
pog
ic ic
she's a viable/t2 option now (at high rank)?
so on the bosses she can be used on
its not *that* far from s0 hoh (the ones without fflare)
im surprised
apparently hor is used here
rip tet <:tericross:902580093304586320>
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
nice
oh interesting
asking cause i found these two at same D


ic
im assuming the former won out since the freeze is so high
<@180679257851166721> was there a huge difference between turg pag M & bast tm Cez B for any refs you saw
you say that every abyss
im dead
and non ranked hof at this d is prolly gonna make you kill yourself
boo <:deadge:975652771082698782>
if you dont  have fflare you use rc huh
if you want an easier life i saw a rc but rc isnt that good here
i thought you were ss2
wait when did you sss jknini
not that i saw
Its pretty much all ff hb right
VK PX BR AE fire dmg dealt 5% at S, 7% at SS 28% currently
SK LE HT lightning dmg dealt 5% at S, 7% at SS 21% currently

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
But I need s2
I don't have crybbals
Shit
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
<@416445660443967491>
And what rank is sushang rn
Did you end up pulling dudu or Klein?
But you don't have any right?
I feel like you asked before
having gear helps
well
thats ae
o
doesnt really seem to matter
eh
without a doubt
nirv its pv
you'd use pv since no ae
aponia team
only times handel is support is like
ya
Your time to shine
<@416445660443967491>
Starry Impression
ssg
seatwarmer
<@385655541248163840>
this isnt even a joke anymore lol
<:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
ill mute you if you say that again
We didn't even make fun of you last time
LOL
I'd be surprised if it uses marg
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
I think it's okay for budget abyss runs on pardo
If you want to invest in ss ma this works
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
Yeah, most of it is old/niche gear
Divine keys if you haven't yet
Beet M is always good
Tesla band T/M if you really wanted
And sn
Eli is
Wym worrymad seele is good
Are you using sp?
So consistent
Mhy is shilling s2/ss2 now
Also no more whaling (Nini)
The gather is the real boss
Lol
The easiest boss in the game
It's literally
also spa cope
you cant escape turg cat
3 set ana
are like t2
or even 7-8s
9s hoh teams
nah
ranked hoh doesnt compete as well as i feared
actually i take it back
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i actually have competition this time
but yeah most times you're stuck until 985-986
you can still hit at 988 sometimes
bye
in the same p1
3 fucking times
sushang evaded me
HoT FR PV works too
Well
HoT
Need a ref?
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
im not sure never played fr dps
Probably
Little bit of both
<a:JailedTakoWantsToLeaveButCant:869950055044505650>
set me free
go back to when i started playing and talk me out of it
are you a time traveler?
im more surprised people wait until the weekend to do these
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
i feel like you know them all though
sure
iirc
move slower but attack faster
planck
it should be a though
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
clearly its ask mr knight
you should know this
ya
LOL
you can
its only 15 points
get back to there
you're losing to edison
<a:QIQIShoot:890718532524990546>
dw she packed me up too
<:TE_PepeLaugh:898642659743260783>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
should've pulled s2 aponia
sushang bad
i take it back
transition has been *okay* so far
is the fucking jumping and sealing you in a water bubble
the most annoying part of it
im actually so upset lol
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
perfect 23/23
ss2
bruh
That's like tomorrow right?
NYCC
Oh shit lol
if that exists
for non ss hot
omg
a LOT more damage
klein is
so uh
like 3* wedge gets most of that increased ice damage
and she has a switch cd
thats called ely elf lol
to be useful
wedge needs 3*
thats another card though
im kinda tempted to get 4*
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
ty
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
<@309634550273933314> ty
30 pulls for 2 elves
bro
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
first pull
<@781539392039682058>
For dps
And ss2 is massive
20% tdm on eden
I mean
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Wth
That's a 102 id
Bro
Cookieezii was right
Ah
Mechs?
Qua?
What's the side stage
Heki
Okay lol
Bro
This god player
Ssg
Heki expecting no challenge
Yeah Eden better then
O
Idr why though
I think fr lead is better sometimes
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Not know
Did you
Beat her with a stick
Ez dub
No Klein you have klein
That's @ noon in blucord
Mega casual
It's fine easy t2
Magery will eat you up
Why keilo have perms to assign me perms
Wait
Oic
I thought keilo wasn't a full mod
<:CB_cool_umaru:815611576353947658>
I put in my time this week later losers
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
Didn't get my lunch
I really should leave early today though
In like an hour
When I get home
So much abuse waiting
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I need mod
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Stupid elf
Elysia I spent on
I hope
70 pulls from no elf to 4*
Dabber was nice to me
Hi
I wish
I'm gonna pull in like an hour
Guys bless my Klein pulls
I'll pull later and see
I think I just barely have enough for Klein
These things expensive
Rip your mats though
Very nice
Hopefully you get your second card soon
Pog
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i'd be 4
owomath 31626+47776+39746

owomath 1.2 * 39720
i forgor
oh right
<a:bcaPatientlyWaiting:764167633234559016>
not much value comparably imo but <@148145559897636865> waiting room
if you had to pick i'd pull 2* dudu and get klein from the box
s0 4/4 sw is good but i dont see her getting much more use

its what, hellmaru assaka and ice elysia? and i think fire is expected to dominate next patch
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
and how far are you into elf banners
how many crystals you have
more important question
you ideally want 3* for the force qte
2* klein isnt that good but banner tomorrow
nonexistent
oh
how far are you from elves
at s0
what does sw do for you
I think 4* gets tdm right? That's basically constantly active?
I don't plan on getting this

How big is 4* Klein compared to 3*
jesus
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah
imagine joining a vtuber server
it looks fun

9s whale
this is ocean
pog
Smh my head
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
Wyd
That's why I sent a no elf ref lol
Avo or Theresa Origins is good enough though
You don't have sieg m
Here's a no elf run in sea but
That's a hard one
So no fire elf
And you have no elf other than dabber?
You're in rl right?
Wednesdays are usually bad for me
Busy
Not tonight sorry

Then moved to na
Well he's been playing since the sea server opened
His hidden channel
Yeah
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
I dont wanna pull
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Fookin whale
shino's run set him loose
3* fuxi too
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but
i can see the 650
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
you right
my scores
cant duplicate
i actually
im still on if you still wanna watch
done
<@385655541248163840> logging in now
I'll play when I get home
Rots here for future use 



Okay, dm login info
I won't be able to tomorrow
<@385655541248163840> you want me to play still?
Either works though
I say this one
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
They found my rot
<@416445660443967491> do my Abyss
<a:ChikaDance:611423525529714688>
<:lolice:532005386694426634>
s1
pleasant surprise huh?
sushang op
nah, thats a solid score w/out klein
turg /jst comes in so clutch
yeah she's surprisingly strong there
oh, ma
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i wish i was this good
this is oko
nah, i do streamables
i may live
a better rot for s0
i found it
wait
last tank was 452 on eu no?
nice
23k crystals
probably
if you're concerned about hof's pri, i dont think s2 ae would help that much in tank
yeah, i think waiting is better
i legit think they forgot about her
before ranks
etc
dkeys
dorm
pris
and go for s2/ss when she's farmable

but id def get other opinions
like i'd farm up the other stuff first
i think s2 ae is strong esp at higher D like we are now 
i dont think we'll ever find ourselves not using ae as a flex support either

i dont know about spending $25 for it though
you'll notice the 2% breach but im not sure how much of an impact it'll make on your acc
what is it, $30 usd?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
people who pulled the first ones
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
i dont remember irene standing out
i think handel yeah
zhenyi t/b is also strong if its a short fight
i'd get a second opinion probably but i think if you're using hoh rc jk for the foreseeable future
i'd double down on that team
i dont think nyx has much use nowadays either
you could use fr if you wanted
thats a weird one for me
in my experience, 4/4 sss hb has beaten out 4/4 s0 sushang
idk tbh
hb is like
sa def not
good refs should be out by then
this patch was not kind to my mats either
ic
even better
dont we get like 60 a week
yeah
this is like the best mpe player on our server lol
i havent seen a good s0 hof score yet, but kyo got 700 with s1 hof
at 467D
this scored 650
<@82358863155703808> i take it back
i think overall is the best play
i dont like it necessarily but its definitely viable / solid option  for most accounts (read: non whales)
and just level as needed
for a good chunk of support pris
lvl 50 *is* good enough mostly yeah
im not <@416445660443967491>
i dont like the idea of running supports without max pris/close to max
but i meant max hof if you can also lvl 60/max ai chans pri too
the argument is usually that support pris have more use cases so usually you wanna max those
like pardo and her 30% ult reduction cd

idk how tru that is though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i miss using spina
esp if not sss / type advantage kinda hard to overcome
def s0 hof
and it wasnt that good
could try it though
i only saw 1 vid on bili
i wouldnt use mpe if thats what you're asking
you could get fucked over so easily
just a good example
this doesnt apply *as much* anymore since nirv is so large now and +0 but
also wasnt my acc/screenshot
this was wild lol
hod
yeah
easy retains are usually bosses no one else likes to play
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
def bracket rng for sure
like this
provided you can also max ai chan's stuff
then go for it
so i think it depends on you and if you're betting on more usage for her in 6.2
i just think if this is her only boss, is it worth if you need to level other pris
for the general question, if you should max hof pri, i mean you can if you've got the mats or you think you can retain
in that acc already
but thats 10k plus
like ice is fairly new
if you dont know the spending level of said players
thats not a good comparison point
and ideally close to max as possible dorm/dkeys
for rl for sure, nirv is like 
13/13 max gear teams
depends tbh
thats usually what happens in gacha games if you're playing without time or a large financial investment
generally i think the advice is max them if you need them
but id caution against investing into a pri for 1 or 2 bosses
maxed pris can give you a power buff while you build those up for sure
like ss+
everyone and their extended family has ranked pe on na
pe  cycles are *not* cycles you wanna mald on lol
also
i mean if you have the resources by all means
we just dont get her bosses very often

idk the schedule next patch so i cant speak to future uses
thats not *that* much of a jump then
ah
what level
yes
lvl 50 or?
is it like
who knows her usage next patch
well
i wouldnt this late in the game imo
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
+2% fire dorm
i wait till tomorrow to mald more
but i assume you're fine
idk about s0
yes
ill jump with you
he's actually such a pain in the ass in abyss
heim
ew
because you have the damage
its not that bad
with s2 ae kinda?
but
s1 is op
im out
-5D
you can almost one rot tank p1
yes, but s2 means you have s1
s2 is bs
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
3.25m
bar is the same though
what the fuck
ult
3.18m
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
3* sirin
oh
cake mei is really good
cursed bracket
oko velskud styx
wow
send code
yep
leemme try now then
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
thats so awful
nvrmind
o
i still have it
just lmk when you logoff
i expect it to be relatively equal
i can do a run or two
thats fine
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
ss ae?
i can try if you wany
hmm
-6
look what i found lol
im like -1 tdm and -4 fire as well
whats att
but ss+ still
470 i mean
and those runs are ss+
on bili
but i dont and the highest D ive seen is 468
if i had 30 more att i wonder
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
idk where
i think there's another rot for not killing tank p1 with just ae ult but
hot really stole everyone
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but i dont think rank for rank, ss1 da would beat ss3 bke, nor does the future schedule warrant any future investment into da
thats what i think anyway
may wanna ask around
im deadge with her too
i dont even have dante lol
just feels bad
D is too high and no timestop
i dont think ai chan is gonna help next patch either
but da is kinda dead
i think bke may again in 6.3
da will really never see usage anymore i think
sss sp pretty nice
imo
id take the ss3 though
ss3 is just lead idc
ss1 da is p small
hmm
what does bke get at ss2
i dont think i can even 650
i might
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
maybe
~690ish
i think s1 is fine
missing 1% tdm 4% fire
2% as of tomorrow
1446
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
pls
keilo gib att
anyone know?
max att for s0 hfs is ~1480 now, yeah?
up here anyway
really bad
like
bad
you do no damage
if you're s0
this boss (tank) is mega dead
also side note if youre in nirv

Nini backreading
<:alphacryjuice:923461030967918592>
Me neither
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Boring
Oh bruising
You're a cutie to but no 😉
<:no_lum:666832358003179530>
It's like Nini lite
You'll like my acc
Get me out
You can do my er anyway
<a:TE_BBoomer:854084726117629972>
She'll beat me to a pulp
I can't say
Actually nvrmind
She's like
Old references
And Kanye going vrazy
Cause this was all the rage in my time
Was my first thought
Black and blue
All of you
Zoomers
Y'all have never heard of this?
I feel like heki is referring to this?

<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Eliclassist
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
No
Yeah
A couple hours ago
6-7k left
There was like
Is this the dress thing?
HoH does it twice
And it takes a while each time
<:RoseFlashbang:870623126826909716>
my time to shine
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
but idc about ice atm
i need bn / sn / hov / all the ice ones / vke
pretty much the same
get my al valks done
100%
im literally just getting frags lol
because i pulled a card from dorm
180 frags left
then like 6-9 weeks on vke
i have her tomorrow
should've waited on mpe
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but yeah they wereyears ago
technically no longer gacha which confused me
they were yeah
i was just confused by the gacha weapons are craftable
oh im not saying it isnt
L
takes forever though
and those *can* be reso'd
all the old bounty weapons are craftable
the spirit weapons, yeah you can
not recommended but its an option
what gacha weapons can you craft?
also heki
just save crystals?
but i dont see how its not f2p
which is gacha only
i guess f2p = cant pull anything
but
i mean its a gacha weapon
its literally in exchange house
ae's weapon?
ss2 good enoug
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
my fr will never be done
no more mpe farming
Neither did I until a few months ago
Admiral
Cakefleet
Nah
Not that I remember being important
I got toma
Don't tryhard
They play but
Wtf
4 dead lines
Mine was awful lol
One less attack yeah
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
350 locks for a 9.2
Rolled a 23, and wasted 350 locks trying to affix the second line
I had a stig with two 16.5 lines
But it's fine
I think I bricked My Hof ngl
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
You played not me
No u
This isn't even bad
Honestly
And yes, still number 3
Shut

<@385655541248163840> what does bracket look like
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
Those are buffs you're missing I'm assuming?
Where valks
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
Proud of you nini
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
Pog

Shield bash?
Okay bet

Nice!
Until yesterday
Well
I know
Moreso for you cause ss pe
It's SS ma
Yeah
I just want my dailies and ow stuff
You don't need to mald it though nini
No one else is scary
But I think 750+ is safe
Or moose
Wow neffr didn't play yet
What bracket look like?
If possible
780
This boss
Well
Esp on this boss and fgo
Yeah that all adds up
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Ah
Depending on how fast your hands are
~790-800 should be possible though
It's all Nini
Nah
I'm not playing this weekend, out of town
Any scores I set in abyss are not mine on my acc this cycle
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
I'm too powerful
<@434737143395516416> w domain of sentience
35%
<@434737143395516416> w my kissy pillow
Just dos then I think
Hmm
Were you using neba or dos earlier
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
?
With SS senti
In that above vid
I just do what Darius does in his opener
And sleep
Just do swords then
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I blame my missing 2% phys dorm
S1 actually sucks
Wow
I wonder if sswords stacks were at play or +2D is just insane
That much HP
800 it is I guess
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
But cdmg should be better
Less bald
I use myriad
Or something like this
Because I imagine you do this if you can't one shot core
The rot hasn't changed right?
Fair
S2 is okay
Not happy about hot power level rn
I've said it before but
Understandably so
And s0 is at that point already
Just make PE not be able to one shot core
It's easy
Nah
Insane
Yeah
Type hos is BKE too
Bloodlust mobs or nocturnal knight
Idr which but one of those was bk
Depends on the boss
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
From not strong enough to too strong
Shit on every other t2 option
I feel like af just like
Yes
Idr
Jizo wasn't bad until they reworked the boss for af I think?
I don't have skadi
I wouldn't even if I did
I can't believe how bad the non SW options are
Oh I mean the boss
It would go badly though
Ice Elysia memes
My dreams of SS
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
That's a legit complaint I have
Actually idk why she isn't yet
<:TE_PepeLaugh:898642659743260783>
That'll never be farmable
And not pull/backpull for every valk and 4/4
Why is it hard for people to understand that they'll need to save
Also
Idr why James worthy did this though
With a Lowkey toxic song
It was a meme
LMAO
<@148145559897636865>
Saints been abusing this one
You have my toxic gifs
Keilo
That's not a good backpull imo
Right now
I would not pull pe
Also this is fun to read
Yeah
Like unironically
If not nirv, prob not
Personally
LOL
Feels weird
Like it's obv strong but
Cope with newt Mei glut
Because my answer is no if they don't have the crystals
How much crystals do they have
I mean
Me?
Guy pulled on something he shouldn't and got defensive about it and is coping now?
I don't get what is even the question anymore?
Yeah just read that lol
This is fun
Actually nvrmind
I wanna play
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Keilo maincord Prof (real)
Out of town

<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Like Swatting a fly
LOL
She gets so much more shieldbreak at sss
Yes
You can use newt
It works though
<:02shrug:1001147147703562260>
Or smth
Couldn't Eli ft HS sns
Is hos in use?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

You can 893 with 1
65 + 50
If it's kallen probably
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
Esp if discount banner
Fuck bronya
Conpletely

CNY im expecting to be crazy
BP os the best way for low spender anyway
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I gave you refs heki
Lol
Yeah
No shot
To go from s0 to ss
You need the full 28000
Just do it you whale
Or sin if Canadian
That sounds like ssn?
Your keys expired
Personally the last one may be best
I'd look through all 3 but
3 varied refs
There heki
Not at this D
There aren't f2p nirv refs
One sec
But this is full gear
So lemme find something cope
I'll see what I can find
Prob not happening
Okay thats
You know how hard it is to find a f2p RL pe
But I'd start looking to save for cny
I'm impressed
I've never seen abyss so active lol
<a:patpat:850500624630022154>

Oh Nini you might not have to mald my abyss after all
Out of state
I can't login rn

Of dec
Isn't it until the 29th
<:prayge:863861301310652416>

Also welcome to my world
Just need to stage 3 I think
Whoops
3 stages
Oh

<:nokek:1014211961292083240>

<:prayge:863861301310652416>
Gogogo
Na abyss open
Dw about it
You saw my crystal count
I don't even top up my own
Also don't have enough crystals
You uh
Simping purposes issok
Competitively speaking you'd be throwing
Yeah, 90 ish minutes
I think 9s is okay there
I wouldnt
<a:based:960205908980424734>
Respectable
Simping ok
Hmm
Sswords hs with SS pe
Are you pulling Holmes?
Nini
Actually
F2p can't compete
That's what it took Riku too
Whale
I didn't try hard either
Understandable
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
792 should be easy
It's easier than the Turg or newt RC tbh
Phew
Oh
Rip tank
And no dupe?
?
You locked cez right
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
A few I think
Yes
Ty
Bet
?
But no urgency
Okay
Is there a time limit?
But just click on it in desc then?
I can't login
For the shipping details
Do they send you a link after or
How does buying book work
<@309634550273933314>
Government people and state workers get to relax though
I'd have work today too lol
If I wasn't going on a road trip
Only +0'd wolf
I'm like 4280 or 4380 or smth
I'll have an even number finally
You're going down to 3k
Whether 3100 or 5300
No I mean if you're above 3k trophies
Actually me lol
If above 3k
3k
After the first cycle
Should be
I just know the stigs are strong
Idek what the ranks do ngl
Ic ic
Nyx?
Who's the adv for
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Cheaper than SSS hoh
I wanna SSS day one
Im gonna
And Eden right
For PE
Oh shit
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Houdou, type hos, bloodlust
She was fun in RL though
Yeah, agreed
Sounds like a tency thing
Was that tencent?
Lol
One sec
Actually I remember saints suggestion lol
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
RL is sleeper can retain, even promo with lvl 50 pris
I think if people looked at the teams as a whole, I think they would realize the DPS isn't the problem per se
It's actually wild how many people want dkeys for hof/ae
I swear I don't remember 5 lol
I must've not been around for one
I swear we only got 4 akas
What was the second in 5.7?
What
2 cycles
She had
Even in RL that's miserable
Okay that's crazy lol
For her time she was strong
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Yeah, true
Honestly
I don't think I've regretted not pulling her
Er valk fr
But Mobius for sure was the wave
9S hot actually got a pretty respectable score iirc
Oh right, I forgot about wolf
Was torture
I saw pat do that
And HoH got her standard 3 cycles
Yeah kosma was twice that patch
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
Idk how people did on tonytron
And he was there twice i think
Kosma, hoh did pretty well on if 9s
What were the bosses again?
I meant for pulling hoh
I hope anyway
I think ai chan will really shake things up though on 6.2 for fire
S0/s1 actually can't compete
Everyone and their mother brother grandmother's have ranks
For 9S for sure
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
Easy wins
Non competitive cycles on a suffering team
Still one of the better investments I've made
It's fine though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
It's actually bs 9S hoh beats her
Which probably won't happen with vil
I'm gonna try to T15 all 3 accs
Yeah
On fire tank/sushang
But I'll be surprised if we -2 back to back
We were the exact same as the debut I mean at 463D
It did for heph
This is usually right though
It's the exact same
If we somehow to down to 461D
The vil v rot hasn't changed
2
Ss2
It'll take longer to learn the hoh rot
Vil is like maybe 15 minutes
It seems easy enough
Meh
With hoh
I can't believe I'm playing twice
I'll be piloting Riku that cycle too lol
Except fire tank cause I think you're s0?
You'll t1 any bracket for sure
Nah
Idk why I'm always fighting for my life
It's a lock for sure
On accounts that aren't mine
Well
And frame drops like crazy
Transition is bs
It's toxic
Don't recommend lol
And my fischl arrow not hitting
Opener PTSD of LI SUSHANG
I just don't like that boss
I'm sure
I gotchu
Okay, sushangs annoying but those other two are easy
I just remember agreeing
Idr
Other than hof
Exactly what cycles am I playing for you
Oh that reminds me
I believe in you
Ik ik
785ish should be possible
I just rolled a bad bracket per usual but that acc can take fourth or fifth
And Keeby oko iriya lux etc
Me
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Prob gonna have to top up for a Klein card
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
For the Sakura wills
I can't be bothered to press buttons
That's all I do too
I need my crybbals I'm broke
And dailies pls
Just the abyss stages
Yep
I forgor
You don't have PE
Wait
Have you tried being faster
IMG stages should go pretty quick I think
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
nini this you?

reminds me of seele
and never doing that again lol
with having pe free
i think they realized their mistake
iirc
680 w/out schro
733
mobi or spa is like
no pv conflict
so competitive though
its gonna be like
ez for me
i wanna mald next weeks
i did it last time but
dont really wanna mald ma
840 every time
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i dont have the hands though
yeah kallen 893 is actually so straightforward
seeing a lot of pag tm newt
im guessing 2 pc effect
which is hs anyway
but pe needs what mpe does
for the 893
i dont have pag t
for 946
need sss hs
s0 pe can but
why kallen shield so thick
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i should've mpe
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
easy t100 for sure
its like -3 or -4 from jst cez but
760
i played once
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
me neither
yeah that should 760 for sure then
okok
oicc
you beat 760 right?
but im getting my 2% so im good
turg ppm works which is what darius did i think
jst cez
ya
i didnt know i needed cez
not good lol
<:lolice:532005386694426634>
where's the suspense

ssg
audrey was a wild card
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Deserved
🐌
Don't forget the bombs
Lol
If you played year 1
You were pretty maso
Abyss was way different back then
If it's a 2019 vid
Yeah that sounds right
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Take me back
<@704867526877904908> remember when this was high
speaking of
I dont have footage but I have an old screenshot
17
Basics is like
Whale
Can prob run FF if you wanted to test
Predation and ult on pardo is enough so
The rest is the same
CB and before trauma change but
Here
Keilo
S0 jk
FF should outscore
I don't have a ref for that
Ff
Oh
Sushang
Or
Hb
For
Smh
Fake and gay
Click on hua enthusiast
i have
yes
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i can count the non ss hoh on one hand
why does everyone love this valk
which i do not
he also has 4* elf
maybe?
but 2% is maybe like
2 points the way im rotating
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but that wouldnt even help me
idk how donut got 784
audrey woke up
also nvrmind im 5th
i respect it
simp
We'll see if the other ones can be bothers
Once they do I'm fourth
LeEruru and shiki haven't played yet
finishing something up
gimme like 5
probably could use this
but i mean we can try it
idk the sushang rot
painful though
that is
i have 5 tdm 15 ice for this
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
6% dorm would fix this <:Cope:888647792434765864>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
now im stuck 772-776
hard stuck 767-771
i was like
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
and he lives on a sliver of hp after the second ult
then i get fast enough
im not fast enough i should say
well
have 0 damage
i like
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
<@291907279291285506> i cannot catch you
imagine
it never ends
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
that sp is actually a big help
this should be full btw
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
gj though
<a:patpat:850500624630022154>
thats a lvl 9 key
<:susge:830321489064230952>
✈️
Trust
Next patch
Someone demote me
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Imagine
Freeze/elf timing?
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
Highly recommend
Dorm is nice
So many SS+
There's like
Why does everyone on na have this valk ranked
Where the fuck are they coming from
Bro
You can too heki
I think <@704867526877904908> got 700+ with okay gear
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
You sweated hard yesterday
Show us
Eli where your ref
But gwneral idea is good
Bastet though
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
But it's nice
Takes a bit to stack though
It's pretty nice ngl
Was not fun
On FGO
I tried that rot
But you'll wanna kill yourself
Dual candy is stronger
If you were maso you could gpn
Holmes TM Newt B
If not sswords overall is better
If you can one shot
Holmes is unironically stronger lol
Nocturnal knight or whatever
She means on hs
<@434737143395516416> s holmes
Yeah
Idk about the vil v boss though, haven't seen footage
3
You bedge at like
It's only been 5 hours
Go bed
Eli
But I'm broke
I want to
But Holmes banner
FR and the other one
I'm gonna assume everything after follows the schedule though
PE/Dabber 11th
Klein/Aponia 18th
Forever
It's been in in game news for like
Cause 11th is PE and dabber
Like gear or?
If they all try I'm literally 7th with 775
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<@385655541248163840> there's another 9S in my bracket
Imagine malding
very nice
slide > double tap > ez  kills
mega toxic
pre patch that was like
we're cool
ok
were you a thorn abuser
did you play d1 eli?
also didnt know eli played destiny
thats a game i havent heard of in forever
you approved of it
<@704867526877904908> toxic
no prob
icic
thats explains all the sss im seeing in armada applicants
she was right?
was asuka an s rank?
oh btw
this was why LOL
remember when we thought tenshi was boosting
it aint worth it
i badly need coins but
i stopped pretty much
on my own acc its like 3-5 minutes for a game
like on acc around 5k was usually instant
its painful ngl
higher rank = takes longer to match
cause i wont be here this weekend to play that cycle
i gotta remind nini
oh shit thats right
until trophy reset anyway
im hard stuck here
you have the option of climbing down
tbf
last kasumi felt brutal though
s1 hoh and s0 hof
im gonna play both
my pride said no
but uh
i was gonna do this
kasumi wil be interesting
i like tank too
benares was ok
i didnt like assaka

hov was fine *if you had soe*
everything else looks fine
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i have to use my crippled hor
i cant do the 883 SpA i did last time (this was rl)
abyss
this houdou is gonna suck
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
bring me back home
which is nice
yeah
not by much but lower
just be aware thats its a lower score
which he can do
he wants to use sushang
way more than enough to t1
you're ss hb so its fine i think
<:worryGetBackToWorkSlave:780487618588442704>
so im hearing 850
dkey diff'd
but its a score loss overall
idk why sea is so high
yep
4 weeks
yes
you have a dead elf
say you pull wedge though
then spend crystal on her
unironically i'd rather spend the 30 bucks to buy her stamps
you got spending event stamps?
40 frags
just under s2
should be
yeah
if you spend paladin 4 four patches, its ss hos (48 balls) and 16 left for sushang
6.4 and 6.5 yes
i wouldnt pull sushang since she's farmable and getting stamps in bp either
pure elf orb right
i actually dont know but
havent heard anything about it
i dont think you can
which is useless to you
cause you'll get wedge frags
i wouldnt pull
then why risk your blade durandal
if not 3* minimum we isnt an elf
with the trauma change
which is kinda less mald now
so i think if non ss jk, just use the hb rot
granted eli got 835 with hoh hb rc still
at least for this boss specifically
its not fun in nirv from what i've seen
idk how non ss performs in rl but
i mean hb
if not just use rc
is your sushang ss
whats up
i can be
<a:Smoge:808844088115068938>
imagine having hh
waiting for the ss sushangs to play
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<@416445660443967491> raid with us
but this sucks
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im getting my stamps next patch
probably
so scores should be ~the same
its the same
scores are gonna be so high
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i did 771 last time
oh nvrmind
is it this easy now?
what the fuck
kk
im ready when you are
Not bad
Or hof
HoT PE Twins
Time to leave
Alright
I wanted strem
I'm not home yet
Why
?
All these <@148145559897636865> malders
I haven't even played yet
9 points
834
Fine
850
I did
850?
<a:bloodlao:959706412685099038>
Should've raised it
But I lowered the standard
I was gonna say that first ngl
Doko
822
Pog
I leave in a bit
I at work
In a bit
I believe eli
820 doko
See what feels better
But I'd play both
The Ana scares me
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<:Kappa_lum:605646609056923649>
~~she's better anyway~~
That's quite a bit
And 25% fire missing, not including alignment bonus
That's 45% ult tdm
Tell me the 3 PC effect
Eli
Tell that to ganesha
This is literally the most important stig
Wait
You need the mechanic now
Unironically
Yeah
No me
Simp
I remember
It's workable I think
That's why you demoted lol
Do you not have soe?
*if you own hoh*
Like since the trauma change this boss is a joke
I think sushang will inspire people to try though
Imagine
If one doesn't play I'm fighting with shirai for a spot
It's more of
s1 can't compete for 5 SS
Not even lol
Y'all so worried
I'll try though
No shot
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
there's two more ss hoh
im actually dead on bracket generation
trade
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
nvmind i dont own that
bet
<@385655541248163840> help me
im also probably demoting this cycle
im actually broke
no me
smh
you're getting beat by that cata
lol
whoops
oh
kallen
oh
sure
only 310 in NA jeez lol
I'm not even in
Says the one on myriad rn
I blame keilo
463D
last hod back in sept was like
pre 5.9
def not this sweaty tho
i think
that was fgo
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
same
yo
if fire's your strongest team, id shoot for tank
that shield is no joke
like the only one i'd actively avoid is kasumi
or you could +0 and promo into qua whale, since thats pretty free
and mostly ranked pe
everyone and their extended family has pe
like
i'd promote on hod tbh
less competition
oh
~~i wouldnt in nirv~~
given how much bigger brackets are now
which means you'll likely retain
last cutoff was 613 for myriad
in my experience anyway
everyone shows up on hof cycles
glb sucks at tank more i think
but retain maybe
and i dont think you maxed neb
this is assuming everything is maxed btw
def not promote\
retain maybe? like 8th?
and ae s0 results in a slower rot and more sp farming
that 2* sirin isnt doing anything
you're gonna tickle tank though
nable to clear sides probably
thats
and elf
show team
i hate sushang boss
im not even doing mine
absolutely not
jk it depends on the boss
<:worryGetBackToWorkSlave:780487618588442704>
do your honkai stuff
<@385655541248163840>
the lvl 60 pri hurts more than the s2
not really this though, i took some elements from it
kinda this but im s2 hor
so by the end of the rot i have like 0 sp
<:Sweats:959781948274909244>
its actually 300 tyvm
smh
im at like 4k
for slackers yeah
later!
kk
i robbed myself lol
thats like 3 times now
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
throwing
im literally
im actually trash
wtf
i cant actually make that now
that map in particular
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
again
kk
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
i do okay
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
didnt make the jump
i literally
redepttion?
you were LOL
baban actually retired
inv me
anyone in na wanna plaay fall guys
retain for sure
i think its fine
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but they took it down
i would've sent an s0 jk vid
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
have to do a few basics to refresh
so yeah you'll deal less dmg
on bike
you cant refresh welt tm
this is how keeb did
LOL
yeah
ss0 jk tho
on sea
ana broke 770 lol
also missing ice dkey/dorm, and affixes arent *great*
after the second ult at 1:36
would ss1 kill on that second bike swipe?
i did
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
anyone na wants to raid
wanna play fall guys event
anyone in na
jeez
back in march?
this is from when i first broke through
or like a couple weeks after
?
and jww
ssg
you still have silver reaper?
granted i did use to look like that
i was f2p for 5 patches
or crusher
or cf
why isnt bd lvl
why is everything lvl 35
every so often
you use  it in ss ma
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
20 frags from ss
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i should've done that sn adv
yeah
it started like
yeah
actually throwing
<a:darksideslap:786450895378317342>
yeah
if you have an 8s team
soe does p1 for you lol
if you have soe
its actually fairly simple
rest were like 472-478 i think
the lowest i saw when i looked yesterday was 468
yeah
ye
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
okay i cant find a  non hor vid
<@148145559897636865> 
Ty
What are the biangs for sushang if I wanted to search this team
Ruby
I'll try it
Triple supports huh
shut
no shot
not 50 points difference but
i feel like 4* elf makes the difference
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
here's more life
so uh

This is what I mean tho
Like keyboard keys
Basically keys
She uses keycaps too I saw
Til Nini's pulling ss
Or more now? To find a use for cez m
It took 3 patches
<a:SAYUsleep:970435428001915051>
I just chose to die on soe content
Double pri patches are disgusting
Me included
Can't compete with these whales
<:worrynirvanajail2_hh:828444826822508554>
Kinky
Wyd
Tet
Dalao
Wow
4 days to get from a quest series
Fatui beat em up I think?
I still need the fatui one
According to the wiki
For 6400 primos
Apparently 820 is Max
Then retired
In 2.1
I think I was at like. 41x
Ic ic
That feels low
Wtf
800?
Even better
Ohh
You took time off for this lol
<@416445660443967491> <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
It's so bad lol
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Better gather
1 week until dabber
Wedge
I'm good
He's an hour north
Not in this office he's not
I'm at work so no link but
Way less multipliers
Ana bad
<@148145559897636865>
i figured out hoe to be good
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
that was good
ssg keilo

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im coming for you keilo
oka i sleep
ive never seen it
the tile breaking one
new map wtf
same
Yeah
LOL
I played twice and called it a cycle
The only threat in my bracket is karto
Lol
I'm second with 570
Idk SW scores
Prob +100
It's a retaining score
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
Okay Carl sucks
Maybe this
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I'm using nadeko commands
Carl bot
Ah
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but i found that one at least
yeah there's no shot im gonna find that lol
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oh boy
specifically hoh rc hb yes?
lemme see what i can find
thats a tough one
for rc huh
rl?
but if you dont need the torus you can ig
just *i personally wouldnt*
i mean you *can*
to answer your question though, ff is better
i wouldnt salvage a weapon for cubes if i wasnt a nini level whale
and assaka cant really be froxen
since most of her buffs come with freezing
cause rc kinda hard to use on assaka
do you have the gloves at least
no sushang?
i assume  hoh
who are you using
im already here
ty carl
+bonk <@148145559897636865>
You already booked me later this month
The shot heard 'round the world
Ic ic
Pre hor
And just preferred to float
I thought she was able to walk?
I mind that my fucking potholes aren't fixed
I don't even mind the taxes
Ninis got the IRS in her pockets too
Oh shit
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Imagine
Took them 10 months
Yep
Fr <:deadge:975652771082698782>
$10million
I know a rich person and the IRS came after them for like
Not even
The IRS will come after your family
In the US
Yes
Not for 3 months you're not
Next of kin i think
Jeez
7??
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
The jag f type is the small one
Theyre pretty big
I'm surprised you didn't buy your Lambo in cash
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
Pog
lol
literally her health
thats
dkey raid
kasumi
bruh
meh
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
<@218762069338619906>
<:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
i will find and hurt you
im serious
shh dont tell anyone
<@148145559897636865> im 10k
<a:patpat:850500624630022154>
if you still needed this, the math was correct but *may* have misled you with the source
so 80 frags from stamps
80 frags from pally both times
100 from buying stamps
thats counting the frags from the bp track as well
for the 80 +80 + 100 figure
oh <@385655541248163840>
this is just call mom simulator
hang up the phone guys
Probably SSS PV
But falls off hard on assaka
Funny enough vil v is the only one that can one rot mobs for me
Or sw
If not ss+ sushang
Well
I don't wanna play
Like everything feels bad here
Mobs suck though
Probably not the best one to ask this cycle
I've only done one run lol
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
Gj eli
About time
Weird though
I feel like there's enough to rank from s0 to ss in bp
Found this
Just like non awaken s yes
Per patch
We get two of these
See
And card
Stamps
Yes
Barely
So 260
Then
80+80+100
I think
For non awaken valk
20 + 20 for bp, 20 + 20 for stamps, 50 for one card, it's 130
Have to recheck calcs
Wait
I don't think so, no
And there's a topup event with hos frags too
You'll get ~250 frags from paladin bp
Yes
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
Sorry carv
Cb is a big dmg loss
Wow
<@385655541248163840> try this
i sleep  fuck this
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
apho bronya?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
where's my sw
everything feels bad on this boss
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
guys i think im doomed
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
np np
she doesnt freeze either
nopr
never paid attention
i dont think elf ely freezes either
honestly
until ely anyway
well
selune's is the freeze one
no
dont salvage weapons for cubes
if you're not a whale
okay, let me rephrase
arent they dead next patch too?
torus will go a lot longer than cubes will
then yeah not a bad idea if you come across it
sync
oh
then why do you care about judah
if you dont want to spend the equivalent of 400 torus on judah
you could forge pledge of sakura
since benny sss next patch
*maybe* aka and hellmaru
of*
oh the non sss bosses
maybe 2 ma bosses now
i think its safe
its only used on like
i genuinely dont remember the last time i've used that
Qua Whale*
Though that's more of an L for Vil <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I think at the top, 9S HoH outscores 9S vil v on whale
And way too many on mine to be thousands of HP off the core
It took me one try on ninis acc
Kek true
Which she can't at these temps
PE is only a problem when she can't one shot her bosses
HoT should not be as strong as she is rn
I'm actually really mad at that one
~~PE real herrscher of 2022~~
Insane
Yeah
But she's fine with me
So I can see where the disappointment comes from
Also there's more options for ice in general now than ever
Every other herrscher was
Like, she's strong but like carv said, not broken like
Imo
But she does feel underwhelming
I think she's good for what she is
tbf i killed myself
well
yes
and you just noticed me
also thhat qwas our 4th match
its my best one
and bumpin
keilo grinding fr fr
If you gimme the lvl 50 pri
My appreciation and a base lvl 50 ff
One would call it a trade offer
That I need to use
Less mats
Yes
No
I'll max
Gib

Trust
Wednesday
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
Someone without sushang
Do your weekly quiz
Ton of freeze resist
Yeah that sounds right
<@385655541248163840>
Just can't freeze assaka so gotta FF HB or use turg ppm rc
From what I saw too
Yeah this is right
Guys can someone ~~suffer~~ play hoh and/or hov on assaka for me
No more daylight savings
As of 2023 it's permanent
Not for another couple months
idk a total
3 sp per .5 sec
<:chima_sweat:826854591684804629>
it is
ew
oh is it?
have fun on heph
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>

.ban <@148145559897636865>
L
me?
In one sitting
If you played the 4 hours you could probably climb to 10k+
L
Yeah nvrmind I remember
This was the Irene HB
Oh
I don't remember
On Sept 18th
<@704867526877904908> 21677
But I can probably find it
No
Or whatever
Wasn't that labyrinth warriors?
Should've skipped
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Bro
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
ew
no, server time
85 minutes
<a:no:963351594785706024>
yeah
idk if i wanna play for 10 points
oh
shameless
oh shit
but not often
recently anyway
more often than it should be
no change in disturbance
nah
461
are we?
yeah
i thought it was 4
5?
how wtf
oh i have what i did recorded
i can try that though
jk team more fun ngl
s2
jk
istg its seeded or something
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
what bracket isnt
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i still gotta do ma too
baiting works guys
<:bceCoy1Evil1:593020248513314816>
its *impossible* for me on m account
yes
do my abyss
you like hoh
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i wanna promote
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i dont wanna play more
713 after 20 minutes of playing
im probably 7th rn
bro i dont wanna do more abyss
rip
Skin is safe if you wanna guarantee you'll have enough for Eden guns
But I'd go for something that provides an account impact over a skin personally
Up to you really tbh
But you gotta save some too for Eden though, hmm
Well, my answer is elf, you can pull to 3* if you wanna spend the full 20k
I mean
In my experience anyway
You did something wrong
If more
It's dorm or dkeys
Or less
By like half a bar
But if you copy it and your damage isn't equal
And can you learn in time
Rank/Atk is the first thing you look at
Then execution, if it's easy to copy
For most refs
Ic ic
You're right here
Generally yeah
If you wanna split it
Tdm matters here btw
28
Imo
Hard to say specifically but in general, it goes dkeys (levels / %) > dorm > dkeys (sync) > valk atk 
For rotation/account impact
Yeah
But atk is a factor too though

All of those add up in nirv
Exactly how much damage is missing
The little buffs
My question is why are they copying an s0 rot at SS though

But yeah assuming gear elf executions everything except dorm atk and ranks

It all adds up
If not more
That's like half a bar
45 is a big gap
Less attack
Oh, right
And SS should make up for -4 dorm
Or it's dorm
They're either not doing something right
That they are copying?
What's Disturbance
I value dorm more but 45 atk is a lot
It's enough to break rots
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Pog
You'll find it
Come up here
But I think you're one in like 100
Which is nice
Not that good of a comparison point
People don't bald down there
Eli
Prob not anyway
Lol
No
I mean
Going from 775 > 778 took way too long
*cycle
You're doing this patch what I did last patch
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
Understandable
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
I'm not home at the moment, sorry
Don't bald yourself into retirement though
<a:TE_DonoWall:854581664570015775>

Removed forever
Apparently q singularis is dead in 6.2 too
During the entire 6.2 version, the captain's accumulative recharge amounted to 648 yuan, which can be freely obtained: one of the promotion seal of the Herrscher of Knowledge × 6 / the promotion seal of the other side twins × 3 / the ancient inheritance × 240 , and an expansion supply card × 1, Precise supply card x1, SP character supply card x1, ancient will x50 and other welfare rewards! 作者：崩坏3  出处：bilibili

(i think this is 6 HoR stamps or 3 SN stamps, this is mainly important for those chasing SS SN)
someone play fall guys with me
Nini e-girl arc

im no longer privileged
its not in beta anymore
<a:aworryFlashbang:897712369843716126>
isnt that so good keilo
you asked for it keilo
ma
hi keilo
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i cant even fund my own
so bad
vil v without that banner is like
no
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
im a retired whale 6.4
i wasnt even a whale in 5.4
so i dont count
but nini funded me
i gave 170 pulls for vil
than people did into sw
just before hoh
i would be shocked if more people dumped >28k xtals
same banners essentially
vil was just before herrscher
sw was just before pe/spa
prob more
well
jk im not *that* toxic
<:bedge:903014531268243506>
but rl is a free for all
i wanna know all vil vs
carry on
idc then
oh
multiple times so
heki said nirv sensei
i'll check myriad
743 huh
unless you're referring to tai?
and on na thats only me
that would mean there's another vil v owner here
im intrigued now
who the fuck is your sensei?
but more damage
literally do what i do on mine
i want nini's acc
and PE
i liked playing nini's HoF
trying to cap on two accs is awful
im kosma'd out
i dont either
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
Midnight Absinthe?
Hi all
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
I'll throw you

<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
cmere tet
<:Fubuki_Grabby:828297136927801374>
this skill specifically
that third line 2* doesnt get i think
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
SAME
very imo
150 frags
1040 metals doko
probably not
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
thats fair
faster farming maybe?
understandably so
i also dont lol you delete every time
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
and 200k mysteriously falls into her acc
maybe it'll be like kart
hey
and thats it
just getting the key
i am
i was ready to live without it
and get a klein card, and just buy 3* klein from spending event
i can pull 3* dabber
but now that i know we get elfs
if i wanted to pull
<:worrykms:398047795732545536>
im at a nice 99
i hope you get 4 cards in 4 ten pulls
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
how do you not have ss2 yet
nini
wait
I wish
Ever?
Yes
Of 6.0
Ssg
It's the last cycle
Not a bad way to do it
Lemme see if I can find an s0 hoh
MPE or FR is probably better
Well
Oh boy
For s0?
Something like this
I'd HoH
Etc
FR
HoH
MPE
But anything works
Everything else is pain
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
Vil v
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
Where's my slack lobby
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
if anyone cares to see
i sleep
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
okay done
773 but i actually cant go higher
and i gotta do karts
until wednesday night
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
ssg eli
i think sword
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
He's saying you have to defend lolicons
Then I died mid run and stopped
HoH
Lol
It was one try
Yes
Hire me
I'm Henry Cavill
I picked the wrong career
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Did people ask to join the mile high club
What was the most fun place you went to
Wtf
The customer is NOT always right
Fun fact
Never again
I worked retail for 3 years
LOL
So early
Jesus
Bro
*I don't curse
I can use hoh and feel like shot
I'm out
<a:bcaPatientlyWaiting:764167633234559016>
One more hour
<:Fubuki_Grabby:828297136927801374>
This is a whole thesis
Bro
Assuming nothing breaks
1:30 for me
I piloted Nini last cycle
I'm good
You leave aster out of this
Tet
Weren't you in beta
omg lol
i laughed
<:bronyaserveteatodalaohic:640194268316696603>
B
also correct
correct
non MA players may not know this one
you guys should know this
get me tf out
same
bro
<@704867526877904908> he just like you fr
LOL
Er?
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Why do you have 8k
She's so extra
That's probably part of it for me
Low
Only 1436 attack though
So she does damage now
I just reaffixed her
Samesies
HoT is nice
AE fast combos can be tedious yeah
Though I really really don't like HoH so bias <:02shrug:1001147147703562260>
Hoh I feel the same way
I feel that
So she's like brand new for me
Tbf
I didn't use mpe until this patch
Really?
I like mpe
Exactly
As far as valks go
Or find fun
I'll only pull stuff I wanna double down in
I think at this point
I would pull SS HoF
HFS isn't old enough for an adv yet i think
In NA
I'm fully expecting to get them in 6.2
Isn't this assuming we get the banners
<:ew:960016221636530206>
Where's my funding
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Yeah
Next patch
Spending currency*
I'll see what I can get with the frags tbh
Ikr 
Where's my bannner
And 2* lol
You have 3S hoh
Nini
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
88 frags
Klein doesn't exist in my acc
Dabber yeah
I dont have Klein at all though
Yeah
Not for cheap nowadays
Kart said no lol
<a:aWorryFuming:636089809219092480>
And I'd have my perfect patch
If I had klein I probably would've taken 5
I would've played on his
If I knew wolf wasn't bad with hot
Or hoh
MPE?
We'll see
Just to try the 9S rot
I'm playing kart's acc
Can't wait to play
I'll shoot for t3 and t10 this cycle on both accounts
<:borryKMSwlaughter:464798777119604746>
<:TE_PepeLaugh:898642659743260783>
I'm playing a 9S account this time
I'm not even beating Styx this cycle
<a:darksideslap:786450895378317342>
So am I
But if I got the chance to play a SS/SSS account on a server there I'm taking it
Or something
62
And that be literally
Like say I get 760 this vil v cycle
Kinda wanna see what it would be like to drown
I'm already fighting for my life usually
You've seen my brackets
I Lowkey wanna get a KR acc just to see what its like
Ngl
Truly a different world
That's crazy
What the fuck
Can you send vid/ss
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Truth
I wish I had mobi
No you
His is random with the mobs
AE is a more consistent opener though if you used na 4 twice then sirin
This is the same thing I did lol
So guessing it was a fuck up
And I did the raid with Nini yesterday so would expect it to be completed
But no progress for me
Snow wolf's is there
Bug it seems
Whale
On NA D for Qua Whale last time, Keeby got 794 with s0 Nyx
That was 456D though
can we quote this
gimme a bit
im doing cata's er
all of you
krakens
or damage?
not like sp?
do you
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
fischl
but ai chan
was about to say
oh you guys stole the duduL emote
all of you
whales
In cq
I know of catsicle
Yeah
Isn't that good
Their acc
To compare
Isn't the best option
Catsicle
Yeah you're mega dead
<:OhISeeGaeun:892029051412312074>
This is nirv
Oh shit
I believe in you eli
But I'll see what I can do later
I'm not even home
but idk
im guessing hfs with ai will top if rime does back back
or rime returning to abyss
a friend of mine was talking about sss rime
this makes <@704867526877904908> very happy
hmm
looking like ai takes raven's spot unless raven is needed, like tank then
wtf
dont even need a minirot on shield
wow
this is interesting actually
god i miss rl
I'm hoping
issok i'll be 3* dabber and rank scum da lead so
cursed <:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
if i could oneshot i'd have a chance
also look at this shit
why does everyone and their mother play on pe cycles
there's like 4 ss pe's below me
im gonna +0
same
sure
yeah
LOL
<:worryGibCurry:433117130339123200>
ty for curry
all good
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
dps ae is real
i'd say spear but would have to see what you're doing
<:ohno:959752132905566261>
you didnt change the name??
so cant start from beginning
i just ran it
you have to
<@385655541248163840> ready
~~cause im running it rn but have excess stam~~
in like 5
poggg
you can play snowwolf's
ashura's throne is done but
they're right
oh wait wait
wanna try nini
unless they just mean run it again?
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
We pushed a lot of updates/upgrades/migrations this weekend
Hoping that there isn't much blowback
Same though cause work <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:TE_PepeLaugh:898642659743260783>
It can't come soon enough <:prayge:863861301310652416>
 cause that means we're closer to new patch
keilo not a fan of blond kiana?
gib pe her gimmick back <:deadge:975652771082698782> ~~for s0~~
unless your crit affixes are like mega cracked
def not on sea
for s0/s0/sss si, idk tbh
yes, but the only one on na who did used ss hs so thats an extra 6% crit dmg
eu is what na was last cycle i think
*last time this boss came around
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
eu doesnt even need 4m
4.11-4.13 will kill on NA
+1D though
wtf is this boss
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
little buffs add up too, no matter which you pick
\my b\
640
no
800 AL
8 weeks of farming
5% lightning
*if you did get hor
that would save you 400 AL if you did
depends whats your priority
gib to tet
thats like 20 or 30 bucks
im gooooodd
now if i could get a klein
<@385655541248163840> i yolo'd a dorm pull
prob not gonna go for pe outfit now since i dont need sk from the box
hoping sushang and soe dont ream me
oh shit the pe outfit too <:deadge:975652771082698782>
3* dabber
though in all seriousness im prob gonna get elf and stop
see?
besides, nini is our resident account booster
i may intend to dunk a basketball on a 10' rim, but if im 5'0''
probably wont happen
intent, not necessarily ability
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
i dont even have s0
i cant even fund myself
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<:worryExit:783190311987970118>
and mine
this is mkp gpn strat
yeah, def needs 4.11
im out of affix mats
411 would probably kill but
in p2
yes
thats disgusting lol
didnt try yet but it is pixel
any bets on kill or magic pixel?
lol
cant wait for 3* dabber
this is with pillows
carole's gloves
but idk how to rotate with mkp
granted this is neb
im actually a clown
i spent the last hour trying to oneshot this boss
i actually dont have the damage without 3* elf
The mobi run feels cancer if you try to cap
What I like about Homu is that you don't have to use mobi

Everything kinda works
At making me wanna commit suicide
Best boss
You mean you don't like seeing Andrius run around and leap
Oh true
Pat did it with newt
RC*
Is this the hfs rv hoh
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Ic ic
Yeah
Isn't as diluted
I think it's cause tdm
Same
FGO
this is weapon only but carole
wait
yeah
do you know how hard it is to find a non 4/4 s0 pe
the perfect ref for you
65 is nice though
50 is ok
if not nirv
doesnt matter
is it worth upgrading any pri considering whats coming in a week
but yes
rare\
yes
Wtf
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Tet
Idr
Or tm newt b
With Holmes mb
If you're dalao run mkp
You'd have to test it
You run senpri if you don't need sp
Yeah
For SP
It's removed vid
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Oh wtf
Leaving work so quick search
One of those is Holmes, which is fine
Holmes uses the same rot as gpn



At least 640
But yeah
And a couple other servers
That's cross posted in sols
Also refs in blucord I think
I just use this
Probably
Gpn rot is tough without a ref
Ic ic
They can stack
Though candy balding..
Wouldn't glut be better?
Why Tesla T?
So 55 pris, okay
Don't bother, still save
Good call
O
Is it 60 at least?
Why is senpri not maxed
Question
700 doko
Why is yours so pixelated
LOL
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
I'll have to play it I guess, doesn't seem too bad though
Wtf
What is this, jizo?
Isn't it typeless?
3S benny
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
To much and to greasy if it's not good
I like
Pass out after
I haven't had a good burger in a minute
nope
which is probably another spending event patch
in like 4 patches probably
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
could also wait until we get the elf banners in what i assume is 6.2
but 3* dabber is def my priority here
ughh
i could rush to ss some valks instead of nyx though
<:CB_pika_think:553556724917862400>
feels low
yep
i dont plan on ss until 6.2
i dont own nyx
i want her
so 3* dabber
nyx card
and a sushang stamp i guess?
i need 88 for 3* dabber
so buy the box 44 times

which is 880 currency, ok
wtf
100 frags for 3*
150 frags for 4*
1500 currency for all the elf frags, hmm
nvrmind found it
like that scale from 0-75k crystals spent and rewards
where was the list of currency that we'll have for the spending event
pog
which

Last lightning wolf was a while ago yeah
Available now one sec
Okay
Do you have ae
Gotta leave my desk
I can though one sec
But you have ss1 FR, right?
But should be fine
Without AE though
This is a RL comp
This is a nirv rot, I imagine it's free in RL
Yeah
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
Also I don't own mobi so I'm prob the worst person here to ask
Not today, sorry
Gonna be out tonight right after work, won't be home till a couple hours after close

I do not like her gameplay
In er
Using hoh
Avoided
I actively
I thought you had to charge and release every time
That you can hold attack on HoH
After 5 weeks
I just figured out
You know
I did my er
No
Keilo do my ma
<@416445660443967491>
They crazy
That's legit nirv two months ago
RL is 450D
On one of the cn servers
Idk which server but
<:HorizonSmug:1024981431610523699>
It's only 30 bucks
Youre funding us both wym
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
Wtf
<a:ritaspin:929736146349609021>
I think that was her farewell
Every boss is a BKE boss if you try hard enough
Do your side stage
She's designed around one shotting the bosses
At this temp
She's falling off
Not fun
It is
I'm not excited for either
Next week is kosma
And you're stuck with me
2 more promos
Oh shit
So they can kick me down to rl
Manifesting Eli bracket
Ssg cata
<a:MadgeClap:853961726155554877>
Tell Andrius to stay in the fucking circle
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
Same tbh
Nothing works
I tried vil, HT, SpA and some other
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Embarrassing
I don't own mobius or 3S FR
I scored 201
Yes
I'm not sure either sadly
She has tesla
I don't think
I'd kill myself if parv for example came back
For this D
Not meant
Some bosses are just
Tet is in nirv this time
No
You don't need to
You're rl
No paga M?
Um
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I should've whaled s2 aponia
No
I chose 7T
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Better than not having mobi at all
You have options
<a:JailedTakoWantsToLeaveButCant:869950055044505650>
2* klein 
eli's handel rc
with klein though
just got home lemme see what i can find
Would def max at some point though
Levels don't give sp
That's fine
waltz will give you damage but no sp = dead anyway
SP will be a disaster otherwise
If you're s0
But I know for a fact CFlare is needed
I can find a ref
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Same
bye
fucking take stamina
do these
why
i hate this
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i dont wanna do this event again
<:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
great score on the best boss in the game
LOL
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>

<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
Nini very good
It's true
I never lie what
Ask her for help
Nini is the best HoF player in the server btw
<:ew:960016221636530206>
<:KKDoggoSmile:763808119461117952>
It's fun here

I'm pleb
<a:JailedTakoWantsToLeaveButCant:869950055044505650>
Take me too
I just don't know it
Which there's actually some variety on this boss
All I know is BBABABABA is the usual
And I played bad
Using !== Owning lol
LOL
And you don't own a SSS fr
I don't own mobi so idk the intricacies of her rot
My worst element
By far
Lightning is
<:Fubuki_Grabby:828297136927801374>
Cmere eli
LOL
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
if thats them
they're in my bracket
do we have a finnix here
You'll have fun in qua
Tet do my abyss
Poor tet
LOL
And her bday cake
Where's your daki
Make a shrine
apparently they're 9s
and thales in blustorm
i got kart
is a lot of one run and done people
yeye
not enjoyable bosses combined with new games
were not that high scoring
lightning tony/couatl like
people hate qua content in general
i mean this cycle specifically but ic ic
so many new nirvana players
and in ma week after next
<:CB_smug:585549007158247426>
then yeah thats it
to make sure
id check
if you have B yes
whale
coach me <@309634550273933314>
now that she reached nirvana she coaches
oh?
i dont wanna do it
<:madge:861416927095422996>
i gotta finish er
oh shit
i respect it
simp
imagine balding this boss
Welcome home
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
Oh shit
All the time <:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
No
I'm the only vil
Fenri the only Aponia afaik
Someone's gotta do it
Except the beginning of p2
Same
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
I did about the tdm
Oh nice I didn't know about this
Or like smash
Poor tet
I assumed you already were doing that
LOL
You're being beat by a lolicon
Tet wyd
Keilao big dalao
LOL
i wanna test
i cant wait until live
is its probably gonna be determined by amount of rotations needed
my guess
<a:Smoge:808844088115068938>
that was fast
lemme take a quick check at what you're doing
on boss? 
prob normal
so it forces you to play around that
its got a very long cd too
if you're only using on this boss
i wouldn't level it
it could work
its all you got lol
missing some tdm which matters but
but yeah hot / hoh is fair
~~if you have gear~~
everything is paper down there
that was in rl tet
with fr can try it
but
i havent seen a single hot
hoh prob
at 462D
this is cancer
fr isn't seeing much use nowadays outside of people who've already geared her
right
which is fine
in nirv
if you're not ss2 minimum
fr dps is BAD
cause he doesnt care for qua
584 ely
yeah
just sleep
i forgot
oh you're in nirv
that should be fine if you have collapse cannon
everyone here has been brute forcing with hoh
honestly
hmm
then prob not a good option
ss2?
yeah that works tet
do you have a qua valk
let me ask a different question
what team
like im torn
yeah ik
gear for both
like i legit dont know
they are focusing on lightning/ice teams
and they wanna know if they should pull sushang gear next patch or round out their lightning team with zhenyi
a friend of mine in masters is asking a question of me
help
guys
you know bke is mech right
tihs
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
stream
i was drinking water fuck you keilo
caught me off guard
i choked holy shit
pog
<a:aRoseExit:983062088828211240>
bye
e-girl fr
wtf keilo
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
<a:JailedTakoWantsToLeaveButCant:869950055044505650>
<a:aKKsBearLeaveLeft:814686897452220456>
pull vil v and pay me this
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:TE_PepeLaugh:898642659743260783>
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
yeah
so im capped
im not triggering tf, im extending it
oh <@148145559897636865> 
i figured out husk
i see what you're saying though
i'd assume that team needs 12/12 to work
or ig ely tb carole
oh like carole dps
though idk if id pull for it
i feel like paga M is the only piece you really need 
for like sk, shield otto, wolf etc
<:nokek:1014211961292083240>
once you have enough just reso
just pull weapons and cube them
yeah
fookin whales
imagine not needing cubes
<:meisip:833970844958720010>
That's even worse
*surely* it's jk
*surely*
Tet wyd
I just grabbed the first one I saw
Make one
You're a kraken now
Idr
Or access revoked or smth bad
You'll get banned
Yeah
I think bastet wants spcr too
Or maybe of your acc has the damage and you don't need stacks a mix of both? Idk but curious
All attack if you're hoh/sushang dps
Spcr if you're otherwise
So I'm guessing two sets for whales
People running spcr for the hr team it seems
Tet test two sets
And test
That's what you're supposed to find out for us
It was 264 last cycle I think
26x smth
Also cooler
Na is like
Q Mani seems way easier from what I've seen
Honestly yeah
366D
Or close
Sea q-singularis reached old nirv temps lol
You can elemental affix lol
Unironically
toxic
4.8
y'all forgot about the shared  lead?
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
I didn't even schedule these
I'm going home after this last one
<a:JailedTakoWantsToLeaveButCant:869950055044505650>
I've been in meetings since like 1
Someone get me outta here
It's hilarious
Lol
Yes
Or go crazy & rabid
I never noticed how fun it was watching people mald
You know
<a:gBKbite:668928900331732994>
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
Why you stream and me at work
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
you'll be fineee
whats the full bracket
you're paired with keeby
ye
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
of elilao's total net worth
not even a fraction
if you cant math this is almost 136k usd
<:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
Shut
You're certified god player
You literally have two lao emotes
Not bad
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
On this boss especially
No elf is pretty deade
Yee
100%
Idk
Maybe  cause learning the rot?
Surprisingly ye
Vs Playing the FF rot on someone else's acc
For me it feels better
But cb19 is comfy
I think FF scores higher
893 doko
<:blurry:593478274500263959>
<:meisip:833970844958720010>
^trl in a nutshell
someone gives advice or makes a commentary wrong
just his takes are
yeah idk him or have anything against him personally
has very hot takes
kekw
is home page
keilao did
this guy
fbi does a lot tet yeah
there's a hack going  around in Tower Of Fantasy and everyone's inventory is getting emptied and stolen by simply partying up with someone (so don't accept random invites right now) everyone is getting straight up jacked, to make matters worse the code for it went public so just about anyone can access it and its a problem right now, For now and maybe the next week or so until a fix in place don't queue up or party with anyone unless its someone you know. (edited)
i've never seen a gacha fuck up that badly
all your shit gets yoinked
you jsut join co op
inventory hacks
yeah
Yeah
Never heard of that one actually
It's like a full time job
And with alts
And they had +25 weapons
All the whales I knew that played that game just sold their accs lol
You're still looking for that ark?
Oh nice
It's like what, 1.5-2k?
Do it
Brb
I have a quote actually
LMAO
I do have the f2p bronya outfit though
When did this happen?
It's less than Nini
Shut
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
If you log into my acc don't look at my topup
Cata you should do my pulls
@ your mobius
What's pounds to us currency rate
Or whatever the EU equivalent is
I'll give you 2 pennies
Between chy and myself we have like
65-70 extras
I'd give you my extra frags if I could
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
I gotta chill
Keilao is rubbing off on me
Cdeez nuts
You don't even like vil v
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Will you sponsor us if it is?
I need to update this
Unless I make both mediocre
I'll have enough for one
I will not
Forgot about those
And nanos yes
I forgot the xp crystals but it's a lot
~3.75m coin
All pris are 400 torus 520 metal no?
Your current mats should give you the answer
Realistically
That 30% is game changing
If you use your ice team more, you def want to max pardo though
I actually say save tbh
22.5
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I really wish I had s2 sn
On everyone
Honestly with one more rank you could do it
You really need ss2
Depends on the team/gear but probably not above 650, idk
They have an insane ref with coautl
Idr the name but
There's an insane cn player that always does well with nyx
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
So FR or Nyx nini
Beat me to it
Yeah I saw that one
Apparently fragile made a ref
Looking to
Ranks
Meh
Same but sw
I can probably find something
Nyx might unironically be good
Actually
Idek what's t2 on megatron
LMAO
I get out of work when eu closes
It's a good thing that
Kinda wanna retire and do ma instead
I kinda wanna mald more
That's how I know
Sponsor me instead
Nini has double btw
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
So I can finish her ss
Pog
But yeah da/nyx are next
I'm really hoping it's not elemental
Same LOL
SN was farmable
I really wish
Maybe GK
And whoever else
Her > vk > BN
Im doubling down on fire and phys
Same
Like 6-8 weeks
She's non awakened
Blood rose doesn't take that long
No u
Keep your tags away from me
thats fucked
~~she has nothing better~~
i think
Cthulhu
and confirmed for me
a friend of mine spent like 600 bucks
its such bad value
galactic mega kraken
thats like
I kept fucking up the timing mostly
But honestly not that big a deal
But 7% played perfectly is so hard
You're fine
If you were like 2%
Yeah
Which is dorm
Like 1/3 of a bar
Then there's a little bit of last bar left
That's 745+ for sure if I do
I could've cleaned up the Klein/para timings too
Def dorm would close the gap
I talked to karto about it
Before I have to active/charged
2/3 of a bar left
Yeah
That is holding you back
It is dorm
Confirmed
Nini
whale
i dont wanna hear nothing from you about husk anymore lol
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
last time
i did
you deleted
nvrmind i dont
yeah
so whenever you're ready
i just got home btw
~~7% lightning~~
Otherwise you're slow somewhere
I'd be shocked if you're damage issued
So I'm just guessing
I haven't seen you play
?
I'm guessing your problem is gears
Thought keeb did it twice
Whoops
Ss3 you skip
With ss1 you have to do it again
For ss1
Thinking of a different ref
I missed something
Wait wait
Either way
Normal 4
Or is it called n4 here
Auto attack
Auto
They skip doing it the second time
After the first a4 > a4
Look at the first weapon active on ht
Slight adjustment
You have the acc needed
No way you can't though?
Lol
I don't wanna
<a:OH_peepoGaming:849054142940315668>
Get a 972
Yeah
But I think you should be fine
Dorm buffs matter more than atk imo
7% hurts cause Keeby is almost certainly maxed
Nice! That's what I did for tp
Oh wtf
19% lightning 5% tdm?
What's dorm
I hear doing more damage helps
760?
<@385655541248163840> what score are you aiming for
Husj
LOL
7
Plus ma plus er
Cause that's how many we have
Make it 4
Qkk
Wyd
Are you doing Keeby ref or
I put it off till the last day
So won't be long
I got an event I have to finish up for another Gacha though
When I'm home
Sure
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
Get that 800
You're hitting ss1 scores
Nini cmon
I legitimately completely missed it
It started just after I left and stopped right before I came back lol
Okay i backread
<@309634550273933314>
they gave plebs like me a break
also you're a klein haver
raksmey and bunny havent played yet
this is gonna be a close one
can maybe 680
i feel better
okay
You can't run from me keilo
<:Fubuki_Grabby:828297136927801374>
<:worrynirvanajail2_hh:828444826822508554>

Imagine not being in sinful
It's evolved
Oh god
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
Were you trying to snipe?
It's fun
Come up here
Poor tet
Sushang wasn't that bad
Abyss is really husk
Negligible
MA has been like
Solid anime
Death note
Yeah I actually really feel the Klein difference this time
React to dn
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
Just saw this
I'm at work
Whenever it comes
Yeah that I'll whale for
Banished to the shadow realm
Dust
The elves are the better go
I'm also gonna 4* elfs
I think at this point in my career
Tyvm
S1
I'll backread in a bit
There you go
Owohug <@148145559897636865>
And just dominate fire/phys weather
I'll take the L there
I've given up on ice cause I don't really wanna invest in hor rn either
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
I'm going the keilo route
Nah but fr I'm not paying for 2s sushang
Ssg ss2
LOL
And 3s hoh 
My only 3s are non gacha
You have 2s HS too
Us plankton have to survive off your scraps
You're a bigger one
Fund me
Y'all were being weird
I wasn't here most of yesterday
No
That's fucked
I'm making that pri when I get home
Okay so
Wait are you serious
Deffy slacking
Iirc
s2+
Nah
Kinda wishing I had her rn ngl
I miss her
I liked using HFS again on this side stage
Yeah
Probably not until the next fire support tbh
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
<:worryCoffeeSus:778719399745945651>
We get a tank?
What tank?
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
I can't even do my own
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
Owoheadpat <@385655541248163840>
Imagine not being skill issued at 61x
800?
At least I'm not suffering alone
I might try riku's idk
Lightning is like
By far my worst weather
I'll probably settle for a 650 or so
And I have sp issues
I don't have his damage
I use his opener
Alternating ppm/Tesla M
I've tried 3 different runs
I genuinely don't know how to score higher
Shut
ss3 though
and they fucking do it better than i do
okay so i finally looked at a ref
how to get higher score
i found my answer
yes
im not watching a ref
its just me bashing my head against this
i can stream again
i did this so badly
lol
i've never seen this
so this lightning stage is new
every toxic thing i have i got from him
blame saint
sksk
hot
dj lets gooo
yoooo
but never made that pri
i wish i could do that
yeah seriously
i didnt remember the year
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
shh
jesus
what is this 2021
did you say vp
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
wyd
you did it correctly
around 1:55
like tet
<a:nodnod:821142843909210202>
around 1.5 bars gone he'll kneel for you
1.5 bars
kk
so like for ht
when kneeling he takes a shit ton
when paralyzed he takes more dmg
a lot of your damage was without turg and without him being knelt/paralyzed
time paralyze better
a lot of this is just
he almost one shot your fischl lol
yo
but seriously
saves you some points
you can just swap to gd
but you swap to gd after fischl ends her falling animation
you weapon active twice on fischl
you dont need to do that
double tapping arrows
also
you're losing so much damage
fucking with me
yeah your opener is
judt
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
so much more comfy
its makes mobi
suffer
*commentating while watching*
turg gd/marg gd, etc
i was just watching refs first
familiaring myself with the team and why people did what they did
why are you ulting first here
actually
wait
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
no u
we (tet) have other priorities
but uh
generally i would recommend everyone cube it
abyss keilo
ik
ye ye
im trying to see if you need
im still watching one sec
but definitely helps, though
its 6% tdm
cubed doesnt matter in rl
you're using waltz here
do you have cflare
tet
you're ss0 right?
dangel deez nuts
this is new info for me
<@148145559897636865> confirm
you really only use ae on wolf in lightning
idk
honestly
so plenty of room for improvement
sieg m 4* klein
though you def dont have the gear
710
sss again, s0 ae
sss though
fr dps 716
score loss
shouldn't be a *drastic*
ik
cause mobi scored 711 lol
whats D in rl eu
hey tet
now watching tet's vid
refs acquired
okay so
<:TeriTeehee:928714685132460073>

owoavatar <@148145559897636865>

You're a mod
I can't
I'll get to you in a bit
Just left work <@309634550273933314>
LMFAO
For a long time
I used Lee TB Thales and arias
It's not that bad tbh
Do you not have hof
100%
Paralyze?
Which weather
She's great for side stages
That too
7T really changed the game
I'm very aware of this
I don't own Mobius lol
Sir
There's a vid on his channel
With GK
2019-2020
Yeah he mentioned this back in like
In MA sure she's very strong still but the way abyss is heading
Mobius weather isn't exactly often
Yeah
Seems he wants to break into doing bigger things
This is also the same guy that posted the sushang leaks a while back
I agree the red is a lot
As far as like the content, not the ux/ui
How do you feel about this kind of format
Guys
But I already see some mistakes
I'll watch fully when I get home <@309634550273933314>

bye
someone quote that
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
what
oh did he?
click the channel
literally just
like bro
the misgendering
its useful for very niche ma strats
not anymore really
dorm?
metal income is so bad
you dont
thats the neat part
prob not for another few months
sea just got shin jia whos been out for a min
<:kekDoggo:775708084051378217>
and do well
you can still use the same units from 2+ years ago in kr server
thats why i like cs more recently
in a fast paced game like this, absolutely
or citrus
not exist
does wyv jjust
yeah
i didnt know honk existed
2-3 years ago
old
no no
so meh
neffr doesnt care
fragile is on another break
will prob die down in a couple days
this one i think
<a:MadgeClap:853961726155554877>
and i missed it
it was huge at the time
prob do but dont care
they both got death threats and stufff
it feels like he's using his platform to try and cancel them
this really should've been resolved in dms
neffr is half retired nowadays
neffr is lumina yes but
most big stuff involved a lumina member
yes
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
bro
surprised it happens in gacha
league or mmos
yeah in like
and we drove him out of every server
we found out because his wife posted the pictures to the armada server
thats actually what happened 2-3 years ago lol
including financial gain
in the context of how im using it
night night aster!
that was 2-3 years ago now
there was another one but
yee
i just learned secondhand
i think a lot of it was mostly self contained
<:ghosthugscarf:782879035247034389>
hi <@964806731471405086>
there's been a couple
and the heisen stuff over in hotspot
and obv this
i think the only dramam i know of here are both catfishing incidents
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
Plenty before that
I dipped around the first anni stuff but
Ye ye
Tai got a 590?
Wait
Like idk textone or smth
So it makes sense that we blow it up when something happens
I'm so out of touch now but cc doesn't really help
Genshin is most people's first Gacha, at least here in the US
To a 5 year smaller community?
You're comparing the biggest Gacha game of all time?
Twitter def blows it up though
Honkai of all places does not have a lack of drama lol
What did I wake up to
will carv retain again?
wao
s3 da it is
fuck
cause i kinda wanna s3
or not important
for pe lead skem
does s3 da matter
yes
why is everyone so suicidal here
nvrmind im not doing this rn
its all fucking interludes
wait
is the new chapter
how long
no way its still on streamable
yeah that was back in 5.5
this is slander
no
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
i voice revealed for nothing
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
join me
i hope you suffer
no
<@416445660443967491> look at her go
yoooo
and speak confidently about things you know nothing about
you gotta mention you're a myriad retainer too
LMFAO
<:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
You leave AE alone
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
Yeah
Husk?
You good?
Nini
Bro
Pog
I wasn't far off
Idr offhand
24%(?) Phys damage vs what, shield damage and charged attack having more crit rate?
Better lead skill
Pretty much yeah
6
I've been in and out since like
I should probably get up though it's almost 10:30
I went back to sleep
Shut
TM still watching
Carv every time
<:rcCrisuGun:952502954819199016>
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
Can't even change pfp
And forget who you're talking to apparently keilo
Would make a dn joke
Didn't think you of all people
But
I saw that coming
Ngl
Dudelf
Blade durandal
I forgot she had to do this
Idk this rot
Tet is using carole
Oh God
But idk
Is my guess
Swords stacks or dabber
Idk how to play ma
Before she<:worrykms:398047795732545536>
Okay let's watch tets ref
<a:OH_DonutLick:850438145211367454>
Not abuses me
Donut teases me
No
I think this was it?
Lemme find
Donut gave it to me
I have a toxic sticker but I won't send
Phys broke all of you
Everyone is so snippy
Man
Tets going insane
1 ball is 15 torus
BP balls if you don't need anything
609
I'm still in bed wtf
Which looked awful
Was literally every single hit needed to crit
For the rot he was doing
On type hos when we last got her
I remember karto
<:dudutrash:1001346904686350416>
LMFAO
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
That's called murder
Yes
Poke the tet
What
<:worryExit:783190311987970118>
Bye
I don't usually watch yt enough to warrant it
Me wtf
I don't even have an acc
Repost your vid and I can watch again but it looks cursed
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
Hate this
I actually
Yeah
But you're better than me
So I'll probably -15
I haven't seen it yet
How is the HT parv
Oh that remind me
Na can't play this damn valk
Everyone assumes everyone sucks
It's MPE
Idk if that's enough but it doesn't help
8% phys missing
Is quite a bit

Oko running 6 tdm 15 phys
Yeah but not SSS MPE
Hey that's me and ice
<a:duduwhale:999040551422787656>
If I had 4* I could probably make up the half a bar left on zombie
Makes sense
If you stream later I'll watch at least
Ss3 = s0
Fuck this boss
I got 600 and sleeping
This is true
Griseo lead feels better here too
But he was using the same rot I was
He just has the damage to execute it
Yeah idk how oko does it
Those days weren't fun
Ch was literally the most important phys support in the game up until hos dropped really
She made phys fun (tolerable)
When you wake up
Alsi Nini
Wild
This vid was 4 months before hos existed lol
Yeah
This is the earliest footage I could find
That's why I'm confused lol
Like as far back as i can recall since FT she's been mech
Was shadow knight ever a bio boss?
Hmm
really wish i had sss
600 done
fuck this boss
in one rot
how the fuck do i kill the zombie
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
you're welcome
i respect it
simp

<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>

<:deadge:975652771082698782>

i hot on that one
LMFAO
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i said im so proud
i did
im watching cata
i havent played yet
yeye
i hate type counter weather
<:02shrug:1001147147703562260>
i dont think i'll even make it to boss
and kk
i wouldnt
5 pm est
Hi aster
So I'll do the same
All I've had today was two bags of chips and a cookie
Kk
If you're still gonna stream
Just got home <@704867526877904908>
So uh
You get the good and the bad
For my team and for angry customers
Not as bad as directly dealing with the clients on the help desk (think customer support rep)  but I'm an escalation point now
It's actually pretty comfy
I'm in management at an IT company
I havent
Ic ic
And Im stuck here
All my fucking clients are closed
Columbus day apparently
You have Monday off?
Yo Nini
Just about to leave work
15
Gimme like
Are you ready to do my abyss
Tet
hfs did well on that stage too so makes sense
but yeah
stealing ss
Just that second half
that one took me like ten minutes
I was doing other stuff too
You can def do it faster
4-5 hours max
Like
Including that, time it took to buy out most of the shop, etc
I did some of the abyss too there
There's puzzles
I just did that last night
The tower defense one or the Pokemon one
Stop the suffering
I think so
Yikes
I really really wish I didn't trash my dupe tm
I would take the reduc
You're ss aren't you
But again just what I've noticed, haven't fought the boss meself
At least last cycle anyways
Either on Carole or hos
I've never not seen an elemental affix run
But it's pretty important for Nirv nini
I'm sleeping
I'm not reaffixing either lol
Afaik
Just an elemental affix
It doesnt have to be lightning specifically
Like with SSS BKE before they patched that out (assuming it was patched out)
But yeah you'd have a lightning damage affix on hos
So im not 100% sure
I think an elf is fine but I haven't fought this boss before
My b
The latter
Cause she takes more damage for each elemental hit taken
In the past people used an elemental affix
Idk about one over the other specifically, but fr does bring more to the lightning team than mpe does to the physical team imo
We get enough mats to buy out both nowadays
Farm both
Honestly
The last sentence you mean?
Upgrade your support pris if anything
No in all seriousness
I really don't think it makes sense
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
Poor tet
No
Honestly same LOL
These sides are brutal recently
Yeah
The new dk for hor
Exactly
I don't think it's wise to invest in if low resources and you've other stuff to look at (as far as next patch: you said you wanted soe before)
So then
If your resources are that low in general, I would take the +0 on this boss tbh
And this is her only boss this patch
Not that mpe pri is a bad one to raise up
But iirc you had other pris to invest in too, right?
I would question what other pris I would make that would be more beneficial for my account long term
And consider my plans for next patch
So
I see
What is koe
Are you a3 or rl
Two things
640
sk is like
i personally am of the opinion to always get a new valk than rank existing valks
(ex: sk gives you 5% lightning dorm buff, which can be huge over a valk you'd use for 3-4 weeks of a patch)
but i'd prefer someone else answer
idk what ss hor brings to the table over s2
<:FakeNooz:865259265471152138>
So many mutes and warns waiting
Mod abuse would be fun in the server
Ree
<a:PoyoyoSpank:885108917191970836>
Can't miss that
5% lightning
I plan to
I'll take it
Whenever PE does her winning animation
If it means I don't have to hide my screen
But uh
I know I said I wouldn't swipe
I am
I just have the skin
I don't own the valk
No I mean
I can use that sk skin
Also one day
Gacha fairies or smth
Idk what happened
And SS HS landed in my acc
I just woke up
I'm f2p
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
<:Lamy_Pray:883777386909409361>
Patience is a virtue
I'm fine with that
I'm literally being priced out
It's all I know
<:notwhalehic:628213810989105160>
I know you can SS her on release but uh
And the nyx card
I was planning on 3 spending event stamps
I wasn't planning on bchip stamps
Ummm
Oh you asked me something
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
I think
Just the box in 5.2
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
Wao
Keilo went 59 weeks straight doing fr
<:meisip:833970844958720010>
Just sss
Why stop at s1
I haven't used her in so long I forgot what her weapon was
O
A what?
It's a good thing you're in rl
LMFAO
Pleas don't btw
DXY T
If you wanted to go really old you can use like
Do you not have ppm
You are correct
<@434737143395516416> s paganini
I only own the M
What does paga B even do
Wild
And griseo literally 5 patches later
Until Carole came
Well that at the time was true
But 3 fucking sp
Mine is ss still
I was gonna sss
Boomer
Or 2/4 SS Carole
0/4 s griseo
So
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
What's griseo rank / Carole rank
Is she SSS?
SSS should win out
So Carole should be fine
That's what I'm saying
Why do you have more than one
Paganini M?
Or it'll be shield Otto all over again
You use gris at high D with paga M
The old Carole rot should be fine still
Well
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
shut
not even cap lowkey
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

ccause our chem teacher sucked

success in chem i feel like its based on your teacher
<:ew:960016221636530206>

yikes
yeah

becuase you skipped
ohhh

Not home yet
Gimme 5
Shit

Actually if you stream I can watch
480D*
Idk if it'll scale down but a posted a 480 ref
Shouldn't matter too much I think though
Nvrmind
Youre in rl
Wait
With cez
Do a different rot
<:KizunaBlur:419855244386893824>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I just left work
Not on this boss
Not really
Me pleb
<:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488>
Oh I hear that's looking good
Fund us
Where's <@385655541248163840>
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
Get both
Just whale
But idk
I hear she does
Excuse me
So no sushang?
Do you plan on using HB after this boss
But idk your situation
HB of you wanna use her
Absolutely
I'm so glad my shifts ends soon
Work is kicking my ass right now
Not yet
600 should be
<:02shrug:1001147147703562260>
Get 650
Ssg
Meme in 2022
Yeah we don't do that here
Maybe
If you bald for it
But
What the fuck
They're using verne
Wait
Rip
Ah
The best piece
And t is like
That's for melee
Why are you using ana
Also
It's annoying
Can be Worked around but
For the missing trauma
It's a pain in the ass
Pray
What are scores
Well
You're dead
Why are you using falcon
Um
Missed this
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
On qua whale
817 in nirv
Probably that 883 in rl
I think my highest score was an 883 on Houdou in RL
I did nothing
So
Why not 700
It was inside you all along
I did nothing btw
How the fuck do you rotate with AE on this boss
Wait
Thats partially why notti is gone now too
They are
Yes
Neffr stopped too
Good
Shadel who
Ziazis who
Soon she'll t1 eu
Tet bicc dalao
Fast learner
Nice
Pog
just to ult when its up
im not big brain enough to adjust timings to that 5 second window
this is the bastet way of doing it
but i think you should be fine with jst newt
granted
but i wouldnt make that a goal, just something to note
you'll just BARELY have time for an extra charged shot after if you're fast
active
qte yellow purple breakdance qte hoh
oh, yeah
tet wyd
dont spend time on hoh after finisher if hes not frozen just qte cat in : where specifically are you referring to
dont use hb ult, only qte, save ult for after meltdown cat breakdance yes
cause problems in p2 stem from p1
not gonna comment on p2 yet until thats fixed
but im just pointing out what i see in p1 > transition
vid here 
yeah basically
dodge > yellow > dodge > yellow > breakdance > hb ult at same time
on pardo
until transition when he's vulnerable
dont ult
tap hb
no
lots of time lost trying to freeze
until you can freeze him during transition
save your ult
dont listen to me
nvrmind
you have ss
wait
then ult > ult
i would personally farm sp on hoh until hb ult is up
also back to this
a lot of your damage is being done while heph isnt frozen
yellow > purple > breakdance > qte in hoh
you should've rc'd in there
also at :47
take me with you
also *technically* you should be switching to hb but i dont think you're fast enough to do that, so it doesnt matter
in the first rot
you forgot the active
tet
nope
Will be fun
Sure
You did well this cycle
Also yeah good job
Yo I still haven't started
The 480 I linked
Ignore I mean
Ignored it
Or rather
I'm glad I found a rot that skips it
Tbh
These dalaos
Ah
It can Miss?
Yeah
Classic
LOL
It's that simple
Yep
Incoming t1
<a:ganbaworry:959721929563074590>
But prob using a weaker rot
Freeze timings are awful
Just lucky I got a second card from the 5 free pulls
I'm not rich
s1
I owe kyoshiro
Pog
I can't play today and I'm hoping I can t50
Nini where am I on myriad
I respect it
Ohhh
Ic ic
Poorly
The gear is there
You def can score 
It sounds like a rot problem
That should be maybe 700
You're already doing better than cata
RL?
Show gear too pls
Kk
I got home at 3:10 and just didn't bother sleeping
I stayed up all night too
Ngl
If I can get time sure
Weekday cycles are bad for me
wishing you the bestt
with flu season
this is actually a weird time cause you dont know what's what
hopefully like you (or tet?) said yesterday its just a bad cold
feel any beter?
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
is all i can ssay
styx op
thats what magery was saying too
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
780+ possible easy i just suck
yes that can
<@291907279291285506> sorry for ping but try this if you havent seen
this works for s0 at our D, i wonder if s1 can try

<@385655541248163840> when you wake up
*same
Sane
Honestly
When you can?
Are you going get Klein too kith
So hard
I've never wanted mobi until that damn bio lightning side stage
I stand no chance
If Styx says he'd die in cn
Yo
But meh
And doesn't need a dkey
Senti works at s0
That's surprising actually
I love and hate it
But she's so op
7T is cracked
I'm not happy about her current power level tbh
And even then that's basically it
Until kosma
The weakest shill I've ever seen
Keklmao
Nice!
Is how I feel anyway
And a 4* elf
I'm not paying to not use a valk
I have vil
I'm not allowed to skip
I probably won't do that for ma or this boss
Spent way too long doing kosma
Yeah LOL
The last cycle drained me
Very casual
He's cool
Jk
Slacker
With LE pfp
The Korean name
If so beat him for me
You have misamo then?
Wait
3/4 hoh
Ina isn't a threat
My armada buddy with SS is 790
Like Styx is what, 824 now with 9S?
780 minimum
SS should get like
And some random SS whales
Toprock curisu and another 9S
Oh I'm dead in my bracket but I appreciate that
It feels like it anyway as far as I've seen
Get that T50
And I believe in you!
This boss is a rank check ngl
Yeahh
Instead of praying
So relatable
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
I can usually tell when I fuck something up but confirmation helps
Good idea
I really should start recording more actually
Shield? Or fgo?
Cause he wasn't frozen soon enough
It took so long to figure out that's why I was doing no dmg
Esp the transition in your notes
It's so much harsher
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
For 27 points
And spent triple the time
I spent like an hour with bastet, got 727 and then found a cez rot
The bastet rot has variety so I can see that
It feels weird doing anything else ngl
For cez?
But yeah that's identical to my p1
All good <a:patpat:850500624630022154>
Gotcha
The active I mean
Interesting
Oh, you didn't use crusher?
After opener right?
P1?
That sounds right
But I don't feel confident in my elf luck
And I'd rather 4* the elf before going for more ranks
I'll actually be broke
I was considering s2 Lowkey but
So much goodies coming
That's how I got mine too LOL
Pog
Unless you're Darius
S0 doesn't exist in na
You're right
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
Oh?
Idk if you'll have the damage at s0 for cez
It's comfy
If s0 probably bastet
It's actually too fast
I despise the cez B rot
Took 3 hours just to figure out the timing
And I did
Generally yes
Wow you weren't jk
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
I doubt the cn 9S rots would work (read: are optimized) well enough at our D
He probably made his own rot
Magic
700 doko
<:CB_doubt:816234257940086824>
And 720+
Have s0
Darius and caliver
Pushing higher is pretty bad though
Unga bunga with bastet and 727
It's not bad
For me
On this boss
At least
And she dramatically changed my acc personally
With Lee TB Thales and Arias
Ik <a:patpat:850500624630022154>
I was personally

But I'm just going off the general vibe in sols for example
Don't slander me like that
Listen you
She felt op
Without ranks

And without sirin
I miss HoF
At least not without the elf
Ngl
And HoH doesn't feel like a herescher
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I'm substar skem on both
I can't really say much either
<:Prayge:824060134840991756>
PE and HoH
Like wtf
NA NOT to have 50+ SSS PE
And uh
4* dudu
That would require
But like
She's my only whale valk so
Pipe dream
I only do it on her bosses
Without vil v
I wanna T10 myriad
But meh
Week 6
I'm mald for it
If I had klein
I'm never getting T15 again
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
I believe in you
Very true
Yeah
MA?
But we're there
Not T1 like celine
Myriad and T100 ma several times over
Tbf though worst case
We have nothing to prove
Vil v was a mistake
But I think it'll be fun keeping up 
Relatively speaking

Without having to spend hundreds
In all honesty
I'm too new to be happy about not competing
I can be free
At the higher levels
I'm gonna be priced out of honkai
I think
If you wish
Tomorrow
I guess I can coach you then
LMFAO
Doxx me keilo
<a:BronyaHacking:933189860494299176>
Alexa
So sad
Impossible
After a break
You'll score better
Yeah
I've seen your acc
You already have 500k
700 doko
I have 4* sirin now
Issok
Never forget
So you can snipe me again?
If you ask <@704867526877904908> it's raven
Honestly, idk anymore now that bug is gone
That's what I already di
I miss using her
But
Will never happen
I need a new spa boss
I don't disagree, just making light
Can't believe we got something cn didn't get
That was fun watching you mald
<@704867526877904908>
LMFAO
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
It was
If you didn't go in abyss
fucked up husk
Like it's been 5x
Ice Ely does not feel
Yeah that seems right
Or ?
In p1m
Immediately
I'd retire
No
But worse
Heph
Pog
I can try later if you want
All is good
Ik lol
Did you beat the robot yet cata
I. Sorry I suck at coaching
Mobi right?
Jeez
That's disgusting
Iirc
It's hitcount
Yes
There's no way it's not BKE right
<:kyaaa:960016921451966464>
Keilo cc now?
Not since griseo
Misunderstood
Ah, ic
Isn't that better since everything is viable?
Honestly if everything is meta
Just retire
Skip everything
Carry on
Oh, physical
Why you gotta do sw like that
I just got my first one
Brb
There was something else
Yeah
Iirc
Nothing good
Um
Nini will find me so it's ok
For one boss
I actually ruined my chances for sushang pri
Until tank
This was me
<:villvsurprised:1015320774426501182>
Where's your vil v
General scares me
I just waifu Gacha here
Other channels exist?
Btw can we pin these
I don't think we're ever seeing it again
The easiest boss in the game
The whale is by far
Well
That was a good boss
Bring back couatl
Not fgo
Tony
Nope
It's sk
Abyss?
We're being forcibly retired
Feel better guys
<a:OH_peepoSick:688031868767174693>
I was a bit ago
My fucking coworker came in with covid
Issok tet
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
Won't be home till like 3 am
After rwork I have an hour then I'm going out
I might tomorrow
I'm not gonna play today
I couldn't coach a fish to learn to swim
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I'm actually trash
Guys I need a honkai coach
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
sure
not for a bit'
ic
2?
how much do you need per wave
your rot is too long
if you're running out of sp on raven
i wouldn't use phoenix here
800 doko
Well
Not quite
But since you have cez B, sp is gonna be gone
That sounds like pain if in rl
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
s2 is actually so much damage wtf
i cant quite copy with s1, there's too much health left after the second ult/finisher with hoh
even -8D
or that could be my missing 6% ice dorm biting me
but whatever i got my 750+
there's so much nuance
a natural way to get rsi
yeah
i honestly wish i never saw it
for the cez B rot
my hand is fucking killing me trying to match these timings
its not sp\
fuck this
im retired this cycle
but my sp affixes are bad
for me its bad
im not even gonna try this
yeah i have no sp on bastet
cause this is s2/ss
i wonder if s0 can copy
with full bastet
sp did not exist
the way i was doing it
which makes sense
<@704867526877904908>
i wasnt far off of how to fight this boss
though watching a proper rot
i couldve ran this instead
you said cez b wasnt a thing
carv
what
its literally the ma version
i havent needed a ref for
this is the first boss
i think
get me out
we're good
nvrmind
guys im losing it
fuck this boss
honestly
and im trash
that
yeah
<a:aKKsBearLeaveLeft:814686897452220456>
whoops
my fire dk wasnt on
wait
fuck this stage
and now ae died
im streaming rn if you wanna see the mald
why am i playing like garbage today
now fucking raven died
bro
im fucking trash
ganesha actually smoked me
wtf is this main stage
okay im not making it either
Nvrmind actually
Wait
Or tet
Did Nini steal it
Where's your attack
Carv
Didn't seem like there's a way to fit it in
Ok yeah I figured
Wtf
~~dont listen to me I haven't seen a ref~~
What ref are you following?
And I assume 12/12 or cez B?
1415 att?
s0?
Smh
Don't tell the truth?
Someone quote that
Quick
You're pretty
<:HoVWink:675105567496339456>
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
I could've used her on the BN ranged stage
Wtf
?
HoR is ranged
Wait
I didn't even have a mech until spa
I wish ugh
You offer conclusions I'll never reach
On keilao acc
Remember I tried to HoF it
Iirc
Yeah
I think thats the mech/bio > psy /bio > fire tank
HoT op
Wow
Wait you weren't kidding
Someone in our armada is gonna try
Gotcha
O
Or see what it's like
Just clear the stages
Do they wanna compete
Question
Well
Haven't seen footage
Probably
I actually couldn't clear it the first time I got to nirv lol
That's the tank stage with bio/psy
They have to make it to her first
Would need like 3-4 rots
That zombie is bad
I highly doubt it
What happened
Bring me back
Granted I *think* this is type counter
But found it

I wonder if I can find it actually
The ONLY good example I've seen is karto's 9S
Never Again
It's SO bad
Cosplaying a wolf
He's a fucking bullfrog
This is gonna hurt
Now that the bug is gone for io
Bye
Type counter wolf
Type counter in general sucks
Gonna try it though
Not sure tbh
You'd wanna kill yourself
Which if you'd malded that
I'd actually rather do lightning Andrius with spa again
But not by much
Better than mpe kosma
I did that last time
Ngl
It's bald
Okay lol
Rank for rank?
And a couple others
Griseo let her do tank
Also I mean
MPE had like next to no value in MA either if you wanna go that route lol
It's called kosma
She can
<a:CatShoot:959706440858214521>
Ok
Break your rot completely
But that shouldnt like
6% tdm 16% phys and 8% dkey
All the little buffs add up too esp at this D
Oh
And rank
What's atk
I wouldn't say she's ex *per se*
But she is strong 
In a lot better of a place than when she released anyway
Just SSS hos like oko
Yeah
She gets a lot more hits or smth on ult atm
Ihy
<:worryTakesTheBait:775425675356143616>
Shut
Which is pretty cool
She's also got the bug rn
But that doesn't sound unreasonable if SS+ (read: ss2) nowadays
Actually lemme go back and see
Imo
Griseo gave her a LOT
Or something?
What was it again, ex?
She actually has too many acronyms
HoF
HF (which used to be Hawk of the Fog)
Hofs
KFT
FK 

Like damn
Kentucky fried tuna

however
 <@385655541248163840>  just loves hoh
literally its not even open
i cant even do mine
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
Okay watched that tier list video in full, pausing and reading comments/notes and all

I'm not sure why some valks are in there but from the perspective of someone asking what's good right now or looking for something quick and easily digestible it's fine on it's own and fairly accurate
The world
Or like
3 sometimes
I remember back when you needed 2 per ma boss
I'd cry
No no
Ohhh
Or crit
Spcd
Bio attack
I hate it
Literally all of my newts are affixed for hos
That stig is op
I'll allow 9 Ppm though
3-4 now?
You need like
This isn't early 2021
You could've salvaged a newt
Jesus
6?
Only need to kill off one
And I kinda want this beet B
I don't have anything to salvage
Imagine
Do it
From what it seems like anyway
3 cycles on release
Every new valk has like
Well
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
Once they invalidated aponia
I think they learned their lesson
It's actually busted
I love how people still think 7T is weak
Oh true
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
But yeah def not as simple as the PE runs
The worst part is just Carole for me
It's not that bad with spa imo
Doom?
733 is limited to schro M though
680 or 733
I think you can like
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
If you're Darius or mimitsu you can play her every cycle
I just unlocked da actually 
Probably won't use but she's there
Back when rime was a thing
Werent they designed for her specifically
yeah that'll do it
esp for newbies
the type counter ones are pretty bad
that fucker is tanky
or the psy ice one
its a bitch without mobi
was this last lightning one
like a good example of the side stage thing
is the best way to put it
its like getting another substar
dorm specifically
yeah
*majority* of people are not competitive here
have to remind myself sometimes too
100%
also, i think people are gonna cry about specific valks regardless
which if you're not in nirv
your opinion is invalidated
cause everything works below
clearer phrasing would circumvent that for sure
people always see tier list and make assumptions or get misled
pretty much
not that either is f2p but they're both good
if mimitsu and neal worked on it i believe it
i'll watch later with as much as an unbiased opinion as possible
have only seen the screenshot
at least its felt like it
since 5.3 (?) it basically has
everything new has been good and meta
I don't dislike Marisa and I appreciate the work 
But ngl some stuff has been sus

And they always catch a fucking attitude when you mention something
Idk I really don't like tier lists here
I can't wait for someone to get hos and say she's not good she's only B rank
I don't like tier lists in these type of games in general
It is
Is that with that shit tier list
Someone posted a ss
And I havent
Otherwise everyone would just get a higher graphics card and >500 lol
Hence the lose na respect quip
most ppl just consider it cheating to some degree since it requires editing your fps cap externally
There's a gentlemen's agreement to not go >120 fps
But anyways
Idr which though
Kyoshiro passed aka too on some cycle with a 9s account he borrowed
Ic ic
I thought they had 839
Oh he improved?
Aka is sea
Yeah
There's been a couple that aka hasn't capped now
Different D in eu
That he said he didn't have time to optimize?
Whatever aka had?
What was cap
Also
He'd lose NA respect
No shot
LOL
you guys are everywhere
blustorm sea
is that
another one
232 stayed in
or slackers
just good to see for new players
ohh no no
?
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
if im understanding correctly
we could've been spared
remember this
im actually triggered
wtf
when did these exist
I haven't seen footage of it yet
That sounds
Annoying ngl
I'm so excited to see the same reactions that people had to kosma here
Yeah
<:Lumine_1Mora:795762964024131634>
Why do you have 22 mil coins
Carv

Edit Neal made ref

Neal didn't pilot but he made a ref I think
Thank you Neal
I think I know that person
LOL
Nirv
To give you an idea
724 is fourth
No one wanted to play
Outside of Eli's bracket though I think it's pretty comfy this cycle
You had to hold back to let them think they had a chance
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
Carvlao the nirv retainer

Idk why I thought -200 a week
Still 6 or 7 cycles though to carv's point
Trophies reset after sushang I think
So Nini should be at 3100, maybe 3200?
Yeah
Cause my math is wrong
How much are you at?
Wait
That's 7 weeks or so
Assuming you're at 3100
You'd have to demote for an entire patch
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Y'all put me on the wall of sus
Bro

Same
Pardo 3S is nice
But ik it's there

But
Generally yeah
Hard as fuck to play around
Or rather
Ss HB is unusable
With how fast rots are now
Sp and damage
Saint got you hooked
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>

Honestly
If they fixed that
It's not a bad boss
That's what I heard
The delay
<:Jail:844326873714262096>
It's illegal to touch minors
8 months

I don't wanna do
Cause there's a really toxic one
What's the lightning stage
Wait
But idk I'm timezoned diff'd
Is feedback I've gotten
Takes forever between attavks
Clunky to dodge and uh
The collapse is awful
From the sea players that did
Literally nothing positive
But I've heard
I haven't played
Raven ain't it fam
But idk what it will be, I just know one is needed
She falls off a cliff
-200
If you dont
If you hit the breakpoints
She does REALLY strong damage
Imo
For HFS
Anything below SS dies at this D
Pretty crit mald
The 9S rot is uh
I hear it's hot garbage
Won't be surprised if expected Fire support is Qua to tend V2v scores on Kosma
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>

actually
<a:aWorryBackAwaySlowly:695603204599316560>

if you're getting 761 in agony 1
depends on bracket
<:kekDoggo:775708084051378217>
Good luck timing p2
Which Holmes or gpn can do but
You need ~3.88m to one shot the core

Riku didn't one shot core either
I'm confused
You need holmes
It's 463D
Well yeah
Sswords is fine though

The way it read before implied something contrary to the actual effect
I don't have mind stones wtf
I didn't level that skill because I misunderstood it
FUCK
Wait

Himeko gave her life
Why is everyone suicidal

<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
It took me an hour to improve 3 points
Another hour to improve another 7
Not worth it
<a:nodnod:821142843909210202>
It's just roll till you crit big
Honestly smart
But p2 is cancer with gpn
Gpn yes
Maybe Holmes TM Newt B
Not at this temp
Well
Nope
I don't think people tested in beta
Oic
Like ruby just mentioned
It depends on the boss like most things in this game

Overall FF is more damage
People do answer though lol
With playing who lol
<:KizunaBlur:419855244386893824>
which made 0 difference imo
then i decided to try out the crit emblem
it was one
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
for 3 points
baited me into playing for an hour
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
happy now
<@704867526877904908>
ik <:deadge:975652771082698782>
my wallet looked like it went through 11 rounds with mike tyson this past 5.5-6.0
rebel

carv pls
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
<:meihue:960024977703313439>

glb anni?
but 6.4 would fall about
cant see anything beyond that
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i just want my fire support
what non pe boss is paper though?
rpc doesnt count
<:kekDoggo:775708084051378217>
exalted 2: electric boogaloo
that isnt happening for a long timr
every patch is  pe patch lol
i mean
hoh/vil v patch
i should actually watch a ref lol
but i can oneshot p1 with sswords
Edit: nvrmind im full of shit
now, granted im s1
idk what people are freaking out about
honestly
There is this but
When people are doing stuff like this
And that won't go far imo
That was mentioned too
S3
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
You gonna take this slander
Tet
That's maso
Who uses schro T anymore
Yeah
The SpA doom one
For one strat
But happy for 3% phys
Won't get the SS in time
<:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
i was farming her too (didnt own her)
didnt expect her card
only 32 frags away from ss
<:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
i want that schro m
im tempted
that was ugh
judah
like say
though i dont miss the short buffs era
non whale teams
for like
im pretty sure its used in 3s ma still
i used 2 last week ma lul
such an op stig
and a good chunk of 2021
2019 2020
newt was a meta like
Get him tet
763 was fifth in my bracket wtf
I got ocean rein and tka
I also don't know what this is referring to outside of using newt over cez
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
<@309634550273933314> you gonna take that from carv
Like the last double pri patch we had last anni
Sounds about right
They fucked up
Some people get 12/12 exactly so they can be lazy lol
hell s0 hoh 776 this boss with crusher
every once in a while he's on there
yeah
because you dont need ss+ to retain nirv
my s1 valks do s0 damage so its fine
hence s0 vil v
he'd rather get a new valk
no lol
darius has s0 too
does lux not have s0
another score with ss2
19 hours later
but he uploaded a score on benares with ss0
i couldnt find it
no no
it was actually so funny
ss2
yes
<a:MadgeClap:853961726155554877>
i havent used it in so long
oh they added it to this server kek
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
wait
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
will use it next cycle lol
or the person that didnt use said song
a good chunk of them do lol
why does every fucking ref use the same song
also
or something else
if its as straightforward/mechanical as this/bke
granted idk the fight
20 less D though
thats like
i have to
im a vice
i am
solstice composes of 4 people nowadays so
well
<@385655541248163840>  
just learn biangs ez
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
i found you a 9s hoh kosma already
<a:CatShoot:959706440858214521>
<a:bronyadots:583366510555430912>
its not that bad
wait i just saw this
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
soon to be 3
that and na does it late af
imo
yeah ma is pretty dead
for sp
used every once in a while in ma
you probably dont need it anymore but
that idk
um
do you even need anything from exchange
noreason to burn it
monet T is ok but pretty dead nowadays
idek if shakespeare T is even used anymore outside of hawk mobbing
<:worryDasRight:595540930212397057>
ik i hate it
just barely missed mvp
they pop up in luminacord sometimes
i think in cafe
TheKillerAngel
<:meihue:960024977703313439>
you good <@704867526877904908>
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
holy shit tka
its freeze/buffs timings
right now its not a damage thing
yeah
every pe boss is a mald boss for me
cant relate
just end me
with s0
460D HoD
yes
whale
just gotta be creative
this uses 4* dudu but should be good enough
do you want one?
i shouldnt be this close to you
yeah
do ma first
<:kekDoggo:775708084051378217>
i can if you need
also i saw ping
top 4 were 901+
that happened to riku once on hod lol
i'd be third in that
the fuck is that bracket
idgi
and 2 very close s0
the problem for me is when that score is 5th with 4 other 9s whales
its easy enough to one and done with a good enough score to retain
what the fuck
this fucking plane has used the aoe stun 5/6 times
my last 6 runs
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
pog
all good
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
i literally just posted hoh/sw runs
here <@385655541248163840>
9s hoh actually does well
oh


this is 9s sw team


and here's an hoh kosma


i have this for sw
well
cause i see hot  kosma hoh bke
are you sure
brb
im actually curious how that works
you'll be fine then
oh, pog
can they?
not my fault miyoho made her bosses vv or die
listen you
literally
cry
similar
well
that looks about the same as mine
priced out of my game
i might actually be forced to retire
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
<a:Fukbywei:993370439445385299>
if anything we get aboosed by wei
easy week for me
we try again next week
i've accepted
nah no rush
nvrmind
actually i know my answer
keilo
i think you can use gd instead? but idk head empty no thoughts
no way to qte
for ht yeah
cause i dont wanna do heph if i dont have to
i really wish i had klein for the 946 heim
its easy when your score is  subpar anyway
i diidnt want to play more tank ugh
done
like what is this personal attack lol
they +1'd me in myriad & in ma
help
yo im being disrespected by max
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
guess im done playing, no coming back from that
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
that i dont even remember my original rot that got me the 760
i've done so many variations of my rot now trying to follow kyo/pat/etc
i have a new problem
and yes 3s hb is probably the problem
whatever it is
dont do it
<a:JailedTakoWantsToLeaveButCant:869950055044505650>
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
They're called Cadets in this game
Oh
If you can find mentee
Masters shop
Well
That's it?
Pins?
Ow?
Cause where do you even get them
Same lol
But even like 2-3 red = 1 purple
I think is okay
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
We could convert
I kinda wish
I have 1500
Me neither
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
I still haven't started
This is good to know
This seems like speed issue
idk why ref was using active
but actually
i can show you rq?
i dont need this
since it has that baked in already
or meant to refer to earlier
this is what i referred to earlier
i was looking at this
wait im a liar
it should proc regardless
to hit mobs
or rather
for the passive to proc
you dont need active of cb19
also i confirmed
cause i was killing mobs too slow apparently
its so much more dmg
but swapping in hb after rc to apply turg
same opener
well
im doing a different opener now
climbing 1 point at a time
okay i figured out something
i hope i never see that thing again
rimestar weather without rime
how are we supposed to survive at these temps
its so fucking annoying
bro
go for 700
weren't you supposed to go to bed
good
rude
im in vc nini
idk where mine is either
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
s0 gets to die
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
But I expect a lot of 740-770
790-800
According to ryuu
That aside this is really good
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
What is this slander
Also
No
copycats
ikr
im watching eli play rn
rpc?
for what?
hey i ran into that earlier lol
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
sure
im still
yeah
<:DISGUST:908186956071075852>
eli wyd
good enough (not really)
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
bro
disappointed
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
lets see if this is true
okay starting
loading game now
home
Didn't wanna text and drive
Almost home
Fake
I believe in you :)
But anyway
Honkai is fun from a more casual eye sometimes too
Nowadays more than ever
Gear is mandatory
Not that you shouldn't be getting gear
It's hard but you can do decent with bad gear
Skill issue is just practice
Well
As <@704867526877904908> can tell you
Gear issue can be overcome
Rotations are just a repeat sequence of actions you take
But affixes are pretty important at higher abyss levels and some ma stuff
<a:JailedTakoWantsToLeaveButCant:869950055044505650>
Honestly
Sometimes I wish I didn't either
<a:aWOGGERS:434306628288774146>
Keilo and Nini are the good ones
Me pleb
No that's me
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
It'll be super simple
Red lotus?
Where are you
I don't wanna fight the airplane
Ew
Oh that's right
Or rather
I forgot
Ty ty
Idek who the boss is
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
14 hour difference from me though
Wow
Wasn't to far off
Oh
I thought you stayed up all night
Ahh I see
Wait
Why are you awake aster
Had a company event to go to
Won't be home for like an hour though
Haven't done abyss yet
I'm gonna stream then
LMFAO
Nini wyd
I reso tm before
Relatable
9%+ spcr
CN had like
Fair
Hmm
T is fine then
That was before I knew you had a sister t
O
Yeah
Personally I'd use in the b but yes
I can ask around but I'm not sure nor do I have it
Though tbh I think it shows your outfits for other people maybe?
Whales, all of you
For whales maybe
That's how you know they're retired
T2 option and sneeze and still t100
Cause it hasn't been used on that account yet
Also Lowkey was a waste to get herrscher
Numbers he gave me
But yeah they just kinda randomly revive
Expensive game
S2 HoH with elf still cost $600
Stopped whaling though
Only when he feels like it
Meh
beefy is lumina vice
<a:kree:809653433455214632>
Wouldn't know Klein doko
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
I mean tank and heim
Well
Makes sense
Easy bosses with multiple options
This is a tryhards week lol
Yeah that's what I remember seeing
Ah
Iirc
It's Cleo B actually
I just tried to copy rino but was getting tilted by krieg
Imagine 
I was malding for a 893
That heim took me out
I'm gonna try tomorrow
O already
Are you gonna do ma this time
Nini
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
Not like <@309634550273933314>
Well
Scuffed enough
Clicky's account is in RL/nirv bouncer status
Scuffed to hell
Don't you go bullying my armada peeps

Hi aster
<:meihue:960024977703313439>
Yeye
Just wanted to show the quote
No
<@704867526877904908>
I actually love this quote
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
<:meihue:960024977703313439>
I've noticed lol
Oh I'm adding a quote
Always something else lol
Never skill issue
And imy was actually so pissed cause he kept pulling out excuses
I remember when imy and Darius were helping him with bk
Yeah he triggers quite a few people too lol
Why would you do that to yourself
Because s0 is actually so sp hungry
SS nyx is sp, right?
It's a fucking cycle with him. It's normal this happens a lot with Darius or anyone helping him
I have no context but
Good
Edit: found context. Great
Fucking dumb whale brain strikes again but
elf skills are a scam
to level this yes
the next level is 9
for 60
thats still 30
oh not cyclic
2 elf skills

how do i tank without 4* dudu
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
its gone
i go too fast
but bd is like
ngl
it feels about the same as krieg
<a:nodnod:821142843909210202>
but br is the wave
idgi
yeah lol
and have higher health left over
i do more dmg than ref
hence this problem
yeah
no qte used
no
was enough to clean kill
1.71m ult
did the same thing with br
honestly i have no clue
i just retired kreigs
lol
fucking finally
figured it out
wtf
so not active
no extra number on his vid
well
is it the weapon active not hitting or am i just dumb?
my heath bar is higher?
yet
i do more dmg 1.63
my bar is lower
rino
fuck this
doesnt kill
1.64
always has been
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah i cant compete
wtf is this boss
didnt kill either
1.63m
bro
crippled by elf
fuck
leaves too much health
1.59
because that might be where my dmg is going
no right
is newt/jst affected by timeslow
wait
wtf
1.6m doesnt kill??
wait
wtf
i do no damage
wait
so this is off
i probably will overkill too much
ok gonna try ref
sounds painful
and pe is usually locked elsewhere
i dont own mobi
see
sue me
i havent used her in what feels like forever
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
its been 10 years
omg
wait is that le
they did
leme see this ref
im so annoyed i upgraded my dupe turg set to find out what i wanted to do doesnt work lul
<a:teripoor_hh:810150526762876938>
what do i do for heim if i have no klein (HT) and no rc (hof) and a non functional FT
It used to take me like 2-3 weeks a level
Before the exp changes yeahh
Affixes cracked
Wardylan op
Cause it would be too easy otherwise
After standing there until the timer reached 400
<:Fubuki_Grabby:828297136927801374>
this your alt?
yo nini
dont even need to do boss to retain
lol
<a:aborrySwipeFastest:469453781571207179>
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
even aponia doesnt get a break
after watching magery bald last night
<:cozypengu:959706457052413994>
3 minutes left
clear with like
really makes me appreciate vil v
i wanted to die
2 seconds left
barely cleared
LOL
it was the first run
<a:MadgeClap:853961726155554877>
i didnt know
the one time
better than nyx
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
so i never get it
17/20 runs
and she jumps like
instant reset
because if eden throw doesnt hit (all 6-7 hits)
is fucking maso
sushang without klein
I can't be bothered
This is the only time I've never played a cycle
Shut
I will actually uninstall if I play this boss
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
Fuck that boss
I played for an hour
Wanted to uninstall
She looks fun
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
I'm not even mean to you
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
So trying to start using her
I just maxed her bow
Toxic
To roll higher attack
I mean
No no
Fund affix mats and I will
I'm not even 1500
Her attack is embarrassing for ss3
Though I need to
5/1 it is then
Really don't wanna reaffix
<:worrykms:398047795732545536>
Since she has so much crit baked into her kit already
Do you run 5 att 1 crit line?
And
How much will I be missing from that rank if I'm only ss3
What does mpe get at sss
flex
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
<:shut:887612771477389312>
It's gameplay
I'm pretty sure
But I doubt they have it
Avo would be better
Theresa Origins isn't a bad idea
Actually
Tesla M
Do they have
Glut T Irene B
<@434737143395516416> s irene
Wait how to do this
<@434737143395516416> !s irene
No newt
No zhen B
Irene B good B
Do they have newt?
Cause it's really hard to play with scuffed gear
Than gear
Might help more
Watching a run
I think
Zhen T FHM mb fischl lol
Maso
Then fr is
Oh
10%
FHM op
This is support impact 3rd
But jeez
Stigs are meh anyway

impossible game
<:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
<a:bcaScaredNo:784649325976223745>
yeah, thats fair
awful
on top of double pri patches
triple fucking sp valks
and
no real skip patches
5.2+ has been insanely expensive
5.0
i dont blame them
in terms of competitive cost  it hasn't really dropped since like
not many are willing to spend on\
game going in a direction
yeah
so he can finally play other games
and his wrist injuries are healed
was thinking about dropping for a while
is general
which is fair
hates the gach
cursed emote
<:worryfire_hh:772136190039031838>
eli wyd
that makes sense actually
just after hor
oh
when did tp even drop
<:02shrug:1001147147703562260>
ns/sk fun
wish i found honkai first, as much as i have a hate/love with this game
would've loved to play ns back then
funny how that works lol
impressive
sss hoh but still
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
also <@385655541248163840>

kek i wish
<:CB_smoothbrain:781799597776437258> <:KianaDumb:496085016888082433>
yes, but the final for apush had you do essays too
ya calc 2 killed me
i hated writing 3 different essays for the test
apush was so hard for me
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
and doesnt blind you every fucking time
honestly
vil v had the same problem but hers finishes way faster
with ults
its just so slow
no, there's def damage
i dont like playing elysia in er
ngl
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
i found this funny
also lookie
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
fair enough
you're substar scammer instead
oh
yeah ik
or hot
and isnt mobius
thats gacha
who do you have ss
actually
you're ss account
shut
the rest is niche shit im crafting
i crafted all the needed stigs when i wasn't f2pbtw
took fucking forever for goemon/elysia/ana t/lee b/dirac etc
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
im so out of touch
but i havent had to care about fuel in so long
yeah thats what i remember there being
coffee did math
nvrmind
nowadays just do g4 and sell the mats
it takes like 6-8 weeks in my experience
but that was before g4
but imy authored a guide somewhere
apparently no server has fucking math on it
brb
but thats just from a quick search in maincord
you can get 1k ether fuel a month so rpob
allegedly
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
o
but i havent seen refs so idk
honestly, i still feel like this boss is gonna be free with 7t now
hod gonna be cancer too
the bare minimum score was insane
like lightning rpc
i mean as far as placements
minimum
850+
im scared for rpc
the scores people are getting up here
but it is stupid
nirv
i'd still be 4th in lux's
lux got a sweaty bracket too
okay i dont feel as bad
<:stronkhic:640167811469279232>
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
told you
pog
Sushang we eating good
She wasn't designed to work with hb
Issok
Higher is def possible
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
Gimme my 6% ice
I don't wanna play again
I can kill crab at 953 but
With this rot
I'm near capped
Unless I aim I think
Also keilo
7% ss
5%
Fire
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I only had 15% and 5 tdm
Dorm buff
What's your ice
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
Yeah
I actively sit at a desk
Idgi
But never really hungry out of it
I get really hungry at work
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
I did yesterday when I did cata's abyss
Oic
Then die to hunger <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Mald Harder
<:worryCoffeeSus:778719399745945651>
cb is def substar scam
if its ff then ss is enough
not needed
well
pretty sure thats ss2
And 2.7 sprc
.4 SP/s
It os
only 2 more times this patch
i truly despise this boss
i somehow managed a 536 on husk too
i just hope no one else shows up
but who knows
at any time they could do two more  and 760+ ez though
for 9s
thats a one and done run score
probably a slacker yeah
issok though
i rolled one of the only sweaty brackets apparently
5 is 9s
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<a:aworryRun2:601196179878969382>
was getting a half decent score on husk sorry
?
you still need raid
nini
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
Looking at Keeby vids he did use that
Actually
Fair enough
Ah
Never played around with it, not sure tbh
That doesn't seem too good
How does fischl use turg
Wait
Like 729 should not be 4th/5th
With a sweaty bracket
Why am I the only one
The fuck
Before they fixed her
Like PE
GD is the wave yeah
FR for me was for using a non lightning valk
But idk
I really don't think this time will be bad
It was mald with dos lol
Ice rpc is literally so free
Shouldn't be too bad
7t now
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Maybe 20 points or so per rank
Not much different
Not much different
Higher bar with FF but like
If you have cb19 you're just stuck waiting
HB is awful
Ya
<:KizunaBlur:419855244386893824>
nyx
is that
is
deceived us all
<a:nodnod:821142843909210202>
cn built different
insane
thats the same thing i said LOL
hs is actually doing insane damage
<:02shrug:1001147147703562260>
lookie tet's alt applied to sols
also
yeah
lemme find vid
like i thought 760 was always cap
for hod
me when i saw that s0 813
honestly
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<:pennehands:886690313937256488>
imagine capping ma
i've never seen this before
wow
wtf??
not the ref
look at the first 10 seconds
o btw
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
makes sense though
but idr
ic
i feel like i remember that cycle being a full lobby
and this one 20
so someone got removed right?
and look
ignore the score but 4/19
ma seems clean
i do think some are getting banned at least
hoh bait 6s is the real psy ice
what a god
ssg
im not
<:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
i miss when he was hackerimpact3rd
number 5 is 9s btw
729 legit might not +100
ya thats styx
the tea event
cause it ended 3 days early
some people sent a ticket to cs
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
hopefully it goes well
jk
L
i heard about that too
hitcount shield
ye ye
fair
170 pulls
that was so resource intensive
i'd be less mad if i didnt commit to vil v ngl
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
trash game
yeah that i heard about
beta is usally 435D, no?
oh right
that thing just got deleted
wow
i'll take a look sure
ss2 seems good but ss good enough
like
just end me
im so annoyed lol
double pri patch bro
or metal
where am i supposed to be getting nano
fuck that i sleep
are you kidding me
hov is getting a sss?
excuse me
oh god
maybe they'll be nice <:Cope:888647792434765864>
to use on only houdou sss
and im not making a new pri for a dead valk
exactly lol
if possible
i'd rather craft it
i have ana mb
depending on crybbal
and new dkey
so pull sushang gear
then g4 is useless to me
i legit know nothing
i dont look at beta until v3
200 pulls max if i shitsacc
so 50 pull guarentee per piece
nvrmind then
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
bro
wtf
oh, is her gear not the new g4?
sushang gear prob expensive
so thats already 11.2k crystal lost
also gonna pick up the new dkey if only for the attack
but so much fuel
and just transmute the last piece
to 3/4
assuming we get a box with one of the g4's (which prob wont happen idk)
or ana gets direct craft (i hope)
i'm prob pulling sushang gear banner
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i gotta grab that server
shit
:worryeden:
yeah
affixes are like the endless money sink too
even for affixes
bad value
thats such
thats insane
excuse me WHAT
its actually crazy how dorm buffs mean more than 50 > 65 a pri
<a:madgeclap:875612053375684638>
where 6% ice
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
cause you gotta wait for stacks
until the first hb active
all ranks are the same pretty much
granted
i dont think sss rots translate well to s2< rots
only reason i did is cause of yolo pulls with the 5 expansion cards
its hfs all over again
i am surprised about substars
i doubt people were gonna skip
are not ss+ or s+ scammers
5 people on na
i feel like all but like
the only thing i see is that i lose points at 2:33 because im 2 sp short (and 2nd active should've killed) but idk
run at 0:42
help me clean up
~~yes ik recording quality is trash~~
btw anyone here can look at this
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
and sp/s on turg feels bad
exactly
so she doesnt need 1441 attack anymore lol
and i never have to use pardo dps ever again
since we're getting a second one
im not even mad though
<:KyaruTired:959737564791717889>
i had to use the event sp/s spcd piece on bastet
i think i can 730
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
sure
whats up
even beat yumi
knew you could 78
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
NICE
ohhh
why so many dinosaurs wth

i thought you said you weren't trying lol
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:KizunaBlur:419855244386893824>
im gonna guess hb qte but lets see

<:worrypat:986461060104081508>

All the retired whales came back for Ely so
Literal number 1 i mean
Yeah
In the middle of asserting dominance as T1
OwOpat <@385655541248163840>
Better t1
Fookin whale
<:worryPat:587481019213545473>
Oh no
Burned 600 locks for garbage
Yo
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
To be in anni box
Cata isn't a fan of the sk pick
2 of those are ancient
Though last box was aka vk and fr
HoR is ancient though, 3.3
SK 2.6 or smth I don't quite remember
Roza no, that was just before genshin x honkai I think
<:pennehands:886690313937256488>
<:Fubuki_Grabby:828297136927801374>
Not bad affix
Wow
If you're talking about 5.5
So was roza lol
When was the last time you saw sk given out
We already had a free hor
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
But no more I agree
I think it's cause of coverage
Yeah
my finger slipped
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
nah the s1 was an acciden
<:worrykms:398047795732545536>
should be fun
now husk without klein
not doing that without s1 or 3* dudu
the latter of which i dont have
ty s1 pe
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
husk tomorrow now
we got it
nvrmind
im using myriad and i still cant get this fucking sp pack
now im stuck on hod
like the opening frames
i use as soon as pardo starts to ult
that hitting a headshot did anything
at least i didnt read in bow skills
second nah
first one yeah
idk if it matters honestly
also i couldnt kill with 3 actives, had to do active > charge > active
for me i was legit just too slow

also not sure of best elf timing
i just used when rc was starting to ult
got
31840
kill at 4:59
rip
whatcha got
i figured out something too, i just keep getting jumpsec
👀
klein enables a lot of strats
3* dudu matters for win more imo
ya
personally then, i'd 3* dudu rather than get a 2* klein
but idk how others feel
what are your lightning/phys teams?
which of these matters more to your specific situation?
31786
guess the score
only own mb <:deadge:975652771082698782>
i gotta grind ana T too
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
thats so much dmg
you dont really use ana without the 3 piece
but
i wanna say jst m but that sounds wrong
sk popular again
wao
<:ClownTao:959088901790765186>
and literally wasted all my locks
i burned at least 40k mats <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
finally jesus
4/4
SSS HV, 1534 atk
Not my SS idk gear or ranks
Cause she does okay
Who asked about hov er btw
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
We demote together
Issok
Assuming I don't get substar skemmed
It'll be fun being an s0 retainer though for once in ice
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I'm actually crippled with 1399 attack
I see some like this, but was seeing a lot more with 6 atk lines
?
Is 1 sp/s actually the wave
Yo
They'll be banned soon enough <:deadge:975652771082698782>
They were in relationships with others too
Noooo, you don't have to fund me
*Pockets all the money and doesn't pay a dime back*
And flexed about simp money

I'm actually so annoyed by this still
For 3 years
Someone was disowned by their family
I can't give any details but
Nah man, you gotta put myriad + T100 retainer
Has a special on Netflix I think rn
Big catfishing story
Google it
I can't believe I actually lived the manti teo story
It's mostly died down now but man

<:worryDasRight:595540930212397057>
Game only rewards after you pay
And she's very strong for general phys imo if you don't have Ely 3S yet
You're never not gonna see 2 PE bosses a patch
But that's without knowing anything about Ely
Best general use case
Imo
Dudu
<:smoge:959781798181736478>
1399 s0 4/4 3* elf
Idgi
4* sirin was better than 3* ely

OwO headpat <@148145559897636865>

9% team tdm 10% phys damage for 10 secs I think
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
Yeah you need 3*
2*
Oh
Riku (another s2 PE SS Carole) hits for like 4.55
Where is your damage
But yeah wtf
Just pause for like 3 or 4 seconds to test
That looks like sswords stacks
So uh
Back to my corner I go then
O keilo answered
3* can kill
No
What's the ult?
4.55M
Yes
<a:whoasked:959994506017660979>

<a:CB_pepeleave:595326302223990814>
Iirc
Cause it loses the shield then
Destroy turret when out of ammo
Wait until she runs out of ammo
She shoots at you with shielded turrets
I feel like her mechanics are
Wait there's a vil v boss incoming?
<:HimekoDead:632367996404498452>
Lol
Parv is just unnaturally tanky
At this temp
Right right
Ohh, right
Parv
Ew
Who do we have for fire bosses actually? 
I'm only recalling kasumi and aka?
Though I guess for most phys bosses that's true
It's not even hard
It's just how much time are you willing to crit bald
Yeah LOL I forgot about this
I got 21k crystals and a dream ready for her
Yeah same
Idk why the shield is crittable
And Carole has to crit too
Without paga
It's like impossible
Yeah
I'm at 431
Scoring lower than Ely with pe
I really suck wow
Yeah
That's with Ely btw
<:kekDoggo:775708084051378217>
Not even tickle
Can confirm
But yikes
Lol
This reads like ch > hos all over again
icefire scored 783 with 3*
so idk
everyone and their brother mother grandmother had 4* dabber
though when i was looking for refs on bilibili
this guy scored 732 with s0 with 3*
not that important i think
shui is actually better
i know
pls work
on carole
gonna try this
and it helped a bit
i just used ult only, not the regular qte
i have no clue
honestly
i almost failed cause of that
that was so anooying
i had no gear for both <:pennehands:886690313937256488>
his shield is thicc too
remember when type andrius was worse
yeah
its kinda paper down there
doubt
im dead too <:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
we weren't kidding <:kekDoggo:775708084051378217>
and mei m isnt that good here
full shui isnt the wave either though
yeah
so i get it
i didnt really start sss valks until i started to become a bit more whale either
eden yeah cause the dmg boost is insane
if you're shooting for nirv
unless you want a performance drop
all valks need sss tbh
but paganini is too important
she gains so much from sss though
carole
if you have both with gear there's absolutely no reason to not run carole here
sss carole?
yeah
431
323
23x
im full of shit carole is better
though since griseo this is legit the only time i've felt what not having paganini is like
only other time was hod pre griseo and that wasnt *awful*
too many rotations
they both need 2 rots to break the shield if bad
griseo is better if carole is crippled
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
this is why you dont skip sp banners
yeah
really should've fucking pulled paganini
fuck this boss
literally fucking pe and hos died
im sleep <:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah i actually do nothing
fml
i have to 2 rot the mobs
but with a cope carole
that shield is disgusting
i see why no one is using griseo
why does everyone in cn have 4* dabber
its all paga tm cez B sss carole (expectedly)
i cant find any refs for non paganini carole OR for griseo
so uh
It's wild
9S is stupid damage lol
Well yeah
well, closer to 6 but
its only been like 5 hours lol
I just assumed dabber is messing with buffs or something
But I've never found a consistent way for the mobs to take the same amount of damage
If you don't rip your score
If you can one shot mobs you win
Yep
I got the gloves though
Shouldn't have skipped Paganini<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:kekDoggo:775708084051378217>
Yeah, that'll work as well
Cause Carole SSS is so much more shieldbreak but gear doko
Did anyone figure out if a 0 Paganini SSS Carole beats a 4/4 SSS SI
<:OhISeeGaeun:892029051412312074>
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
what do you use eden with?
do handel lol
you dont have ae
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
o
marble?
vil wiped me out
im summoning some streamer luck
was just before iirc
hr 3.3 or something
sn 3.5
no
<:meihue:960024977703313439>
i'm coping with 20k and 50 focus cards is enough
wolf or any mobi team
but its so fucking helpful on like
i got 776 w/out 3s pv on last bke
yeah
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
It'll happen
Only seele they care about is the hod seele
And they're reviving her
I missed some
I wish she got more stamps in 5.1
Yeah
Don't cheat yourself
She's strong at 3S
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
Yeah I'll take the aw
That one
Oh
What else is in box
For trial valks
100% sure the base attack is lower too
I'm like
You'll get to mid 90
Nah
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
you would be t3
you saw mine in bs
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
t5 in yours would be -200 in mine
i could've promo'd in this wtf
that 10% is huge
you need 4* yeah
trash boss
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
hasn't actually malded
chy did one run
if they care to try lol yeah
send help
im fighting for my life
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
hoh come sooner
so im guessing most brackets have more shill valks than average
like this is myriad cutoff rn
and there's still 8 and a half hours left in glb
you can close your eyes and score 750+
its a sw cycle carv
Cause I feel like I remember one taking more dmg than the other quite frequently
I'm actually not ready
I don't miss dabber causing dmg variance
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
If you can one shot the mobs yeah
This is me with stigs though lol
+10 attack
Sync it if you have the stars
Shield *shouldn't* really be a problem
But I agree with Ruby
<:borryOld:457954203327791105>
Dxy T kek
<a:TE_MonkaShake:687198386533040210>
probably nonexistent
The fucking hacker is in my lobby so I can't be bothered
<:worryPat:587481019213545473>
and keilo
lmk when you hit 800 nini
3 runs and done
not worth
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
im not ready
part 1 lowkey burnt me out
not again
oh god
nice
good cause i havent started 2 yet
<:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
im still on part 2
oh shit
Based
<a:aworrySuperGanbatte:767329206199648258>
Ganbare ninilao
Hey that's me in 2 hours
Whales all around me
<a:Y_KEK:792821099062362122>
Pog
So prob pulling sushang
And I don't nearly have enough al/aw
Hoping enough for 3* elf
I'm planning to s0 4/4 gear for sure
Depends how my pulls go
Ah
6.0/6.1?
For?
Just annoying though
Myself included so I guess it works
Sooo many genshin transfers and new whales
I don't think anybody is
Honestly
I'm just not happy with miyoho in general rn
That's several tens of thousands a year gone 
A few people sure but just
Not good business
If your. Biggest whales and dolphins are complaining/leaving the game
You'd think they would make some effort
I can't imagine they're not getting enough complaints about it to warrant some mobement
I'm shocked the customer service department isn't bitching to that team
Honestly
It wasn't *terrible* with hof though
If you have da maybe
MA was way easier this week
I don't wanna do abyss <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Rush where
It literally took me 366 days to hit/cap (idr which) lvl 88
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
How are you not 88 yet
Wait
I'll watch Ina. Bit though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
2* elf
<:worryPitchfork:791025339043676210> <:worryPitchfork:791025339043676210> <:worryfire_hh:772136190039031838>
mihoyo pls
yeah
i'll try the homu gold then
but i've got 400 of those rn
cause the ones i pick only sell for 8400
i assume everyone was taking those
ohhh
?
what, gold packs
they jsut add up over time
in case i need gold someday
and whatever this is
i select the twin crystals / phase shifters
i get like 2 a day from here
the rewards
where you can pick rewards
from that one
commissions that reset every day
i meant the uh
o
<:meihue:960024977703313439>
<a:gBKthuglife:663423719808696320>
And nbad players like me look good
Whereas vil v everyone sleeps
HoT is insanely competitive
Ya
I wish I could do the same
Honestly
<:HimekoDead:632367996404498452>
I wonder what the g4 fire next year will be like
I still have my monet/Goemon hawk
Pog
And I've got
Like 1400 red lenses to burn
I refuse to farm out another peary
I'm hoping for direct craft ngl
I don't even have Ana T still
Not mine though
<:LuckSack:998055565941014539>
That other options can handle
Hopefully they make better bosses
I'd uninstall <:DeadFischl:710794008993071144> 
Then begrudgingly reinstall <a:JailedTakoWantsToLeaveButCant:869950055044505650>
It's literally only if you want to promote on every single weather
Which isn't most s0 accs
Probably all SS/SSS accounts

For MA I haven't cared about so idk, but I feel like you can still go very far without some of the newer gear

Still disgusting company practice though
Also from the nirv perspective I think
If you're not like say
Keeby or ryuu or a nirv regular then yeah

I do agree that this pace is insane and power creep up here is wild but it's been wild since they decided back in year 2 that only one valk should be competitive for x bosses
At least kasumi with that damn shield
I could see this
And even then that's a nirvana exclusive problem
Cause Carole/Paganini is still fairly strong
Just more niche now with Griseo if you have griseo and gear
Though I can see that
Not a pull both and leave the other one to die thing
If you don't have one, here's the other you can use
I feel like the Carole/griseo thing though was more of a
You're a good tutor
i can maybe get +2 still but im good
keilo i did it
<:KizunaBlur:419855244386893824>
Yeah
So idk nowadays
But that was before people could jet to ex and start getting legacies
Like I started 5.0 and it took me like 6 patches to get Ely as a low spender
That's a very tall order
For a new player?
It'll go much farther than hoh who could just
Not be heavily shilled after 6.0
I'd rather wait personally, but depending on kit
I'd opt for the support
Wao
Kek the leaks were right
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
all these t1 laos
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
<:pennehands:886690313937256488>
also would've proc the qte on HT there
you dodge them to proc tf
and i never got a 4:50 opener again
tornadoes kinda dispersed on me
just gotta clean up
this is the rot btw i think im sticking with for parv
this actually tilted me cause i wasnt able to do it again
oh look at this from andrius

in my eyes
but confirms 253+ is possible
really sloppy
this was
i see i see
LOL
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
you did what
i dont
we'll see
because thats literally another 5 or more seconds
but if i do that, i dont think im fast enough to catch him coming around again to ae ult
without having to double dodge there
also figured out how i got the early raven ult
which is why i think 39253
i havent optimized yet
so +5 or maybe +6 is a big jump
its +3
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
ty again
for what im doing
maybe an extra 1 second
<@148145559897636865> 
i messed up, but i think 39253 is cap
parv is fucked lol
yo
i used this and got 735, -7 lightning dorm buff though
cflare rot
nirv
bke?
for
<:worryExit:783190311987970118>
it like impales you
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
the fucking pig can pick you up
bro
lol
one sec
i think cats eye and tailpiece
meanwhile im fighting for my life
so many hot laos here
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
yeah
lol
mihoyo closed my ticket <:deadge:975652771082698782>
do it
as they all float to ex
its getting worse
<:worryDasRight:595540930212397057>
<:worryPat:587481019213545473>
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
Have you tried being faster
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Even with vil v shit, it adds up
I get like 2 a day
And pick them from armada
And dorm shop
Buy them with jades
Just like
I need cubes
200
I have like
Jeez wtf
But idk
I may pick up that after I get s0 and gear
What does 4* Ely elf get
Oh btw
I saw them in gameplay help last night but haven't seen in a while
Nice
Oh, echi still around?
Same as karto
If you're 9S there's no reason you should have a 3* elf <a:runfast:959995921305829466>
Ah
What does 4* even do
The weaker CFlare rot isn't bad but it's wild how much you can skip
I wish I had klein
I should be 800+ club <:deadge:975652771082698782>
It got a pretty small radius for any bow that isn't Elysia's
Yeah
Ic ic
And zhenyi may not be applied either even if you get the Turg
If you run into that specific problem as well
But yeah that and/or maybe you're too close to the left mech.
sometimes that one will block the weapon active for the other one
No prob
I think it's spawn order or how close they are or smth that determines the turg
But do that
Idk why it send like that
I have a vid somewhere
Or actually, one sec
Maybe move a tad farther away from the spawns?
Yeah idk that one
Oh Turg application to both mobs
For Ss2+
Because you should be killing mobs ~948-950
On spawn or?
Wdym timing?
Don't let a hacker beat you
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
i sleep
oh yumi's 9s
Yeah
Name sounds familiar
Idk who that is
I am!
pog
i also did find a dudelf rot
no wonder i fall off a cliff in p2
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
its 427D
i figured out why i cant make this work
wow
i wish
yeah
im gonna max all the sp valks eventually too
nice
o
you're ss gd right?
you probably will
it was pv
he ran ht ae idr what the third was
this is what keeby did last time i think
yeah
i played through just to practice the rest of the ref a couple times and the rest isnt too bad
mobs is fine
i always fuck that one up
the 4th dodge
its literally getting the dodge on fr
this one i linked that im doing now
super weird to optimize without bella or klein
i ended up doing ht rc pv before i found this but
i cant turg because no klein
i cant handel HT marg eden cause that needs klein
i mean HT play in general
i really should've pulled klien
nvrmind this dodge is hard again
this is def a lower D ref though
scuffed but down
okay, p1 down
is killing me
in p1
this fr dodge
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
im doing it wrong
oh nvrmind
i have 0 damage
i wanna do the ae rot but
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
we can be broke together
why is this not auto banned LOL
new cap i think
this took 3 days btw lol
ssg kyoshiro
not that it matters im just curious
or lux?
are you doing mag's rot?
keilo got fucked
yo
come to mine
wow
esp when you manage to get him in the corner and *hope* the mobs stay generally there
that jump is so tilting
honestly
that wouldn't even get me ss2
do i *reallyyyyy* need those stamps
though
fuck
i still gotta do that too
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
i dont wanna do blockade
<:cheershic:966589707746172958>
rip that strat
Glb spends more than prob 3 of the iOS servers
Idk how they don't either
Then maybe?
Use each acc to make a strongly worded statement
Prob not
<:MeiHue_lum:694766566046171166>
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
kek yeah
or just name them all the same thing
<a:KEKBOOM:914343838162780241>
but its once a patch literally in every other region
i dont understand why they can ban within hours in cn
once every patch is fucking tilting
but you hate playing her right?
i think hof does okay here
<:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
6.0 can't come sooner
Get me out of 5.9
that's great though cata
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
where's my cut
very nice!
oh
?
if you dont meet the dmg thresholds
this boss is awful up here
using vil v
yes
get me out
okay nevermind
is actually trash
this boss
i didnt look for ss
great question
for s0
there's 663 at 471D
probably
I haven't seen a RL run though
In nirv it's actually AE
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
🚑
Basic ones do though
But most are deadge
Yeah some work
<:KasumiSurprised:660032567806001181>
One farmable one not?
You think they'll do another double S rank?
~~And out of the main story~~
I do hope sk comes actually
Bring all the flamechasers back in er
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I thought this too until I played cata's phoenix
She hard carried me in MA
I miss her
If she was in
Hawk
I'd actually enjoy like
<a:Y_KEK:792821099062362122>
Dimension breaker when
If this wasn't a team based game
She would've be good
Yeah
<:FuHuaSmug:857524710223904768>
I use WC instead
<a:KallenMunch:814963878194577448>
Forgot tp and bk were a thing
I kinda went sj first
So uh
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
Can confirm
<:pepefeelscozyman:493668776684945418>
I've seen your top up
She funds everyone
<@704867526877904908>
<:kyarusmug:959737490292482148>
Prepping for 6.0
Yeah idr an arsenal bundle ever
I actually don't know
Don't those usually pop up with new banners?
Outside of the monthly bundles?
I can *kinda* read you and Ruby baban et. Al
<a:patpat:850500624630022154>
I know lol is all good
I mean I skipped mobi and sw so <:02shrug:1001147147703562260>
I'll do well but it's fucked imo
I'd rather more viable valks than 1 op valk
That doesn't change my stance lol
<a:DuckSmh:931628395656249345>
Or any img cycle
Like last cycle
Vs bosses that one valk can compete on and everyone else is fucked
The second is more balanced if more valks can compete on the same boss
Vs everyone having a shot but vil v pulls ahead
It being good for me and bad for everyone else
There's a difference between
Ew
or parv, etc
this one is pretty simple
or another husk
and honestly, this ref/boss isn't that bad
like if it was wolf, i'd refuse lol
<:slapbaka:974814370817273876>
abyss isn't even open
well
moreso that i can push my acc to the limit to see how well we can do
for me personally it just feels good knowing that i can compete
which is to say relatively speaking, for most people, probably not
at the end of the day, what's worth really mean?
worth is relative
still -2
all of that for +1
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i keep getting stunlocked
p2
i hate this
get me out
im just slow
i figured out p1
nevermind
i also literally dont know how im -2 here
and its just not showing in the game
you're pressing the button
you ever feel like
me bad
cap
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
same tbh
parv kinda kicked my butt last time
much more tolerable than abyss version though
he's paper
i just don't like husk
ew
oh right it was husk
only way pleb like me survives
or whatever the other sss boss was
did not care for tank
i think i can t100 this time
<:meihue:960024977703313439>
i guess i mald that too
gd it
i found them on bili s0
yeah, that gets you the 1.5x ult
Substar skem
this is rank skem
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
my hands arent good enough
baban do my ma
<:worryDrinkThePainAway:439477761246101524>
so 31733 47680 39(something good)
<:felisdeadhic:952156584233029672>
this person hit 733 anyway
wtf
wait it is
hmm
t0ast's ref was 680
is it?
its just a timing thing
oh, i got the 680 already
yeah
turg on wolf
i dont have a second aslaug
yeah
LOL
<:blobsalute:821139160949063680>
<a:KEKWADDLE:877622869998313502>
kekwaddle
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
if they own klein yes
~~meanwhile me, malding for 680~~
<:02shrug:1001147147703562260>
but i havent testeed cause i dont own paga M
fragile says it works
ah
full irene instead of Aslaug
cause irene will work
but i was thinking about this for your kasumi
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
idk a non vil v kosma
do you have irene
wait do you have 2 sets of turg btw
it isnt gonna work lol
had to use that strat on kasumi
i have sieg M
neither do i
<:POGGIES:916144524080857160>
Brb
Still gotta try it
But I think p2 is like
Do you have the dmg or not
In my experience
If you just go after you bust his balls he'll probably jump
Yeah
That's why every ref waits a second before they use ravens ult
So like
Roar > laser > lunge > collapse
If you're too far he aerial lunges at you
It's pretty consistent
Roar > laser > collapse tentacles
More of if he stays in the circle or jumps at you
About to try this one
For the first ref I was remembering anyway
Yeah
I'm -1 in p1
And when I'm not -1 on p1, I'm -1 in p2
Cause the thing doesn't want to use the collapse attavk
Well, AE isn't
It's not *too* bad
274 frags now
pog
~~also going from memory~~
but im probably missing the ae dodge in transistion
the 648, i know im missing a raven dodge in p1
was doing fhem's rot
this is a ref im about to try
why is every bili ref using lycoris music
idk how tf he has 696 for vil
it worked for neffr
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im slow in p1 and idk how to go faster
kosma
no no
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
648 too hard
632 too easy
<:KizunaBlur:419855244386893824>
they would buy if the acc had a ton of pulls saved up
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
same
<a:aKKChikaWhistle:748277672228159538>
is unironically that
4* ely elf from what i saw
that seems to be the trend
but is fine
im cutting back anyway
i just want the qte
not that i've seen, yeah
nope
<:Sui_Think:827222703567011910>
i cant imagine what they would do to powercreep klein actually
yeah
maybe if nini funds me i'll do it
stars im fine with 3 for klein
well, pull i mean
but i dont wanna do that again
i literally pulled 4* sirin and she's next on the chopping block
im fine with the (lack of) time left
but not worth now i think?
i wanna pull klein
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
<:meowpensivepray:814858736497590302>
it still improved me by a lot so ty
for that ref
so uh <@148145559897636865> you really need klein
What is this slander
<:KizunaBlur:419855244386893824>
I'm in pain too though
Like once
They did
I was actually not gonna play
Nini meant nirv parv
I thought for a sec
Guess I die
Oh ffs
For what
Jeez
That's like 8 weeks out
<:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
Your acc is literally ss
No more though now that HB and griseo are maxed
Yeah, same
I bought like
3 or 4
I honestly don't know
I just pick it whenever I can 

Haven't whales for metals yet
<:worryPat:587481019213545473>
Wth
How
O this is the account that posts rev reports
That was boobnya
Yeah
Lookie
Booba region fr
5.7 was the best performing patch on glb
Btw
Always max elf before ranks on valks imo
Avoiding everything until 6.0
I have seen literally no info
<:02shrug:1001147147703562260>
4* I expected
3* is actually more expensive than I thought
6.0 can't come soon enough
I'm probably gonna one run pardo and call it a patch
Hellmaru is stonks too for you
You have sw
Wait
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
But I like vil so
I'd kill myself playing raven again
I mean
Pog
So I think I just take the L
I saw spa but that's a RL thing
Lol
Ss2 with a lvl 50 pri
I don't have Ely weapon maxed
HFS kinda works but that's s2
456 rn
I know SSS PE is viable here
Because I saw A 675 s0
But that was 447D
s0?
If no mobi/nyx
Does anyone know a cope option for homu
I was messing around with sieg vs avo

Yeah actually watching this isn't too far off from what I did with FR
This probably gets me 626, which should be enough for T100
The 520
Yeah that's the one
Makes sense
I unga bunga with Turg sieg M FR
This used Eden
Wait
I believe
Shouldn't have skipped klein
I'll see how different it feels
Pog
Where are the 7T wolf refs
Oh keilo
Not that it matters cause a lot of people play late anyways
If I got demoted because autumn played late, that isn't any different than phi sniping on the last 10 minutes though?
Autumn almost fucking got me sniped
Not that I would've deserved to retain anyway
Np np
Yee LOL
Lot of people didn't play
Haven't hit+0 this patch yet
But I +100 yeah
Idk about keilo
but this fucking wolf
-2 kasumi
-1 kosma

that i can live with
<:pennehands:886690313937256488>
pleb
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
alright fuck this
no seriously where tf are the 7t ht wolf refs
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
try the nirv stages
im good lol
i didnt know you could morb
never again
<a:nodnod:821142843909210202>
all i see are DoS refs
how do i wolf with 7T
<:meihue:960024977703313439>
I don't bully anyone
Wow we're active today
Hi guys
It also fills up bar
It's sp
Keilo answered
Is this keilao's tsun arc?
But no promises
I'll try it later
Cause I'm willing
Are you trying to promo or
no hot or sw sure but
wait then how is it not dead
are you in rl?
i dont even kill my husk
<:felisdeadhic:952156584233029672>
depends
hi
it makes turg cat not random on kasumi
That's still around?!
<:pausescum:994742541482213436>
I have this
Oh
<:Kappa_lum:605646609056923649>
I only have 5
Yeah f2p here
<a:aWOGGERS:434306628288774146>
Nini fund my 2s1
I'm so dead
<a:aworryOnFire:862940123430518814>
Or was that last cycle
?
Isn't it 478
Too slow again
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Oh nvrmind ruby answered
466D just as a fuck you
LMAO
In a patch or two
Most of that won't natter
Well
But I have 2 daweis
I'd have to check
I don't know
Give it another year rebooting
Diablo lol
But gear stats will literally make or break a match or stage
Similar concept
Well
PvE and sleep
I don't though
KR gaming
Yeah
It's very competitive at the high end
Pvp
^
I haven't personally
I threw $200 and stopped
And also basically honkai bchips
Mats for pulls
Well
For pulls
And uh
That's where the money is mostly spent
For gear
Like basically honkai affixes
I mean
You unlock gear
No
<:shut:887612771477389312>
It's mostly endgame gear and stuff
Be surprised
Oh you'd uh
I was a genshin transfer
*most
Very fun game
Good call
I saw that yeah
Over 1k anyway
Well
In the thousands already there
He's about to LOL
i will still minimally maintain my account for the time being but i plan on going ultra casual and probably let people pilot on my account a lot
Not quite but
Well
Keilo
Karto quit btw
Yeah
And gpn was the best you had
He played when honkai was bad
Oh for sure
I wish I had hands
794 with s0 nyx last cycle
Just doesn't upload
641 with ss1 HT and 3* klein
He still balds
Lol
Yeah this was 5.8
Killing with finisher feels nice
SAME
It really does
Example A

That was optimal on paralyze
Before the bug fix
Though tbf to you
And I'm 4th
Like keilo and a friend of mine are T2 with the same score
Same
Sane
In my experience
By then he's already up
The active doesn't really build trauma until after
Because you want to keep husk paralyzed while he's on his knees
650 ish
But I can't imagine SSS gets more than like
Ye ye no prob!
There's probably better now though
Before people made refs
That cutmeo one
Yeah
From: Gresham mentions:nini
Is kinda low though
Now that Keeby got 641 with ss1
I literally sent you one
Like nyx side stage was worse than husk
I'm ever playing that valk
It was literally the first and only time
I DIDNT KNOW
eli wyd
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
she feels so bad
granted i never ever played nyx until today but
with vil v
it was
literally
i never want to touch nyx again
yeah
<@148145559897636865>
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
where's my torus
yo wtf
gonna stream now
okay tet
<:meihue:960024977703313439>
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
Ssg
Sounds like you're an expert at gpn timings
<:blobsalute:821139160949063680>
Yours is probably better than mine
Sure
Just got home
Ready when you are to do abyss
OwO fuck <@148145559897636865>
slapping people with cash
wow rebooting rich
still bs but w.e
its not, now that i malded a bit
just keep him on his knees and you win
but yeah you retain for sure nini
<:Sadge:886778608591466556>
you scared owo off
<@408785106942164992> slap <@385655541248163840>
i don't even wanna do mine
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
~~On my acc~~
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
im done
okie i did my 500
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
Maybe neffr did some idk
If you want whale vids look for like 
Whale in honkai
Or arkabon
Though idk if either still post
Or whatever those videos are called
Unless it was like the genshin 100% speedruns
I wouldn't expect them to
Definitely feels like it varies by elf though
According to official when I searched rq
Somewhere between 50-100
Just end me
And 50 focus cards
And I'm at 95 until guaranteed
Lol
15k
I have like
Yeah I'm not sure either
I've never owned a 3* gacha elf
That's easily 100 stones minimum
Because of so
Are you gonna 4*?
And yeah I'm fucked for hoh too
Fucking sirin
I have mats but I don't have the stones
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Chy has aponia
Also uh
Wyd
In ma? Nah
Everyone competes in ma in sols
The zoomers anyway
Be wasteful to not use
I pulled vil
I unfortunately have to
<:meihue:960024977703313439>
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
I've been saying this since 5.8 wym
<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
<a:JailedTakoWantsToLeaveButCant:869950055044505650>
Mood
Whoever you want
Ely ss2 
Fr ss2 next week
I wish
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
SK where
Only 14% lightning buff though from dorm
1538
Ye
We have the same att basically lol
Keilo wtf
<:worrySusBait:775423608506941481>
Score 54x+
I bet you can't
Actually yeah
Wait
Toxic
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
And someone hit 54x with 2* klein
Keeb did 574
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
I could replicate
If only I have klein
Yeah lol
Cutmeo?
I don't have Klein so I can't keep the damn thing paralyzed
Easy then
O
Because I don't have hands
You'll probably cap out around 48x-52x
Eh, it's fine
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
And 151x+ att?
I'm assuming 3* Klein?
In an area with bad servicem
For a week
But yeah I can if needed
I see
O
Do you not have ss HT?
Wait
I assume 9s
And Nini I only play HFS cycles
I did cata's abyss while she was on vacation
No
Right now?
I'd be willing to if you're serious
done for tonight
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
<:CB_pika_think:553556724917862400>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<@385655541248163840> if you wanted to bald it 
we all are
which is insane
cn is at 47x
really high
yes
highest HT i've seen so far
i know cutmeo on sea got ~600 or so with 9s HT
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
458D
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
well this is the bracket above nirv
people said nirv too easy
yeah
i gotta bait him to test
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
s0 aponia
9s sw team
i dont wanna
but meh
can maybe 41x
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
with turg gd
2nd try
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<:meihue:960024977703313439>
cause too late to close
it would be a score reset, right carv?
well, actually
but im really hoping they close cycle (which they wont)
probably
so i wont beat that horse
keilo covered it pretty well earlier
but uh
its so messed up
the qua one ez
the type counter ones
well
i barely cleared sides lol
i can barely do mine
you promo'd into the worst cycle
that why i said earlier
<:smug:585797266082889740>
baban
but yeah andrius was fucked
type counter weather in general in trash
LOL
yeah
i'll give it one more run
<:pikathink_hh:884675638634639400>
i cant imagine it'll be much more
since short rots
you think turg works
nini
actually
im done
no im not sniping this is my actual score
<:stronkhic:640167811469279232>
well 
you wanted to see hell
literally the worst cycle
you promoted on
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
omfg

i hate this weather
BRO
MY FUCKING HFS DIED
some poor soul ran this on the boss

<:deadge:975652771082698782>

HFS AE RC
now im stuck on the fucking tank
okay nvrmind

pog
oh a quantum stage
<:cnohno:960015364056580108>
idk why
ht was bad for me
no
i almost didnt make it
i fucking hate hate type counter
i actually cant even get to the boss
Yes
For boomer og
Neffr Ginger 
Spliff gone, Ina casual etc
Game too expensive to spend on
And devs don't care
But yeah
I did say zoomer malders
Fair
LuX karto iriya et. Al
Nope
And the zoomer malders here are fed up
All the old malders are about to be gone
I'm pretty sure no one's really gonna play
Pls forgib
Smol indie dev
Yo same
I wanna make FF pri
I think next patch may be a double pri patch for me actually
HB bad
<:meihue:960024977703313439>
Imagine they close this cycle for glb
<a:DuckSmh:931628395656249345>
You're right, you're not pure either
🧢
Mald mine too
<@704867526877904908> I still haven't gotten paid
<:huh:966619839307321394>
What nsfw channel?
Someone just sent this to my armada
I'm pure wdym
Oh did you see that Aponia cosplay btw
Just luxury
Aponia isn't even bad if you have no dps
Yeah this is PE levels of shill imo
To boost dkeys
I did a lot of raids
Jk
Slacker
Also they changed the exp system
I hit a year yesterday what
<:huh:966619839307321394>
88
What's up
Intern kun pressed the wrong button
We're on our own
No refs either <:deadge:975652771082698782>
They fucked up
Yeah
Paralyze husk in type counter weather
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
<:meihue:960024977703313439>
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
That doesn't mean I want to
So fucking tanky
But type counter weather is demoralizing
I don't *really* have any threats
You just like me fr
If there wasn't a guide made I wasn't doing it
I had to slog through that yesterday
Honestly me
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
snipers all over
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

baban nirvlao

I see
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
1 year of suffering down
but after  ely
because miyoho ain't doing shit until after ely
since you HAVE to pull if you're competitive
its annoying
all the 9s whales are about to be s0 f2p lol
yeah
styx neffr and a bunch of whales/dolphins have tickets
karto's been getting all the whales to file reports
lol
nice!
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
<:cnohno:960015364056580108>
that one is sss
wait you still have 2s griseo
idk who the other 2 are
taeyuuki may, idk
rain has ss but probably wont play
these 4
no one else  is a threat that i see
you might +100 btw
that isn't fragile's anyway
well
one of which is 3* dabber
but i can get you 2 800+ refs
lol
i cant even score 693
<:meihue:960024977703313439>
but i really dont want to bald it
really i should be pushing tank
okay-ish
and yeah heim
i only have 1 turg tb
or a 2nd turg tb
but i dont have klein
with this
my buddy got 680
im just bad

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
ss1 fr, ss pv
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
interesting
never knew hot wolf was a thing
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
for the abyss one
i was looking in another channel and found this\
oic
was it?
just awful
unexplained damage variance on mobi
<:TeriChrist:928714790271057923>
those fucking tornados
but fire supports on kosma
so i have to spa wolf
i dont have mobi
im not doing next week
understandable
im fighting for my life
nini do my ma
we both s2 ae ss0 hc
sirin diff
3-0 rn
ie. he's the reason im balding <:deadge:975652771082698782>

he's on ma t100 rn
chyara

not needed in rl
oop
not needed in na yeah
oh nice, multi played
<:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
imagine balding
idk why anyone would bald husk
probably why
heim is easy
tank's easy
well im not
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
what was it
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
pog
oh def
how's rl cata
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
though for the ult um
from what i've seen with other players anyway
if ur too close to the screen the shots don't count as going through it
and if the shots are even like slightly missing

if they don't count as going through it
they lose significant dmg

and SW naturally move slike backwards
while you're spamming her combo
it kinda does iirc
are you holding forward
nini
🙂
fun to watch
i am
nini
something is falling off
can you show me a rot
yeah ik
3* wedge isn't even the same elf
anyway
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
3* wedge?
bastet tm?
what gear
wait no
are you using ppm?
Sure
this one costs the same too lol
VE costs the same
not sure why though
<:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
you'll get em next time
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<:worrysnipe:962908598671925258>
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
you're only an hour ahead of me btw
i see i see
ah
*inb4 that's the joke*
tomorrow's monday, keilo
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
i shouldn't have looked for the context behind this
yeah
spaghetti code
wild lol
literal garbage
agreed
not that it matters with cezanne now but interesting
oh btw i just found out cosmic on senti is bugged
too  many husks
people complain about aka but i mean
i'd be fine with never seeing husk again
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
idk what about it is bugged
well, fragile says otto is bug abuse
no confirmation
thats what i've heard
and i think otto is bugged?
just dudu is easier than these ones
no, i think you'll do fine
just sleep until abyss dudu
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
LOL
i tried playing around with that
oh, pog
idr the husk one
or you're fucked waiting for the elf cd at the end
that needs 4* dabber, no?
if you're using ely on tank
well
now you have to
<:HoVWink:675105567496339456>
owo 8b will keilo ever cap a 3s boss
i believe
be there in a sec
kk
o
did someone leave nini?
well now you cursed them
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
pray for keilo guys
i'll save my ts for the next reset
all good
kk
send inv when ready
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
literally just starting
i know you havent done raid yet
<@704867526877904908>
actually
finishing that summer event finally
im here btw just ping when you find a third
raid dn
<:meowpensivepray:814858736497590302>
Well, worse case you're stuck in hell still
Leaf takes a spot
He's ss v2v
Bern will def take 3
You may actually +0
Wait
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
Yeah
Well, I mean sp problem
But same difference
That's an annoying CD to play around
Oh, yeah
Idk how tf Keeby got 792 with s0 nyx
I think you take 5
Tae and leaf
Outside of like
<:ohnojuice:928898597318185011>
also everyone just one/two runs and done
you ahve to do another rot but vil v strat is easy
so ss vil v and 3* sirin
and everyone failed math
just most require 4* sirin
no
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i actually dont know how to search between three fucking versions of the same boss on bilibili
<a:Y_KEK:792821099062362122>
idr
but i think trauma bar is harder to fill
well, nott kill hot per se
lemme look for type counter rq
paralyze and hitcount are fine
yeah
this is specifically the kill hot one
but i dont recall if anything not aponia is good on this one for us nini
i havent seen refs yet
no aponia = demote to rl anyway
its the fucking tank
this is type counter, right?

Cata do my abyss
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
~~also literally doesn't matter for majority of players~~
~~people wouldn't be mentioning SP if she was 125 in v1~~
Well, when all of myriad is 9S
<:KizunaBlur:419855244386893824>
@na players
you know 55 pri ss1 got 800 right
so uh
I remember watching him mald this lol
You might actually not demote if you literally just poke the boss
Should be fun
:)
Qua whale you gotta fight in RL?
In time for the uh
<@704867526877904908> when's are you back
Or +1
I don't have to snipe
Well

Pog
Ex fub for keilao

cmere
<@148145559897636865>
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
i'd say im not securing my own but uh
but i not playing nyx
i dont own her
literally have seen no footage
idek what qua whale looks like
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
also wth
slacc brackets
and nini was fine with it <:ghosthugscarf:782879035247034389>

i'll be surprise
lemme know if that +100
oh nini
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
understandable
ssg
<:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i havent done dkey raid yet
oh wait
you just wanted to see what nirv was like right?
why promote into qua whale baban?
Actually my experience when I played cata acc
imagine buying a valk you got for free
and i'll have 5% ice
1 more week
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
where's my pilot
ask <@385655541248163840> 
that was fun
im good
and no pri on pardo / lvl 60 pri on hfs
gpn
pardo
451 with fricking
i just did cata's
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I'll stream that one too
Yeah
KEKW
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
I will later today
I haven't even logged in
Rough
It's uh
Ohh
What's next week
I'm gonna need it before/after suffering on cata's acc
kk
Yeah I'm at work rn too
Just lmk when I can get on
kk
<@385655541248163840> do you want me to stream this time
<:KekDoggo:743295767262789752>
Watch my secondhand suffering
I can't believe I'm relearning px in 2022
I should probably stream tbh
honestly
ig irene can sub idk
and pardo has no gear since she has no turg
never seen tank with no ae
200, maybe 400 boss
but probably like
i can actually finish a side stage this time
all the good rl players are locked in nirv
also helps that uh
hell
to promo or do well on is uh
your acc isn't bad to retain on
but i'll see what i can do
im doing nini's <:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140> 
and trying to see if i can 700 with a 1414 att hfs and non ss ae
im not available wednesday this week
gonna try to 700 mine
and i flubbed
still doing your abyss tomorrow cause now i can bald mine
okay schedule changed a tad
<:A_HuSadge:814445957960826931>
Unexpected turn of events just happened
Probably tomorrow I'll bald
Idk if I'll be available tonight actually <a:bugcatdeadpat:898434851160604684>
Pog
Just gonna copy this
Idk
Should be 700ish?
<@385655541248163840> dm me when I can login
F2P like me can't keep up
Ssg
<:ohnoswipe:961788853486780466>
Isn't it just sp?
And 4* ty
Fund me s2
But a 2* elf
How do you have SS HS
So uh
600ish should be enough to retain nowadays
Lol
Rn Mimitsu is 9S and has 550
Yeah
Pretty much LOL
If you're not ss2 minimum
And HS doesn't have ranks too
It's a disaster
I think
On fire tank?
Art design for most chars is nice too
Yeah, honestly the kr voice acting has been surprisingly great
Just a warning if you do pick her up
So it should be fine
All the awakened pvp units tend to be really strong in pve
Probably will be a more pvp focused character
It counts as two separate characters unfortunately
You have to gacha the awakened
And an awakened
She has a base form
Nono
Yeah
Or good gear for said character's
Imagine having 6 weeks per awakened
And not just 3
I just hope they figure out a release schedule
Glb rn is way too fast
She looks dope though
I'm already being terrorized with no anyb
I'm not ready
Oh god
<:Fubuki_Grabby:828297136927801374>
Cmere
Pog
Sounds like a -200 attitude to me <:LiliSleep:645512767880560650>
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
can't relate
☕
ty for your hard work coffeelao
<a:patpat:850500624630022154>
understandable
herrschers i want to keep s0 on release
i'd rather ss vill v than ss hoh
yeah
well yeah
but i'm surprised so much more people pulled vill v
apparently sweaty brackets still exist
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
what is this
i wanna slacc
wow
<a:NekoPray:994156088750505994>
pog
to terrorize na
just in time for anotha one
they're stealing my t1
someone kick this hacker out of my game
health wasn't too big an issue for me
the stagger and fucking pillars are the real problem
aponia you can kill fast too if she holds still
but she isn't very  tanky imo
PE
depends on the valk
like i wouldnt pick ely if i was playing say
never again
elysia is the speedrun pick lol
<:worrykms:398047795732545536>
where linn M
she actually cant do corruption
it didnt get better than this
this was run 1
<@704867526877904908>  er done
join me
it is 160 yeah
my b
yeah what keilo said
brb
that feels like the other way around
i thought it was 200?
if i did i'd be lying
oh, here
crawling out of er hole now wasnt paying attention
for what boss?
this is stupid lol
i keep forgetting how cracked mobi is in er
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
wait how does hot do on sss tank?
<:CB_slap:850322941496918046>
<:worrykms:398047795732545536>
overworked and underpaid
yeah
there's light at the end of the tunnel
its legit awful
yeah
but its an easier 648
only 648
ss vill v is lower cap though
i dont even wanna fight kosma on my own acc
yeah
LMAO
<:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
one of my buddies tried breaking with fischl
thats why ht is supposed to break them
^
outfit debuff
kek
and max pri
bet
and thats with collapse cannon hb
you'll fnish boss at best with 3:40 on the clock
you can't, no
seems silly to ask yes
for mobi?
tonatiuh or husk
yeah nyx kosma is a disaster LOL
i dont even own this valk and i've learned by playing this acc
that works
kosma is doomed with no hitcount
er
i know people had trouble with nyx
or is any non vill v quantum bad too
since its so qua heavy
how does fr do this one
i still gotta do er <:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
ht is awful but workable
but she has neither
without vil v
this kosma fight is actually cancer
while baban has every elf but the free ones 4*
had to max jw and be
f2p like me cant compete
these whales man
even mine is 3 and 2 substars
why is her blood embrace one star
<:worrykms:398047795732545536>
one run and done everything
specifically referring to cata's acc
its nice to not worry about sweating in ma
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<:worryok_hh:770950253658636329>
you want me to stream your stuff?
about to log in
<@704867526877904908> you around?
and this is why
i just know they're playing 470D+ temps
no clue
ely made miyoho some bank
my god
in cn
90 sss in t100
jesus lol
so frustrating lol
honestly
<:bugcatdead:960024797260181514>
?
we were supposed to use carole
wait
weirde
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
whenever that is
on the next ban wave
hopefully they get booted
they're everywhere in ma
then all the hackers kinda floated up here
until 5.9
there weren't
does so much more damage with a worse team
i gotta get their gaming chair
man number 1 is really good
i know about the no ae
oh believe me
you didn't demote last cycle somehow
only +0 so far
im joking lol
not even t1
mepleb
she'd actually kill me
absolutely not
<:huh:966619839307321394>
she may lucsacc to nirv at this rate
but i'm fine with +0
if i do +500
i would need another 15 seconds
it takes too long to get sp
i actually cant finish that side stage
i bet this retains
was posting for satire
a non sss ma tona boss
if only it was uk
she doesnt have klein but
i may not need
wait wait
<:worrykms:398047795732545536>
and no one but cata will need
that no one is making
time to look for refs ig
this is actually cursed
well fuck
does transition need melee
wait
p1 is bad
mobs are bad
<:WOGGERS:434015120553803786>
mobi is about to be dead too
surely
discipline
yeah
lets try boss
okay sides is a disaster
jesus
i forgot how bad senti's sp gen was
i actually have to read the mechanics lol
ugh
why are her non lightning teams missing so much
s griseo with no gear
sss sa with no gear
s0 hs with no nebs or koo
s2 bke
its probably the same this time
somehow
lol
why do i do this to myself
so we're doing this shit again
she somehow retained last patch
oh btw ruby
i dont wanna do her ma
fuck
same
how much do you care about heph (if we get it) or fire tank
<:worrykms:398047795732545536>
im having a great time on cata's account
eh, true
pe got fgo base otto and hod
so there wasn't much qua content
nyx released with literally only couatl
tbf
vil v
wtf
but i hate playing nyx ngl
if you bought the bp in 5.1
well, s2 ae should be standard nowadays except for like zoomers
yeah
this boss is cancer
just 15k and sleep
or any non sss nyx
for any non vil v
yeah
you right
<:TeriGalaxyBrain_lum:624389598801428480>
then i could've not pulled vill v
i wish
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>

<@704867526877904908> wth is this
<:prayge:863861301310652416>
maybe carv can +100
but in na we're seeing a lot less whales tryhard since the +0 change
not that this necessarily matters
rip
i dont wanna play in general
i'll see how i feel
ss2 ely and lvl 50 pri
<:bugcatdead:960024797260181514>
i made ely pri finally

<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
gl ninilao
kek

i'll lose my t50
i personally used this

700 where
there's a rot floating around somewhere one sec
you can use 2 ppm too
o
with holmes yes
Jk I fucking lost everything
I got one
FINALLY
YES
<:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
Was hoping kalpas high rolled
I'm retired
Fuck this
there are 
but its a nice to have thing
same but sp
if anything get for future dorm buffs
to make her a priority
da doesnt get much at ss or ss1 iirc
i think bke is the better choice
LOL
yeah
yeah, confuses me too sometimes
with leftovers for elysia
she and spa are actually my best rolled valks
1532 att
im good on stigs
30k+ affix mats for her
i invested like
no mine
kekw
I don't wanna back read though
Hurts my head
During that whole lightning/fire immunity thing
Heph was never a lightning boss
Relax
Dude isn't even a retainer
He spreads shit
In my armada server
Yeah
I'm waiting for live
Ult idr
1600 > 1000 for some value
Nerfed no?
Velvet is pissing me off ruby
Kek
They won't have much abyss cycles
Historically
If they do well in ma
There won't be
If you don't have hof or nyx
Then yeah fully agree
I saw from where keilo ping
Ah, I missed that
Not hohe
Her performance
But I think the original statement was
Im not disagreeing there
This matters if you're chasing myriad or +100
So it's doable
In na
We had an s0 that retained
And yes
So RL should be fine
S0 can retain nirv tho
Yeah
If not ss
Sp bad
Support impact 3rd after all
Karto and Styx both have done it
Yeah
9S scores 821 lol
Are s0 and s1 scores rn
690-704
Ult locked if you can't one shot
Myriad is gonna be really competitive for non ss lol
It's possible for s2
Haven't seen anyone do it with s1
Yeah
Started in 5.1, I'm  zoomer
I'm holmesless
No
I have s1 PE s1 HS and I do like 3.49mil with sswords
Need ~4mil
458
Not in nirv no
Cause s0 - s3 can't one shot the core in nirv
Well
S0 and S1 definitely can't
Maybe with mkp + Holmes/newt
RL rots
Oh
LOL
Yo same
810+ possible
You'll be fine
Yeah
I'm still mad lol
He fucking failed me twice now
But then again
Probably kalpas though
I haven't even logged in
Fucking high rolled every attack
I hate ely
Jk
I hate you baban
If she loses I'm fucked
im sick rn
she got fucking smoked
FUCK
hoping it pays off

Yeah nyx and wedge are married
Wtf is he on
Is he on
Wtf
Are you the reason people are talking about her on ranged tank
not even
ie the only times plebs like me can retain
slack city
So it's super slack
Most of na is playing tof right now
Also ngl
What was score?
Even I did mine
Slacker
Lowkey same
Based
Pardo can't fight
Nini wyd
Imagine
Yeah this
Funny cause it's literally the same gameplay
Pog
But I don't regret
No
Relatively speaking
But
Yes
Honestly
Compared to how s0 played
Got on myriad
And call spending quits
So I'm gonna pull s0 hoh and 3* Ely elf
Was when I pulled
Around this
With pre-farmed cards/crystals
Like 4-500 usd
So for that specifically
A lot more
Was like
Cause no fire elf
So from no elf to 4*
And I had to pull sirin
170 pulls for SS0
So not addiction
A lot
But SS was like
Partially
I couldn't tell you
It's an answer I have to think about
Honestly
Instead of ss
s0 Ely
I am
~~Check myriad scores rn~~
Nope
Do my couatl too
This is fourth in my bracket lol
407?
What's RL D rn
I think it'll mellow out around 400
Probably not
In rl
Imagine KR temps
Not at this D no
Construction paper
RL is like
Depending on the cycle
Ngl
Was what atmoer said
I can see tha
Yeah
I've never been in agony
I wanna know what it's like
Oko got the Best hands in detroit
Cause smh
This is why frann kart nova etc came lol
In nirv
LOL
Yeah
LOL
So I had to see
They were trash talking oko
They're killing me
I think I'm gonna leave cn discussion lol
He's about as thick as one
At 450+D
People just do
Idk why that's the nickname
Couatl
I'm one of the haters
Always low scores across the board
Yeah people hate cow
I hear she does strong damage outside of ult
So yeah I don't think it'll be a concern
Didn't see it
I woke up an hour ago lol
Ah
Since when
Oh, is it
Why do people not wait for v3b
Sp bad is velvet
Just thinking out loud
Yeah, I don't either
Oh, fair
I'd prefer people not make decisions off of a gut feeling or non confirmed information
Lol
Why get vill v if no supports
I mean the obvious answer he already answered in his question
Idk if depressing or hilarious
That's
Ruby wyd
And velvet coping hard in my armada server
Now I'm seeing it
Wait
The demoted to agony one
They already made that meme again
I mean
Bug abuse lol
imo
marg eden  handel FR
i'm guessing you're running fr eden pv then?
or what team you running
all i had to do was pause gaming
i wasnt letting it hit long enough no
didn't proc cosmic the second time
and i was messing up with hos anyway on the second ult
the feathers while hos is in ult continue to hit the boss
it was sswords stacks <@385655541248163840>
i figured out my problem
ty for your hard work
one sec
?
wanna see the run im doing
actualy
wth
fucking senti is doing more critting than pe
i hate this valk
this is turning a 664 into a 616
imagine pe critting
lol
nirv & crit emblems
4 fucking times in a row
so much
i hate this
bet
so 700
500\
so im hearing
gotta get that 200
fair
didn't care last ma
im actually trying this time lol
nini wyd
just under 111k rn
pretty sure im guarenteed a t100
i'll borrow your ranks too
so inconsistent
PE is
i hate this
MA
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
go for 200
yikes
yes
3010
it is
Bad
<:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
Is that a 0
Wait
The hot run isn't that mald tbh
Not good
She kinda is
At 450D+
Yeah r1 enough
Basically this
LOL
If I s3 I'm gonna ss
I'd go s1 for breach and that's it
I can barely do ONE ss
Jesus
~~not as lewd~~
Too expensive <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Spending less in honkai
No
But idk I see how I feel
I could do $15 a month
Def not the whale bp
Unrelated but I think I go full f2p after I get Ely herrscher
because he was mad about v1
heph was never a lightning boss
he was tilting me the other day
bro
gameplay help beginner help and cn gameplay discussion
i peek every once in a while
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
fun times in beginner help
yeah
displayed like a chart
another guy there is asking for data
but scroll up a bit
that too
so i dont necessarily blame imy for not
i feel like if you're so adamant about something
you should find the data and rates yourself
idk
but the game literally tells you
i could see it if it was like fgo where i dont think there's pity
if you wanna peek
ty nqn
:DeadFischl:
they kept asking to show the data
it does
a player didnt believe banners had 10 pull pity
where braincells go to die
I love maincord
true
or other games
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oh
i thought it was
no
just your acc
understandable
the content creator crybbals?
what brought you back?
i actually wasn't that far off if you were consistent
which is better overall imo
on their up banners
to pulls valks with
exp cards
i will be in 2 weeks
LOL
im not even a full year yet
higher wow
i bet he's at 1032
how long you played?
carv
~~jk dont ban me~~
boomer
<@416445660443967491>
like say
and talk to boomer players a lot
i just watch the vids of old honkai
i started 5.0
i wish
idr
7?
kinda the same up until 4. like
6?
and still be competitive
pre BK (3.9) you could afford to skip
everything new is meta now
def not now, no
that would be 2019 honkai
yeah
you get into exalted too fast
impossible now
actually
instantly competitive
then blew it all the next few patches
i heard they saved like 100k crystals the first year, no banners and coped
prob not
i wonder if elesei's route is still viable
to a non whale
before they sss their valk but 2* elf
it can annoy people but i dont want to give whale advice
and what your goal is
its why i ask first nowadays what level spender are you
unless you're a boomer like rino or ryuu
if you're asking nirv questions i assume thats a given
im ngl i forget f2p exists
i kinda assume everyone is monthly + bp
yeah this
i realized why as soon as i skipped
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
clearly they know whats right
wdym
they're all nirv retainers
i'm so mad
by the time i finished ft
sss ma exists
ely nirv only valk, ft stonks
skip paganini
cause it bit me hard once i started playing more
but i hate that advice
thats kinda viable
well technically
if you only wanna rl retain or 2% ma
i thought i was trash lol
50 pri is like
the equivalent of poking the boss with a stick
and how rotations actually matter
i remember being shocked at how much harder MA was
same but PE
not fun
HFS AE HB
LOL
Hitcount clock was mine that patch
yo
i know i did on 5.5
i dont remember either
fun times
i remember when 394D was a nirv temp
434D RL
477D Nirv
i'd actually retire
imagine cn temps
i think is the problem
no one really wants to play 450D+
well
her bosses used to be super competitive
guess everyone's tired of hfs
yeah
i love rl
still t1
logged 2 runs and quit
i didnt even do mine really
LOL
me neither
based on how they get stronger the more enemies there are?
isn't homu a nyx/mobi boss through and through?
id have to make the pri
i can do tank
yeah
0 firepower this patch outside of fgo
im pretty sure im in the latter
yeah
understandable tbh
but for people its worth to not have to ever play nyx again
im so excited to be the only non vill v in nirv
i saw
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
no one will pull vill v
but accurate state of NA
stolen
its like the opposite for me lol
<:huh:966619839307321394>
have you seen the frost queen skin
and idr but there's one more
hov
villv
why is every new valk have that pose
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
its cheaper to shell out 20 bucks a skin 
vs 300 bucks for all patch packages + bp
the relaxing gacha
i cant whale 2 gachas
set me free
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
This
From here down
Was what I meant <@148145559897636865>
Esp after servers kinda died
And yeah not a fan of tof from what I've seen
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Can confirm it was pricey
nini fund me
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but thats pricey
i might too
honestly
That happened to me with 7T
Reopen shop or reload game
Np np
fuck <:deadge:975652771082698782>
i'm in nirv this cycle
i keep forgetting
oh shit
in general pretty accurate too
for nini's bracket? yeah
thats pretty accurate
actually
what  was it like in nirv
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<@385655541248163840> we T50'd
wake me up in 6.0
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
jk
slacker
end me
same but no nyx
1425 att hfs
s0
just gaming chair
wym
lmk if i retain btw
coffee pilot my abyss too <:deadge:975652771082698782>
just read blustorm chat, i wasn't very far off
so he can't do those rots either
and he's s0 ae
so he has to prefarm
his raven doesn't have sp/s affixes
i bet you thats why
actually
it could be farming sp
different
drastically
his opener is
yeah wow
brb
not hitting tank?
anyway, not a bad idea to copy the foundation of the run ig
she has breach at s1
this is also an s2 hfs ref
like literally used the first ref i found and called it a day
i was just copying chy's ref
i see
well, yes
that doesnt necessarily mean qte off though

~~havent seen iriya's run so idk how he does it, gomen~~
wth
where's your hfs qte
also
idr what raven bow does either <:deadge:975652771082698782>
so no need for bow there
he turns red as soon as he ends transition
oh btw
or just for valk on field
i actually dont know if thats 5 universal sp
why aren't you in tiles
wait
ah
also didnt need the double bow there
just rush to boss spawn, mixed > black > ult
you dont need to black >mixed > black
if you're doing snap
opener is off
well
sp rng
oh, fuxi
can probably guess
but actually lemme watch vid
nini was 1425
whats atk?
ssg coffeelao
oh, you are in nirv this cycle
yeah
2 snaps puts you at 60% here
then you'll lose hp as time goes on
thats why people snap first in abyss/MA first
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
now i die on cow
i should've been in this cycle
if you hit? but either way
its a tight window
i couldnt fit a white > mixed > black if i tried
yeah
damage me thinks
QTE hurts
i wanna say sp
or just easier to get into a rhythm

but im not sure actually
but i'm lazy this cycle
snap can be more dmg
because hfs loses hp and gets buffs sooner, i think is how it works
or rl? this cycle
you in nirv?
<@524782681389793280>
poorly
i did abyss for nini
idgi
it kinda is
actually, thats one thing i couldn't get into
i've tried a couple times but
i actually have 0 focus 
yet somehow i find light novels enjoyable
burnout is real
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im lucky if i do 1 in a month now
gone
i dont miss the days where i used to binge watch 1 cour a day
so much time just
i enjoyed both a lot so i think you will too
issok
thats as far as it goes
is the nature of the problems the mc runs into
the only real similarity
it is
i did say ish
if you've seen bunny girl senpai its similar ish
ngl
i recommend it
though it takes a minute to get into it
i didn't watch it until i hit like 20 lol
still holds up imo
i was thinking monogatari
they made those
oh shit right
they know how to do dramatic moments
its the shading for me
i used to be a big fan of studio shaft
i love kyoani only because of haruhi
not that they're bad, i just really enjoy haruhi
usually thats the giveaway for me too
if the eyes are far apart
well
bones is actually surprisingly solid
the guy who made angel beats for example
creators too
srs, i just see bland stuff
show
tbf
all do now
pretty new too
from what i hear its pretty good
i never paid attention until i hit nirv
true i think
but yeah zetsu says tka
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
fr ss2
ely ss3
same
imo
bn isn't bad
anyway
idk if you remember those lol
and griseoughh
elymeihuasegs
they were also
they never have a good name
its tka btw
will that be all of your dorm valks?
Idr which one has the wild names
Or Arc
I feel like that's TKA
Could be a waifus player
Ig no one wants to play 450D+
All of NA shows up on Kiana cycles
Usually
I could've been nirv gaming this cycle
Sleepy bracket though wth
~~still should've been 670+~~
4 or 5 is secure
But I think
I feel a snipe coming
1.5-2k
Genshin is like an extra 1k for c6
I mean
That's only $1500 usd
they have a flagpole in the yard
i'll ban you
~~in sols~~
.mute <@704867526877904908>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Set me free
I want a pilot too
Was pointing out the rank and gear
Yeah
Insane skill gap
He's been playing competitive for years
Wait actually lemme find vid
It was for er
0 gear tho
Yeah
But that's it
Maybe Keeby for memes
Well
Personally
I haven't seen any s0 Aponia in nirv
I'd be shocked
Def not in global
Imo
There wouldn't be an uproar if she was after herrscher
It's just where she's placed on the schedule
4* sirin is cracked
Still mad lol
Should've been at least 670
I'm in RL this patch
Oh, that's not my acc
And I misplayed a bunch but got tired of it
I'd have a chance cause everyone else would give up
Please
NA about to too
Couatl
Cow
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Yet malded on ninis for like an hour
A few runs and left
I didn't even do mine lol
<@704867526877904908> so you'll remember to do abyss?
That's good
no problem
🙂
do abyss tomorrow
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
have fun
p1 toward the end and p2 is actually
really really sloppy
but whatever, thats probably a 675+ if i actually played well
also had to step away for a bit so thats why i paused
its the same run
logged off btw
i fucked up a bit but whatever lol
i recorded, i'll upload in a bit
is this good enough
<@385655541248163840>
Whew
Wait am I doing hfs
Me bad
I can't even save mine
Guess I'll pilot
I get home in like an hour
Nini you can do better I believe in you
Wtf
Sure! In like
8 hours
It's sleepy in rl
But yeah I can def try after
Imagine having good affixes
I'm not even 1400
Higher than mine
I can try it after work
What's HFS att
Hmmm
That was eris I meant yeah
Oh I can't read
Not happening
652 with Ely in nirv
A 9S competitive whale in my armada got like
LOL
That's not ss ae
Oh you're using Chy's ref
Jk but what ref you following
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
Have you tried doing more damage
unless its like HoD or RPC or smth
but generally 750+ is pretty solid
i bald
since uk
but my standards its okay
it is
well
but sub 1400 attack
you can get 800+
nah this is bad
nqn sucks
i give up
ig i'll bald a bit
whats a good score for this D
ughhh
rl too easy
frann solid
yeah
NS and VA were my first SSS valks
Hor is still used for Benares lol
Sos low value nowadays
DoR maybe can use with HB for extra dmg but I wouldn't make it now
Yeah I agree with ruby
Except himeko
All of mine are SSS now
Listen
I farmed a lot
Idk
I probably have more
Jk
Whale
I legit don't remember
I'm pretty sure I did something similar lol
A3 is /= masters RL so
A2 is pretty cozy
LMAO
Ohhh
Probably, I feel like sea D pre exalted was always higher
Or something?
Isn't q manifold like 300D now
But congrats!
No pros here
There are absolutely
I don't remember the last one
I remember the middle one
I don't remember this
I must've used it in a blur then
Are you serious
I don't think I've ever seen that lol
Is that a ch selector
Oh
Wtf
Oh
So useless to me
There's a selector?
You'd already have her
Maybe if you appreciated her
holy shit lol
is myriad cutoff
394
and it'd be more accurate
replace the model with a bullfrog
they could literally
never seen that glitch before
i just thought this was funny
im in rl this cycle
~~not my video~~
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
its so dumb lol
nirv is chonky
idek
fuck this boss LMAO
i sleep then
oh
i know them
wait what is gweb using
wao
i just got back lol
wolf is just
universally hated
probably 1 1person
zi did it with VKE
Thats the actual score
SIXTY TWO
lol
i fucking hate the wolf
1 run and done
i finally did my abyss
SEA is a LOT larger than NA
Also gotta factor in
No time for pleb like me
Dudu taking all her time
So limited on my end
I haven't seen any Spinas personally
Haven't looked at/through refs though
Since when
On type counter?
I'm guessing RL because ain't no way someone's crazy enough to use spaina in nirv
~~the answer is sleep~~
Wtf
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Just Bennett
I mean
999
Last time wasn't type counter lol
I warned you
I need m
I'll actually take that
Jk
Whale
Ma stonks
2 tb
Wym
She was just in 5.3
Ew
Shui?
What was 5.9 again
Every new valk
Oh so like
Not good
That's
Jk I don't even own her
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
I can come and make it 3
Imagine have paga
Who still has a Michael set
Wtf
For ER
FT set
I thought that was
Yeah maybe
That's a thing?
I hate/love her
Yeah
4/4 PE
Like me
Better than no pri and no poe/dirac
I mean
Mine is 1/4
Can I borrow
Same
Wake me up in 6.0
After rpc
Slacked super hard this patch
I haven't even seen mine lol
Depends on bracket rng
You'd think so
They have a literal money forest
But it's hard
She can
Well
SpA can't compete on type counter wolf
So idk
I'm at 1880 trophies
Whatever, I refreshed my nirv emblem
Expect na to play
If it's an Aponia boss
Retaining score in my bracket was 764
Lol
No
<@385655541248163840> did you live?
type counter wolf is a bit of a pita
jk ily nini

Welcome to my world
Pretty good at ma yeah
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

At the cost of performance
Better idea
Do bans but let them use the valk

With new ppl piloting
Either quit or faded
Yeah
Compared to like keeby

Skill gap at that point is insane
Yeah

Mine has no branches
I need his money tree
Genshin FGO honkai and other gachas
Too much
Razer ninjas is though
Even karto isn't that whale

<:kianasweat_hh:879534573384523836>
<a:nou_hh:833500436526530570>
oh god why
whatever im done
this is tilting me
really wish there was a consistent way to get the very first sp pack
which isnt important here
true
its the same debuff as chains yeah
but doesnt look to impact clock
probably for slowing down the clock idk
and they use pillar/chains a lot
trying to follow this ref
just the general question
no
im guessing no
or no?
does debuff on shell get applied to core?
how does p2 work
also
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
<:safe_hh:710968174887305311>
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>

Gl gl <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
Full cez still feels weaker
Apparently

Using crit dmg emblem: 5% crit dmg

SI: 1431 atk Cez TB Beet M
2.83 sp reduc%
4.55% Crit dmg

HS 1335 atk full sswords

.7 sp/s

PE 1416 atk 4.84% crit dmg
Valk stats
And beet M yee
0 dmg with myriad
I do like
Crit emblem
Unless there's a rot that needs it
Generally I like to keep QTE off for most valks
QTE off
Brb*
I wanna say 3
But beb
6.1 coping
In *late* 2022
Why does BKE have a new boss
Even without dabber
Launched into fucking orbit
I ran into that a few times too
And it fucking goes invisible during the slashes
Don't you just love when you're in ES
YO
LOL
Is awful
SP farming
Too much crit bald
I got it once and didn't bother trying again
<a:bugcatdeadpat:898434851160604684>
Yee
I somehow lived on HoD and the last boss
Gonna have fun on nirv rpc though
No shot I catch up
4 SS+ BKE and 1 9S PE team
I'm stuck at 642
Yeah that's the bar
680 retain in my bracket rn
Same
Oh, you demoted?
you'll be fineee
The highest s0 I saw was 696 before this
Fhem is a god
<a:bcaMoney6Rich:592612557815283738>
keilo about to be
~~have railgun fund you~~
<:HimekoDead:632367996404498452>
wtf
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
~~s0~~ s1 cant compete anymore
keilo fund my s2
only -1s lost from cap
but jesus
yeah, pretty much
forgot they fixed it
ohh, true
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
ye
then griseo dropped and so did that strat <:deadge:975652771082698782>
at some point
it was used for HoD
no
5 times starting 5.5
what
needed it a grand total of
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i havent touched that elf in like 3 or 4 patches now
leveled up my blood elf to help
i literally
that spa run on dxy in awful
nvrmind yes it is
is that the kiana T dante mb run
handel on hot
margrave on eden
i really should pay attention
LOL
and was wondering why ae felt like trash this time
keilo i tried blockade with same team
<:kekDoggo:775708084051378217>
i forget why that was supposed to be bad its been so long
i feel like there was an uneven floor in a few of those maps
that ruins it
because there's always one random enemy or hit
that tilted me so much
jk i dont even play anymore
NO
i hated the fucking zoo
ptsd
oh god
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
split damage is a thing in genshin?
but starters gave me chong and diluc so
yee i've seen him
would;ve def used if i got
and he's c6 on my acc
i've ever touched razor
i dont think
relatable
unless you ran like razor or eula or something
thats not even that bad
i was gonna until i read the beginners guide
yes that
i already maxed white tiger or whatever its called
i cant bring myself to do the stun
<:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
that would be crazy talk
not like you'd ever want to turn it off
its op ofc
people need to be bonked
bruh wow lol
second to Hannah M
most op stig in the game
<:evilPatrick:959721545712934932>
pool is way more diluted
they'll be okay
with people hitting 80 in 60 days or less now
^
runescape was brutal though ~~from what i've seen~~
people usually did one or the other
fair
did you play maplestory too?
yeah, where loadouts?
with a 60 foot pole
stay away
never touched diablo
destiny
but thats the grindiest thing i've ever done
like i thought d2~~ raids~~ grind in general was bad
i hated the artifact grind
*plays consistently*
it probably is?
i havent played genshin since...
2.1

so im way out of touch now if thats true or not
lol
where?
but good
crazy
big lao <a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
like
👀
its okay im going back home soon anyway
<:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
and multi is trolling me
and bern
magery is still down there
kill me
i prob will too
<a:kekwaddle_hh:875055031710273546>
Yeah idk either tbh
Whel
Equinox severance
The 4 big slashes
Also when you can't ES after ult
Otherwise sp doko
Both
But uses nebs here
Still dead
LOL
No Paganini but I have SSS
Yeah I saw that rot from fragile
Listen
Eclipses mine
But his damage just
I helped him figure out the rot
This is my buddy
For s2
I have a ref nini
<:meihue:960024977703313439>
Me I'm at 620
SS < can 665~
Mhm
No no, SpA on this boss
I tried and I just
Lack dmg with 1500 att
It's viable but everyone is gonna use their SS+ BKE up here
People aren't gonna run SpA lol
Yeah
If you can do a boatload of dmg in 8 seconds
Aslaug is a thing too
Turg griseo is a thing?
Sometimes PE sometimes BKE
But BKE wins this time
Depends on D
Inputs don't work half the time on this stage
On this boss
PE is fucking miserable
Mobi could probably 750
Wow, no one liked this boss
hicentral
hic is the server its from
too busted
<:felishohohic:957243523655139378>
make it 1 point too
ofc keilo knows about sniping
havent broken 600
i still
true lol
road to 450
448
LOL
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
just pretend i did it again
<:OH_peepoblush:667784430080884767>
clearly
i havent seen anything lol
i went right into abyss
also i didnt know it was blockade this week so ty
basic team
i just used HFS AE RC
im serious  <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
idek how i did that last time
LOL
yeah fuck this im using SpA
Edit: I'm literally trash now i cant 1 rot the mobs <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
when he remembers to play
ryuuji is pretty good
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
bruh
no way i retain this bracket anyway
tenma magery bern theo multi
so im gonna -200 and call it a cycle lol
yeah, retained the last 2
unless you can 3 rot boss sp and score drastically falls off a cliff
nirv
no paganini
its like impossible to find an s0 ref for PE
ranks though
i havent looked at refs yet though
but s1 pe does not feel good
gonna try SpA
its bk or die up here
this is disgusting
same
honestly
i can if you need a third
I'll do your abyss
Keilo do my ma this week
<a:OH_peepoExiting:667852864915374109>
<:BlurryEyes:849445681223303238>
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
i probably will
finally have enough trophies to skip a boss
where HT
isn't she next best
they'll adjust the schedule accordingly anyway
they might this patch
isn't heimdall bugged?
tank if they ever bring that back'
yeah
mech would keep bke alive though
yeah thats why i said doubtful lol
but hopeful
doubtful
also hope this herrscher is psy
i hope i never see that thing again
the last mech we got was SpA right?
i forgot that was a thing
LOL
aka yeah
ely and assaka
and they dont show up often
ranged too yeah
bio ice
which is what, assaka?
aponia had sushang and a THIRD clock made for her
sw filled a niche we  didn't really have a need for
send inv
sure
all you use is woggers
yeah LOL
pri
outside of the regular retainers yeah
i get headaches if i go often there
yeah
its funny there
such bad takes
wym you dont visit the copium rehab centre
they hang around maincord a lot yeah
that's where i notice them anway
Ruby you think she's gonna be big in NA?
I was looking at cn earlier and she is
not popular there
thats a miserable experience
yo
you'll prob promo this cycle too
i'll give you that
sometimes its weird yeah
never fought nirv couatl though, but never felt bad in rl
moreso than say, press ult to win HoD 
or most other bosses you can just bruteforce
more technical imo
abyss couatl isn't that bad i think
well, targeting still but way easier
sw is literally press a to skip bs and win
its so bad
baban look
brb
in nirv anyway
its funny its so bad
yeah nyx is so cursed against ely
though her buffs dont really do anything either
she might be put in the shop though
*New* Farmable S rank
oh you meant vc
wait what
tp fr and ely were right after so makes sense
yeah
or seems to be
its like every 9 patches or so
if 6.1 isn't farmable S rank valk
yeah im gonna outrage
<a:bugcatdeadpat:898434851160604684>
that explains it, that i do remember
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
why do i remember 6/6?
im a  kek it is 8/8
yeah i cant remember if 6/6 or 8/8
for 20 frags
9 AL
same lol
iirc 6/6 per frag
6/6
wait
yeah
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
oh god
sure
im done balding lol
story time
im just hoping i dont get sniped in abyss
i cant 946 though, so i cant catch keilo
<:meowpensivepray:814858736497590302>
<@148145559897636865> ty for reminding me about LuX ref
<:Fubuki_Grabby:828297136927801374>
im coming for you nini
idk
but i think 600 may be possible
literally breaks it
no klein
i just tried this
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
needs avo though
yeah that run needs SS
if you have LE 893 is still possible
carv do you have ss
sn scythe
path to archeron
i dont own vikrant or 11th though
yo same to everything here
6% wont usually make or break you in rl
idk about ma though
if you play in nirv yes
eh
6% damage though
LuX is too good
but def saved if i feel like it later
i dont wanna go back in there though
yeah i saw lux's run yesterday when riku was balding it
<:fpsscumhic:959744049546416148>
ah, rip
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
wym you dont enjoy the perfect lines for mech or bio
is that doable at 60 fps?
affixes
and i dont own sk so thats extra lightning dmg missing
yeah
but 60 att missing from most refs is way too big
yep yep
played around quite a bit yesterday
i have 1499 LOL
thats my problem
yeah, just positioning so both mobs get turg and thats it
what's your hot att nini
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
or the damage
because i dont have the brainpower to figure out turg eden
where im coping with 740 pardo
<:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
no shame, kyo way too good
either ss1 or sss
with hot i'd be shocked if not
ye
dude is crazy
i saw what kyoshiro did
o
in  nirv?
idk if ss0 but the skill/affix/dorm gap is wild
this got 798 in my bracket (not me)
ss0/ss1 yeah
its crazy
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
With Pardo anyway
I'm gonna be done soon though 
I think I'm capped around 74x
It's awful
now i can get my 8% phys
finally
<:kekDoggo:775708084051378217>
It's slightly more damage
Cancel that's getting patched in 5.9
Yeah same
More dmg per rot for now
Better than more rots
At this D
You don't need cf
Yes
Nice job
Pog
I prob cap out around 715ish
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
Gogo
<a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
<a:patpat:850500624630022154>
1980 for 60 frags (assuming awakened)
They would
But those frags would cost bchips
I'm gonna <a:OH_peepoHang:805687567181152287>
If they have frags
No more Mei frags
Also I'm ss1 <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Oh I mean
I do all 3 finality runs
I'm just not happy about it
Jk but it takes forever <:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
We just
Pretend it doesn't exist

Me bad

I can't even help myself <a:bugcatdeadpat:898434851160604684>

See I don't want to ask whale advice

painpeko
i thought about sss pv first but i really need the extra sp on hb
and i hope 6.0 is ice so prepping
<a:OH_peepoFade:850435927025123351>
and unfortunately pv is nowhere near 3s so its fine
i can delay sss hb by a week
but desperate times
yeah
bad value though compared to aster from pins
lol
yeah
i know im awful
4500 aster yeah
nvrmind I ~~sold my soul~~ used asterite <:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>

You want fun and alternatives in honkai?
never again
ref had qte on for hos and was evading > spear > qte into pe so fast (and fried quality cause no bili account)
i didn't see that they had evade
looked like hs qte > spear > pe qte
then figured out its lance > shield bash for the missing 2 sp
figured it out finally
Pog
cursed af LOL
yeah
can be dead on bracket generation
s0 esp
this is why im fine with changes
big time
top 4 were 885+
i retained with 868
you would've sniped me
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
nvrmind thats s2 at least
and try it
i'm gonna get baited by that pe ref
ily
carv
WTF
<@148145559897636865>  I LIVED
I'm missing meme 6s and sk

Though everyone got baited into SS+ with the new key
HT is super old
Tbf
Just end me
Yeah some unknown 9s is in mine too
Why so many SS/SSS PE in NA wtf
I'm in 5th with 868 lol
It's stupid
I gained 7 points because LITERALLY every single hit that needed to crit, crit
And crit big
It's fine lol
Retain in 5.9
Impossible so
Your bracket is like
So relatable
It's fucking BALDY without SSS Griseo
LOL @Fuck the PE QTE

i meant impair
oh my b
brb gonna test
yeah, i just know hos impair
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
griseo or ch work i think so you're fine
HoF sounds good
I dont own mobi so gl on that one <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
back in the old days you had to be creative
no one thinks for themselves lol
yeah its either hard meta or trash
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
that sequence drops me to 4:58
my hands are slow too
im stuck at 98
how tf they getting 100 sp
the ref i linked is literally impossible
dude
evade > weapon active
he does
but someone better than me can confirm
i personally didnt do well with mei M
aslaug M is more damage if you need it
its extra succ for sp pack
you'll bald more is all
its so frustrating
same tbh <:tericross:902580093304586320>
first try
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
wtf
glgl <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
i did rino's strat on heim
heph
no me
i can't break 840
<:kekDoggo:775708084051378217>
Smh
Cata do my ma abyss and er
I'm too slow for 893 on either boss
Keilo how do I get better hands
.
But +16 is nice (nirv emblem + dkey)
1378 att is not fun
I know I am


s1 - s2 HFS can 0s heim now
Oh guys
I can live that week I think
Pog
Ye
Or psy?
Is Benares no element?
I wondered if it would show up
There's the signature doom per patch
And unga bunga heim
Or LE instead
I'm gonna use this as well
This ma is looking fun ngl
Griseo can do this too wtf
Wait
I hate formatting
Brb
Didn't pay attention mb
You have 110 sp
Why not just le hs pe
Wait
Even Ely kills
Why does literally a gust of wind kill heph
Too many options
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Oh SpA works
?
You're s0 or SS PE
Cause HFS on heim is an easy 893
Or vice versa
I'm looking for runs too
You can prob PE heph and HFS heim or something
Weakened enemies take 35% tdm
Yeah applies weaken
Brb
It applies weaken iirc?
Silver reaper I think
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
AND THEN SHE WAS SO BAD
YO
SAME
Jeez
Is that fs in 2022
Kek true
The in game recs I mean
Which is slightly better than before but still bad
Because I wouldn't know about gear
If I was a brand new player
Low-key I  would've done the same
L OL
But yeah
The bonus dmg at s1 doesn't matter 
SS sp gain is stonks tho
She's a fan favorite so I was thinking because of that
Idk why but 6.4
6.4
SS would be the standard
Imagine if she ever got an adv
All the SS sentis coming out of nowhere too LOL
Need to see someone else ~~suffer~~ try
Ping us if you do
Fr LOL
Idk about ss rots but non s3 is just pray for crits
Crit balding
It's literally
It's not
I got xored (#1 Yumi fan) icefire wardy ginger and tka (elymeihuaagehao)
Oh you're in donuts bracket
<:worryCoffeeSus:778719399745945651>
Can't compete
Why so many SS+ PE in NA
<:AyakaDead:829993657842008095>
And I have 2 SS PE 3 SSS PE
I'm pretty sure I'm capped if not close to it
Yeah
I hate this
<@148145559897636865> can I borrow your PE this cycle
<a:patpat:850500624630022154>
pog
yeah idk how they did that
not my acc or my play but this is stupid
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
go for 920 <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
<:felishoryshet:959980144263581696>
then +5 basic
then pop clone for +15
then +15 from senpri
unless im missing something
abyss gives 90 starting sp, no?
wdym
<:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
Yeah
LOL






Fun HoD stuffs
ew
this has me malding for a while lol but it worked
ty <:meowpensivepray:814858736497590302>
but marisa did your hw if you wanna push to 50
btw idk if this was posted
<a:ameowsweats:394091544065474560>
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
If I ever get past 42 I'll try
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
<:POGIUS_hh:887701696099278898>
Without HT
Wtf
An actual use for SA lol
no reason why ex should take 5-7 months for new players
though i think its an overall good change since everyone is getting pushed into a3
1-2 months
yeah its fucking insane
i havent seen the ss rots
senpri not enough then?
ohhh
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
SpA can't keep up
why
LOL
no but seriously i just did 764 lol
ssg
you mean 876
no one but i'd believe it
<a:patpat:850500624630022154><a:dalao:795864124907061369>
thats cause you scored 850
makes sense
its cause we were abused by the nun last cycle
griseo op
but this is stupid lol
non bk ones
yeah there's near 900 scores in a3 as well
wtf
just bullying rl LOL
(ignore their not owning anything)
from a friend
ye
it was the old bke hs sa team
tbf
felt lol
in RL
there's an 851
<a:patpat:850500624630022154>
keilao prob does 1 run caps and never needed to see
but
that should be the only variance
.
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
But yee magty probably would make it easier
(I don't own mobi or magty so assuming)
Not mine btw
At that att
That should 786, maybe 840 I think
Rood
OwO slap <@704867526877904908>
It never works for me
So much
I hate the evades
And the run is pretty much dead (if you're trying to cap)
You won't have enough sp to ult/one shot the core otherwise
Yeah this
i'll join
kk
whats up
not atm
so low hp helps
and since i have s1+
if she dies she gets a lot of sp back
just gives HP
no need to lvl M
recording got scuffed but thats the gist of it
lvl 50 sakura pri
yeye
764
if any BK's come in my bracket im dead
yeah im stuck using SpA this cycle lol
seems fun this cycle
i wanna triple support this boss too but no pag <:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
i wish i had bk
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

<@148145559897636865> are you proud of me

impossible game
<a:aWorryFuming:636089809219092480>

yeye realized as i typed
i meant for ch exclusively, not ch hs
ahh
or how does impair work?
you can refresh the impair through charged right?
<:sushangfrownarms_hh:914600710019088384>
hi cata
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
imagine not pulling ch as your first s rank
idr
i think thats the 5.1 one
only for sss bosses to exist
im so close to sss delta
im so annoyed by that actually
i remember that video lol
rank skem wtf
no wonder she feels garbo at s0
is that the SS?
LOL
FR
YO
<a:whalepat:899061677583122432>
you'd prob be the only s0 in NA if you didnt commit
ah
what happened to f2p mode
or tomorrow?
v3 tonight right
<:AyameWhat:766220416309526548>
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
doesnt she have sp problems though, rn anyway?
granted im not pulling her either but still
i feel like she isn't gonna be as hard to skip as ppl think
i found this in maincord
oh that reminds me
or aponia <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:WorryPat:954328661270618122>
from what I've seen (glb pleb)
yeah SpA cycles are really competitive there for some reason
i think the only time i've paused in abyss is houdou SpA
is that sw gameplay
<:pausescum:994742541482213436>
for me ma was literally
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
~~though i agree~~
@.keilo you hear this
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
nvrmind im out of attempts
<:AyakaNoU_Nominno:867913208881610752>
gotta find a hod run now
me pleb
ty ty
<a:catvibes_hh:833500453181849630>
no jst either
my first 893
yooo  <@148145559897636865>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I was thinking FGO for some reason
Was not aware
Ohh
Griseo is stupid lol
Jesus
Wtf are those scores
Wait
<:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
3 whole attack solved the problem
I had to affix gaming that piece
Should've saved mine for 6.0 <:tericross:902580093304586320>
Kk one sec
I can dm you the server mine are from
?
You want themm
<a:dalao:795864124907061369> <a:dalaofrenzy:875338810735595550>
fragile's nirv run is pretty nice too



but more fun to see extremely off meta stuff
also my armada mate lol
sss whale but lazy ish nowadays
yeah thats karto
I can't afford another one <a:teripoor_hh:810150526762876938>
Carv pls
The lightning what
Just yeet me off the cliff
No more sp for a while though, <:prayge:863861301310652416>
Hopefully in 6.2 and farmable S valk in 6.1 or vice versa
Turg cat is cursed but where's my fire support
Imagine an ice support being a better fire support than actual fire supports
I hear a lot of people talking about skipping AE, just get Felis and throw jst TM Newt B on her
And idk how I feel about that take
I see I see
AE has carried me almost singlehandedly so I'm inclined to agree lol
AE isn't farmable either though (yet)
Rip if you missed the BP frags back in like
5.2?
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
Makes sense then
So I don't qualify, got it
Wtf
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
And I misread
Cause maybe that was it
Is 893 heim easier than 946 heph
Idea
Wait
So they were full of shit gotcha
Yeah, what would that even be
Fuxi Cleo?
<:ohnoswipe:961788853486780466>
Screw that job
<:worrySadPat:633872417223213056>
Ohhhh, I see I see
Are you gonna SS the new herrscher?
That's so annoying lol
<:meihue:960024977703313439>
OwO headpat <@148145559897636865>
<:meowpensivepray:814858736497590302> ty
Pog
Then reverse these lol
I see
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
I don't play ex ma I'm still figuring stuff out
What I've heard anyway
Cause I think the 0s heim is easier than 0s heph
If HoT is BK and HFS is heim
Cause idk wtf I'm using on heph then
I can find stuff no worries
Thanks though! 
Gonna focus on triple mech next week instead
Maybe LE idk
If I use HFS on Homu need a substitute for the SpA team
I gotta figure out HoV too
733 it is <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I'm dead
SS0 FR and lvl 35 kikaku
<:terifrownarms:959782410843742228>
Wait I know this quote
Not sure
<:fpsscumhic:959744049546416148> ?
Isn't nuadas
A shit ton of lightning
<:pennehands:886690313937256488>
No mobi either, I think she can 786 homu
And the one I do is lvl 50 <:deadge:975652771082698782>
All I've seen is FT CH BB but haven't dives too far into refs
I don't have shennong or 2 sleepris though
If I don't have the dmg for 840 HFS
What do I do for Homu btw
Fair
I'm gonna nap the minute I get home
I think I wanna do MA early for once
If you do I'll watch and cheer you on <:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
Ohh, then idk if you'll need it
Because they changed p2 of SSS
You don't have s0 PE right?
Same but 7T
I maxed mine like a patch after I broke through because they ~~gaslit~~ recommended I should
I'll go back to my corner now
Yeah then cosmic needs to be maxed at a minimum
Jesus <a:dalao:795864124907061369>
Nirv perspective
The extra tdm helps but not necessary if RL is the goal
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
yeah
fhem op
Yeah this fhem run is fucking hard
Impossible without SS griseo
griseo good i take it back
much better than that 18 min run from earlier
<a:runfast:959995921305829466>
<:worryIsFine:676284682253500416>
its only nirv that it's a hellhole
you should be fine
<:kekDoggo:775708084051378217>
sw prob then if you have her
<a:bugcatdeadpat:898434851160604684>
i think fr dps works still
are you in nirv or rl
wake me up on friday when we can level stuff
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

look at this keilao retaining nirv
<:worrysnipe:892222649802059827>
i held off building hor for hopes of a new ice
which isnt bad but still
literally forced to use pardo dps nowadays <:tericross:902580093304586320> (no sw haver)
Poor Eli 
Still waiting for seele
Yeah PE has hard carried me since I broke thru
Yeah I thought vill v was gonna be phys too
Yeah SS scores 857 or something at our D
I guess ss really is mandatory
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
Imagine 3 supports doing more than a dps (tbf its old Bkek team, more a showcase of griseo)
i remmeber that still lol
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
hua
thats prob fhm
cause burnout
low energy though <:deadge:975652771082698782>
fenrysk did a couple lol
where crystals <:worrywokearms:885296664955478026>
this feels like the quizzes they give on the livestreams we didnt get this patch
before ascendent
the old sirin
skem
oh thats picasso i think
<:wheezetao:850286144833716224>

im surprised you didnt run beet M
i noticed damage was slightly better for me
yeah it never happened again lol
hof was 90 pulls for me

where ref
wtf
np, sorry i dont have an exact answer <:zDelusional:959797815842844732>

this was at 31D higher

rl or nirv

<:jerry:960001749693915186>

<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
cause
yeah i think i go all in on that one too
pretty sure but idk i dont own klein <:deadge:975652771082698782>
and the lightning qte 3?
i thought klein was 2?
same but dudu
its SO helpful
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
i dont even have a 3* elf
<:Woggers_lum:608915988351811584>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeah... and elves and all that
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
technically 70-120 if you can make myriad
but yeah LOL agreed
its way easier
yeah, rl is all thats needed
cause they dont have aponia either
i think they're gonna sleep
thats my armada mate
oh shit
every once in a while a nirv retainer or ss/sss whale
i honestly dont know if trophies matter for placement 
i always get brand new breakthroughs, agony/rl bouncers, a couple retainers
<:stronkhic:640167811469279232>
t1 too
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
elilao
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916> gj though!
who needs t0

<a:wokeaf:553559215981985792>
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
maincord gives me a headache sometimes yeah
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
@.neko here's your ss+ ref
and you're done
HoD is
one shot core
no one wants to crit
yeah
wedge op
yeah
but idk
without elf
i feel like this can 47.2
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
and lvl 50 pri
i hate it
im at 46096 on that thing
to help
where's @.keilo
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
you're still winning matching that score
<:meihue:960024977703313439>
def possible
<a:SeelePat_Shizue:952770597883113522> <a:dalao:795864124907061369>
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
<:poggies:799768079814361088>
so rich
wtf
how do you still have 10 mil
we can stop at s
im just glad for once
to bait people
🙂
keep pushing
from what i've seen anyways
not even that bad
<:TE_PepegaBlind:967928246878502972>
never happened
was gonna say i thought they just encrypted
leakers move fast
wtf
already?
i could see that
lazy but true
lot of loose ends to tie up rn
i do wonder how they write this herrscher into existence
abuse flower <:wheezetao:850286144833716224>
i was coping for seele too cause they hinted at it
and qua vill v killed the seele speculations
mei wouldnt make sense right now
<:kekDoggo:775708084051378217>
whoever the herrscher is
i really hope its ice
fair enough
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oh then you're fine
but idk between fr or eden which one's use case is better with sw hb
probably better off sleeping
i think they raised her ice resistance
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
good job on 720!
hey i was right
hope your aponia is ready 🙂
no ref but this is from a player with ss
im still confused why they made af pri then hler pri in that order
af was the beginning of the end
<:wheezetao:850286144833716224>
3.7 was ae
you right
it was yeah
i think
3.7
since like
over 2 years
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but idk personally my bke is lvl 50 with a lvl 1 af
a LOT
and she needs to crit
yeah it is, from what i've seen from others
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
we got 10 free
use your supply cards
there's the 778 but thats ss hs
having trouble
im looking for a ref now honestly lol
<a:patpat:850500624630022154>
thats just cause cata hasnt made it yet
i think
she should
i might actually have a shot
im excited for HoD now lol
i cant believe how strong griseo is
to kill around 945
and the pe qte to crit
yeah for mobs i need senti to crit
but i think that needs ranks on hos too
i know ss can 800+
cause im stuck at that too lol
yeah i think cap for pe is around 782-787
<:rozasadhic:637306257237082122>
magic pixels man
<:FeelsREEMan_lum:458409353930866698>
<a:deadlao:959706479470985286>
impossible game
<a:bcaFedupUghh:703605002899423322>
HoV and HoD are light
hoping homu is easy
ew
oh thats right
triple mech ma right?
<:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
just sleep
yeah i dont blame you
akabane in there
not even
only 5 open
no wait
4 and 5 open

seems low
445d wtf
until hod anyway
i'm not going back
understandable have a nice day

<:MeiHue_lum:694766566046171166>

<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
idk if i wanna bald this boss more <:duduhmm:889049478135447582>

keilo
<:jerry:960001749693915186>
I hate doom  <a:bugcatdeadpat:898434851160604684>
Oh I meant in general lol
I bet
31200 30986 40298
Coping hard lol
Bruh
This si HS SnS strat is more annoying than it looks
Where's Carole crit
Not willingly but I'll take it
I'll take a t
I think so too
I need Dante M still
Though shui was just in 5.3 why is it back already <:duduhmm:889049478135447582>
Zither/shui in 5.9 and I'm getting lance this patch for the full 4/4
I'm hoping 6.0 or 6.1 is bad tbh
I want DA lol
Yeah, she just can't keep up with SpA
Ye
Oh that's right
When SSS parv came out
Parv?
When was the last time we even got to use da
Well, BKE anyway
That's already baseline
<a:FuHuaAngry:557401216028770318>
I don't even own sk
<a:praygirl_hh:757338631747928161>
And leveling up the dkeys still
She took all my skill mats
All 200+
SP so expensive
The only thing I actually have is coins (for once)
I have like 100 left, I'm about to be dead too
<:sakurawtf:961449692745576448>
Someone give me a small loan pls <a:OH_peepoBlush_Christmas:775103882652942337>
Same <:DeadFischl:710794008993071144>
LOL
Poor nyx <:meowsad:415955901162455040>
Also lul 
I hate double pri patches
Need metal <:tericross:902580093304586320>
Agreed
Though idc enough about rime to cap or close either
But PE strat less skill issued
<:duduhmm:889049478135447582>
That exists that's right
Ohhhh
What strat is this <:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
Wdym?
Giga brain wtf
Fragile is
<:bceTired3Dead4:861125829077893140>
Who has pri mats
Maybe wolf but
SoS needs 60 for literally only rime
I'm so mad about mine
Dude
<:tericross:902580093304586320>
~~i have just the one at 50~~
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<a:dalao:795864124907061369>
Same for MA
Or how much effort it takes tbh if s0
Hands and no ranks

Or if you have both but then they go if I had your account I'd get the same score
<a:nodnod:821142843909210202>
im so excited to pull griseo gear in 120 pulls <:worrykms:398047795732545536>
yeah LOL
nothing changes for regulars
at worst this clogs up myriad
pretty much
he's in my bracket rn lol
~~he's also retained nirv literally once~~
<a:JailedTakoWantsToLeaveButCant:869950055044505650>
<:KyaruTired:959737564791717889>
Abyss (at least agony 3) is pretty accessible though
Sometimes RL depending on the shill
I agree with you impossible for most f2p to catch/keep up or compete now
I don't even want to imagine a new player
If you're not a whale or a boomer don't even try to t100 ma
Honkai always been a whale game though, at least on the high end
These recent patches aren't helping either <a:aNotLikeMiya:959706350756192316>
I'm curious too
Yeah exactly
Imagine being good enough to do that though <a:bugcatdeadpat:898434851160604684>
To keep himself interested
Like with the er builds now
And the copium nirv retains
But Keeby has been switching it up
Same tbh
Him and people like ryuu, etc
<:OH_peepoSalute:663785754736197702>
i find good servers
<:bceCantStayAwake:734187825813127290>
*proceeds to vote keilo anyway*\
Cause Thursday new patch
<a:W_LOLTaoA:857383190293250068>
Now I have fucking Keeby in this bracket
I sleep <:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
Not lao but ty
The SSS slept and charlie couldn't play
I should've been 5th lol
this is the 4th time since 5.5
i doubt we see her for a long time
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:worrySadPat:633872417223213056>
LOL
I lived <:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
never coming back here again without an elf
7% and sleep <:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
i still gotta do MA
oh wait
<a:patpat:850500624630022154>
ask keilo
snipe is acceptable
its nirv
<:worrysnipe:892222649802059827> 
though 5th is sniping too
I have a 735 loaded
im hoping
<:KianaBeg:585551010521546766>
<:IdolYes:959736572029329428>
100% success
and don't roll a whel bracket
there is a way
but
its painful
no other options really work (read: do well) except mobi up there
<:teriripjuice:923472148243296286>
as soon as i figure it out cause im up there too
i might retain this time
your snipe is forgiven
keilo
<:whalepat_hh:710738275845013576>
<:wowe:837343798110715994>
when they SSS all dudus
<a:CB_coffee:586231965615915018> <a:dalao:795864124907061369>
tbf a lot of new players are burnt out genshin whales
are they still around
where's my cup of coffee
keilo
oh big time
all whales tho
very excited
new players look strong
prob gonna be SS acc soon too lol
oh yeah
surpassed me soon
yeah
LOL
him and karto big laos
riku
mentoring our newest whale
very good player
he goes in universe too
yeah
what a flex
thats my armada mate <:cheerhic:877383900324843560><a:dalao:795864124907061369>
On the same boss lol
I didn't see it but I assume it was cursed
baton twirl? idk
idk what to call it lol
legit superarmour is too tough
what i hate is when she attacks while you're building stacks for the stab
yeah the bicycle dodge you mean?
took forever to learn it
<:worrysnipe:962908598671925258>
literally
its a hard knock life
<@148145559897636865>
I wanted to promo then I got sniped from T1
so now I'm fighting a losing battle for T1
but i think this boss is gonna raise Disturbance
or wolf
yeye
we did not do well on jizo
keilo I did it <:cheerhic:877383900324843560>
I balded 2 hours for TWO whole points <:tericross:902580093304586320>

<a:dalaodalaodalao:959706475394117632>
Nowadays just pray PE crits on QTE it seems
I'm just glad I wasn't there for the DK Picasso balding
Or the NS/HoS Schro T crit one
That was fun
The 840 tona
Oh right, I forgot about that!
Impossible for f2p like me to compete
Here though, unless SS+ she's dead
level 50 s0 1/4
I still haven't used my sn
Kek
I think you're an M
And boomer stigs
Now I need niche pris
Way easier
Masters is like
And for SSS bosses
For the 0s strats
I don't have the gear or the hands lol
I just 2% and sleep <:keqingsleep:884663408450998312>
And the Nirv SK pain rating was worse
I thought he found a new strat to make it easier?
Twas awful
I remember his malding on that
Ye what keilao said
Lets you get higher scores than what the game allows essentially
Ye
<a:aworryRun:877737618119458826>
I'm snitching
At least among the whales there's a gentleman's agreement for no <:fpsscumhic:959744049546416148>
0
<:naruhodo:782879084229165135>
<:worrycheer:959797281165561916>
~~thats SSS~~
~~i think~~
but you have fhem so
s0 with 616

yeah i got nothing
~~not jealous of a valk that directly caused the 7T nerf either~~
its all aponia rn that im seeing
if i can find one sure
but i think s2 is 648 then (edit im a pleb, this is aponia cap <:tericross:902580093304586320>)
non ss sw rare apparently
yeah, s2+ is so hard to find
<a:bcaPatientlyWaiting:764167633234559016>
LOL
not far from cap tbh though
go for 664 <a:worryganbatte:805679793886462002>
Hi aster
*tet is literally worse though
tet and eli literally are worse though
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
