VK in ER:
Passive: When VK is equipping Might of An-Utu or Shuhadaku of Uriel, weapon action speed is increased, max stacks is increased to 4 and when stacks are at 3/4, weapon action deals an additional 1000%/2100% fire dmg

Ego Signets: (+ numbers in brackets)
1: Every hit of ultimate deals additional 1200% (1500%) fire dmg, every use of Ultimate drains 10% HP, when HP is below 20% recovers HP to 20%. Ultimate speed is increased. For every 4x 1st sequence Ultimate released, automatically transition into the 2nd sequence of Ultimate.

2: Evasions can chain directly into Guren Flash. Guren Flash's speed is increased, grants 20 more SP and after triggering Evasion Skill, TDM+40%(+60%) for 10s

3: Charged Attack speed is increased and deals +150%(+200%) dmg. Charged Attack generates less overdrive. 

4: Schielhau Cross-Cut deals an additional 800+1200% (1000+1500%) fire dmg. The first hit of Charged Attack will pull in surrounding enemies with 6s CD.

5: Upon HP loss or when using Charged Attack, applies a +10% fire dmg taken debuff to all enemies on field for 10s, max 5 stacks. Also reduces weapon action CD by 3s (5s) with 0.5s CD.

GRISEO v3 Cezanne TB Stigma DMG% Comparison
Cezanne TMB

100%

Cezanne TB Mei M

Griseo Signature PRI

100%

Hekate PRI

91.30%

Zither

87.70%

Remarks
- Both Hekate and Zither need to manually use weapon active
- Zither will be slightly better if Griseo supports BKE

-neb
Test Lineup
S1 PE + S0 HoS + SSS Griseo, no ELF
- Griseo has 20±2 ATK stigma affix
- Tested three times each, then the mean value is taken
Test Conclusion
- No Cezanne B, no Griseo (so it's recommended to get B)
- Griseo's signature cross has an advantage with auto weapon active + ultimate evasion on QTE
- Griseo heavily benefits from having her signature cross and at least 2pc Cezanne with B (TB/MB)
- Gap of Griseo with alternative to signature gear can increase in actual combat

Summary
- 3pc Cezanne is not necessary, TB/MB is enough 
- Griseo > Carole in terms of raw damage unless it's the normal shielded enemies. Against IMG is situational, and against BIO, Griseo since 12% Team Total DMG vulnerability vs. BIO passive (can maintain with ult/1st sp skill)
- Griseo QTE can be conflicting with MDPS QTE (like PE) since HoS TS triggers both
- Can skip Griseo if only an RL retain player

```from catgirls lover

As for the cost when Hua uses the honkai form in PE, because of the influence of SWARA, Hua is always forced by an order to destroy the honkai, the plot reveals that it is that command that will make her lose her mind and fight with pure instinct = destroy honkai
This also means that any existence related to honkai including the mantis, is within Hua's enemy, she is willing to attack her teammates
but suppose that after killing all enemies to kill, there is only 1 being left that she considers an enemy
that's herself
And because of the impulse of instinct, Hua will kill herself, also because of Garuda's regenerative ability, Hua will constantly try to kill herself, she will be stuck in a suicide loop after using her honkai form
But this is only in PE, in CE SWARA has been destroyed, and her Honkai form has become clearer, I'm not sure that Instinct is still controlling her anymore (Even though she's reluctant right now)```

While gold spd relic gives 15 spd or 20 smthn
It will give the same prob. Between epic relic will be 10 max

The QoL grinding shards or equipment
yea
Its basically free ups for your gears and UE
which it can go through lv 145 player lvl and also equipments
for UE u can use the orb
iirc also there is some free 5 extra stages where u grind 5 times on that stage per day idk what it called tho
they made grinding shards easier now
not really anymore since u actually select all stages at once and just ticket it
literally everyone already move on jp

``[Early Thought]
Off Course our take is different. Instead seeing Susannah design is more to Nilou. We looking more to Fu Xuan (HSR). But its not stop there just based on Colour Pallete.

One things is particular is the gemstone on Susannah waist and Fu Xuan chest. But hey, our old quotes says outfits is just outfits, Anyone can wear anything.

Okay, but hear this. Susannah mission from Schicksal in the game mostly involved around Arc City including in Sushang events. Ironically that The Caslte from Xianzhou Loufu (HSR) design is look like Arc City Castle.``

Ohh nice
Yea but does it work with SR 160 will be use a schro party while u will put lv 1 ssr to sync non limit break it will make them 160 or will still capped with lv 80?
Wait what? Even with limit break?
<@180679257851166721> should i use SR units to level 160+ and sync the ssr would it worked or it will still cap them to lv 80?
I see
So i need to make my party to lv 52 each?
I see
Since it only selects the lv 40
Also how do i change it?
<@180679257851166721> is this only copying the level up the unit or it levels them up?

I have been Ai-chan's fan for 20 years 8 months 13 days. Back when I was in my darkest days of youth, lonely, stressed, depressed, no one around to share, to listen to me. I was scrolling my phone like a mindless machine, seeking something to cure my soul, it's when I met her. How can I forget, an adorable pettie girl, green cabbage hair, with such naughty yet lovely gestures, appearing on Honkai Impact 3 ads. That's how I felt in love, with this game, and with her. Day after day after day we spent together, she has been leading me, helping me get over the past. There were times that I let my naive and stupid self lost faith in her, blame her for my bad luck, for my gacha results. Yet she's always there, with her hands open, and a bright smile on the face just like when we first met. She is my light, my savior, my meaning of life. I love you forever, Ai.

flac ver. + instrumental

lyrics:
Say my name when a tree susurrates
Once and again telling a story lost in time
the way it starts and the way it ends
Never again making up stories in dismay
With several starts, but just one end

Ah, how I long to embrace
The future breaking out of shades from the past
Still ablaze

Save your tears for the day so far away
To irrigate the wilderness thatâ€™s still asleep
In the world waiting to be lit
To spread over the riverbeds so dry and dead
Let ships that ran aground re-launch their sails

Ah, how I long to embrace
The future breaking out of shades from the past
Still ablaze

Seeds bear new life when flowers dare to fade

Petals linger about
awaiting one last dance
Shaking off all the dust from the past
New stories have yet to start

 She seems to have something like fighting styles: arms/legs and blah blah, different combos, kte, has a blocking attack (like BKE or PE in dark form)
 Perhaps styles will be switched through the ult, as is done with HoS and HoRb.  Perhaps not only for different combos, but also for different roles 🧐
 As for the wings, by the way, there are separate combos with them❤️

One of the leaders of The Family. After Hanunu (the first ruler of Penacony), died of illness, Sunday was invited by the Oak Family to help find a solution to the hypersomnia mutation crisis 

Sunday's proposed solution to the mutation was to use a Stellaron that had been kept under the stewardship of Hanunu. He proposed to activate the Stellaron in order to create a wedge in the Dreamscape — a creation of the Enigmata — thereby stabilizing the local area of the Dreamscape. This would enable Penaconians affected by hypersomnia to travel through the Dreamscape and seek refuge, thus allowing them to return to their normal sleep cycle in reality.

[Sunday]
Skill: test_basic attack (Skill01) :
dev_Causes a small amount of fire attribute damage to the designated single target.
Skill: test_diffusion (Skill02) :
dev_Causes fire attribute damage to the designated single target and its adjacent targets.
Skill: test_AOE (Skill03) :
dev_Inflicts fire damage to all allies.
Skill: test_transformation (Skill04) :
dev_ enters the burning state and removes the weakness, making our combat skill points continue to burn.
Skill: test_ultimate move (Skill05) : 
dev_ inflicts fire attribute damage to all members of our party. If the target attacked is in a deflagration state, an additional deflagration damage will be caused.

The final attack will most likely be changed to a two-stage flying kick attack.
The form of the ultimate move is for reference. It is currently set as a melee attack.

Boss Battle Sam
[ Acheron - HSR ] 

She comes to Penacony as a Galaxy Ranger and attends the family's banquet. Although she keeps her distance from the protagonist, she will help them when necessary. In the story, she reveals her true identity as an Emanator of Nihility: Nothingness.

On the surface: a cold and silent intergalactic ronin, an ascetic imperial maiden. She has embarked on a lonely journey for vengeance, but still seems to have goodness in her heart.
In reality, she is an IX Emanator of Abundance, a Self-Annihilator born out of nothingness, with no memory or past, wielding a sword that cuts off the path of life.

Helia is Lightning support - Paralysis.
Coralie Fire damage in the new trio, her skills deal damage.
In version 7.2, a new mechanic Astral Ring will be introduced, similar to Lyle's attacks in Odyssey 2.

Skill Astral Ring will replace Elf's Ultimate and also depends on its own SP bar.

In addition, it also allows Valkyrie to use unique skills that only work when the Astral Ring is activated.

For example, Senadina's second-tier driving skill is improved into an attack that uses Anchor, dealing large amounts of damage.

Two characters support Astral Ring: Main and Songque.

The new trio (Sena - Cora - Helia) will work together.
They use something similar to combo attacks/QTEs, some of them, depending on the Astral Ring, seem to be called resonance attacks.

Sena's skill leader is closely connected to the Astral Ring and she will work directly with the Astral Ring. (?)

Cant send it on shitposting ill just put here
Mostly source leaks were came from there
Telegram russian and cn
I recommend you guys to NOT believe in these things even considering some CN anon, which is unknown. ;d.

Yeah, I know, everyone want a lot of things here, but there's no reliable source that can confirm even half of this. 

Let's talk about what might be true:
1. Sirin. Definitely playable SP.
2. Theresa. Several sources spoke about her, not confirmed but have high chances.
3. Griseo. Dim's (notmdi on twitter) source said about her, he's pretty reliable. It may also be related to who Hua met in the end of the chapter 39.
4. Engine update. Officially teased, bla-bla-bla.

I am not saying its 100% fake, but there is nothing to indicate that this could even be true.

That's all. Keep yourself safe, keep your crystals for playable Kevin and don't believe strangers without proofs (even if this stranger is me).

<@&1057190682642628618>
While kaeya looking never aged on the manga <:PiKek:973573411911659540>

Story spoiler:
Theresa's new model will be similar to Kallen's.

Hua will meet his two old acquaintances (Su + Griseo) who thought they were 1000 meters underground, or in our case, in space.

Su returns from a game of chess.

Yeye the one otto save
When new kallen or fu hua?
If seele is 6.8
Melee. Has two forms: Flower and Deer mode. NA with Scythe or Catalyst and recovers Herrscher Energy. Flower mode combo attack generates a field of plants that attacks enemies and can summon a giant scythe that slices enemies w/ weapon skill summons a flower fairy that attacks

and can summon vines that deal damage. In Deer mode, launches an attack that hits enemies with a scythe with a special combo where the Deer deals dmg, weapon attack will group enemies and the Deer will deal damage to enemies.

Ult Form 1 deals DMG and reveals enemy weakness which increases Crit %. Form 2 pulls enemies into catalyst and leaves a sea of quanta effect that exposes enemies weakness and reduces def with increased crit rate for party.

<@&1057190682642628618> since it was seperated from this one only shows the ult form here the rest on top

Kafka impressions
Probably back story?
But yea its weird they add eileen on the assets
They dont confirm anything except its only for concept trailer
Probably same thing from reburn 1 <:worry:652762361668829184>
the private one
yea data mined since the closed beta is being distributed for testing
Jingliu icon skills
<@&1057190682642628618>

But they just advertise we be getting over 80 pulls total
They gib through mail box by level
Basically same as genshin
<:worry:652762361668829184>
Limited banner has also different currency
Until 50 pulls its only 8 tickets per pull
This one is the discounted one
So yea basically pulling 50 total there will be fine
Is counted on that one
The starter discount banner..
Also
Thats only once
Oh and btw
<@309634550273933314> <@213811388546678794> this one i have tried this also on beta but pulled only over 100 pulls cuz lacking alot of events <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Hes on standard banner plus iirc after 300 pulls u can choose anyone u want on standard
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Well 50/50 tho
Until i get what i want
I did do reroll some other games renaming emails ex. GenshinReroll_1 then change the number the many times u go for it
U can probably request it through email but.. They might go block your account after that <:PiKek:973573411911659540> for too many request of deletion
Its 12:58AM and tom. Is hsr launching <:lesgo:986330421795110953>
That went mihole mad for rerolling
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Cuz of too many peeps rerolled venti
During genshin days
They removed that iirc
Yea they dont
<:worry:652762361668829184>
U need to make a new email again to reroll
Since the moment we pre register during the start we already have UID for Hsr
U cant actually reroll at this point
Hoping to get on starter banner Welt > Bronya > Himeko > Yanqing > Bailu > Clara
Thats for 1.0

Original source <:worry:652762361668829184>
V6.6   Continuation

 - Hare mechanic: Capable of summoning soldiers (same as in the chapter)
 - Hare or Prometheus will have a new weapon - a dart (?)
 - Hare and Prometheus are linked and supposedly play together (much like Eden and Aponia)
 - Exclusive boss under Hare should be Aponia with a thick shield
 Note: Boss Aponia in Elysium also summons IMG-type enemies, in the Abyss can adopt this mechanic
 - Suzanne's value on blind weather remained
 - Seele is supposed to be in the summer patch, most likely S-rank
 - About spanding: There are skins for HoT and Griseo
 Note: Not sure, better to wait for the beta test <@&1057190682642628618> <:borrySit:1001445019661639680>

<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
i mean physical is always sht
V6.6  Source: Unknown

- Hare rank S, MECH, physical damage (replaces BKE).
- SP Prometheus, physical damage, IMG, assist.
Specializes in breaking physical shields of enemies IMG (?), replacing Carol.

There is no information about Kira at this time. Seele will probably be physical support (previously there was also a leak about the physical Seele).  <@&1057190682642628618> sussy leek time

During the livestream
Yaru said devs are focus on seele?
<@&1057190682642628618> got confirmation now
According to reputable leakers, this is a fake leak

This is not a model from the ingame data, just Fu Hua's fanart that has been shown from the plot.

In general, it has not been determined whether Hua will launch in the upcoming versions or not, so please wait.
Why am i even getting this notification <:worrysmh:892522780925509662>
Real same thing also from my armada cord
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
i sent it earlier there is a guy/girl exposed yaru on 4chan for leaking things
Thats where she got exposed for sharing leaks
Rip den's server
Maybe? <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Pilipino <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
The heck
Looks like yaru getting targeted and posted it on 4chan <:OMEGALUL:454976633242124299>

Here it is kebin vs tuna bat fight <@&1057190682642628618>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
Context of this part

The trio goes farewell to kiana since shes going to the moon bronya goes off first and mei will send her off to the train
<@&1057190682642628618> memory book from start to present patch
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Kiana can meet the others from time to time too 
with the power of Finality, Kiana can meet them and they can come to the moon anytime
So i guess.. On apho 3 we will see kiana her
APHO timeline is 8 years after, so most likely after 2 more years we might see Kiana come back
Looks like sennyuki strim is done anyways here it is

Kevin died, Kiana fully becomes HoFi, she’ll stay on the moon until Earth can bear the power of Finality and do her best to decrease the effects of Honkai on Earth, she says it’ll take about 5-10 years
<:deadGe:1034539882988716043>
Well part 2 of the game just went sht show
Also before his farewell he said: I can finally tell them “Everyone, I have kept you waiting for long” <@&1057190682642628618>
Probably the start of seperation between the trio

Basically a text code file
Just got the confirmation on the armada server
It was fake btw some just edited out add it on the json file to make it looked real
Sussy leek for star rail atm dunno if true or not <:worry:652762361668829184>
yea
Predict next next version either release ICHOR Hua/Grown Up Teri/Seele 2nd Awakening or release either one of those mentioned + one newly appeared character. It’s expected to be one DPS one Support. 

Confirmed next next version put 2 characters, it’s the “one DPS one Support” that everyone anticipated, type is not confirmed, but I think one is definitely Physical, character model is still in progress, next version character is just to fill in the gap until the character models are done. <@&1057190682642628618>
