<a:therehego:1183176161996570664>
Can Pardo and Kira do this tho
with refinement and stuffs
i just had a nightmare where they changed Honkai's gacha system to the one similar to Genshin
guys you won't believe this <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
You can offrate P1 valks

Casual players when they see the changes
Don’t think too hatd
Ok my brother from another mother
<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492>
like this
before asking
raise your hand first
she is a beast
yea still gotta buy her with asterite and coins tho
new players when they learn about elf be like Bro why did old Honkai have outdated system? Astral Ring is much better
<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
and wonder where the fuck is Astral Ring from tutorial went
imagine new players accidentally pulling P1 valks
<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492>
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
or else
start calling it root
enough of prism
so they're the target audienece
WFP love the change
players like Rei
spit it
no i don't know
the new system is telling their players to fuck themselves tho
<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
Hasta la vista
the deadline is near but not here yet
we still have time <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
not Genshin
we play Honkai
since you know
this talk about r1 and r2 kinda feel strange <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>

<a:Aware:889021591776817172>
70 is the current avg
should be 60 now?
how much for valks again
sick
96
it's like Kiana and Void
yea it's Danheng using it but Danfeng is still a different character <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yea but danheng il is not him, no?
like Genshin 1 and Genshin 3
every patches
just straight up new valks
do you think we will also never get battlesuits again
ok real talk tho
W H <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>  and W H <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
new faces every patch
starting now we will get new valks only
it's P1 legacy
no more battlesuits either
no more Herrscher
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
start calling it root
prism is still a stupid name
i'd like some tldr <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
<:PauseChamp:889033551276830770>
<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
Again, i'd beg for you to improve combat experience, it's too complicated, this Luna Vow unit is too hard to play, i don't know which button to press. And make some change to upgrading system, we need a place to use weapon dupes
wrote like this in a survey
someone that is currently playing Honkai Impact 3rd
so you're telling me
<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
why do everything need to be Gesnhin
what with Mihobo and the Genshinified addiction anw
<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492>
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
surely it's better than Genshin Impact 3rd
it's time to move on to Genshin Zone Zero
<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492>
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
the server need to have nqn
Scooby Doo MMO server doesn't have nqn
but yea you can't nqn it
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
it must be I have a question
no
<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492>
<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
so they think players can handle it
they probably see Genshin players leave their valks at 80/90 and weapon at lv 70/80
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
is the most fucked up thing ever
you can't lv 50 a stig because you have to save xtals
but the fact that
it probably not matter in RL
it would be a really big let down for new players and F2Ps
like
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
crowning in Honkai
there is no way this is correct
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
and Coral
Helium
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>

all this prism mention are kinda bugging me
how many stig is that
owo math 21-13
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
15?
how much you need per patch if it's only 1 valk?
<:Clueless:1118532015667544064>
cause 7.4 they will only have 1 valk per patch
but that is only 7.3 right
people with OCD will fucking kill themselves
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
that's messed up btw
there is no way you sit a stig at 45
so, gang, what is the tldr
<:pog:1079351535609335859>
Temp - Boss name - YH S2R3
holy shit imagine Honkai P2 title

Im sick of this Genshin Impact 3rd game, there is no creativity, time to move to Genshin Zone Zero
im glad i quit this game to play another similar game
you cover 100% of their playerbase that don't play Honkai
if you replace Genshin with ZZZ
<:Pausechamp:897051293925928970>
MA timer just stop during Astral Mode
Imagine
Wait
So when they go wild i can start dancing irl too
<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
Im down for auto button during Astral Mode
Highkey
When was the last time we need to think about buff stacking mechanic
Elf going extinct
Enhanced your skills
It’s APHO shiny button
<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
They can make 1 team for each niche
Holy shit imagine all the possibilities with Astral Ring
<:ApuCry:969982697252466789>
No ice elf in CNY = no Vussy
Elf button replace with Astral Ring
Like if you let P2 valk be the leader
and P2 valk Astral Ring
I think P1 valk will still use elf
Cause she doesn’t have Astral Ring
<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
“Bro, what is this trash valk”
Pull for P2 valk, get offrate like HoH and be like
So new players joining in
Lowkey im down to add 50/50
<a:SCHIZO:1042907357249802310>
<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492>
you definitely won't like it if they release more <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
it's all fun and game but im not getting hope too high until i see their schedule for 7.4 7.5 <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
different niche
or 1 team every 2 patches
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
there are no free meal and we're talking about the company that refuse to give HTR box
yea it look cheaper if you apply the current schedule to it <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
when was the last time they sacrificed their revenue to please their playerbase
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
not real life
not trying to be Negative Nancy but Mihoyo sacrifice revenue for player experience is definitely in someone amazon wishlist
only when you apply new system to the current pace of Honkai
<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
do this irl carv
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
I'll meet you at the corner
What did one wall say to the other?
<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492>
you can still pull
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
but this truly our Genshin Impact
you can still buy the weapon so the change is fine
<a:fraud:1160083793336615032>
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
YT title Banner structure change in Honkai Impact 3rd? They finally add in 50/50? Genshin Impact 3rd is real? When will they reach Star Rail? Is Kiana weaker than Aeons? Fraudana? 
jebaiting people with 50/50 in Honkai
some guys will definitely do it anw
<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
and add in 50/50
what if i post it with carv in screenshot
wait
Coralie on my nuts
and 1 box for Helia
no it's 3 boxes for Coralie
reduce it to 160 and add 50/50 is increase the cost by almost 50%
hak wtf, 1 pull in GI3 cost 280 <:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
not this <a:Timeout:1157060847894544495>
i like to do this <a:yapp:1137709016903057409>
i don't, i like yapping, not doomposting
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
guys calm down
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
relax
ofc no
you're hallucinating
that's Mandela effect
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
unless it's your last meal
in this world
but there is no free meal
need to wait
can't jump the gun on this one chief
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
each patch event will give 1 stigma box
starting from 7.3, hard pity reduce by 10, you can craft every stig now with Root Prism and Ethernet
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
that's how it work?
like you'd rather milk 1 million playerbase than 30 millions playerbase?
why the fuck the same company that refuse to make skins in GI to milk money decided to milk every cents in GI3
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
the 3rd box let you pick weapon
you can't be punished with discount banner
that's not how it work with discount banner chesse
like bro, relax
not like the fucking box will damage their revenue
there is no harm in doing it
but no box really fucking pissed me off
i would still play regardless if the game is still fun <:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
time to get real
yea so they probably thought that's enough boxes for the playerbase
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
last year we had 1
we actually got 3 boxes in that year
-5.4: SW
-5.5: SpA
-5.9: HC
yea and it was the massive dick move
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
can't say they're wrong
they just realized their playerbase is dumb and still play regardless of the box
unless GLB didn't have it
she did
yea
SW had it, HC had it, HTR didn't and gHua have to follow HTR standard
<a:HUH:1102852193532514324>
if last year is the standard
that's even worse
where is the box
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
<@148145559897636865> look at how much thing changed
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
Hua and useless in the same sentence
that sound kinda messed up
<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
beside bridge decoration
but what does gHua do again
cause she is a support
like they can get away with HTR sure
if no box
and we blame the shit out of Mihoyo
it should be the opposite
like it's fucked up if it's the default
there is no way the assumption is no box
<:FEET_Sign:1039906915653800026>
delta on deez nuts?
<:caught:1175079388874805351>

<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
wait is that a good thing or bad thing

im not a beast at Mahjong either <:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
you can buy some pull currency in there
it's like daily shop or arena shop
you can buy currency in shop iirc
unless you want a specific valk
so you don't have to pull
people says devs still give out currency and skins in events
yea i think it's fair
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
and it's $30 for 10 pulls
oh i just check it out
<:Looking:1154847280529162260>
look on the bright side tho
and P2 valk need to be leader if you want to activate Astral Ring
the Astral Ring will be P2 exclusive yea
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
or maybe not
with new mechanic and stuffs, idk, maybe
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
but if not
if i still think it's fun then nothing happen
yea im considering it, need to test out P2 Abyss tho
once P2 start
cause you know people might actually fucking quit
it might even be your last valk
and that's all matter
yea she is real
<:PauseChamp:1118545701585031208>
Genshin Kart 5
or maybe
might be EOS soon
the game fucking blow tho
Snow Confinement something
oh we already have one, but it's TPS instead
just make it like Overwhat
yea
but i bet next will be FPS tho
that one isn't a real project, it's the project that won employee contest <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
Genshin On Duty
it's still in the oven
<a:BatChesting:1120707009034067968>
the Genshin Impact
can you feel the impact now? <:Life:1089579344508223558>
Genshinified
that's why everything are Genshin now
maybe Genshin was their favorite game
<:WhoLetGuobaCook:1133321990225276980>
wait i have this one
can't say the same about Queen of England
at least tooth fairy and easter bunny are real
i expect too much from Mihobo honestly, should be more thankful Hua is even real in the 1st place <:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
<:Looking:1154847280529162260>
check out nikke new skin tho
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
for a game that supposed to have variety on designs, Honkai somehow have less clothes overall than Nikke
my bad, i don't appreciate laziness <:Looking:1154847280529162260>
no abs
no ass
no booba
why even make her have less clothes
and they barely have anything to show with Fu Hua
it's the manifestion of her beast
it's not even her clothes to begin with
im all for less clothing but it should make sense
bro even Miranda look more jacked than Hua
<:Looking:1154847280529162260>
if you want to show tummy, at least make it like this
you moron
give them some abs
if you want to show a valk tummy
relax
like who even want to see her tummy man
cloth revealing, tummy focusing, less details on her clothes
Fu Hua i mean
i will be honest her changes suck even if you ignore the scales
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
so Korean whales almost sued them
without the subject to change
the Red Hood character was shown during the anni stream and they post a footage of her
yea leak is different with showcasing
the numbers in during anni stream wasn't match with her numbers before buff
Red Hood
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
Nikke almost got sued
players can sue you for that
yea this is a serious problem

<a:Clap:1053427053229256774>
truly LB's dedicated supprot like Aqua said
but they haven't made contact with 3 studios behind it yet
so they probably think it's in-character for Big G to do it
they do it on purpose with an intention behind it
yea they purposely trace 3 opening from the 3 recent anime so it can't be a coincidence
can't tell
or not
and the PV will probably come up again soon
they haven't making a fuss about it mean Mihobo might dealing with it behind the scene
but the problem is that Japanese is really strict when it come to copyright
Big G spent her time in space watching all kind of media so her PV having recent anime's references are neat
their intention might be pure tho
it's too obvious
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
calm down
no she is not man
Dove is NA
but it's commonly use among British English speakers
yea dived is a legit word

Chinese representative = Discount Valk
CNY
yea definitely
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
do you care about doing this irl tho
maybe they think too many idiots using the beta client is not worth it
so the purpose is probably to limit the number of testers <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
yea, they will update everything on hoyolab account and open a Q&A room for everyone and testers
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
it's beta
not like knowing numbers do anything for anyone
the post said they will still post and update new valk during beta
why do we need leak? <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>

they actually said let's celeberate CNY together
just say we need to call it anni or else GLB will celeberate their Anni during a patch no one care
man says new anni
me
but interesting, not really
she is highskilled cap sure
idk if AE can even be called interesting <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
like sure new supports are all on autopilot mode but the game still remain the same popularity because Honkai has always been about the bosses <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
you guys only think we need interesting supports because you guys wasn't there when everyone had to mald with NS or PX
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
she is trash
if she spends 5 mintues onfield
Honkai is meant to save as much time as possible
you still don't understand the point of Honkai competitive?
it doesn't matter
i mean even if it's boring
if you don't know what her weapon and stig does
this mean nothing btw
that's coping if you think you need to spend 5 minutes on field
especially her boobs

in the sense that she require too much

she is good at S0
if you pull her as a dps
just depend on their mood

im looking at SSS and she does not look like she kill HTR
i will pull the trigger on him if he wants tho
except the trigger
yea im down to pull what he pull
like the beast he is
cause he knew exactly LB was coming
he skipped HN on purpose
Aqua
and you know who account fit in that condition?
if your account doesn't have HN and HoT/HTR
yea i think she is a good investment
not bad not bad
<@416445660443967491> <@370438895965306882> <@148145559897636865>

RL 475D
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
it's 9S team tho
first attempt at using LB as support
<@416445660443967491> <@370438895965306882> <@148145559897636865> 
ER <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
that's kinda rude
too predictable
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
just like you don't have any bitch
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
Because fuck you that’s why
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
how sure are you
yea her NA4 has 17 hit iirc
he is not making it to MA yet
huge ult
10.000 lil bros suddenly drop from the sky
fuck is that
Lol checkout the transition
<@370438895965306882> <@416445660443967491> <@148145559897636865> 
cause im the captain
Kongming almost die
terrible
might find out soon
and without GD ult im not sure about ult every rot
but maybe beta testers are morons
GD use Handel with her for some reason ngl
GD will use Turg
the thing with her playing support is that
how sure are we about that
im talking about ult each rot
oh im not sure about this one chief
who is she supposed to support
the support role i mean
which is still not yet have a place
it's the team breach
wait why S1
look at the amount of contents he cooked
we only knew him for 3 days
i still can't believe
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
the bleed niche is to add her a new boss
LB is just a lightning dps
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Aqua only need 1 day to catch up with 3 years player
do something about it then
except maybe Bleed HoS
but yea, probably the 2nd best option
and QUA
cause hitcount <a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
obviously she is not gonna compete with HN on most bleed bosses
like the beast he is
cause he knew LB is coming
like Aqua did
or you skip her
if you don't have built HN
value wise i think she is still awesome
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
trying to be Him or sth
good one bro
there are 2 things that stand out tho
yea she is as normal as she can be
no you guys are the Dynamic Trio
<@370438895965306882> <@148145559897636865> are we skipping LB or not coach?
i will ask my coaches
SSS HoT it is
but probably gonna skip
considering temp is getting higher
pulling for LB might not be a bad idea <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
i like your attention to details, that's what stand out about you
can't solve it without you
good one sherlock
probably HoS honestly
so which one is gonna be the discount one
they're releasing 2 S-rank valks in 7.0
realistically speaking
still thinking Garuda Hua is real <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
go find out the numbers on S2 HTR
S2 LB
35% lightning taken 
130% lightning 
25% tdm
15% lightning breach
yea Benares on deez nuts
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
there is no fucking self damage, we're not duo dps in Honkai
oh wait what
will she have boobs or not?
> 35% lightning taken 
> 130% lightning 
> 25% tdm
> 17% lightning breach


> 20% TDM
> 18% TDM taken
> 84% Elemental
> 46% Elemental taken
> 17% Elemental breach
like the beast she is
but Ice support
Hua will be Ignite dps still
wait i got it
yea that's why Hua can't be ignite dps anymore
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
who
for Garuda Hua it's fire buff
for LB it's lightning buff
for HN it's physical buff
so you want the supports to cover the buff numbers before it get transfered into bleed damage
the dps kit and gears already cover all Bleed TDM and Bleed taken
mostly just for fun
checking SS one
what is HTR numbers
so at SS it look like this 
35% lightning taken 
130% lightning 
25% tdm
17% lightning breac
at SS she give 17% breach
oh remove her lead, it's always GD lead
i will just assume yes
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
no but it's only 12 seconds
oh wait is she cross count as bleed damage too
remove this one 
> +10% lightning taken for 12s on taking bleed dmg
remove all the bleed taken first
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
even at SS i don't even think her numbers match HTR
she barely buff anything
what is the deal with having LB buffing lightning breach
i just still don't know
at S0
oh around the same with SS0-SS1 HoT
well her boobs are huge
how far
LB’s weapon
Are you sure they’re this big
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
Yea but are they big compare to LB
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
Susannah, Hare, Kira, Sirin has big breasts?
SI lead
Me
and change back to her impair
HoS lose that buff
when that impair run out
it take 25% more dmg from HoS
if the boss already have impair effect
S0 LB vs BKE
<@370438895965306882> <@416445660443967491> <@148145559897636865> 
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
beast mode
still worth it
so overall yea
when impair of GC run out HoS will lose 25% dmg taken from DK and back to impair
you don't need to wait with GC SI
the impair effect is still there
oh i just realized
should still be worth <:terimad:1066677583548260363>
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
the new stig set are still beasting
the DK is the one that remove impair
be honest
there is no way LB is not a bait here
also you still need to pull HoS new stig set
and my HN is a beast
my HoT is 150 frags away from SSS
she is not convinced enough as an investment <:terimad:1066677583548260363>
but here we are
so does not ativar o windows
there is no way this shit is mean to replace HTR
no
<a:xddinside:1004308940835799060>
<:xdd:1099462604386205758>
they can't
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
do this irl
im doing it for the giggle
no it just a joke
you already know the only place this server meetup ever happened is at the court
Edit
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
We’re not coward
No one trying to hide it
Relax, eli is a lolicon too
me and Hei and eli
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
doesn't mean i will accept it
lore wise Griseo was already start to grow up
you coward
man up and admit it
why does people always use lore to justify their love for children character
what happened to them
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
Diavoros's name is Roy?
Roy Mustang from FMA?
who is roy
what happened
if he is in this server why is he dumb
both are dumb
im talking about both
who?
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
lore this lore that
just admit you're lolicon bro
they're cooking
me
We kick the kid <a:catJam:1076171671762894928>  United <a:catJam:1076171671762894928>

i will pull if he say they're worth
what is Aqua opinion on LB and HoS
Chill
Bro no one is delivery a pizza to your house during apocalypse

<@416445660443967491> <@474176413847519242>
Griseo must stay a child
Even if it’s not logical
So what <:terimad:1066677583548260363>
same one with Eden
<:nooooo:971478297185759272>
I fear that Griseo will have big booba
If you don’t already have high ranked HoT and HN
I think LB is good
Bro think someone still return to this game
Returnee <:ICANT:1113490371595485314>
Spit
And memey ig?
It only look derp yea
If this guy even get to Golden House board, you already know he will change his name to the leaderboard url
the bleed part is just for making new boss
that one is definitely their intention
she is supposed to kill HoT
she looks cute
her boobs are huge
still 9S but dude taking time to do stuffs
oh this one is more clear 
<a:vibeedanse:1113540921657667677>
like a beast he is
in his name
did this guy actually put 36* Genshin Abyss
what the fuck
maybe he has better server
is he in Central?
and petty af too
while playing in EU
i have never seen someone ego be this big
how can this even possible
this guy is actually All for One
delusional and petty
outplayed
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
he uses all the small fries to finish me
no, i got owned by him
Luna Booba <a:Booba:1081435431540903936>
S0 LB gameplay vs Husk
<@416445660443967491> <@148145559897636865> 
not even close
this guy is actually Him
<a:Clap:1053427053229256774>
even a joke is now his
amazing
what a comeback
:godge:
ignore everything and only trust yourself
you can't be Aqua if you keep giving attention to useless info
that's what you're lacking
The 2023 valk disease
They’re getting to the Fu Hua
Yea even Fu Hua is fallen now
The brickwall is weapon active
Only when you use chain combo then you start bonking
You can still use her combo
Oh i think basically in the new burst mode
Like the beast he is
Bro still trying to justify skipping HN and pull SS Hare
His ego is so big it make Luna’s boobs feel smaller
Relax man
Bro no one asked
<a:sentifly:998950357789057055>
Like the beast she is
She can cook up these new DKs instantly
HoS is simply just a beast
Now that i think about it
Was half memeing but I've never seen myself as below anyone, just not there yet if someone can do something I'm 100% sure i can do it too, never wavering
Inspiring
<@370438895965306882> <@148145559897636865> <@416445660443967491> <@385655541248163840>
Where is Gordon Ramsay of maincord
Enough of these amateurs
Like the beast i am
Yea i still use FR in Armanda Trial
You moron
Dorm buffs are not gone
That’s neat
No
P2 is more clear than P1
Yea P1 is too fast
idiot
should have done the same with you
 A weapon forged by Herrscher of Sentinence, just like its owner, it doesn't have a fixed form, based on the fights it can change into anything 
he is grinding experience
when you guys are here shit talking, doing nothing
truly inspiring
haven't back yet from the grind
go find out Tet
what is Aqua opinion on this
these morons don't know how to test without 9S
only 9S clip for now
HoS dps
<@370438895965306882> <@148145559897636865> <@416445660443967491> 
:kinge:
orders are what i said
my words are truth
no
is this some kind of a test to join EU VIP server
what are you trying to cook
you moron
in this cycle
we're literally using it rn
probably need to delay a bit
oh wow GC can actually cuck that
especially the morons in maincord
can't trust anyone these days
let me check it
only heard so
idk <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it turn to unique multiplier
HoS DK remove impair from her ult
oh btw
or Ice valk and deal ignite dmg
and make her do Bleed damage
they can make Fire valk
with this the possibilities are endless now
amazing
it just the final damage after all the buffs transfer to bleed damage to get Abyss's buff
so LB still deal lightning damdage
and final damage become bleed damage
it's Susannah that does physical damage
wait maybe we think it wrong
but bleed damage does get the physical buff
LB does have  her damage count as bleed damage 
alright just finished checking <:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
God Key
:uptop:
you look boring
<a:modCheck:1114107903259983894>
any knowers?
so why is her weather bleed weather
she is definitely lightning dps
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
check again
<@148145559897636865> <@416445660443967491> 
as always
fucking useless
or no
but do we have the answer yet
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
unless
can't really punch through the monitor
oh nothing
now do we have an answer yet
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
Good one bro
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Or else
Alright im heading out for work, you guys better answer this question when im back
Like a beast
On HoO
For crit rate
Because she level an M piece to lv 50
Heki care
Because i need to know if her kit has any part that state “ All her dmg count as bleed dmg “ or not
Does LB playable yet or no
Nothing
What does it do
<a:catJam:1076171671762894928>
Do we kick the kid or no?
Probably translating
Yes
All lightning dmg become bleed dmg or not
Is the any part of her kit that said
<@218762069338619906>
Is LB actually Bleed dps or no
Wait why is it Bleed
Bleed one
What’s wrong
Feel like dejavu
Wait did i ask this question before
Why is your <:shruge:1079371164159311982> looking like that
New stardust will be in 7.2 first
Unless she is in 7.2
Probably no
What happened
6 initial stun trauma and 0.5 per second
It give stun trauma again
<@370438895965306882> check this one out
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
Should have went for SSS HoS
Like a beast
Or she also change to Psy
Is she Bio dps now or what
What does that mean
Maybe she is the bio dps we have been waiting for
It better do sth
What is the catch
Why is it stun trauma tho
It’s a brick
Not bleed
But it give Stun trauma
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Wait that’s a DK
You moron
PE was not our first IMG
And pull for the one in 7.5
But just skip her
First stardust will probably be in 7.2
Just wait for Stardust PE
That is the worst mecahnic imaginable
2 HP bars, when you kill the 1st one, restore to full and start the 2nd one. Kill the 2nd bar and it will drop stardusts all over the place, pick it up to finish the final bar
Totally useless mechanic
Wow
So just another QUA IMG
Is it still all boobs
What does it look like from the side
the bear
with the bear
but the paid one is gonna be better
or her sleep outfit
does it say anything about you having bitch anytime soon
both could be free and there is still no bitch
no she is paralyzed
Ice Ignite dmg
no
Ice Sushang coming soon
unless
Yea cause people made it up
At least we will die alone together
Talking from experience i see

Have they forgotten us yet, little Lamb?

Nikke just touch every fetish ever exist

like these are from the same horny artist
Honkai's head artist
only true horny know what horny need
lowkey i think Mihoyo artist is not horny, that's why he think all horny morons out there only like boobs, sideboob and thighs
Mihoyo should learn from Shiftup how to draw different types of women <a:Classic:1102006776540434542>

bro doesn't know what she is gonna do with Bleed and still add it in there

i don't really looking forward to LB honestly <a:alowo:1139655599492182086>

imagine Kafka in Honkai Impact 3rd
the strongest lightning dps ever
with Kafka
yea they're preparing for Star Rail collab in 7.2
relax
cause you're not 18
so Tet can go to Carv's house and make sure to ativar o windows
do we also need to save for an airplane ticket too
what is Aqua's opinion on this
enough of all these amateurs
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
try to guess when will Carv ativar his windows
you know what will be the best gamble of all time
what about hahaha
<a:NopeNope:1045725686834401300>
don't think so
of my dick?
probably need to wait for tmr
probably not confident in her replacing HoT
i still don't understand what is the meaning of teammate lightning breach buff
not because of bleed
Griseo can do it because of her SS passive
bleed doesn't contribute in depleting hitcount
unless she wants GD and PV
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
she is definitely not replacing HTR
just don't know why the teammate lightning breach is there
that's for sure
i mean she is supposed to replace HoT
i only remember JK only has stamps
was it <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like JK
only stamps tho
oh right that too
it's PE and SW this turn
not until V2
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
but that's the best they can go with the old ass engine
they had an graphic upgrade not long ago
2013 is EU server
before you were born
yea no shit it's a game from 2007
cause their hardcore fan can sustain the game easily
KR games generally can't die
yea rise and shine
Elsword Moonlight skin
Luna Booba
what about LB
your mom is niche
that require bleed
probably 2 new bosses
her bleed only look like it's there for boss mechanic
she deals lightning dmg you moron
she is definitely supposed to replace HoT
that's weird <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
ult
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
2 forms
probably like QK situation
she is definitely a dps
this is weird
huge ulti
Captain has some cool fetish
Even with the play button in front of it
Damn that’s some huge badonkers
Lightning or Physical
Psy or Bio
What is she
make most sense tbh
something like this
月下初拥 永恒的爱
24 hours from now
tmr then
The bear
<:Stare:861888503477698611>
Luna and Funny 😭 Lunny 😭

miracle of today is the norm of tomorrow
that's how fast the world evolve
:ikent:
but they don't know i play Honkai Impact 3rd
my doc told me to reduce my sexual activities
she has me
probably physical
so Hua will be dealyed until 7.2 or some shit
i think Teri will take spot of Bio
she is dead
because she hates being treated like a cat or sth
these guys keep calling her a furry yesterday

SSS AKA
<@148145559897636865> SS AKA is gone in 6.9
can you try to rationalize how to get some bitches instead
9 + 1 (default) = 10
and that passive only stack up to 9
the ignite stacks depend on the passive stack
it's in 1 of the passive
her max stacks are 10
you can't reach 15 stacks
2 or 3 stacks sth
weapon does give stacks

Sirin furry
<@370438895965306882> you got me with SS SF on day 1?
S1: SF now can meow 2 times in 1 rotation
S2: regen 1 sp/s
S3: dumb lead skill
SS: starting to play the game
her independent multiplier only increase at SS
nice
probably for Anna
<a:aothatday:925647030091665438>
very original
that's crazy
all of her damage are ignite damage
probably S2 increase it
that's actually low
time to check the rank up
if Aladdin is indepedent it will be 10 times more busted
not independent
yea Aladdin is just normal damage taken
probably gonna remove the independent from it or making it strictly from host later
yea wording like Aladdin
she only need 5% independent multi
if her only competitor is SpA
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
because her competitor is HFI
yea that's high
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
so it's not that busted
and 1 more thing, indepedent source only good as the 1st line, every numbers after that is still additive to the 1st one
so they just trying out to see what her damage look like
it's V1 too
HFI also has 2 indepedent source
i mean it doesn't matter
it's correct
obv doesn't
im gonna snip your ass
truly 2023 valk
QTE - weapon - ult - combo
that aside, SF look like she has the sick gameplay <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
just like the HoT festival one
ingame model is definitely not suit with this skin
the stig artwork look great because the angle make her look tall
doesn't fit her vibe
it definitely look off
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
probably body propotions
compare to stig artwork
the skin feel off
somehow SW doesn't have that OL vibe
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
cool effect
Ai-chan collab skin does look sick
<a:mfwobble:886869808606502952>
mfw Ai-chan is the only one use her weapon like how it should be
but they call it a scissors this time
it's just Pardo weapon
Trio is just too strong for no reason <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Sirin Furry
if HFI can solo ignite then it's Trio
depend on the ignite bar of the boss
T1 is probably either Trio or HFI
T0 is definitely SF
like bleed and dominance
and ignite weather have unique multiplier
SpA is already a lost cause
you do 12 cancel 12
you don't let her jumping around
no, people just don't know to cancel HFI animation
S0 HFI > SS2 SpA
HFI is straight up better than SpA
<a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
she doesn't even have a boss
wtf do you mean by gimp spina
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that can't be good
so Sirin is the ignite dps

The W CD is even refreshed when he transforms. He has true damage on his passive. Then, when he stacks Armor and MR, he gets Ability Haste too, Ability Haste to his Q, and his spell casting speeds up. Then, he has an AD ratio, so his W…AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

PE received 2 buffs in those time

what if she is ignite dps
augment will be back in 2024

so you just QTE in and her whole kit are triggered
summon entity but she can summon on QTE

6.9 is potentially to be GD replacement

The 2 decks they copied have the exact pros and cons with the Yixian Pai game is having rn
You need to prove that they actually steal sth from your game
Plagiarism have to be that specific cause you can’t sue gameplay
Now they already changed the name and numbers of those 2 said decks
So they probably solve the case behind the scene, compensate some cash for the other company
There were 2 decks that match the numerical value of another Chinese card game called Yixian Pai

if she int the crit dmg for a sure crit run
wait is it even good
the strong farm sp on her own
only the weak need spoonfed sp
so does HoS <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
JK also shit sp out of thin air too
Quantum Knight ? <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
so she is QK ?
no way <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
why not 30 or 32
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
wait why 31%
im actually a beast
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
if it boost HP then it mean somewhere in her kit there is a line that state  if your HP exceed y amount, gain z% for every n HP overflow 
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
so you can't swap mode mid-fight ?
her event stig remind me of AE and HoS
AE wannabe <:ok:1088133019455467560>
Hare is Mech vs Psy AW
Aponia was Bio vs Psy HoT
they learnt
it's different this time
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
so she is a summoned dps ?
i just want to play TFT
<:smoothbrain:1114520186280751175>
i actually don't know
<@148145559897636865> you got me with the reading ?
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
any readers ? <a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
where the fuck does Summoned weather Jizo coming from <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
and they have to be Mech
doesn't matter, she just need 2 new bosses for shilling purpose <:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
that many bosses for an SP is actually wet dream <:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
HN : Physical Jizo, Bleed HoS, Type HoS, Type Dxy, Bleed Vill-V, Bleed Jelly, 1-2 new bleed boss that is Bio
Hare : Shield SK, Mech Aponia, 1 more mech boss
assuming HN is mech, Hare Psy, Seele QUA, their coverage would look like this
cause Susannah will cover more bosses than intended
now that i think about it, yea, it would have been benefit too much for the players <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but work for the players
HN mech Hare Psy Seele QUA could work <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
they probably didn't think about Bleed dps when they made Bleed HoS in 5.8
Bleed HoS <:ok:1088133019455467560>
HN couldn't be Psy was because of 1 single mistake they made
they're the SEA of IMG
their bodies are made of IMG energy
HoS too
cause HoF, HoT, HoR should have been IMG <:ok:1088133019455467560>
did you also mad that HoF is Psy ?
heki is too dumb
it was Nyx
HC
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
yes, the reason is that her schedule match QUA valk of 2022
meta come first
get used to it <:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
so Psy is the only answer <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
but they also want to make a dps, an actual dps and not the like of HoS
if she were meant to be support only then her being Bio or Psy wouldn't matter
can't be Mech because Hare is literally just out
can't be QUA because Susannah is bing chilling right now
can't be IMG because they don't want to kill PE anytime soon
with the way they intend her to be
her being Psy is 10 times better than anything consider she can't be QUA or IMG
easy task
whereas right now she can just take over MPE bosss
Bio lack physical bosses and she will have to compete with Aponia + SW <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
but just because a physical valk can give hitcount shield break and collapse 1 layer does not mean it will do anything to Vill-V
if she is Fire, sure
killing a meta valk is not as easy as 1+1 = 2 when doing it with different elements
she is not killing Vill-V if she is the only QUA in physical
when she is the support
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Seele being QUA is not good
because typing have to fit in with the meta
that's weird skill name
i was talking about 4* Dudu
but it's just Dudu but bigger numbers
more physical damage
Dudu is 10%
it's 11% physical damage taken
no
at 3*
it kill Dudu

<@370438895965306882> still Aladdin it is
2-pc: 20% Crit Dmg. While in [6.8 Bottom Stigma] state all characters on-field do 20.0% more physical dmg (non-stack).

3-pc: 20% Physical Dmg. If a team member is in Herrscher form, while in [6.8 Bottom Stigma] state Total Damage dealt to enemies increases by 10.0% (can't stack) if there's a summon on the field this effect increases by 5.0%.

<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
getting reward for being good at the game ?
mean Seele is PSY Physical
MPE is free, her stig are free, her weapon is now also free
MPE weapon being free
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
not because you moved  after entering old address ?
Seele is PSY Physical
Free MPE weapon, no way, it mean she is out of meta in 6.8
<:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
and not because they show up in 6.7 ?
because we don't need to <:ok:1088133019455467560>

<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:okk:1110244301184696360>
That’s why it came out worse than Turg
In V2 it became 12% TDM and 10% more if you have 8.5k HP or you’re Kira
It was 19% TDM  and 5% more if you have 8000 HP in V1
It became worse than Turg cause they shifted the numbers from default buff to exceed HP buff
That’s why they have to add in V2 that “ If use by Kira, always count as max stack “
While having a passive that boost 2000 HP for herself
All near max HP lines
During V1 even Kira need all 6 HP lines to max stacks her own stig
Even Kira wasn’t
They didn’t
From 400 Hp per stack to 500
But they increase the exceed HP needed for max stacks
It was 6k in V1 too
No down low <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

she actually goes <:worrySniperAngry:920552131642142741>
my fucking god
Amazingly shit
Not her kit or her rankup
She is guts by how bad the support is
Yea trust, Nyx has hidden potential
She’s broken
And T2 Ice dps
They scared that Nyx will take the spot of T1 QUA dps
Like Aponia
Should have added a duck for her too
In the middle of the fight Bonya come out with the baby swimsuit
It’s S tier
Yea but if she still wear it even when HFI doesn’t have the skin
What tier is this one <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
What’s up with that
And Nyx still have to use HB ?
Isn’t it omega sad that it’s 2023
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
Yea it would be extremely BM if shit happen every fights

Yea but it have those cutscenes
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
I spent 100$ for mecha malphite
They pick outfit in the circle, Bonya’s swimsuit is picked by Kiana
I atually need to know if Bonya wear her baby swimsuit or not if HFI doesn’t have the skin
Yea pull this one <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
Why are you guys surprising
They give you 20 pulls for free <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
Excet Kallen
Ranked Trio can cover 98% content of the game
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
That is your physical dps
Don’t you already have S2 HFi
GC at best will cost you 10 pulls
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
Okay lil bro, where is the ult if Kiana doesn’t have the skin
why the fuck are you <a:uooh:964118021574623243>

Are we playing the pretend game that CD reduction and sp regen of RC is also not on her gears ?
Literally everyone that care for meta
I even said so before pulling HoH
<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
I mean all the budget players already saw it coming mile away that ice tripple supports are the play by skipping HoH and just pull for elf
Don’t think that is the case during 6.0
<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
It’s not hindsight tho, everyone already see it coming when JK announced before 6.0 launched
If everyone do optimal pulls then no one but T100 Myriad should have HoH in their accounts
Because not everyone do optimal pulls, game is meant to be fun first before considering meta
normal players never use anything but triple supports for ice team
that is only true for top players <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
this is just annoying

<@148145559897636865> they learn the lesson by making HB 2.0 but now has freeze in the kit
<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
she come alone so no discount
ofc no
probably still RC replacement anw, she already has freeze <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
JK is 100% not replacable
that's why i said it's annoying <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
she has freeze and stuffs but no clue if she is meant to replace RC or not
this one is annoying <:shruge:1079371164159311982>

not so much
for Nirv
i think it's a good change for RL
SSS MPE > everyone and their moms S0 on Kallen
Hare 100%
9S PE ofc
Kallen topscore is still PE
max 3 stacks
and Hare has a passive of bloodlust
now it's 1 horse, 1 flute and 1 axe
instead of 1 horse
instead of MPE
to make sure Hare is the top score nwo
oh they changed it again keilo

<:ok:1088133019455467560>
for a choice between IO ( dead ), HoT ( need ranked ) and HoO ( free during 6.5 )
save up to 2k xtals
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
owo math ( 21 * 280 )/1.5
assuming we use Bchip to buy those 21 card with the 1.5 rate compare to xtals
but the cheapest combination is still 1980 * 2 + 120 = 4080
so make it double the amount
for the 980/1980/3280, you can buy each type 2 times for either EXPA or FOCA card
120 Bchips : 10 token + 1 card ( 1 time )
980 Bchips : 100 token + 5 cards ( 2 times ) 
1980 Bchips : 200 token + 10 cards ( 2 times ) 
3280 Bchips : 330 token + 15 cards ( 1 time )
there is the 3280 one
let me do another math
<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
yea 20 cards
To get 1800 token for S-rank
Btw, the price for 410 token in 6.6 spending event is 4080 Bchips

Unless
Your mom also said that
Instead of HC
But for HN
It’s just QUA Whale
She just does everything better because her damage is overkill in Bleed
where weird gimmick are not added
If anything HN’s bosses are one of the better boss
If you fail to meet up damage threshold on HN then you’re on for a ride
It’s the damage that make the difference
That’s like every bosses in existence
HN’s bosses are not even “ use her or die “ <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Yea it’s Hare or die now
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Also that is SS0 BKE
It’s 500D Nirvana
Jfc
These changes are even more tailored than the Big Jelly
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
It’s 4
Not even 2 or 3
sorry gresham, at least we die together on this one <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
<@370438895965306882> <@416445660443967491>
BKE and TP will have one hell of a field trip to clear this one
they added 4 extra mobs to Abyss Aponia
Abyss Aponia is actually just Hare or die
it's fucking over
And it’s the only way for HN to compete on shield bosses
It win 100% on shield boss
Nothing on bili or bbs and beta vids only use it with shield boss
BM this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
go for SSS Hare but use Ely TB instead <:ok:1088133019455467560>
only gresham need it <:ok:1088133019455467560>
test this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
only when they use ultimate tho
elf is summoned unit
he is trying to cook sth
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
they did nerf GC dps tho
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
this one just improve Nirvana shieldbreak performance
you already have 50% impair from spear before
nah it's only a little boost
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
if you don't have BKE
i think she worth the pull tho
unless her S0 can beat SSS BKE
her value won't change nini <:weirdchamp:1079349567901945936>
you actually can't kill 9S Trio jfc <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
9S score 682 on main server
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
 how much does Trio score 
every cycles now people think
it's actually funny if you think about it
S0 HFI are already on the case <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
GC is a better SnS by default just due to 2 simple reasons : she is IMG and now she has impair for shieldbreak <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
also not helping that 2 heavyshield bosses are Otto and SK
1 of SnS weakness is that she has to do shieldbreak before HoS ult
it's probably for Nirvana ngl <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
it's a feature
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<@148145559897636865>
It’s barely a difference between them <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
The mald is the same <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
Except that her score is not better than ranked HoT

Imagine getting your nuts grab by those
I will update later
still too soon
Seem like it
she is just dead
she is dead
no one is using Raven <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
like how on Aponia's weather people use S0 HoT
have to play the game fair and square
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
yea i bet Nirvana will use S0 BKE to compete with them
it's still hillarious when people actually compare S0 Hare and S0 BKE
soon
she has to compete with ranked valk
but problem is still the same with Hare rn
yea Aponia is a good valk
it's called HC
we already have that
just make sure her synergy with FR will be worse
i mean they still can
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>  Mouse
to keep QUA mechanic to stay as it is right now
but GC weapon actually show how far they willing to go
i did think that they could have pull out Lightning QUA
your mom
yea, Nyx was fine due to that, if you use Collapse canon on HB, instead of QUA dps Nyx will become B-rank dps
or at least that dps will have a passive call  Can't put on the same team with FR 
lightning will never have QUA dps
but she won't be lightning
yea what element she will be won't matter
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Trio dominance element side so fucking hard tho
7.0 is probably farmable Hua yea
AT
yea <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Seele is 6.9
it's time for HoS to go
so it's awalys GC -> HoS -> Dps
her ult animation last 10 years like SI
you still won't be able to get HoS shield even with that
that's kinda dark
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
it's time for a put down then
they're redistributed her numbers to match with AT
this ain't it chief
but then she went to fucking sleep
she did summon
yea i mean they make her sound like summoned dps <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
i don't like Hare gameplay so through out 6.6 i will stick to triple physical supports on all physical bosses <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
her schedule match with QUA schedule
do not worry
Seele will be QUA Herrscher
like more lit than SI
GC will be lit once we get into 6.8
unfortunately you can't chief
why did heki using your account ?
yea then she is probably lit for you
cause it mean you just need to go higher rank on BKE
even if she can beat SS0 BKE
she is not worth pulling
like, i still think
you're in RL
relax
i need to see live competition between her and ranked BKE
you will need to ask again in 3 weeks nini
it's meaningless
even if at S0 she beat S0 BKE
like
her case is a hard one
only EU can let idiots step into Myriad
but i bet it's EU
check the server
HoS using MEI stig will have some hard time in Nirvana temp
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
SnS and HN got affected heavily tho
this nerf is normal
no
not another multiplier
mean can't stack
it's unique effect
it's not independent
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
do you know how to read ?
she still can
HoS can basically using it and there were still no damage loss
the trigger condition is too easy
it's obvious her stig gonna be nerfed
HoF vs HFI round 2
Here we go
6.5 Abyss Week 5 P1 
Boss : MHT - 3B 
Weather : Fire
not over HoH and HC
and there is like 0% chance she top score
the boss is not on schedule
how do you know she top score QUA whale ?
unique multiplier for collapsed enemies
if you think about it
HC is literally the first QUA dps
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
yea not when HC is there
so there is no way she is bad in RL
nah she score higher than FR back when temp was 458D
at SSS ofc
her score is actually good for side option
<a:uooh:964118021574623243> Summer
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
your what now
SSS is for fun
SS2 is peak for her performance
but even then SSS HoF is also a terrible investment
it's terrible investment
like if you compare her rank up to HoT and HoF
it's bad on relative scale
but SS Nyx does save her placement
so i settle with +100 score
i can't get Myriad during 5.9 but it's on me because i was busy during it
her rank up do save her tho
but only on release
Nyx fullfil her purpose on release
they're also not Fire dps and physical dps
same go for HC and PE
Nyx is QUA dps and her element is ice
Nyx is not ice dps
yea they have 10 dps in their domain
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Ice SP dps
but Kira will need cracked kit to bypass RC
it's fucking niche af
Bastet is not even good to begin with
yea should be
you have B piece, the useless one outside of MA
definitely not Bastet
EoP, Bastet, stamps
yea they have lot of stuffs you want to get if you miss them
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
You can only get 1390 token as F2P
You need to buy 410 extra token
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
You can’t get the card without swiping
save for Shigure Kira + AT + WS
solid patch
i have all of them so CN outfit it is
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
Grey Cunny
so the spending outfit is basically free
they also give you 10 sp expa card for that
GC supply + 10-20 pulls on expa is enough
yea if you just want the outfit

<@148145559897636865>  i choose you keilo
but i still won't read it
this one is better
cause she is nowhere close to steal ranked BKE yet
yea probably to steal Bloodlust Bio Mech from IO
maybe more than the dps
her own damage is actually relevant
for a shield oriented valk
lol it's actually really important
so SSS
it's maxed
where is re entry ?<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>

Prometheus in ER
i don't use alt
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>

<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
SnS are shieldbreak and Mech dps
Oh wait lmao why the fuck did i suggest replacing SnS with Prometheus
From Fornite ? <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
Ninja is toxic
Better
Change Ninja to the Bio mob that ride horse
They also update Type SK
I just call it Big Bro <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
No pri
In RL
Currently people are struggling to oneshot Kallen P2 with her
She is supposed to do damage but people are struggling to make it happen
To deal with 2 IMG lil bros in Physical Otto
PE need that execution
Even for PE she will still be useful
Replace SnS with Prometheus
You can also use the triple supports team
Exchange with currency
And people still haven’t figured out how to play Prometheus
On both Abyss and MA
Her boss, Aponia is a menace
Not that but more like
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
As expected
Aponia has all 3 elements resistance
If you play from 6.5 you actually can make 2 physical teams
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
Half of 2023 will be physical festival
Now that i realized it
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
Cause i have no interest in Hare
But getting to 20k milestone will be hard in 6.6
Pardo is BP yea
Mini spending like in Aponia + Eden patch
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Ai-chan outfit = spending 
HoT outfit = free from event
It’s spending event
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
I want that CN outfit tho
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
It’s always HN over Hare under normal circumstance
Nvm it’s not a hard one anymore
If she -0 SSS MA i will do this irl
Like SS MA ?
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
HN already -5 Jizo so
Cause i don’t think anyone care about her MA
Waiting for more gameplay on her Abyss side
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
I don’t bother reading their kits yet
And you put Hare weapon active somewhere in there
I think the current rotation is that HoS chain + evede -> Hare QTE -> Prometheus QTE -> Prometheus Combo + Weapon + Ult -> HoS ult -> Hare QTE + Ult
Yea i think the idea is cool, still look rough around the edge
The summon is definitely have more moveset than Hare
Yea i don’t even think you use her normal like at all
<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
You press A, fill the bar and then press B to do a finisher
But it’s 2023 Honkai
I did expect Hare gameplay to be somewhat complicated
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<@148145559897636865> 30 seconds long minigame before you can start the fight
Also lmao did you see MA Aponia gameplay ?
Hare on other side is like what i expected
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
I think people in beta are also struggling to use her
Probably still V1
In performance yea <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
Hare need it so they put Spear on her with different codes from Lance
Susanah doesn't need the new mechanic so she use Chakram <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
less work for the devs
it will save time for creating character like her in the future
the reason why they create spear on her due to her gameplay mechanic that's all
what kind of question is that
because the mechanic of both are different ? <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
not missing even a single one
they put all the shield bosses in existence to beta atm
better not skip Prometheus
the annoying one
the one that will turn invisible once in a while
the one riding the horse
change Ninja to the normal Bio Mob
they also update SK boss
Shieldbreak - Fu Hua
look like it
it's new stage
not Fu Hua
so watch out
they update the stun bar
if not then it's Aslaug turn
did they add Aslaug in there yet ?
too new
skin will be around like 20k ?
yea that one
so no paid skin in 6.6
Ai-chan is spending
oh HoT skin is from event
cause i need to see if she has any insane combo with Prometheus
but ask again 2 weeks from now
If you have 12/12 Physical team with MPE => Skip both, pull Prometheus
If you don't have a proper physical dps except PE -> Skip Hare, pull Prometheus + Susanah
maybe later
no stun weather too
but that is about it
she can stun
SK shield is not big shield
that will depend on her buff number
it's called Physical Otto
we already have 1
Prometheus will definitely score higher
just make normal boss with shield
i mean they don't need to
<@148145559897636865> 1st impression about Prometheus, it look like she is just Griseo without Bleed
6.5 Abyss Week 4 P1
Boss : Bright Knight - Excelsis
Weather : Lightning
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
She is still a physical dps that have crit in her kit
Even when she is summoned dps
Hare is another physical dps
Neko
So at beast she look like only have 3 weathers
But S0 Hare is another story
SSS Hare will probably steall all BKE’s bosses too
Summoned Entity for IO is just a passive to share damage across enemy
It have a different meaning with Hare
Unless the boss have elemental resistance
Or HB/HTR
As long as there is a cross user in the team
Anyone can steal it
Summoned Weather - Aponia
Her new weather also only have 1
And she doesn’t look like she will steal anything from BKE
Even then what matter is still Abyss coverage
Starting to look like a bait
Hare stig look normal
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Honkai Nilou
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
We’re not playing Genshin
Like does it change anything ?
Why does everyone keep acting suprised at new weapon type ?
And Type HoS + Physical Jizo only belong to her assuming S0 Hare can even beat SS0 BKE
so just looking by numbers Hare value is nowhere near to HN <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
HN has like 5 weathers, they're all Bleed with different bosses
not including Type Huodou because it belong to HoR <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
for now i can think of 3 weathers Hare will be the topscore :
+ Type HoS
+ Physical Jizo
+ Her weather
it will all depend on her Abyss value
but HN already -5 on MA Jizo so there really not much value on Hare tbh <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
for the value between pulling Susanah and Hare i won't say it too soon, i will need to see how many weathers Hare will have and how does her MA boss work <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
HoT outfit look normal than i thought <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
look like tmr
and Teri will be the discount valk
if they focus on her
Seele is probably 6.9
that valk will have passive call  Can't be on the same team with FR 
if we ever have one
there will never be Lightning QUA dps
with this i can guarantee 1 thing
they went all the way to make sure physical can only have 1 collapse skill
yea probably
they change it that way for a reason
she is not gauntlet for fun
that's why they went all the way to change her into gauntlet
Prometheus holding cannon mean she could use QUA cannon
QUA Seele is coming
forgot for a moment
oh wait she physically can't be cannon lmao
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
you will only see her weapon trigger + ult
and like 90% of the time you won't even see those animations
long ass ult animation again with no timestop
her flag form is not what i expected but spear form is okay <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
Hare spear form looking sick
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
she is still Bonya
Prometheus is still cannon
they code weapon type into the suit
she won't
you're not playing a valk without their sig weapon anw
and it won't make any diff
they can introduce new weapon type every patch
this is not Genshin
relax
it doesn't matter
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
she looks cool wtf
yo <@370438895965306882> this is a hard one
if we're talking about the most famous hero with spears then it could be 趙雲
it's a body of Chinese hero
it's not Hare
wonder who is the one holding the spears
in ranked sex, they call the POK of Toronto <:DK:840944972383780874>
but this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>  can go somewhere
but in the end they chose not to
they have a lot of setup that can be used if they want to to go with GGZ route
in case they want to use the reincarnation thing like in GGZ
they just want to put it here and there
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
dorm voiceline of Hua and Carole,  Hua has a feeling she already met Carole before in the past
same case with Himeko, Mei nad others
nah it was on purpose
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
they don't want to seperate Can and Felis even if it make no sense
like Batman and Robin
like for them, Can is just a part of Felis
when Kevin didn't know Can exist
even in Kevin's last dream
they put Can almost everywhere
Can is only a symbol for them
<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
or else she could have been SP
Raven died due to this
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
that's why it will be the way
literally no one ask for it
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
Ignite Bio dps
new Hua will definitely fill in the spot of Bio Fire
when new Hua is near
but no point in doing that
they could try to save DA
now is the era of Bleed dps, Summoned dps, Ignite dps
they already solved the formula to making new valks and new shill
there probably won't be a 4th attempt
and 7TR is the most broken shit ever
it's their 2nd attempt to revive a valk using DK
what bug me is 7TR
i think HoT on her released is fine
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
instead of trash
literally her usage getting less by each patch by the time Mihoyo know how to design real valks
when real valks show up she become the trash
that's why people use her on everything
HoV was competing with trash
HoV didn't even have that much shill
she is strong because she was too strong
compare to BKE, HoT shill was normal
the meta only speed up after the introduction of Pri-arm
this is what Superstring look like in 4.2
when Superstring didn't even have many weather
3 patches after release is still new
back in 4.x version
nah
3.9 : BKE
4.0 : SA
4.2 : Superstring
that's like 3 patches after her release
and when superstring was introduced
she was already good by the time SA released

It’s EE concept art
the bug where you block heki
yea i really enjoy when Karashi keep trying to be Akane's rival but Akane simply view him as someone that is in the same generation with her and didn't hesitate to learn from him  <:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
it does feel that way but so far the autor keep the pacing of the story really well so maybe i just worry for nothing   <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
yea honestly speaking, i don't know if having rivals are a good things for Akane cause i don't want to feel like im reading a battle manga, im  leaning on Akane bashi being a journey of Akane finding answers from various encounters more 
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Just because dude was popular with girl fanbase of Conan
I feel so fucking pissed when Bourbon became the good guy in Conan
The baseball guy
I have been following his works since i was 10
If you’re into slice of life and chill manga i’d also suggest Adachi Mitsuru sensei’s works <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
Even when you compare to some cracked manga in the 2000-2010
But Akane is still good tho
So the standard might be low
Manga industry have been entered a slump ever since the golden era ended
The manga deserve way more fame than it currently have
But such a shame
Yea it’s a niche subject
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
Omg it’s Diluc and Layla from Genshin Impact
I have never cry from reading or watching anything so i can’t tell
Depend tho
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Not really
Like 45 chapters sth
That one is lit yea
Actually nuts
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
And the manga portrait it perfectly
Yea i spent 3 months to do research on it and holy fuck i realized how much depth that Rakugo have
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
But it’s so niche that it went under the radar
Like not even close to any others
Akane is easily the best on-going manga rn in WSJ
Time to self check, react with paimonthink to carv last message

how about grabbing this instead <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>

<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
my bad
wow that one is kinda dark
neither does Da Wei
it's against the promises they made with community
they can't release 2 gacha S-rank on same patch without 1 being free
this one
the devs working their asses off for a free game
that much amount of contents every 6 weeks
cause i still think Genshin is nut
yea i get it, i still wish i could enjoy Genshin like others do
but still a great game
like how Genshin doesn't fit for me cause it have no competitive aspect
in fact i never actually hate any games i ever quit i think, i just hate certain aspect and it drive me away
not WoW in general
cause we quit WoW due to the disappointment in Blizzard
we still keep up with the information
it's normal, it's like how i was when me and my guild quit WoW
not disappointed in Honkai
Keilo disappointed in Honkai competitive
don't mistaken keilo's attitude as  don't care for Honkai anymore

yea on V3

<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
without SSS HoS <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
she scores 800 on Mega Mob 500D
she is not outscoring anyone in QUA weathers and definitely not taking anything from Type/Physical weathers
so far she is still a niche valk in Abyss yea <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
scuffing her MA performance sound weird

He still did Abyss and MA during that time iirc <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

It’s like

His competitive blood won’t settle with mediorce score
He can’t help it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I thought 7T HoT steal it back <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

Struggling to find who asked
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
She does beat HoT records so it’s still impressive
SSS HoS and SI is just craked <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Yea isn’t that what going to happen anw if a real valk show up
But on Abyss outside of Bleed Weather, she is just an average one
Maybe on MA performance
Lowkey I don’t think she needs heavy nerf
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
She is good at being bad
the only thing free is here <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
she already has 1 less RNG layer than others
a physical valk that doesn't require crit
her gameplay is peak braindead
no joke but

the hardest valk rn is HoO and she is not even that hard
it does not matter, it's Honkai 2023
she better have timestop with Pri then
that is the saddest thing if it's true
lmao no time stop on ult
that's won't change anything, even if they release Kiana and Mei 10 patches later they will still look exactly like this

if you can't afford 2 pcs of HFI stigs  then just use Turg
there is no other combination exist that does not include her signature stig
but at least it's enough for RL
terrible
but yea it's assuming 4/4 HTR and HoO
Aslaug or mid Mei, you still want her to do damage
put Turg on HFI if you can't afford her stigs

Don’t ask if you don’t know

Like half an hour ago
Already
6.4 Abyss Week 1 P1
Boss : The Bull
Weather : Imaginary
Kinsen singing under Kalpas impression in Spring Gala
don't let him cook
yea that's not cooking
probably bracket RNG too
i saw someone used RC weapon on her with Zhenyi and still retain
yea it's not that bad even in SEA Nirv
the least punished valk without sig weapon
probably Aponia
JK is garbage without weapon
HoH is trash without 4/4
can be used without weapon
i don't think any dps from 6.0 onward
it can't be worse
kinda broken
yea it's 0% compare to her weapon
“ Fight for all that is beautiful in the world “
best case scenario pulling SS is 70 pulls and get the card
it doesn't
Time to pull the trigger then
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
They’re updating beta on update day in CN ?
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
Wonder who T1 bull and tree now
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Probably still stop at S2
<:DK:840944972383780874>
Cute voice
<a:pogfish:1063841859664891978>
20k short from the goal
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
Should be sth like this
So judging from the coverage, if you’re in 
- RL : 4/4 Mei > 4/4 Kiana > Elf > Mei Rank 
- Nirvana : 4/4 Mei > 3* Elf > 4/4 Kiana = Mei Rank
Currently from beta, the coverage look like this 
- Kiana : Kevin, Benares, Ignite/Fire weathers in general
- Mei : Bull, Tree, lightning/para weather in general
They don’t need anything but Bio Dps
You know what is the problem with physical atm ?
Me and nini will be like
<a:pogfish:1063841859664891978>
Guys, she is broken
You’re supposed to say
And he pulled SS HC
Gresham gaslight her into skipping HC
Have you seen nini skip anything
It’s physically impossible buddy
Oh i just don’t think HoO is a valk before S2
Is 4* elf broken ? <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
How about you get some gears on your support first
<a:SeeleNoted:874736846259781692>
S0 Kiana S2 Mei 3* elf
To have the baseline for Trio
84k for 6.4
Adding extra 14k on top of 70k needed
that is concerning <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
i genuinely ask for more fund <@385655541248163840>
6.4 is so expensive
extra 50 pulls if you want to compete T1 on Bull and Tree
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
don't roll HoO if you join later <:mfw:840549220406263859>
why even bother with alternatives
you only need 40 cards to 4/4 her
literally no one need this
With this 6.3 is officially over

It’s Origin and Finality frame
the one on Pixiv is better <:DK:840944972383780874>
ain't no way
heki and saving in 1 sentence
so her signatures are worth it now
her damage went up a little bit with V2B
aslaug this instead <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
if they push Nirvana change in like 5.5 then even PE is not exactly a must pull either
off the top of my head i can only think of PE as a must pull but it's also because of old Nirvana format back then
when even was the last time a DPS considered as  must pull 
always have been
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
AE best valk ever
kith you're way too confident on being wrong

6.3 Memorial Arena Week 4
Physical have SnS and MPE, Ice have RC + JK
And rn ice + physical have the best budget options
Usually you want to cover at least 2-3 elements and ignore 1
But that is if you like ice
Yea for Ice she is still the best pick
<:DK:840944972383780874>
It’s the “ Pick 1 column and do it in this order “  type of guide
Not that
<:DK:840944972383780874>
The priority won’t change even after V3
It’s investment prior
It’s not tier list
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
Some what now
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
Yea my bank account is on fire alright
Financial damage
Mei and Kiana ult in coop <:DK:840944972383780874>
is that a bug or nah ? <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
by stealing Aslaug
she is broken alright
yea nothing wrong with it <:DK:840944972383780874>
what's wrong
spear form is melee
3 days
probably, i don't pay much attention to V2 <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
SS is for buffing Kiana
until S2 iirc
but it's 9S
there is one
<:DK:840944972383780874>
8k coins in Floor 8th
the 58s run abused Felis strat
oh wait i just realised
they just need to buff Combo 3 damage
probably not, it's just damage distribution problem
so it's better to skip combo 3 and use ult in super time stop
hitlag problem, if you do Combo 3 -> Ult -> Combo 1 + 2 buff will ran out
im on the case <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
can't milk players that way
she won't have damage trouble at S0 anymore
if they put too much team buffs in her stigs
the other combination is Mei TM and Cez B
yea
only in Benares and Kevin
for normal weathers you don't need Mei to contribute damage
yea Mei's stigma are lacking in support aspect
Literally have to wait 5 weeks for her

6.3 Abyss Week 4 P2
Boss : RPC - 6626
Weather : Ice Up
usually Monday or Tuesday
before patch go live
cool bro <:DK:840944972383780874>
What is combo 3 <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
the only elf worth to 4* is Dudu
most elfs work at 3* for capscore
as long as the ult CD is not at 4*
total of 150
<:DK:840944972383780874>
for the giggle
because her Ult CD is at fucking 4*
the only elf that is broken at 4* is Dudu
probably not broken enough
<:DK:840944972383780874>
i don't even know what 4* Klein does
or try to look into 4* Klein
if you don't plan on using elfs or stamps then i will just prior Wafers -> Dorm buffs
<:DK:840944972383780874>
or wafers
probably just dorm buffs then
and try to 3* her
just Klein <:DK:840944972383780874>
look like it <:DK:840944972383780874>
only after V3 we will have constant adjustments until patch go live
<:DK:840944972383780874>
they won't be polished until V3
i will need more polished into 2 new animations tho
these changes so far look good <:echok:977515701961117706>
it look good in actual combat <:echok:977515701961117706>
<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
not showing it's represent the  blazing flame  enough
still think the cape is not detail enough
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
instead of polishing the cape
still don't know why they change the hair
beta survey is out
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
Only niche team
No more niche dps/support
Honkai new generation
<:DK:840944972383780874>
S1 HoF is broken
Now that’s copium
They only want them to dominate as a team
They still don’t want the trio to be broken standalone
I mean yea that’s the point
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
So does HoFin too
She is not meant to be a broken dps
Better not keeping your hope that high
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Not just playerbase complaining
They have a lot of things to worry about in China
I didn’t expect those poses to go through beta in the beginning
It’s fine <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
V2 only shop change and stuffs matter
It’s normal for V2 <:DK:840944972383780874>
The what now
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:dongerj:981641448057356289>
Kiana look at Mei in V1 :
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
Luna your pfp is disturbing
Around this time CCP will be more strict than usual
It’s near CNY
Also im 50% sure that the reason why they removed 2 close up poses from Kiana is not because of the community complaining
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Kiana
She looks like Hu tao now
<:DK:840944972383780874>
No matter the race or nation
It’s always normal when community have stupid opinions flying around
So yea, nothing new <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Life or death matter
Yea their beef are like Carv and Twitter beef
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
Also im not gaslighting or anything but among the current haters there are also AK and PGR playerbase in CN
People that love the design still love it
They are the same people that have been complaining since the start
I mean haters are gonna hate anw <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
With the amount of times he keep repeating it while im explaining stuffs i don’t think it’s a joke
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
As long as human are still human, we will never reach a peaceful conclusion
I mean in the end it’s just a matter of opinions
Maybe in heki’s perspective she does look like that due to different culture, workplace
I mean if we’re being real
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
That’s why we can’t live peacefully together
Human tend to have different perspective hak
Just like how Heki think Kiana is dressing like a whore
If they even change anything about her dress, im out <:DK:840944972383780874>
Like im fine with whatever change they imply on Kiana as long as it’s not her dress
Even in this small server we already argue in heat
20% the population of the Earth
They have 20 social media platforms
The community is always like that
Should be good to go
Just need to polish the new animations and zoom the camera in when she does it
These changes look normal
She do a kick now to end it
They change the end animation of ATS yea
<:DK:840944972383780874>
Less lewd
She has 10% more hair now
As long as you confront with the major group you will always find out that they know nothing about the game in general
That’s the mass in general
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
I struggling to find who asked
6.3 Abyss Week 4 P1
Boss : Herrscher of Corruption - Elysia
Weather : Meele
beta survey
they will show later in survey
not yet
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
they will give CNY rewards for GLB in GLB anni
as expected
sure bud
<:DK:840944972383780874>
It used to be not that low until Blizzard fuck everything up
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
They would still be bettet than 90% company out there
Yea even when Mihoyo at their lowest
I don’t expect anything anymore
Even GoT SS10
I have been through so much
Yea i think it’s because of expectations
They’re just Kiana changing different costumes and you have to gacha for it
Shit like New Year Kiana, Summer Kiana, Winter Kiana, Nurse Kiana, Mommy Kiana
Cause i have played a bunch of gacha before this one
Like i think new suits are basically just mean new
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
Yea but her action wouldn’t change even if she didn’t know
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
Cause her resolve have never really changing or anything
PE was more like adding context
When she was 12
She is also at her peak
Tbh all Dudu’s suits also doesn’t have character development
Unlike heki
at least you try to be open about it
Yea it’s fine
Kiana is like at the peak of everything
Compare to Mei and Bronya who had some issues
Her transformation is just another step
She is already at her peak
Like i have been saying before we got this suit
It’s the community that want HoTE from GGZ
The devs vid didn’t imply that
I mean they didn’t really try to sell it that way
The answer is because she is Kiana
Why of all people it’s her that have to do this
Who she is
It’s more like her resolve
But she is not shoulder everything alone
I mean with the lack of context i can’t really explain much
It’s community joke
Don’t take the moon part seriously keilo
The context between the 2 suits are different by a lot
No heki, it’s your reading skill make it bad
It will make sense once we know her fate in chapter 35
HoFin was born to shoulder responsibility
HoF was born to overcome despair
The difference between HoF and HoFin is that
HoFin is just Kiana and Kiana alone <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
No Hua reference, no Himeko reference, no Bronya, no Mei
Like she and herself alone
HoFin is what supposed to be Kiana
HoF is not Kiana’s legacy btw
HoF is inheritance of those journey along with her
Just like my parents
They found the most white name start with K
Same with how they named Kevin Kevin
Yea Herrschers are just like a cool word Mihoyo found out
<:DK:840944972383780874>
Yea they’re Archon in Greek alright
Is pissing me off
And the lack of respect toward lore
But their attitude
I mean the designs are good ig
Special QTE and special ult
I mean that would defeat the point of hiding it, no ?
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
More like unlocking it, this should have been there at the start of 6.3, they just lock it away until 6.4
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
it just  what's next 
no such thing as unlucky or lucky
so as long as you keep swiping eventually it avg out
but then on other patches you get sth like 40 pulls and 4/4 SP supply
0 stig
80 pulls and 10 uprate weapons
back then you can get sth like
yea it's normal
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
by next year
eventually every F2P can 4* them
yea it's fine, they're giving out Klein and Dudu like supersale <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
it just depend on situation
at the cost of 10k
which refund banner already cover nearly 20k
you only need like 40k to get a 2* elf
should still pull in 6.3 if you don't want anything in particular in 6.4 spending shop <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
yea that's fine <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
ult every rot
used to be big for MA and Abyss
regen sp
or 30 sth
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
they give like 35 cards in CNY
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
it's always pulling in 6.3 if that's the case
assuming you use 60 pulls and get her within 60, it will leave you with 16k + cards, whole patch saving around 14-16k and free cards in 6.4 so in total by the time you collect all 6.4 rewards, leave you around ~35k + ~40-50 cards <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
her S2 is as useful as Eden's signet in ER
with CN + HTR
i actually mean it btw
her S2 is basically useless now
they update her new year chibi <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
what is your pity count on EXPA ?<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
this is accounting all the cards already ?
<:DK:840944972383780874>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
they're busy uploading new designs
current xtals balance and goal ?
go for both, HoF doesn't need more than S1 now
S1 HoF and elf boxes
only HoF card
all that effort and not even putting anything into reading
and so so sad
that is so so bad

<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
time sure flies
it's already next week
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
or else i will actually turn blind
my eyes are extremely sensitive with intese light so i actually can't keep looking at it too much
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
yea cause you're blind
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
so i never care about ult animations
like no matter how cool an ult animation is, your eyes will eventually get tired out of it
i usually alt tab out to read discord message anw
idc about ult animations
oh i mean their normal animations <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
hope tmr they add SFX and done polished part of HoFin and HoO kit
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
i mean you can try to 110 if you think it's possible ig <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
just stop
if you get to 60 milestone and already get her card
i mean it doesn't matter how many pulls you have <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
V3 usually for adjustment
yea all the event shops and shop update will be in V2 <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
if you have 60 pulls that is
for the box
it's always pull in 6.3
unless there is something you really want in CNY spending shop
HoO stamps in ER shop please
stig reveal and shop changes are in V2
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
tmr
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
yea CN get it twice
yea i don't remember 5.5 reset xtals bonus for SEA <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
yep <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
i only have decent luck, i'd be happy if i can just SS
yea i will try to SS if possible <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
we will see
i will probably go to 190
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
like even just 60 pulls are better
you should always pull in 6.3
compare to SEA
thinking they have cracked rewards
yea that one kinda make GLB players turn delusional
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
The amount of rewards are fixed so nothing more nothing less
With the emblem
They will give CNY rewards as GLb anni
More ? <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
So Kiana will be HoFin - HoF - Highschool Kiana
Zoom in
In the box
It’s HoO T - HoT M - Highschool Mei B
Mei’s stigma reveal
Oh shit
to be expected
no elf box neither
no HoO stamps in spending
SN HoR HoV
Mei's stamps in ER please
tmr is V2 <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
they don't even know what they want
people just complain for the sake of complanining <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
top notch agrument : 
-They need to make Kiana's ult flashier
-Okay, any idea on how to do it without losing Kiana's unique ? 
-I don't know, it's their job
if anything at best it's 50/50 <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
when NGA are actually making fun of the opposite side
also i don't know why people keep saying  entire CN are complaining  <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
actually a pile of trash
i have been constantly muted in maincord cause the dumb mods in there don't know Chinese or don't try to learn the context behind her design
i wish people could shut the fuck up for a moment and realised that they're playiNG HI3 <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
let me check it <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
i just don't like the cape and extra sleeve just because people are getting turned on by HoTE in GGZ
yea adding some textures on her legs is fine <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
her cape
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
which she already complain on HoF
that much details will actually hinder her movements
and dps is as niche as ever not like before
supports not replacing each other but instead creating different scenario to use
the current state of powercreep is actually in a weird spot
Main problem :
1) Powercreep -> Ever since 1.0
2) Triple Herrscher Released -> Literally at the end of part 1 
3) Finality Design -> Dumbfuck playing wrong game for 6 years 
4) HoHE being on Beginner Supply -> Retard
that's kinda racist
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
wrong nation buddy
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
instead of saving it
no people believe that she must dress like she is about to destroy the universe
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
SS Assaka <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
6.3 Memorial Arena Week 3
so her dps rn is higher than it's supposed to be <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
And you can count her buffs to Kiana with 1 hand
Her stigs are not cracked enough to support Kiana
<:life:1001518241610485781>
Mei is not motivated enough
<:shrug:1016228944330100757>
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
more dmg taken iirc
bro i scroll pass through 30 pages to find 1 post on that tweet, these are what top posts look like
literally only porn artist complain on lofter
 so many artist 
bro
1 wrong input and all your damage gone
But trio rotation right now is too hard
Trio is still better
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Her dmg is actually nut in the clip you posted, beating HoF on raw damage output is an amazing feat
i shit on a mod instead
this time it's kinda fun tho
i was born to shit on idiots
<:OkaygeBusiness:900551897251979317>
also just got muted from maincord again
 After playing 6 years and all you want is a suit from other game, what a way to waste your life  <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
in fact on NGA and Tieba people are making fun of those that want  HoTE  instead of  Kiana 
0.1% people playing this game
3k people is like
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
6.3 Abyss Week 3 P2 
Boss : Benares
Weather : Chrono Navi Up
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Bonya did get an insane buff while being a 3rd wheel tho
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
The boss have stalling mechanic
her best build is simulated Mei and Bonya in the team <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
They will die even before finishing a Flamechaser
16 Floors of ER
Even if it’s the best one
Also there is no way someone recommend that signet
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
It’s ER
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Made in Heaven from Queen
Cause iirc Jojo named stands based on Rock culture
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Isn’t it Made In Heaven
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Once you guys are in Uni/College
Make sure to not join the shady groups
It’s a club kind of thing <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
I can’t stand orgy, i particapted once and can’t even get hard during my Uni
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Tet you’re a virgin
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
It’s always lady first
Tet, do this irl <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Elysia is a bait <:evil:1049317760984940574>
There is no such thing as flawless anw
Ofc there are still flaws
Same go for Kiana. Flamescion is her living up to Himeko, the will of the flame but at her core she is supposed to be more free, more joyful, like WC. HoFin is that kind of suit
Goodbye to someone does not mean completely erase their traces from existence. HoT is still her, her once powerless self, acknowledge the past and move forward the future is what she does
We all change, we’re all different people all through our life. And that’s a good thing, we need to keep movong forward so long we don’t forget who we used to be.
Becoming a new you does not mean you have to get rid of the past you. At her core she is still a Samurai and Herrscher of Thunder. She is not someone that was born to be Herrscher of Origin
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Not gone if you don’t use her joint QTE immediately
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Will have to watch like 10 cutscene per boss fight
People that use all 3 in Nirvana
Lol i just realised
Why are you wogging <:evil:1049317760984940574>
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
They both transfer 100% dmg to the core
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Cause he know too well how to make money
In term of business i’d actually want to work under someone like Mihoyo’s CEO
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
So they know their new audiences
I mean they have a big pool of examples in Genshin
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Im eating burger and fries rn so i can’t think of anything, tell me if they’re broken or not later
So i guess yes
They’re the one that let Mihoyo become this big
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
You need some cash first
They’re trying to save the world alright
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Patch that make you want to take a break
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Me when i open my secret folder
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Btw Kiana has an ego signet that will pretend that Mei and Bonya is on the team in ER
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
FT release was even cheaper
Not the 1st time
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
But it’s 4 ice in a row
Yea i guess it’s cool since she is the OG Trio
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
What’s the point of reviving HoR then
Like
Im actually against it now since they also release new Bonya 2 patches after
That would make JK release a lot better
And no need to revive HoR
Yea i still think HoH should be Mech <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Only bilibili and hoyolab CN complain
On NGA everyone like her design
Half like it and half complaining about it
It’s 50/50 in CN
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
She could potentially steal Parvati and AKA
I did expect new Kiana to take the lead by like 5-10% for raw dps but if they’re equal then HoF will keep all her bosses  <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Oh in the clip he is talking about peeking BKE’s panties
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Her ult still feel a litle stiff
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Cool, care to explain it like im Donald Trump ?
PE is on her last straw
She only score 30 pts higher than triple ice supports ?
You know that if PE can’t one shot HoD core
Like dead dead
So she is just dead
Even PE can’t one shot core anymore with S0
I mean if temp keep growing
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
So the whole point of trio is to skip everything for the cutscene
Also i think you can even skip Bonya ult with Kiana QTE
It’s Super Cutscene alright <:evil:1049317760984940574>
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
How high is it ? This high <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992> ?
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Definitely can’t do it like fhem tho
I know how to make NS deal enough dmg to kill boss
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
People use PX and be like AAAAAAAA
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Cause of Hua new suit
Like i think from 1.0 to 3.5 Honkai was the hardest game to get into
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
That’s kinda pog ig
Does PGR even supposed to be hard in playing any characters ?
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Not what you guys are thinking
Oh i mean “ use AE “ like a Nirvana should be
By using newest toys
Because Nirvana is so easy that even bad players can go to it
Even Nirvana players nowaday don’t know how to use AE
Yea it’s sadly the true
They will 10 fold it by V3 <:evil:1049317760984940574>
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Need a super quick one alright
Yea you can’t piss for more than 30 seconds
They can’t really fuck up the mechanic of the game too
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
I think it’s fine
Yea it’s only for the cool concept
It is what it is
QoL improvement
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
You can use it when you’re eating tho
Yea it just for cool purpose, it’s basically just a combo with timestop
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Clip and ship it
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
And Kevin transition phase require you to deflect 3 types of dmg from elemental balls
He has elemental shield, he will take extra dmg from that element but when you broke the shield, he gain that element resistance and change to another elemental shield
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Oh you haven’t watched Kevin’s fight yet ?
Need to stop hanging on the ceiling
Yea new year new season started
This emote is kinda <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
No more aint no way, time to use <:evil:1049317760984940574> more often
I meam she still have Absolute Time Fracture alone <:evil:1049317760984940574>
Mei’s description state that she is QUA
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
This is how you overpowered PE
They actually cracked the code
Bonya being the 3rd wheel again
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Haven’t seen anyone posted her kits
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Mei is also executed, no ?
25 is 5% more than normal
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Oops misinfo again
With other 2
Only 25%
Oh wait her indepdent effect is not 50%
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
But HoF made everyone forgot about it for a year
Fire was and has been always dog shit until CN show up to fix it
For entire year
But HoF alone make Fire look good
Like everyone think HoT is the most OP valk rn right ? But that is because other factors contribute in to make her look like a beast
Dps window, TF, smoothness, all perfect
I mean yea how are you supposed to design a better HoF
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Mei QTE condition : Time Fracure or Kiana using combo attack, any Kiana
Joint QTE
Outside rn
Im just traslating picture
Yea people are testing it
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
With this much stats does she even have breach ?
From 20%
Her independent effect is boosted to 50% fire dmg taken
If she is in the team with other 2
Ain’t no way
Not Himeko tho <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Domain of Nameless/Unnamed : The Beginning of Everything
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
Eden also got a Pri
You mean 5
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
You mean SUPER TIME FRACTURE ?
Wrong name
Bzzz
Too cute
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
not really abnormal
he just seek for some attentions
okay maybe that's too harsh <:Clussy:1006905943520452690>
that guy is the worst among the worst
do not take anything that guy said seriously
gres
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
what's up with Genshin and putting pepe's eyes in every objects
SUPER CUTSCENE <a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
REAL TIME STOP <a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
SUPER TIMEFRACTURE <a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
WHERE IS IT
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i want it now
i don't wait
there is no way they delayed the Super Suit again
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
I think the skin look great but i just don’t like forced fan service
But Honkai is still a waifu game so fan services are needed
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Should have done it like Yun Jin
I don’t like some fan service parts they put on HoF new year skin too but it is what it is
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
At least HoFin effect is purple
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Also yea lately they have been using too much pink/white and i can’t really blame them
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Still using the bait
This one is a tribute to Kiana herself
Like it’s not a tribute to everyone that had past through her life like with HoF
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
This one is more symbolic yea, im still struggling to find which flower is that
Yea she doesn’t really look special but that is because they want to keep all the traits of her journey from WC to HoF. It’s not exactly a transformation, think of her suits as her growing up
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Yea it look good on her
Not every cool designs are best designs, cool designs only look cool but do not mean it fit the context
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
She likes to watch Homu Heroes, use baseball bat to beat bad guys
Not 37
She is 17
That look literally ignore all the context of the game
So 120 frags to SS
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Yea tmr
Else she stay at S0
I will try to SS her if spending or anything can provide some stamps
<:peepoYes:965975508829483030>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
damn it <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
wait i just realised, 3 days muted mean tmr i can't bait people by saying HTR is a bait <:HMM:966625453194485760>
i don't remember too, last time Vertex type anything was like 2 weeks ago iirc  <:evil:1049317760984940574>
useless mods go everywhere and stir up shit
there are some good mods but good mods don't do anything outside of their channel
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
that's as efficient as politician
they took 1 day to mute me
probably from yesterday
yea it's from maincord
as if reporting to these dudes even do anything
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
just do this irl <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
1 more whore and i will show how to use a rope in your house <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Selene counterpart is Luna
Selene is the Titan of the moon
Diana is the Roman name of Goddess of The Moon, her Greek counterpart is Artemis
you guys don't even know Diana the goddess of the moon, she is literally what the name Kiana coming from <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
her suit is literally inspired from Diana, wdym by  more clothes  <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
he is lower than nini <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
their new suits have context behind it
heki even if there were  cooler  designs doesn't mean it's better <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Tet is so virgin everyone think she is from Virginia
relax Tet, you're both virgin, just embrace each other <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
or some of the Asian countries too
also isn't it legal in Japan to marry your cousin ? <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
you're virgin
hak wtf <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Tet, nini grown up with Family Guy, why do you even surprised
having sex on plane or the airport iirc
<:gaykiss:1000428892768714762>
it mean how close you're to your partner when you dance, is it enough to fit Jesus in
16 hours
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
before CN
if you don't have Sirin it's literally impossible to ignite her full bar until the last animation
SPA have ignite and she literally can't even ignite AKA full bar without AE
dps haveing trauma in their kit actually mean nothing
i mean it doesn't really matter <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
mine is SSS so i don't know if S0/SS has anything change but it's still the 5 NA - CA - weapon - 5 NA - 3 NA - CA for me <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
sorry eli it's physically impossible to steal Heimdall <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
HoFin will most likely be able to steal AKA and Parvati ?
yea Heimdall can't be stolen, Tank also can't
HoF's bosses get reduced by 1
if her dps > HoF it's her boss
but Benares is typeless
she definitely could, don't have her numbers rn tho
yea Ai-chan is gonna be as useful as SnS <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722>

i will count on you nini, gresham tricked my 70 pulls into CN, im broke
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
they need to prepare for 6.4 too
even CN can't afford everything
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
there are like 100 refs of S0 HTR using as support in CN Nirvana
for CN Nirvana
what's wrong ? <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
but SS is where she work like a normal valk
copeable at S0/S2
probably gonna be like SPA
<:clueless:973756617109676032>

There is nothing wrong with skipping HTR, she is eventually will be mandatory  just like AE back then but not like you have to pull her now
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>

Moon Form = can't time fracture
Time Form = timer won't move
Finality form = rewind time
imagine
doesn't look like it but we will see
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
and the 2nd one is too busted to be real
yea i can only think of it as 2 things :
-Made up name by Kiana
-As long as her domain is up, timer won't move
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
15 hours until SUPER TIME STOP
that is enough yapping
and everyone is just protecting Mihoyo
than accept being wrong
he would rather think he is the innovating one
probably but even more fucked up is that <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
because he is able to see some shit that i can't even understand how he come up with that
that guy level of reading skill is off the chart
you're describing mecha <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:hugging:659956388373463046>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
they don't even bother to read 90% of new info
even in lore channel where people pretend to be more than normal players
some outright hate it
cause not everyone are invested in Elysia or Flamechasers in general
so only the last chapter matter
yea i think the problem with current arc for normal players is that, it's already too obvious after Bonya turn Herrscher
busted but niche at the same time
you can say that point in every patch
yea ever since they cracked the code on designing busted valks
when someone start typing a storm
cause i tab out of that server
it's just the 1st message i saw
it's 1 hours ago
first line and i already gave up
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
peak maincord message
cause literally no one ask <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
but i don't think i have ever yell it to everyone face
i hate a lot of the designs too
yea i have always hate how people disrespect the choice of the artist without bother to ask  Why did they choose it to be this way  <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
:kkona:
this one just happen to be it
each country have their own view on some specific stuffs
yea i think it's fine
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
i grown up with Beijing Opera until my family moved to Canada
yea it's the difference in culture
it kinda suck but i don't dislike people because of it
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
yea it's the same with Yun Jin
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
i don't like the cape that much, could have been more polished
think it's great, some fanservice around her abs but it's represent the fresh of spring
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
how do you expect them to appreciate the meaning that lying under each suit
50% of playerbase can't read
this has always been the problem between Mihoyo's designers and their playerbase
the grammar are all over the place
because Bilbili users are NA's users that use google translate to make Chinese post
and i will tell you the reason why
only on Bilibili people are complaining
on NGA 90% of them love Kiana's design
the suit is literally what she think is cool
ofc she can go all goofy
Kiana doesn't become The End that End humanity, Kiana become The End to end this samsara that making everyone suffered
why does she need to look like she is about to wipe humanity out
Kiana doesn't bcome HoFin to destroy the world
but it's just wrong
they want HoFin
i think the problem with people that are complaining rn is that
problem is people using it the wrong way
it is what it is
i don't think it's wrong to say the new suit is a cooler Kiana
not fit HoFin
the HoFin is supposed to be what Kiana think fit her
because it's the whole reason about it
i mean it's not wrong
players don't know about the game
mods don't know about the game
i really see no purpose of HI3 official server anymore
that channel is beyond trash
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
lore channel has a whole fanbase that want to suck Bunbun's dick so bad anw
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
but in reality they're just bad
cause everyone think they're good at the game or somewhat good
it's kinda normal for official server tho
lore channel is trash
that server is for fun anw <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
there won't be <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
it's only 45 pulls
you get refund with FOCA card, even on worst case
On avg :
 -4/4 Kiana = 162 pulls
-4/4 Mei = 39 pulls
-2* Elf = 60 pulls 
Total : 201 * 280 + 60 * 150 = 65.280
might not even be a good valk <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Using the bat
The elf is Kiana herself
The best part is that
QTE too
THE SUPER SUIT
when SUPER REVEAL is this near
why do you sleep
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
No it’s the Gem of Serenity
No it’s the Binding Zone in Kolosten
It count
As long as the authority already got sent out
Not the exact order
Only the authority
For the story to move foward
They are not needed
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Eat the HoDeath Seele dream too
Just eat all the cores
Showing her now or later in the story won’t change anything
She is at the peak mentally and physically
6.4 act 3 but it’s just that there is literally nothing about Kiana need to be built up for her to become HoFin anymore
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
I need the super cutscene
I don’t need sleep
SS Mei will be easy
For SS Kiana and 4* Elf
Probably just gonna swipe more in 6.4
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
I can 190 pulls when the patch drop
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Where is my fund
Okay Gresham
Yea look like 7 weeks patch now
They didn’t say anything about her not being in 6.4
Should be
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
You tricked me into 4/4 CN
Gres, i expect my 70 pulls refund will be here before 6.4
Double gacha release always have compensation
Yea 100%
Jayson wtf
Refund supply
You still want her to be in 6.4 for 4/4 Mei in 50 pulls
Even if you can’t afford Kiana 4/4
If it’s Mei alone you have to pull for 3 S-rank for 3 patches straight
Neko it’s because double S that your fund is not in danger
It’s too lit
7 hours until her model
SUPER TIME FRACTURE 
SUPER CUTSCENE
SUPER ULTIMATE
Is real
THE SUPERSUIT
She is real
Coping
All this time
We won
It’s Kiana skin
It’s not HoF skin
It’s the Beijing Opera Kiana they were talking about
Oh shit
Kiana
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>

<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
and that guide is not even a fake one, no one pointed it out yet that the numbers are wrong
why is it 15% better than S0 though
just use AE
literally 65% at S0 <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
it can be useful on an actual dps <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>

That is literally the anni rewards
What the fuck is the new one
Literally 1 patch ago
SEA already got it early
So better just give them all the rewards in Xmas and their New Year
GLB don’t celebrate CNY
I mean it’s normal if they want to give out rewards early
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Dumbfuck
We act the same
We are human
Ain’t no way people don’t realize that the login event give 7 cards for a reason and not 5 or 10
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
oh they mean GLB get anni rewards early before their actual anni ?
wasn't SEA got it first ? <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
any reason why they got mad ? <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
CNY does have 10 cards for login
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
So probably only the emblem ?
GLB anni will happen around 6.5 iirc
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
And a happy anniversary letter
On their anni they will get the emblem
The ribbon does look good
i think in exchange you got a fixed salaries for this ?
you have to sign actual NDA and have to spit out your address
yea, this one is for internal beta
probably someone just got chopped off

HoF and HoT only get a sligjh increased from that buff
No valk atm even appreciate normal attack buff except for maybe her 2 teammates in 6.4
The increase 10% ele dmg and 18% normal attack dmg is too obvious
Obviously better than AE anw
CN will have a field day to test if she is even better than SSS PV
still have to pull SS
buff
CN is actually pissed lmao
and the comment is basically roasting mihoyo
moriso will update the detail soon
and adjust some numbers
basically revert v3 to v2
the important one is just changing back the passive that buff fire/lightning damage from basic and charge to ult
i even doubt she can use God Mei for her IMG boss <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
If God Kiana is fire she has to use CN
In general
CN is new staple of fire
But it’s not the point
No shit sherlock, i can see that
Oh right, SK

But shieldbreak have never been peaceful either
Haven’t seen Kallen vods yet
Complete schedule of 6.2, 6.2 is officially over

26th is Monday, reveal is on Thursday 29th
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
They pushed this way too early than usual
Oh wait wtf, just checked the calendar, reveal is on 29th nvm
Could go both way
Or they’re just dumb
It mean they’re hiding something in act 3 that don’t want to be known through valk reveal stream
Chapter 34 Act 3 will be out 9 hours before 6.4 valk reveal
They pushed chapter 34 ealier than usual
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
There are 20% chance for that to happen
So not confirm to be 7 weeks patch
Event shop always last 1 extra week
He added “ maybe “ to the 7 weeks part
<a:mhpeepoclap:998941254027051028>
So far 4/4 CN look like a good investment
10 bosses, 2 belong to fire

They will
if they keep this cool  feature  then FGO will belong to HTR <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
the core HP still got reduced
watch the core HP bar in the beginning
probably bug
in V2 HTR can pierce core atm
Cool, where is the free box tho <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

at least from the all refs
i haven't seen HTR confront sp issue in Lightning <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
maybe there is some hidden tech playing her in fire

when Fire need it more
why the fuck did they buff her sp regen in lightning
Not sure about avg
Max is 3840

<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
Not S0 HTR so don’t worry
could be worse
not bad
2 fire bosses in 6 cycles <:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
So far 6.2 doesn’t look like fire patch
This close <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> to HTR
6.2 is already next week
<a:pepeexit:965959614195712010>
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
but you guys already know the answer
i will test Turg CN for you guys
oh shit i haven't even download beta yet
SS her and never look back
can cope with Turg CN fine in RL
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
imo without 4/4 CN, you will have more chance to retain in HoF weather with HoT + HTR
if your other SPs are not SSS yet
but i still think it's a waste of asterite
in RL
joking aside, probably fine
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
just don't buy CN
without CN, you have more chance to retain in Fire weather with Lightning team + HTR than scuffed Fire team
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
even with HTR
without CN, fire won't function
and ignore fire team forever
but if you can't then just pick HTR
ideally ofc you want to get both HTR and CN  <:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
PE's niche can't be stole without the same niche
but she can't steal any of PE
hard to tell about HoH
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
decent
like Tet's team
it just a way to cope
HTR buff is also awkward in fire team
Felis's buff is too short
won't be
it will be so so bad
it won't work lol
even though it will be so bad
cause you can cope with RC
she's next AE
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
she is a must pull if you're new player
CN already acknowledge HTR value
it's investment prior
it's not tier list

Next year will be Prototype Kiana
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
Wait last year is also Kiana
This year is Kiana
1 per year like QUA
She is not the IMG dps of the year
That depend on how tanky the bull will be in Nirv temp, if PE need 2 ults to expose the core then it’s already better than executing
Just like QUA
So we know only 1 IMG dps per year
Mei will also have execute
Aight

60-90-150-190 ?
yea
PE's passive
transfer damage to core
the only question that matter
does Bonya have Herrscher Killer passive or not
important question
<a:Yeehaw:999641827080675400>  ?
<:life:1001518241610485781>
like the 1st Herrscher of 2022
if the stig buff ranged dmg it mean that Bonya won't have sp problem <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
the stig buff ranged dmg
only the form that does dmg matter
no point in looking at animations
just extra dmg for closer enemy
oh wait she is ranged
<:huh:966619839307321394>
she is fucking meele ?
you're giving up 200-400 trophies because you don't want to waste another 30 pulls when it could be 150 pulls for an S-rank
and that is already the same amount of what a new S-rank can cover
it doesn't matter how many physical bosses she has, the problem is that there are 1-2 boss that need 4/4
it's already a lot
1-2 boss is the same amount of what an S-rank could have
they force 4/4 with Bleed Vill-V
Griseo need 4/4
which one is it
i don't even remember the last valk that need 3/4
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
SSS Bull MA <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
yea SPA and HC definitely appreciate breach more
Mihoyo forcing players to get everything <:HuTaoDead4:878604730576826398>
in the case of RC vs AE to pair with CN it will depend on boss fight and who is your dps
it's for general usage
like JK give way too many Ice TDM taken for ice team to the point that even 40% TDM is better than more Ice Dmg Taken
or at least can cover the lack of other sources
a good support is a support with well diversed buffs
just having breach doesn't make you a good support <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
AE is kicked out because she is too slow on farming sp + breach is low value on HoF
for example top score of Ignite Benares is HoF CN RC
breach value is low if you already have built-in breach
because she is also Ice dps
but you will need a kit worthy of a therapy session for that
realistically speaking she definitely can replace AE in Fire
can't even give AE a DK
at this point i think they're just too scare to replace AE and HoS
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
True
<:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
call her HoTS
but more numbers
you just need the same HoS
do you think Mihoyo use Black Jack or Poker to decide the next Priarm ?
or their roulette
up to what they write on the dart board
you have to force yourself to eventually reach SSS HoS tbh
<:OkaygeBusiness:900551897251979317>
so yes it's useful
SS1 is 3 ranks closer to SSS
<a:alert:960403776991264798>  DID I HEAR GENDER ? <a:alert:960403776991264798>

6.3 suck
2 pri patch, 190 pulls for HTR
<:OkaygeBusiness:900551897251979317>
Meele HoC 
Bleed HoS
IMG Bull
+ new QUA sidestage
Only 3 new Abyss bosses
So prepare to be down 11k for 6.4
I still can’t find any events that look like it will give you HTR free stigma box
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
gotta catch that SSS rankup
That’s why they give you HoS ADV and BP
That is more than enough, HoT need more damage to do Jizo
The weapon is busted in a sense that it can reapply Mei M and probably Turg if you can’t extend the duration
You still don’t use GD’s ult ever in HoT team unless it’s for filling Para trauma and reapply Turg without weapon active
The new bull have huge core, it’s a dps test
Yea only HoD and FGO
cause 2 extra seconds of Turg and re-activate Mid Mei
i guess it's big on HoT team
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
what is the verdict from that vid
it just look satisfying
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
weapon inventory  now have valk icon that is carrying it
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
look like a dps check if 2 IMG dps compete with each other
with like 8-10 HP bars
just a huge ass core
no aerial mechanic
i just watched the bull's fight
probably tmr

as if 6.4 is not gonna be double pri patch
this schedule is mental
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
battle of the century
it's a Psy HoT vs IMG HoT angle
God Kiana will take HoF place
Bonya will take RC place
not others
i mean it depend on herself
100% need that buff
haven't used HoT that much in Abyss, she is overrated
because 100% HoT is underperforming
i guess in a sense this is a buff for HoT team ?
oh i guess if the timing is right she can re-activate mid Mei thrice in a rot too
it's always Turg
if you stretch it you can definitely extend Turg for another 2s
don't know how practical it is tho
i can see being another 2s on Turg after counting her total hits in HoT team
i can see it being another 2s for Turg yea
oh i guess you can use PV 2 weapon active to make it 12 hits in HoT team <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
still 1 short
HoT count as 2 hits but that's about it
you need every 6 hits to extend Turg for 2s, with the new passive it's only 2 extra hits or even 3, so it's just 1 ( PV weapon ) + 1 ( GD QTE ) + 7 ( GD weapon ) + 1 ( Dps weapon ) = 10 hits, can't even extend it for another 2s
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
but i guess making triple lightning supports viable is fun
well i still fail to see the purpose of this weapon outside of GD dps <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
probably  GD dps
nvm
oh it has a CD <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
God Mei will spam her weapon active like there is no tmr
it's a preview
maybe it's not GD dps
wait
GD doesn't have breach
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
need to time it
cause it will be hard to trigger GD QTE with AE
it should be HTR
GD PV AE/HTR
also GD now should be viable for IMG content too
jesus, HoH is actually the last valk of current gen
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
is what is going on
next gen is coming
i guess they need to make a new one because 9S HoR take over Type HoS
Bleed HoS is BKE's boss
Griseo solve that in 5 seconds
just hitcount shield
look like HoS's boss
Meele weather
HoC is Psy Type
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
it's a scroll from the FC wonderland PV
no Bonyan today in beta
Bonya is tmr
i guess that's cool
oh it's for dps GD
wait a minute
the 3rd one
absolutely useless
wow
or too weak
new Kiana is either too strong
this mean that the weapon is a bandaid for PE
that's even worse
ofc it's HoS gauntlet
and you're gonna use HoS SnS SI on IMG boss ?
there is literally 0 reason why GD need a priarm
only Mobius need Breach on lightning
it's actually low on Lightning
breach value is so low
can't be Fischl either
there is 0% chance HTR will ever replace GD on lightning
this is the most stupid ever

It’s an option if you’re poor
Pull her on 6.6 or sth
Cause she is standard supply
If you have to skip anyone it will be God Kiana
<:life:1001518241610485781>
Her design is good enough for me to pull, no kit needed
I will probably get her anw
190 pulls for 4/4
So it’s actually standard amount of pulls
They haven’t announced free stigma box yet
<:life:1001518241610485781>
Not cheaper
Any Herrscher Killer passive mention ?
Mei and Bonya will have the execute one
i  actually bet only Kiana has Herrscher Killer passive  <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
that will depend on the Bull mechanic in Abyss and MA, so far if Kiana is the IMG dps then she will most likely use her Fire team
<a:Yeehaw:999641827080675400>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
she gonna make you pay crystals  everytime you switch to her
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Yae Miko will be the ceiling of lightning support
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
my bet rn for Bonya usage is :
- Support for MA Benares
- 1 Abyss boss
- Ice dps that is just strong in general, jack of all trades
- Can't replace AE in Fire or anyone in Lightning
too soon  to say anything, we will talk about this in another 16 hours <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
an Ice dps that can top AE in Fire will need a kit that deserve a therapy session
i mean she could but i just don't think it will be the case
definitely not you
idk, meele weather with freeze mechanic ?
some weird weather
i guess HRT will have 1 boss in 6.3
Bull is 1 of the 3 Husk
and PE in 5.5
they added HoDom for the giggle
this shit already happen in 5.0
Bull is 100% Kiana boss
does she even have Abyss boss ?
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Ethernal Natsu Dragneel ?
it will be AE + CN
imo never
no way you skip her
super strong
if she is like
yea that's also the problem
it depend on her numbers tmr
RC already filled that role
i'd skip Bonya if she is just a support for MA Benares
her normal looking cool tho
but nowaday we refer to it as sound effects
it used to be special effects
it's motion sickness and vfx
i can already tell i will be dizzy af with her burst mode
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
When in doubt, just remember you can always be a Gymbro
Dominic Toretto ?
<:SeeleD:1008271952064024626> <a:meltedicecream:975022253592940575> <a:bronie:1006027019403923516>
tbh if you're a mod in a PG13 server, chance that you're also a kid <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
and you think they're grown up ?
they're a mod for a PG 13 discord server
<:huh:966619839307321394>
no it's not
like 1750-1800 sth ?
if you use stupid Stigma you can reach more
her IMG version is coming
not for long
when i joined 6S was the queen of Ice
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
im this close to sending to a truck to Mihoyo HQ
Psy -> IMA -> Truck
they will all be IMG
with bigger numbers
just HoT but IMG
and those 3 just happen to be good on 1 MA boss
this is a triple dps schedule
so if you think about it
like she can't replace AE in Fire or anyone in Lightning but good enough to use on MA Benares
bet it stop as breach and TDM
wonder how big the buff for lightning fire is
i don't even want to ask JK score in RL
not RL
and it's Nirv standard
ofc JK will never match her but that's how bad this situation is
their gap is  as close as possible 
and so on
if HoH use S0 JK, she is better than S0 JK dps
you don't get it, the gap between them is linear
<a:smadging:1034847088737005628>
and she is a better JK
to build up her debut
they spent 1 whole year
who is the 1st Herrscher ?
that 4 patches in a row that you can't afford to skip
you already know 6.5 is also new lightning SP for God Mei
HoF awk ?
kid get prior
cause SI is a kid
good TF valk : PE, 7T
bad TF valk : all FCs combine 
you see the pattern here keilo ?
yea it's actually go up from 42k to 53k
and CN also can't find one neither
so far i can't find one
actually save a lot
with frees tigma box it will reduce to 150
190
CN is complaining about no free stigma box
see, no HoH, still Nirvana <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
are you demoting back to RL yet ? <@906785655823147028>
but you don't need to match capscore HoH to be able to do well in Nirvana
even at her S0
there is no way for JK to be able to match HoH score
i mean it's not even gonna be close
any chance that HoTR will have good TF that she can steal Hepha from HoH ?<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
don't take me, keilo and nini opinion tho, we only discuss it on our perspective, which is untrue for you guys
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
what an era to live in
or they will also be strong enough to compete with shill valks on their weathers
Pull Out King
i'll just pull out of Honkai, they call me the POK not for nothing
190 pulls before CNY is mental
in SW and HC case they specifically mentioned the free stigma box before beta
11.200 crystal
that is 40 pulls jump
i can't find the free stigma box in the post
uh oh
but Bonya and Mei on other hand
so she is fine even if her fire aspect suck
Kiana is definitely the IMG dps out of the 3
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
so for Abyss performance each of them have to be able to compete with other teams in their respective element
but what about Abyss performance
like sure new trio is meant to take over Benares
the problem is that i still don't understand her purpose to exist
6.4 will replace them with God Kiana and God Mei
yea with HoF and HoT
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
no she is not a support in ice
where is the free box
She is ice relax
They didn’t put element on CN dev vid

 When you see this, it's a bait  - Mihoyo

<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
You shouldn’t be surprised in general too, 1 year = 52 weeks, but 1 year also need to have 10 patches in total so the avg duration is 5.2 weeks per patch
Cunny ? <a:uooh:964118021574623243>

AE is looking like getting DK soon
good luck bud
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
Unless you just copy and paste her, adjust higher numbers
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
There is no way you can powecreep SSS HoS
I can proudly say that
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
as always
Bronya being the bait valk
probably still Bronya first then
pepe derp sth
The Bronya was in 5.4
i don't know if Pure Crystalium was pointed toward her but if it does then yes
<:xdd:1022782509316059176>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
to leak 10 patches ahead
i still don't believe how is it even possible
<:xdd:1022782509316059176>
oh i mean we would know about new Trio during 5.5
<:xdd:1022782509316059176>
you mean in 5.5 ?
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
They give bit by bits through each region stream
This one is actually exciting lmao
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Bronya's weapon look like both a gun and a sword
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Kiana use musket and sword now
JP stream new trio silhouette
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
We’re moving foward
Week 4 Infographic updated
6.1 Memorial Arena Week 4
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> ?
6.2 Abyss Week 4 P2 
Boss : Eden
Weather : Quantum
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
don't even know how they can keep it together all this time
i think the fundamental basic behind Genshin's mechanic are actually complicated and a good one at that
talking about their codes, it's already christmas miracle that Genshin can still running normally <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
this smol <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
the designer of Yae doesn't even fully understand her kit
the Yae's one i think is more hillarious in a sense that <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
and Mhy be like  wait what 
people learn about it now they start demand Mhy to fix it
yea i mean as in mainstream to the mass playerbase
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
until CN players make a fuss about it
HoR pausing drift used to be a feature
like a lot of bugs has been running under the radar since the dawn of time
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
even for 9S team
that's a bug abuse angle
480D on Type Wolf
to have an easier time
but recently the temp is too high on some bosses that even top players have to abuse it
yea it has been like this since long time ago
watch this one
abusing pause in Abyss get you more time on buffs
assume that they can fix the IMG core thing
it's actually affect more than IMG core
pausing cause too many bugs so they probably have to put it there as a temporary method
bug happened
I can’t say for Nirv but AE is still probably better <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
That outfit is literally mean for seducing
<a:Yeehaw:999641827080675400>
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
and seem like Mihobo couldn't fix it
there are too many bugs revolve around pause spamming <a:aware:965946296236122172>
6.2 event
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Cause she has a lot of other issues for being old
Her buff numbers that is
She is still a good support even in today standard
But strictly speaking she only need the timestop
But some extra team buffs and increasing sp when using combo are good for her
Honestly speaking, she only need the timestop
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
If not
If AE get a DK then yea Fire would stand on same ground with other 3
Then 6.3 is S-rank + AE DK
If Hua use an upgrade FHD in chapter 32 act 3 or in chapter 33
Just a possibility but
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
Good one
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
I won’t bet on Fire valk remain good outside of their shills
Unless Senti will forge a new FHD for Hua in act 3
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
She will be default into fire
Idk about good lmao
That can’t be right
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Any tldr
That is too many words

Last event stig was Lightning
Possible
SpA should stay dead <a:aware:965946296236122172>

rn it's place holder  6.2 test stigma 
not yet
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
cause HoH is a bait
isn't that a lot of field time or am i tripping
im reading her skill now and why does it require her to hit back her weapon to stack <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
do you actually think the record it 1 day before beta ?
they record the interview way before beta
I just need first impression answer to spread misinfo in maincord
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Im busy with work, can’t think
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
So can anyone tell me if Ai-chan is yay or nay ?
Doompost first and fix later when she become broken

So a HoT boss i see
Probably change the transition phase depend on your dmg type
3 ele bars
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
DA can have 30% type counter and it will still be HoF boss
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Only use Eden model in story
I still gotta give it to them, they still make new model for Ai-chan
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
She doesn’t have breach, only breasts
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Hahaha

The icon is ranged keilo
So it’s just Fire in general

Should be all, i will wait for Ai-chan’s kit translated
Updated effects
They promised to upgrade the skin
Aponia is adjusted skin
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Watching from phone is kinda hard to see the words
I think Ai-chan has a skill that can regen 36 sp ( ? ) if teammates attack ignited enemies
Yea she will
Typeless
<:peepoSitGamer:984923819619795034>
Ranged Kalpas = SW food, Shieldbreak Kallen = SnS boss
Sound kinda weird
Ranged Kalpas i think ? And Shieldbreak Kallen ?
Look cute
Ai chan character card <:hmm:767936100920328202>
<@148145559897636865> SSS Benares, Kalpas and Kallen in Abyss, and SSS Benares probably change to Fire Weather too
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Kalpas and Kallen in Abyss

They sent the client, info will probably be posted in 30-60 mins
6.1 Abyss Week 4 P1

Next they will announce 6.3 is a break patch <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Yea too many currencies, they need to simplify it more, it show in chapter 32, there are too many deez nuts
Some players just don’t click with EX
I guess letting master players craft pri-arm is fair from their perspective
<:795357298481954816:798379305460957235>
Yea free HoT
Asterite shop
Game is closing in 6.3

i can't wait for V1 numbers <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
GENDER ALERT <a:police:985413068655829002>
so it's 150-175
because it will consume all 165
she is not 150 if you have 165 sp
she can consume more than 150 for extra dmg <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
but still no gender allowed <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
extra 30 mins to download

Fischl's skin is lit tho

<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

maybe the cat is Jackal <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<a:Yeehaw:999641827080675400>
there might a need for some exceptions <:hmmm:979143314718720020>

she is a comic relief character now
good one <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
cause FR has normal skins <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
wonder if it's Dudu's taste or Rita personal favorite <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
and SpA is bedtime theme
it's Succubus theme for Raven right ?<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
Raven skin is better for me personally
im not feeling anything toward SpA skin <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
need to wait and see but it's not gonna be Cat unless Mihoyo fucked it up
why cat is there <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
Fire SP yea <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>

<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
she wears that one on bed with Dudu
<a:Yeehaw:999641827080675400>
it's time for AE to rest
Raven's skin
oh god
cause i pulled out <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
they call me the Pull Out King of Boston <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
cause it's Seele's type
i don't know about that one if Fire SP is already confirmed
ok take it slow <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
until 6.2
nini, trust me on this one, Nyx will be good in Abyss again with JK, lowkey might be closer to Vill-V than before
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
in Abyss she might take back T2 spot
nothing can save Nyx anymore in MA
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
she needs RC in her team to generate sp for 2nd rot
she can't use JK
Nyx MA performance problem is that
kinda broken <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Nyx get like +1 or 2 second from SS to SSS
definitely not because of HoS and Griseo
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
on MA Tona
better than 9S Nyx
SSS SN is actually good yea, no cap
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Vill-V got a buff in 6.2 too
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
everything
you know what SN lack ?
doubt it
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
that's what i read in Seele's simp amazon wishlist
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
and 6.3 SN DK
imagine it's SN's skin <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
like 11-12 hours
around high noon
probably before beta is live too
they show it too
all 3 of her suits are 4 words
forgot about her lmao
oh Seele is possible too
others are either already got a skin or not even relevant in story anymore
those 3 are the possible candidates
HoR, SpA, Raven
1 of them could be HoR skin, Prometheus
4 words battlesuit
also 2 new skins reveal tmr
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
but the obvious reason is that new Bronya is next in line
there is like 10 reasons that Prometheus won't be playable
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
wonder if he is still waiting for me in Nirv
yea no way that dude can win against fragile
fragile auto win
if i know them in maincord they must be dumb
who won ? <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
what did i miss <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
yea i just rewatched it and some movements still feel rough <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
that is wholesome <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Tet has the cunny for reasons
that you like adult ? <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
actually CN <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
my man actually ping the entire mod line up to suggest changing channel name <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
it's already revealed in chapter 32
it's normal
it's her battlesuit name <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
SP Fire Mech
she is SP
<a:agonPunch:818862400728072222>
Ai-chan i mean
it's the correct way to use Chakram to fight
RC and Aponia doesn't even use Chakram to fight
she is the 1st chakram user tho <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
18 hours
imagine how fun it would be if she could rival S2 SpA damage  <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
without timestop
it feel outdated now
what is not fun is using her ult
i think AE is fun <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
the fact that they don't put breach on every S-rank valks show that they want to keep AE relevant
i mean i don't doubt AE and HoS will keep surviving for 2-3 more years <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
a valk that actually use Ring blade to fight
but finally <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
so does Aponia
yea Eden's figure are huge
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
maybe she can also replace SpA
but we will see
most likely replacing Raven
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
it's Eden model
ofc she does
Doesn’t mentioned
Fire Mech SP
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
But so does new Kiana
Unless RL temp can raise to sth like 600-700
She will still be a beast in RL yea <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
get PE outfit to use her for 3 more patches
1k per week
i mean most likely <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
not what you're thinking obviously <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
but i like the Prometheus design more
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
the best one is still EVA
<:okfine:971481680265216130>
like MPE blue skin
probably
HoR is gonna be the free one
wait for valk reveal
not much to guess anymore<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
new skin for her new battlesuit
Kiana won't get any new skin soon until 6.7, 6.8
but it's about time for her
just a guess
it's HoR and SpA lmao
oh wait
HoR and Raven probably
from 6 to 7 hours give or take
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
it can't be anyone else
if it's SP then it has to be Ai-chan
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
a different lifeform compare to the Ai-chan on Hyperion
she come from Time Crystal
this couldn't be anymore obvious
it's 100% Ai-chan lmao
most likely for new players to catching up
yea it's a good thing
can't fix heimdall anymore <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>

Yea this Thursday

12 routes overall
CN event i think, call the phone number to pick Kiana/Mei/Bronya voicelines
<a:Yeehaw:999641827080675400>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

PE is overrated
6.1 Abyss Week 3 P1

Susanah/Jackal : A-rank
Ai-chan : SP
Yea Susanah can’t be SP
if you don't see my post then it's not up yet <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
still thursday
Tmr
New OW map have mining feature
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
you don't have anything to use asterite early game except SP frags
then supports doesn't matter for that account anymore
if they mess it up then they already played the game wrong
if they don't mess it up
newbie do have 100k asterite lying around
6.1 Abyss Week 2 P2 
Boss : Optimus Prime

<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
<:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
Anni will give like 30 pulls on first 2 weeks anw
He is in SEA
Hak will most likely be fine
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
Not a bad amount
50 pulls total
Honestly if you have like 13k then you can just go for JK supply <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
If it go well then you can go for it
Just make the decision after doing the free 10 pulls on JK
I guess that work too but using HoH on ice HoV is already a bad idea ngl
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
I would spend that on SoE instead
But if you only have like 20-30 pulls
Then yea you definitely want to go for JK supply
If you have more than 50 pulls
Think of it this way
cause even with 4/4 JK it will be a long time before she can overpower HB
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
are you sure it's not because you don't have 4/4 the 2 supports ?
the cost efficient of that SoE supply is too high if you don't have AF yet
it's just for 10 atk
if you don't have AF yet
and go for SoE supply instead
i would actually give up on JK's supply
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
same time as PE outfit
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
i'd be more concerned about your xtals instead
Wtf hak <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Dps - HB - JK
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Probably still can but her sp will be concerning
<:TeriThink:928714644040871996>
T2 : MPE or HoH
T1 will probably be either SW or Aponia
Or is it Aponia <:HMM:966625453194485760>
Not even a contest
SW will probably win tho
A decent HoH shill <:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
6.1 Abyss Week 1 P2 
Boss : Assaka 
Weather : Ranged Up, Meele Down
BKE default skin in my mind is the elf one
no think just pull
but i like the dual concept so i will pull anw <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
it would be better
they can add some wings on her knight mode  <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
tonight in hell, this moment is eternity
it's to fit the narrative <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
It didn’t stack with JK breach before
Bug in ER with JK
youtube link <:795357298481954816:798379305460957235>
Still shit until 6.2
<a:Yeehaw:999641827080675400>
That channel only exist for the giggle
it's F12 Heim in 6.1
<:xdd:1022782509316059176>
Yea except for 200 hit count ball, mobs taking extra dmg when ignited he is not that bad
6 weeks 12 bosses and we have :
- 3 ice bosses ( HoH top score all 3 )
- 3 lightning bosses ( Aponia T1 2 bosses, Mobius T1 1 boss )
- 3 QUA bosses ( Vill-V T1 all 3 )
- 2 IMG bosses ( lmao )
- 1 Physical boss ( MPE T1 )
with this 6.0 is officialy ended

<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Then they shouldn’t have a whole different date for it
If it’s only 3 S-rank then it’s easy, refund supply and special supply <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
unless it's type counter
HoS is not gonna compete with anyone
what is even the chance new Bronya suit won't be ice
this patch, HoH <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
dw mihoyo won't grieve us <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
but they can be
not yet
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
augments can have different types tet
and 1 refund supply
if that happen 2 of them will be free <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
good for my mental health
tbh im kinda hope they will be augments <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
oh wait i have all of them at SS
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
we already have SS HoR and HoT, only need to pull for HoF ADV
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
what if they're augments
yea pretty much it, can't spoil anything more than that <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
the most juicy part
and they announce 3 new S-rank of the next arc
6.1 trailer and arc trailer
there are 2 trailers
they announce some juicy stuffs too
yea 3 hours ago
which stream ? <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
too bad <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
won't you SSS HB by the end of this patch ?
i guess ?
saved
she is not gonna be A-rank
nvm i just checked 31EX
not the current
even Carole and FCs are past and future
cause so far SP only for those that don't belong to main timeline
won't she just be A-rank ?
if Ai-chan is 6.2 valk
It’s not a single sword
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
but you're not gonna kill PE just because they're all IGM
i don't know if you're dumb or not
triple dps comp
watch them all be IMG
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Yeehaw:999641827080675400>
That one is just for fun
But yea, to calculate the value of stigs you need to add in supports value and the valk internal value in her kit
You multiply all the dmg multipliers
6.0 Abyss Week 6 P1 
Boss : ~~Kasumi~~ False God Otto
Weather : Imaginary
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Should have removed Otto
So SoE can feel more impactful
This nerf is probably direct to DoR
So more charges now
They buff HoR bar regen in bike mode
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Cause before G4 was too cracked of a set
I guess it’s kinda fair ?
Pretty big nerf to G4
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Aponia outfit stage animation
give or take 15 minutes extra to download
1 hours
pri arm version turn into a space ship
it's the normal version
no refund
no double gacha valk
maincord never fail to amaze me by how dumb they can be
it's better for those don't have AF yet
yea if anything
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
when human use 100% of their brain capacity
you still get double DK
even if you get 5 of it until SoE
it's actually beyond nice
It’s uprate AF
Not off rate
Is that legal
Is AF
SoE rate up weapon
Omg
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
remove what now <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
then why did you even yes pls  <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
All the designers had to work on Hellbent Dudu <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Nothing change
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
elf is more high prio cause you can't farm it <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
or else 40 frags
yea should be, if they put her frags in BP
but if they also put her frags in BP then it should be 5/20 frags per Knight/Paladin BP in 6.2 + 6.3
non-awaken = 4 stamps
8 stamps are for awaken valks
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
4
week 6 of 6.0 only start spending, EXPA/FOCA select, Elf supply
probably 6.1
No JK supply yet
it just sit there for fun
you can exchange but you can't use it until 6.1
Wait for v3
Not yet available
I can see her bellybutton
The skin is see through <:woggers:652740192653934633>

HoH’s shill better not stop at 3
Only 2 bosses left for 6.1

Nice HoH shill
6.0 Abyss Week 5 P2 
Boss : Lupus Boreas 
Weather : Lightning
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
cause the skin is still bug on beta
not sure how reliable this one is
oh apparently they added some background into Aponia's skin <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
<:Susge:838690098802720818>
or does it ?
at least it doesn't have a cock
HoH also had a cock too ?
i thought it was the other game <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
im still stuck in this hotel room with my co-worker instead of playing Honkai with my waifu <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
so those nerfed change nothing
but they also optimized her animations
yea her non-bike got nerfed
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
HoR
she deal more damage on neutral
so even with the damage nerf
they optimized her animation
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
she deal more damage after the nerf
Eden gun and Liu Qi i think my cadet will cum lol
i think it's kinda obvious
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
is it not obvious enough Liu Qi will be on SoE DK supply ?
and you will still retain RL
you can put Rasputin on your HoH
it's illegal
i don't watch cp <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
nhentai is overrated <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
next lightning is gonna be in 6.3 <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
just in time before she has new battlesuit
Mobius - free 
Aponia - spending 
PE - Pyramid
Eden - Bingo
no other one left
same with HoT
they only put the skin in bingo on live
but there is bingo on beta
not confirmed cause they won't put it in Bingo
oh Eden is also bingo, that's +2800 <:795357298481954816:798379305460957235>
better start praying now <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
can leech off other weathers and no other options in her own
PE is still the peak of shilling
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
but if they actually want PE because they like PE then it's still worth yea
i think if your friend just want a Physical dps to bandage the problem then MPE is more than enough
oh i did answer it yesterday, i turn off the ping i think <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
we're way pass that point
the deadline of pulling PE should be 5.7
and PE is kinda sus now
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
strong S-rank but not anywhere strong enough to justify wasting xtals on
i still think Aponia is just a nice to have
it's either on release or not
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
the value of S-rank pass their release is low in Honkai 2022
damn now that i think about it
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
anything worth to pull ?
even if you guys can get select
- 2800
we will see
i guess i can always pull JK expa for the giggle
what more do i want <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
i want JK gears + HoR DK + PE skin
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
looking at 6.1 im seriously in doubt i can even spend that much
but are you sure you can even spend 74k nini ?
tbh, always sack everything for elf frags
you'd be surprised by how addicted you're
realistically speaking they give more currency this year
last year is the same hak
that is assuming you can even spend 74k
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
oh you can't even buy out elf frags and 4 JK stamps
6 stamps yea
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
Almost become AE
They nerfed JK personal damage quite hard
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
They shill Vill-V and Aponia like they’re the Herrchers
What’s up with that

wait what <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
and 6.2 Fire SP Susannah
Mei is the new S-rank Fire support
wait actually
wtf does that even mean <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
but IMG Fire without Fire SP sound kinda sus
not like Kiana can be anything but Fire and Phys <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Fire SP better coming soon
is so f*cking bad
IMG Fire <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
SS1 HoR is kinda good tho
everyone will just buy HoR stamps tbh
If you can afford 4k Bchips
6.1 looking hella good for spenders
They do
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
So sometime i mix up between them
Viet Honkai community still use UA for her
Undeterred Apostle
Her beta name
Oh it’s meme
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Not for UA
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
That is Otto in disguise hak
the S-rank after 6.1 is gonna be a bait anw
not like it matter, after 6.1 you only need to pull for next support set <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
who will win next year throne i wonder
and 6.4 will definitely be meta defining valk <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
but they better not let her be Raven 2.0
yea she is probably gonna be A-rank <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Like how they put Goemon in when Handel were released
6.1 BP will probably be Ana
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
Dw
2 of them must be Hellmaru and Kasumi
Still 4 bosses left
6.0 Abyss Week 4 P2 
Boss : Clockman ( Para ver ) 
Weather : ~~HoH shill~~ Lightning Up
that's around 30 pts higher than SSS HB
that's actually fast
Cause they can’t gut HoR sig set too much anw
No matter how much they will change it, it will still end up as 2ns best option
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
On current v1
Like 10% lower
Cute and Funny <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
Logically speaking you can SS her on 1st day
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
Yea
DK will probably up on same time or 1 week late
But consider Sushang is a support
Lowkey might <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
SS her on first day is kinda important <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Who care anw, we should all exchange JK’s stamp
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Spending is usually on v2
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
Now if they can ban those hackers
They also fixed a lot of bugs
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
This ?
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
I think it’s better compare to what she used to be
that shield is on SK tier lol
new DK <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
where everything begin
bet it will be Nagozara
i think the last battle will be on earth
cause if they stop Kevin mean real HoTE has to come
so we need at least 1 more arc when Kiana and gang confront real HoTE
this one is probably about stopping Kevin
what if it's not the last <:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
not yet
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Bingo on beta
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
she is typeless
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
should be PE if she is only raw dps check
nice increase
increase max limit to 8 but weekly AL income is still the same <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
> Elysia, Fallen Rosemary frags weekly limit increased from 6 to 8
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
I see <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Moriso said so
But fire work
Physical doesn’t work
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
They will probably change it to high res later
Ice HoV
Ice Shield, immune to everything but Ice
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
So yea SS on release <:huh:966619839307321394>
Just checked
Oh it’s 7
Let me check it
Enough to SS her with ER stamps or sth like that
Iirc 4 ?
the weekly limit is 6 for all iirc
actually P2W game <:huh:966619839307321394>
isn't that just BP ? <:huh:966619839307321394>
if she has any it will be after 6.1
don't think she has ER stamps as of now
everyone that want her will have like SS JK on first day
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
i don't even know why people test S0 JK
that score is about the same with S0 SW i think ?
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
it should be on beta right now
also if we have bingo event
so Aponia look like Bchips
same with Vill-V pirate
usually Bchips skin won't be in beta first day
it's 30k spending milestone
but looking at it
it's speculation
anyone that can use Griseo
should be a free for all valk
Griseo
i will search bili later for more vids if there are any
Hellmaru
should be
it's about picking the best option
and HoR new DK
you're skipping HoH for 3-4* elf
you're not skipping HoH for SSS JK to reach her S0
the problem is that
S0 HoH is 853 on 435D
9S team JK is 827 on 445D
and Raven
she only take the lead because HoF use AE
SSS MPE is also on par with S0 HoF
she should be able to do that much
but that is the norm
but yea, SSS JK is on par with S0 HoH
<:huh:966619839307321394>
was mean to reply to hak
wtf wrong reply
she is on par
i don't remember xuanyuan sword being any special <:HMM:966625453194485760>
the scene of Kalpas in the moon, all the broken swords were all 10th key
10th key were made into multiple weapons
they're both 10th key
<:huh:966619839307321394>
nothing
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
GLB still have the right to pick
it's only suck to be CN players
yea both 6.0 and 6.1 look good
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
because it will be terrible
i hope they don't do that with HoH
and that weapon still came out at what it is rn
i mean they balanced 7TR a lot during 5.8 <:mfw:840549220406263859>
4head
DK
it look a little bit like what 7TR was
the new SoE
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
im more worry about that weapon
they should spend more time on SoE
look balance to me
it's 3* Ely
the clip 9S ice team 827 Hellmaru
oh nini
Susanah
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
it's for Eden dps
i don't have it atm
try searching image
someone should already posted it in here
yea we have
Houdou is mecha dog
it's the bull in new story
by making the transition phase require aerial attack
also they make sure PE can't top score that new bull too
CNY will be on 6.4
2
wait where is the post about her gear being on BP ?
yea i think new IMG is on CNY too
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
suck to be poor ig
not like it's a surprise anw
they become a competitor of the Herrscher
creating a support specifically for a Herrscher always lead to this sh*t
yea i actually hate it lmao
but do not skip JK
i will be serious here, you can skip HoH or HoR
no other valk can make use of her  drain sp  passive
but 2 passives from her ultimate are made to deal with Kasumi/Houdou and 1 of it is a direct buff for HoH
SW can use her
she is specifically made for HoH and HoR
I don’t like this era
Compare to HB
20% TDM on 2nd rot onward
10% TDM on 1st rot
Which is pretty big i guess
Yea she just drain her sp to give HoH stacks
Oh no not that
She actually need that much sp regen
Whatever rank increase that stacks charging speed will be her break point
The 200 stacks Sword Will
It’s the passive 1
No
Same with Griseo and Eden and Felis
Doesn’t mean much
Only extra 30
It’s for MA
No translation yet
Idk dumbass
The same with FR
But whatever rank that speed up her charge
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
Motherf*cker
Dumbass i said jk
Jk jk
SSS
If she is equal with S0 HoH with SSS
She looks balanced to me now
Stars on the elf ?
That should be on par with S0 HoH
That can’t be good
444 ?
What is the temp in the vid ?
Tbh i would rather them keeping her as what she is rn and focus more on balance SoE
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
She looks good
Ngl
So far no team regen sp
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
I don’t know any valks these days can work without their sig weapons
RNG on top of RNG
it's RNG
the problem is that Turg Felis is the most terrible experience
Turg Felis is always better than Bastet Felis
3 supports team need all 4/4
if you don't plan on pulling HoH yea
cause he will need it on Felis for JK dps
Bastet is still good for him
also Epi won't be pulling HoH anw
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Bastet being useless doesn't make Purana useless
what's wrong ?
it's also useless now on freezable enemies
not really
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
Turg Felis
there is only 1 problem with using her for HoH and HoR
she looks great
probably 18% at high rank up
<:huh:966619839307321394>
you won't using them 3 ever tbh
cause she is also Psy
but could be for herself on Kasumi too
this one is for HoH on Kasumi and HoR on Houdou
> Ultimate Skill 2
> Ice DMG dealt by [Edge of Taixuan] +50%, shield break ability +100%, upon casting [Edge of Taixuan] all team member's shield break ability +25%, last 18s, refreshable.
this is what specifically made for HoH
> Ultimate Skill 3
> Upon casting [Edge of Taixuan] Jade Knight will additionally deplete SP, max 25 SP can be additionally depleted, skill additionally deals the amount of additionally depleted SP x 20% ATK of ice DMG, all team member's Ranged ATK, Basic ATK (including Combo and Charged) and Burst mode ATK additionally increase the amount of additionally depleted SP x 1% ice DMG, last 18s, refreshable.
it's up
which is big , i guess ?
you get 10% TDM from using Sushang
it's this passive
but if we're talking about how everyone think she is made for HoH then it's because of 150 sp cost
still waiting for moriso's translation
cause i don't think i see her has party regen sp
maybe she takes too long to do her stuffs that Pardo yellow combo can regen more sp
i actually don't know
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
she look like she won't have any sp issue
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i actually can't recognize ice anymore
stop cosplaying cn discussion resident
epi <:mfw:840549220406263859>
since when Ice become this long to setup
i actually can't hold my laugh
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
feel like im watching a Genshin stream
but the setup time
HoH can do 3 ultis back to back with Sushang, 90 sp starting ( Abyss standard )
her stigs are full on offensive
TOP: Total DMG +10%, When Combo ATK deals DMG, all team member’s Ice DMG +30% (unstackable), last for 12s, refreshable.

MID: Total DMG +30%. Basic ATK and Combo ATK Ice DMG +50%.

BOT: Combo ATK DMG +15%. Upon spending at least 120/150 SP, enters [Plundering Array] state, last for 18s, refreshable. During [Plundering Array] state, all team member’s Ice DMG +30%/60% (unstackable).

2PC: During [Plundering Array] state, when all team members deal Ice DMG, apply one stack of [Sword Menace], last for 18s. Max 15 stacks. Every stack makes enemies take +1.0% bonus Ice DMG. When equipped by Jade Knight, the max stack of [Sword Menace] is increased by 10 stacks, at the same time, if B piece is equipped, triggering QTE will be counted as entering [Plundering Array] state upon spending 150 SP.

3PC: Max stacks of [Sword Menace] is increased by 10 stacks. When enemies are in [Sword Menace] state, will additionally receive 30% ATK of Ice DMG every second.
yea cause you also use her with cat
even without that extreme sp regen
but not like it matter tho
she can't use sp reduction affix
150
it's HoR stig
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
what is that supposed to help HoH or HoR
wait i don't get her extreme self regen sp purpose <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
or like party regen ?
but she is just self regen right ?
her evade is also not complete yet
yea they will add it eventually
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
i want color that fit the character more
yea i think it's my taste, i don't like too colorful
personally that is
i think morbmaid is too much honestly
one hell of an anni if you ask me
Aponia is Bchips
Eden is 30k spending
but with how they present it in beta
no clue on Eden and Aponia yet
she suit with strong color more
yea full white does not suit her at all
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
at least they never miss with those skin designs
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
yea her skin isn't there yet
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Eden also look good
better than i thought what it was
probably tmr like 7TR
still not given out yet
so it's just a normal S-rank patch again
yea you save like 50 pulls by don't have to pull S-rank card but that 50 pulls also need to go to HoR new DK <:Sadge:965974621411217482>
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
G4 is HoR stig, Sushang has her own signature stig so it's not really economical anymore
Mihoyo putting so much effort into making money driving me crazy
i think i will just auto pilot this game until next week <:mfw:840549220406263859>
just pull whatever you like
all the talk above was about Nirv
lol you guys will be fine, dw
no translation for Sushang's skill yet
JK
but damn i really like Sushang abbreviation
is that supposed to be a question ?
i mean look at your account without AE <:mfw:840549220406263859>
it' still fine to pull aster
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
this is actually first Herrscher in history getting screwed up like this
pull HoH -> retain on Nirv Hepha 
pull HoR + JK -> 50% chance to retain on Nirv Hepha and 100% chance to retain on Nirv Houdou
but the scenario is this
i think HoH is fine, i don't even think SSS JK can replace her in any mean
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
turn out my cadet was right for panicking
yesterday
yea i actually think  holy sh*t, i can afford everything 
can they use that effort on banning hackers instead
Mihoyo is getting smart now, don't they
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
but so does Nirv Houdou
yea i think without HoH, Nirv Hepha will be -200
G4 is HoR new set, Sushang has her own signature stig
getting scuffed rn on the budget
yea
lowkey it's 
Hepha : HoT - PV - RC 
Houdou : HoR - HB - JK
Sushang has another stig set
which patch should you skip
im just talking about if you can only afford 1 patch
yea it's fine
but money doesn't grow on trees
like i actually mean it
i don't think she is a bait
is there any MA combinations that require HoH assuming new SoE is as busted as 7TR ?
really lowkey tho
lowkey yea
i mean the valk ofc, not the elf
both look unskippable to me too but if i have to choose 1 then it's always skip 6.0 <:peepoShrug:965995072401309698>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
EU should also have like 10 sth
SEA T100 MA now has like what, 30 hackers or sth
really ? but i do understand why he feel like quitting <:peepoShrug:965995072401309698>
<:peepoShrug:965995072401309698>
and he is in EU anw so
4* elf is more important for his account
i can understand that
damn suddenly feel kinda poor now
42k + 9k6
150 pulls for 6.1 <:mfw:840549220406263859>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
what is the avg for 4/4 gears only keilo ?
4/4 Sushang and 50 pulls for HoR DK
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
Honkai is getting expensive even for S0
and 70% chance CNY valk next year will be another IMG
i have to get it but 6.1 looking a little scuff rn <:mfw:840549220406263859>

yea but this one is story boss
oh wtf, you're getting damaged while in the ground during that orb phase
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
whether if HoS can touch those or not
it probably depend on how high those orbs are
don't think you can ulti all of them
it's like 10 cores floating around or sth
i guess
that's creative
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
you see what i see keilo
<@148145559897636865> the dude phase transition has floating orbs, you need aerial valk to destroy those
Full fight ( i think ? )
im blind
oh it's 2 phase
i think the core has a core or sth ?
the boss fight look like hell
IMG Bull boss fight

why do you act like other valks can compete if it's not FGO

she is in useful zone
3% physical iirc
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
her bike literally need you to pause pause for maximum dmg output
need enhance damage and smoother gameplay in her bike
timestop is not enough
unless there is also a focused B for it
only her weapon

there should be with her weapon

HoR best mech dps

yea it's an overall nerf in her team performance <:life:1001518241610485781>
really lowkey tho
<:life:1001518241610485781>
lowkey i think if they let HoH keep her insane tf she might steal Husk from both SW and Aponia
<:life:1001518241610485781>
after Aponia  buff , Mhy has to make sure Aponia won't lose her only SSS boss
and lowkey Husk
probably target to tank
:tero3: <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
So HoH is a bait <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

they nerf breach in Hooman form
v2 both forms used to have 15% S0 and 18% S1
it's actually a nerf on her breach i believe<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
S0 is still 15%
it's S1 <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>

But the character that Raven is refer to in Tale stuck in an infinite loop with an Immortal being

Tale of Berseria, Velvet Crowe, “ Why do birds fly ? “

Difference in culture actually make it hard to translate in this game
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Like the upcoming HoH’s skill names, the English translations sound lame compare to the CN names when i read it from other translators like sora
The problem actually due to difference in culture, i also find it hard to translate stuffs to English because it sound way leas cooler compare to the CN text

I really don’t want to hear “ your investment last 5 patches “
Good sign tbh
Which mean they don’t intend to let Bastet die this soon
But yea i think sp ulti increase was to force everyone use Bastet B
Im not sure if it’s due to inconsistent sp regen that they mentioned or what
Like when the rot end her sp is at 50
Even with 100 sp cost she already had sp issue
But i don’t know about 100 sp to 125 sp
Yea the breach buff in Human mode is actually big
<:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
You couldn’t do ulti back to back
Im surprised with the sp increase cause before she already had sp issue
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
Aponia’s summer skin looking good
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>

<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
You can’t even buy the card and the feature skin
This spending is a lot more scummy
Cat skin was around 19k without dorm card
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
So what is her performance look like in V2 ?
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
Jfc
New generation will start with the 2nd HoS
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
She raised the bar to what we have rn
The last one was HoS yea
We’re one step close until the new generation of valk <:Despairge:957713851103735838>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
That’s why i think they will keep lv cap as 88
88 is a symbol for fortune and richness in CN
I actually think they won’t increase level cap
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
Lv 70 pri
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
Maybe they have a change of heart and now they want to make pri for irrelevant valks
<:woggers:652740192653934633>

just not the same FC
they still have captainverse to mess around

it's a popular project in KQM

but it's Genshin
i remember working on this project
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
do you think Hua ever looked at Aponia/Eden/Vill-V and be like  I shouldn't went through the surgery pre 18  <:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>

she was alive for like a total of 1 hour
it's HoH boss so my bet is on Bio Fire
<:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
jfc we actually have a lot of Bio recently, don't we ?
new Bio is coming
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
maybe Bio fire
i actually think next farmable valk is Bio
bring ER dmg to normal content
what if next S-rank is physical mech dps that has breach <:Despairge:957713851103735838>
Diavoros would smash his keyboard
imagine new IMG boss during PE pyramid skin
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
PE actually grief the temp so hard
PE alone raise the bar so high for IMG niche
good luck with that
competing with PE <:Despairge:957713851103735838>
tbh they would be crazy to release any IMG dps in the next 2Q
PE alone dominate IMG
cause BKE dominate type weather and PE + BKE dominate physical weather
lmao
the 2nd coming of HoS is basically guarantee BKE to dominate Type Bio even further
lmao
compare to killing Handel or Bastet
2nd coming of HoS won't be that bad
i guess they can also kill HoS
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
if next SP won't be fire, it will cause a massive outrage
i will call it rn
just reset the run bro
which Honkai's players don't need
like Bastet is good but its good part is ultility
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
it will kill Bastet
the next ice valk won't even kill Turg
you know the funny part
enough for TB
5 * 4 = 20 balls
yea they can
her boss appeared a total of 2 times
beautiful design, animations
DA was such a bait jfc
they lowkey want to drain your wallet
<:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
you can buy Felis outfit + black card in 5.7 but not this one
it suck compare to 5.7
lowkey this spending suck
<:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
when everyone mentioned  Mobius need sp in 3rd rot  they didn't mean  get 1.5sp/s on Mobius 
<:huh:966619839307321394>
or all wrong
Maybe some brackets will be like 400
I guess it’s also rng
I think my cadet bracket 10th place is like 680
This one sound kinda sus tho keilo
It’s -100
If you don’t have a fuction lightning this patch

<:HMM:966625453194485760>
My guess is Zhenyi on 6.1
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
she died like 10 morbillion times
SA's life is dramatic

btw, does v2 change a nerf or a buff, i really can't tell
<:worryMantaRay:945494671042412586>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
i will be convinced that Mihoyo is compensate playerbase through BP
if 6.1 BP is Zhenyi
she is still in line with the old generation
HoH doesn't feel like the beginning of new generation dps
the problem is that <:Despairge:957713851103735838>
for 6.1 info
just wait
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
or people all quit
and it's either hype up the game
it's just mean sth big is coming in 6.1
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
<:HoVCookie:599331162690813966>

5.2 Time Runner
We actually have a lot of pyramid gacha skin
<a:SusgeClap:835512309480161280>
Eden looks like S-rank to me
Aponia skin = pyramid gacha
And Eden skin = 30k spending milestone in 6.1
Eden and Aponia’s skin should be model only
<a:Wankge:919637493958209556>
Casual clothe Aponia makes me acting up

Cherry stop being easy
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Don’t be fool
That’s not enough to compensate 6.1 big spending
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
Only if you get caught
Maybe we will get a hint for 6.1 valk
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
What does she weak to ?
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
Guess we have to wait for live server
They don’t really specify about it

<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
There are like 10 pts diff i think
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
Even the fact that HoH is tie with HoF for the moment on type Kasumi
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
I will ignore everything
As long as they compensate 50 cards
They’re trying to avoid CNY land on 6.3
After 6.1 there will be another 5 weeks patch
That’s the neat part
They don’t satisfy with killing Genshin alone
Mihoyo is trying to pull a killing spree
Keilo did you read the news ? <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Eden spending skin and Aponia pyramid
Maybe 6.1 will be Eden and Aponia’s skin
Right ?

If they don’t compensate at least 50 cards in 6.1 people will stream deleting their accounts again
Max amount of currency without swiping is 1100
Btw taihen, you can’t get Griseo outfit + another outift without spending max and swiping
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
Unless it’s summer Eden
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
Or else
They will compensate sh*t ton of cards in 6.1 yea
Big spending yea, 70k milestones
from 3.5 to 5.1
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
or else CNY will land on last week of 6.3
we need 1 more 5 weeks patch after 6.1 for CNY to land on 6.4
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>

really lowkey
skipping HoH and pull 3* the Elf is better
lowkey
 dear diary, today i score 98 pts in Lightning Husk Nirvana, what a good day to retain 
in their diary ofc
most people in CN discussion don't play the game
that's the neat part
S-rank Sushang, Fire SP Susanah
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Halloween PE
im more curious on 6.1 now lmao
HoH is bait
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
in 6.1 that is
i expect you only need to swipe 200$ for all xtals bonus
dw
well they will give a lot of xtals in 6.1 anw<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
so they can push CNY to 6.4
but i expect another 5 weeks patch
6.1 is 100% 6 weeks
spending only last 3 weeks btw
yea it's 5 weeks confirmed
but type Kasumi belong to HoF cause 6.1 Fire SP
<:Wokege:859195243030904860>
rerunning 7T when they hide Lightning Husk and her bosses away in 5.9
so peopleo can't pick Aslaug
not even let it 5.2 lmao
Ely gear
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
your mum
spending event only last 3 weeks
oh btw, 6.0 is actually 5 weeks confirmed
 Guys, what is in 6.2 
6.1 not even started <:Despairge:957713851103735838>
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
we need a 3rd one
i already assumed HoH patch is 5 weeks
should be 6.2
they will probably do 1 more 5 weeks patch after 6.1
instead of 6.3
so that CNY will be on 6.4
we need 1 more 5 weeks patch
give me 5 mitenus
let me check the calendar
that sound normal for F2P
really lowkey tho
lowkey
that's a whole new world of dumb
imagine thinking 6.1 won't have big spending
CN discussion = know nothing about the game
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
wtf
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
i will comfort Griseo when she is dead
lorewise accurate
Griseo lifespan : 3 patches
yea it's Griseo that getting powercrept <:Despairge:957713851103735838>
imagine normal Ely taking over HoH boss with breach buff
but breach can
so impair can't fix that
he has high physical resistance
take SSS Hepha for example
in ER it's different stats, Impair = Def, Breach = Resistance
physical dps start to do ER's damage <:Despairge:957713851103735838>
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
with impair + breach
it's S-rank sushang
motherf*cker

sth is coming and it's not fire
this also mean
28k
<a:HoSMunch:814963878320275466>
SS HoS is broken in Abyss
what if you use more than 36.400 xtals to pull 4/4 HoH
there is a problem guys
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
you can have that amount
if you save xtals like a normal human being and skip 5.9
you will need like 110k xtals
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
there can't be any other big spending events
Anni and CNY
we only have 2 big spending events per year
that mean they already have sth in 6.1
i legit dont' care about HoH won't show up in 6.1<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
you can buy both with F2P xtals
tricked me again
wtf carv and tet

is it ? <:huh:966619839307321394>

unless you swipe
you can't even get outfit + black card
yea
650 mats
wtf
Griseo summer skin is a scam
oh it's actually HoS ADV
i just asked Da Wei
Fire Sushang + Fire SP with refund supply
i repeat, no HoH in anni EXPA select
No HoH and Elf Ely in 6.1 anni, they specifically said it here
i will need someone to ping this
36.400 xtals in total
it's mini scam nini

2022 Honkai you don't need to worry about wide coverage
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>

not a bug or anything taihen
i mean it's a well-known fact

actually broken
the mech position change with it
it does small gather, when you do Griseo QTE in the bleed stage you can notice it
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
physical has like 50 gather sources
when she QTE in
Griseo also has small gather too
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
don't have dudu = -50

cause normal human don't use manta ray as their weapon
yea during her human form she attack like normal human <:AgonConcern:799494217717776425>
she summons 2 manta ray  everytime during burst mode charge
im not sure that most people PC can handle that gameplay
like Superman
born as a Herrscher but want to live and die as a human
<:worrythumbsup:759845056743473204>
she is both

<:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
so they have to buff it for Aponia
this time her whole team lost the buff from her passive
last time she lost 2% TDM
everytime she got buffed it's actually mean that  we removed the bug that enhance her current performance with a lesser buff 
Aponia performance overall does get weaker with all these bugfixed

what's wrong with her bias toward ice valks tho
lore wise it fit her
it mean Hepha will beat you up
idt they will remove breach tho <:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
better than her owner
oh it's not ice valks only

Hope CN can somehow make Mihoyo waking up

It’s actually a 6S angle into RL demote
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Use wet on Ely ?
Im down for Mihoyo to get my design idea onto next Herrscher
They should have just make SSS Hepha only take dmg from Ely
Even when the shill is ridiculous
Nothing is more important than Herrscher shill
In reality HoH is mech ice
What if this is just a nightmare
Wdym surely SSS HoV can outscore 3 supports team ? <a:cluedespair:965946296236122172>

Wouldn’t that be hillarious
Taking back Type Kasumi
Imagine 6.1 Fire SP + Fire S rank support
<:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
Who even in Mhy think that : “ Hmm, we have 2 busted valks in Psy zone, then HoH should also be Psy because she deserve to be busted “
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
It’s not her boss anymore
If fire get even 1 upgrade
But the problem is type Kasumi
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
HoF : fire heim, fire tank 
HoT : lightning rpc, lightning BKE 
HoH : ice rpc, freeze hepha, type kasumi, ranged tank
Ely did have the most bosses among 3 Psy Herrschers
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
Calm down
It’s still unconfirmed
I only do it for Kiana
SSS in Honkai is so expensive tho
Lmao
Literally never
It’s 4 stars Sirin + 4/4
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
Yea it was around 3-4 pages of paypal last time you asked
You think so ? <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
So HoH is in a normal spot anw
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
And in V3 it got toned down to 7.5-8M
In V1 everyone usually output 11-12M
The normal dmg output of every valk in V3 and V1
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
They will tone it down later to 8M
Looking busted like usual
Still S0 ?
What is the team for 11M6 ? <:woggers:652740192653934633>
The current HoF dps
8M is like
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
Does she busted or nah ?
Aka usually do a raw dmg check for every valks <:HigoThink:585629884630695948>
HoH raw dmg
How is her raw dmg looking like on Aka’s stream ?
Oh btw
Not really <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I mean better than WE basically equal to a 4th valk
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Where is the gather ?
Elf ely should also have gather, no ?
What kind of design is this
How does elf is more important than her rank up <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
The TD gacha <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
<:keqsip:994857348436865124>
My bad
I mean AK <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
Does A9 has a good banner running ?
Time to go to A9
Kinda cringe tho
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
I mean it look they go together as a combo
<:keqsip:994857348436865124>
It’s still 1-2 bosses per patch
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
Seeing how extreme they pull this off
At least they will shill her for 5 patches right ?
<:keqsip:994857348436865124>
Quantum actually has 4 weathers now
Timestop on ulti, 50 SP on weakspot
Dw 6.1 Raven get het pri
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
You sure it’s not because of AE and Raven ?
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
2023 Honkai design be like : 
-SSS Kallen ( can only be damaged by Kiana ) 
-SSS DXY ( can only be damaged by Dudu )
Keilo, nini, check out my 2023 honkai prediction
But this still feel like a nightmare
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
I mean you’re not starting the rot without Felis’s ulti anw
Elf Ely does have 3k% multi ulti
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
Capscore in CN use Aponia as a support for HoT
The bug is that right now the effect is for whole team
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
So it’s an overall nerf to Aponia again
Aponia got buffed due to her bug fix
Oh btw
It’s not even rougelike anymore
This patch is so extreme
Just get HoH bro
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
Schor T mid Mei bot Newt
Can i get back to Schor T days
Feel like a nightmare
All of this
Uhh
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Where is the 3rd SSS boss coming from
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
They also need to change RPC aoe check to fit with ice team
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
Abyss Hepha also has high physical res on top of immune to lightning and fire
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
Akayuki is streaming it i think
<:TeriDerpMelon:928714410762063943>
Abyss Hepha will kill the other Elysia
Only ER Hepha
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
They better shill her for 5 patches
I don’t have SSS HoS
<:keqsip:994857348436865124>
HoS and Torus you mean ?
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
Next friday
if you know you know
im not even half of luna's degen
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
luna is a degen
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
can't, the server need you to submit application and sh*t <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
private server
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
3 charges and weapon skill CD built in pri
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
i will get Griseo's skin and be done with whaling
this game just suck in general
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
Does she even wear anything lower half
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
i will recheck on this later
they seem did adjust it, mech enemies seem fall down properly now during time slow <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
1 more good news 
Elysia ER passive : all signets level +1
no more news
that's it for v1 guys <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Elf Elysia is called The fairy Elysia
fairy theme <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
the queen of all fairy
the most beautiful woman in the world
Titania probably refer to the fairy queen Titania in A midnight's summer dream
Maybe HoH stig name is Elysia The Titania <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
not a buff
so 5.8 Aponia actually lost 2% TDM
also last Aponia adjustment was due to bug
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>  HoF bosses literally appear 1 per patch
no one bother check MA
but i can't find any picture
SSS Hepha in MA
cause Ely also can't steal their bosses
will HoT and HoF bosses still show up
the problem is that <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
so expect FGO, Sushang and Kosma to be on 6.0 Abyss cycle
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
not that they're new
it's usually mean they will also on live server
Sushang
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
but beta abyss has FGO and Sushang
not sure if this good news
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
but that is trash <:Despairge:957713851103735838>
that is actually all <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
-1000 social credits
im sorry <a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
oh it's not QUA Kevin, just QUA Kosma come to Abyss, they use the similar kanji so i confused <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
but SSS Hepha also come in MA
idk if this is good news or not<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:Wokege:859195243030904860>
HoV
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
but i really can't find any
im trying to find some good news for you guys
HoH is gonna released to deal with new content
HoV was released to beat the hard content
nah
this is the most unreal update ever
this is even more extreme than HoF patch
or facing husk
that's the 0 cost buff
ER 6.0 : 
-Change F17 to Hepha but Hepha will immune to lightning and fire
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
and +30% ice dmg
HoH leader skill : 50 starting SP for ice valks in team ( S0 )
oh btw
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
time to go on NGA and asking for a truck riot
Mihoyo really added 10 more abyss weather <:OttoScared:873503904401338409>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
save it for HoS or Eden
this affixes is busted on HoS tho
max sp/s and max sp red
not attack affix
SP affix
SK is free
no MA Hepha
it's only Abyss Hepha for now
Ice RPC should only have freeze trauma
should have Ice RPC too
heard you guys like him
Kosma also joining Abyss
just expect to score like 2/3 less
you can still use MPE on SSS Hepha
<:heh:990308225314328576>
nah you can still use 6S
<:heh:990308225314328576>
time to send a truck to Mihoyo HQ
2023 Honkai design be like : 
-SSS Kallen ( can only be damaged by Kiana ) 
-SSS DXY ( can only be damaged by Dudu )
and high physical res
it's immune yea
heard you want to use HoF and HoT ? sike
<@385655541248163840>  <@370438895965306882>  <@148145559897636865>
6.0 ER valks : HoH and HoV
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Griseo skin has vfx change
Senyuuki is showcasing her gameplay in stream
but so does HoF
she is using ER stats in v1 yea
her 3 set has 50% ice dmg taken
don't take it seriously but
but it's V1
the numbers is busted tho
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Elysia The Flawless or sth like that
her stigs is herself
doesn't seem so
New Abyss boss : 
-Ice RPC 
-Freeze Hepha 
-QUA Kosma
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
HoH is not MPE awaken
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
hope her gameplay will look stunning like her vfx
12 more hours til beta
i just remember everyone talking about S2 being the least sth during 7TR testing
is S2 HoT even a big boost to her damage ? i only remember SS and SS1 being one <:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
im actually unsure about that one
<a:diesofcringe:972420698654003210>
if they want to push it they can make her damage on the same range with SS HoT, that will at least make sure Fire SP won't really change the tide for HoF
probably balancing around S0 HoF and S2 HoT, like slightly better than those 2
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
how much OP
i mean she will be OP yea
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
HB help me reducing the tilt bar
ice bosses are all RNG fest
<a:BronyaJump:480122156542328834>
i like HB, help me saving my braincells
that will probably depend on how the pull go with Ely herself <:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
<:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
Elf Ely look lacking tho, i wonder should i wait til 6.1 to pull her
<:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
im just asking an example
<:susge:946793003287195678>
you'd rather bedding with a minor that look like adult ?
wait so you're telling me
<:huh:966619839307321394>
she is not a loli wtf
Kusanali is 500 years old
im not into loli wtf
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
where is the bare feet tho
<a:HuTaoPhoneLick:837747326125867039>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
what if they mean bust mode
she is March 7th
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
keep dreaming hacker
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
you still lost 1 point by her finisher
fun fact : HoT time stop is also not entirely timestop
im gonna fly to Shanghai right now and fuck up Mihoyo
me
and SSS Carole or SS BKE dps is too damn high
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
if Mobius can't one shot P2 Houdou she is basically useless
mobi only competent with BKE on type Houdou because RL is so damn squishy
Mobi is trash in Nirv type weather nini
Senti set the bar for physical too damn high
im pretty sure the reason why they won't make her mech is because they can't push her number far enough to compete with Physical <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
so it can still be fire SP + S rank support
Mobius + Aslaug
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
you don't remember last year anni
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
4 Psy dpses compete on the same boss for no reason
jfc, fire SP better not showing up in 6.1 <:pepe2:368744338445828106>
not like SW score any better than Felis in those bosses
she can probably steal Hellmaru and Benares tho
Senti + Griseo
HB + Felis sound OP but you know what sound more OP
im unsure about ranged tank
ngl
isn't it already official
wait why <#963273616852652095> <:HMM:966625453194485760>
cause HB is there
she will definitely win tho
only 1 type weather for her, it's Kasumi
what type counter <:HMM:966625453194485760>
HoH will steal Kasumi from HoF instead
HoT has her own boss and lightning husk
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
hepha is her shill boss
<@385655541248163840>
this should be her coverage
ice mech : Hepha, Kasumi 
ice psy : Elysia
ice neutral : Hellmaru, Benares
ranged : Assaka, tank
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
do you actually ask that
even Chongyun can
all ice valks and their moms can freeze enemies <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
Yea stronger than WE then you basically have the 4th valk
So this one also need to be at least 80% of WE’s buff
WE has the strongest buff among all
Ice elf will be busted tho
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

Toward QUA Herrscher
We need to move even faster
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
No one want QUA unless it’s a busted QUA
But i hope we can skip QUA patch
Yea that too
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Skipping this shitty patch
There is hope tho
Yea that’s why we have to wait
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
And new BP is on next monday
Their main supply all lasted 3 weeks compare to the usual 4 weeks
You can check all the 5 weeks patch from 4.8 til 5.2
It’s usually a sign for 5 weeks patch
Yea to make sure we need to wait for BP, just notice that Vill-V supply is 3 weeks
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
5.9 is a 5 weeks patch ?
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>

<:HMM:966625453194485760>
the timing is still normal with fast ulti and combo
Moriso tested it on beta
maybe just some bug we don't know
seem like not fast ulti or fast combo <:HMM:966625453194485760>
we have 1 like that ? <:woggers:652740192653934633>
im just not sure what bug did AE have <:HMM:966625453194485760>
this one was talked about like 3 weeks ago in maincord <:pepe2:368744338445828106>
the double weapon one
Felis one is a bug
istg if animation cancel is a bug i will send a truck to Mihoyo HQ
im more concerned about what the hell did they fix with AE

<:worryoraora:653794051308650536>
<:worryoraora:653794051308650536>
she has Herrscher Slayer in her kit dumbass <:AgonConcern:799494217717776425>
her coverage is as huge as any Herrschers in their prime
same with HoS
she was released in CNY
no, the physical Herrscher is PE <:AgonConcern:799494217717776425>
because Physical Herrscher just out
can't be physical <:AgonConcern:799494217717776425>
<:AgonConcern:799494217717776425>
not like she can be anything else
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
probably due to story content shop
5.9 will also have Blue Elysia skin
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
<:TeriDerpMelon:928714410762063943>
Dicken G3 Phys in 5.9

Imagine Paga has  SP supply rerun with 30 guarantee
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Herrschers usually have their mentor or someone close to them as stigmata
6.1 will probably have Bastet and maybe Handel FOCA
<:OttoScared:873503904401338409>
epi
Physical does have Cezanne <:worry3:978153888421126164>
if you miss SP supply debut, just pretend to be blind and wait for better sp supply
Mihoyo favorite battlesuit
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
so she is HC
<:woggers:652740192653934633>

But you use Felis in there
Morb is also close to BKE in type Houdou
That should be it since HoT take back her bosses  <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Eden is better than AE in blood weather

just use FR  <:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
i think the difference between 0/4 Morb and 4/4 Morb is like 50% in ER

no double collapse <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>

pick your pokemon
they probably want to widen the score between HoT and Aponia
this one, from 20% to 30%
for now it's 10% TDM

no next patch is HoV with Herrscher<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
HoV is so bad they can't even make her usable in ER
<:huh:966619839307321394>

5.8 Abyss week 4 P1
Boss : RPC
Weather : Lightning Up, Physical Down
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
 Oh no no no  - Mihoyo
 7T on SSS and DoS on SS guys  - normal advice
oh keilo i also realised with this they straight up kill DoS on HoT
with 2 SSS bosses even if you pull Abyss only you will perform really  well in MA <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
lore wise its accurate
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
lmao
every Felis skin is spending
because they add FT in 5.8 <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
free meme outfit in 5.9
Vill-V and Meme
long patchnote <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
with Oh Summer
HoF had both
v1 always heavy <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
you forgot 30 minutes to download it
this game suck
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
at least they won't be dumb and put 2 physical SSS bosses in same week <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
good news is that we will have Ely on Tank starting from 5.8 so at least HoF can be free if she is needed for 0s kill
3 bosses if you have SSS PE for Jizo
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
PE has 2 top score bosses in MA
this is also the most PE shill i have ever seen since 4.7 AF
it's probably will be 1 phys + 1 ele SSS for every week
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
they won't be that dumb
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
i don't think maincord know what is MA
tbh i think 4th boss would end up better than this <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
just make valks that can do abyss and replace MA with SSS
oh i just realised with this change they don't need to balance around MA and Abyss anymore
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
so FT will die next year
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
why do you call her Mobius, it's Morbius
probably spending
Ely summer is free
Morbius is probably pyramid
Felis is probably spending then ?
can i get another HoS first <:huh:966619839307321394>
no replacing
they said extra one
it's double SSS and double SS i think
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Jizo-FGO-DXY-AKA
imagine the line up be like this
just gg ?
what happen if it's Jizo and FGO
but 2 of them <:huh:966619839307321394>
and some AL AW
20 xtals
i think it said the 2nd SSS boss will have seperate rewards too
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
i think
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
like 2 SSS and 2 SS
it's another one in MA every week
no wait, you guys are mistaking, it's not new SSS boss
they said a 2nd SSS boss will be added
below Felis skin
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
it will be 2 SSS and 2 SS from 5.9 i think
they're adding another SSS boss into MA
<@148145559897636865>
2 cat skins in a row
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
yea, only know about til the CG is up <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
unless she is another HoF case
if she show up in story then we will probably know her apperance after July 14th
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
they don't put story contents in beta like at all
you can only datamined it when it go live
beta doesn't have story contents
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
stop coping tet
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
but account in 30 minutes to download it
29 minutes till beta
it's always morbing time
looking a little bit sus
nebrium posted it but i also can't find the source <:HMM:966625453194485760>
2 birds in 1 stone
spending will be good for people that simp Vill-V
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
should be pyramid
So spending will be in 5.9 then
Look like it
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
Morbing ?
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
and if Ely is Herrscher of Fate then she will also be HF
i just realised Vill-V battlesuit name is also HF
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
augment is real, we will have Teri augment soon
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
WT or augment
the question is what kind of farmable <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
but 6.1 can be farmable one tho
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
the only reason Vill-V supply has reward feature is because next valk will also be S rank gacha
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Looks cool tho
She looks like she come from a Nintendo game
waiting for math peeps <:HMM:966625453194485760>
istg if this is another Nyx case i'd cry again
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
still a money grab valk
that's huge
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
it's not a bait if they dish out 10 QUA bosses like 4.8
look like canon already <:HMM:966625453194485760>
QUA dps, doesn't sound that bad
but she is a QUA tho <:HMM:966625453194485760>
wait GLB beta is already started <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
waiting for thursday
it's up
CN doesn't have future sight like us
it's fair for HoT upgrade to not steal other bosses anw <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
she needs type weather to completely outdamage PE
not like BKE remain as the top rn for phys weather anymore <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Current record is SS1 HoT can 47.568 i think
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Should be this thursday unless Mihoyo is dumb dumb
<:huh:966619839307321394>
5.8 MA week 2
coincidence ? i think not
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
valk reveal day
guess what do we also have on June 23rd
Act 1 : June 13th
Act 2 : June 16th
Act 3 : June 23rd
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Jizo and Type Huodou
Your BKE will have used for our next 2 weeks
5.8 will actually have at least 4 phys weather
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Just like expected
CN week 2 first boss is Type HoS
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
i guess it does have the downside for FOCA select, some f2p folks can't guarantee weapon only anymore
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
and remove expanded expa
they just move the 50 pulls counter in Expanded Expansion to FOCA
it's 100 pull guarantee for S-rank valk
<:worrywink:963350381545521152>
Flat
not Aponia T - Griseo M - Vill V B - Fu Hua F ?
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
sadly never <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
Maybe she can send real 7TR to Mei
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
when Griseo equipped it with 2 pc effect, she can trigger it with her ulti
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
Inb4 it's not the mastermind that kill all the remain FCs, it will be Kalpas doing it instead in 5.8 
banger patch <:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
5.9 Vill V S rank
6.0 Ely Herrscher
6.1 Anni S rank + SP
This is the worst future possible <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
5 SP cards and 5 boxes
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:SeeleSegs:966624134756970517>
Could also be summer PE , Juan turn into a seahorse
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Which is more appeal ?
Or string bikini
Yea she just need to wear nothing
<:TeriAhe:973793204237398106>
Naked
free HoT <:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
Or is it gonna be summer PE
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Probably Mobius
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
Also 10k for this year summer outfit
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Yea that look more like it
Zhenyi will be in 7TR supply, i saw the script
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
They will somehow find a way to put Herrscher in 5.9, i hope
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Like, im pretty sure if that happen CN community will send trucks to Mhy HQ
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
I thought about this too but it seem impossible for them to push Herrscher to 6.0
The cockroach ?
<:nonono:963350975479955466>
Mihobo changed her to combo to make sure she can’t use Paga
Hide all the shielded bosses
Mihoyo will do the usual strat for next 2 patches with Griseo release
Her ulti got halfed, no more Griseo dps <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Doesn’t exist <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Should have wait next week
I agree that it’s still too soon anw
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
The only one that can’t be replaced
He just stated out the dps ( PE ) and the 3rd slot ( SnS vs Griseo )
Because HoS is default slot on both team
That comparison didn’t state HoS
No i mean
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
No one can replace Senti without special impair anw
HoS is default slot
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
SSS HoF
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>

50% of gacha games in CN use JP VAs
nah, JP voice bring more awareness even in Chinese market
and Kiana JP is literally ruin my mood whenever i happen to hear it ingame CG if i forgot to patch the audio to CN
Senti sound like a woman in her 60s
Raven sound like a woman in her 50s

it's on chibi's twitter
Still reliable last time i checked <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
i starting to think free speech is a mistake for some people
can we suggest a feedback for a mod to shut up ?
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Headcanon after headcanon
Literally beyond saving
That channel is beyond trash
That fucker need to stop moderating lore channel
I will just mod mail first
That will leave such a bad taste to people that actually enjoy the story
Because this one is pissing me off so much
Can you even mod mail this ?
Pinned an opinion
Who the fuck
So just fuse the 2 together
They want to make a suit focus more on Mei but Kurikara is also a part of HoT
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Actual Henshin moment
Mei about to call forth Kurikara with her ultimate but to fuse instead of riding Kurikara
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
Probably just Origin
Act 3 : Next Monday 
Valk reveal : next Thursday 
Beta : the day after
On monday
That channel basically work on voluteering mode
There are no mod in that channel
dw that's 95% of lore channel too
kinda heavy
like saying it straightfoward with 100% confidence
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
a member of maincord lore channel, who just said that sora doesn't have passion for their work
probably still a kid
oh, i noticed that he is slow on picking up stuff so i think he just genuinely don't know how heavy what he just said <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
with who ?
<a:agonPunch:818862400728072222> ?
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
Does this one contain any spoiler ? I thought Kevin and Hua’s convo explain this quite straightforward on how Finality Authority work
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
Or rule34
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Cause after this schedule we need a break patch
1 of them tcan be an S-rank
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
Need to wait for their APHO version showing up to become SP
Until APHO
Can’t have them as SP
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Because we all know who is that “ someone “
Tesla propose a plan that in order to defeat Kevin and secure a future for humanity, they need to surpass Finality Authority. And in order to do that, 1 of the steps are letting someone absorb all the cores together. Basically no Herrscher Seele, no Herrscher Teri
yea only 6 feet under
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
I haven’t seen this concept in any other writing’s culture except CN
Really ? Cause MEI’s explanation about the origin of Honkai is actually a common concept in CN’s novel writing
Wait let me ask this, if you’re not familiar with CN culture, how will you intercept these dialouges
Even if they don’t understand
At least someone can use it as a quote
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Why does everyone in there seem to not understand the meaning of her research
Carv, you haven’t explained MEI’s research about Honkai in lore channel ?
Spreading misinfo like today is the last day they can use internet
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
I still fail to see the reason to exist of lore channel
<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>

oh that, yea <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
I have 0 expectation for how story progressing, i was talking about how pacing affecting gameplay
And what does it have to do in here again ? <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Haha, you got me there, good one <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Don’t let your imagination get you
I was talking about pacing <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

Chapter 34 event last until March 9th which is the end of 6.4
There are 70% might be chapter 35
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
all the people in that channel rn are GGZ enjoyers
won't matter
about not having an offcial server and refuse to use off topic discussion
and GGZ players cry about it
i did once<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
the purple statue
anw this is not fit for this channel, my temper is too high to contain myself <:clueless:1030024390190055445>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
turn out no one care
they used to think playing GGZ was cool
GGZ players are just suffered from superiority complex
we only see the statue
we don't even know her new design close up
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
what a surprise
and GGZ players are upsetting about it
they changed her design in new arc, she no longer have the same design that resemble GGZ HoTE anymore
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
 iconic design  ,  huge impact in the story  ,  my GGZ experience 
the reason is fucking dogshit
this is why i hate communicate with people that suffer superiority complex <:clueless:1030024390190055445>
just some dude complaining about design choice with stupid reason human could never think of
that's too toxic
they surpass my expectation
when i think that lore channel can't be any more worse <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
but Lichun is based on the location of the sun iirc
yea Lichun is also called the beginning of spring <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
so next year CN spring start from late January
their new year is also the spring festival
CN spring is based on astronomy in the old time
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
Carv do you think you can tell people in lore channel to stfu, my temper is too high rn i might get banned if i type anything in there
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Even though that is like 5% of that channel
Shouldn’t, there are still people that want to learn about new chapter in that channel but they can’t understand Chinese
The only value left is a place to post new chapter translations for those that can’t read Chinese
It used to be an acceptable channel
That channel is beyond saving anw
As far as i see
Cause this dude understading about lore is in the same level with CN discussion
Does other mods let him in charge of lore channel ?
Who is this dude anw
Like they’re all pissing me off equally now
Both and some others
And they blame it on the… characters ?
They can’t understand anything that writters want to deliver
They’re so lost in their world
Like
Half of the fuckers rn pissing me off
If it’s just a place to post translation then that channel don’t need the right to message
Can’t agrue like how normal people should
Can’t clear misinfo because people are too dumb
At some point i wonder the value to exist of maincord lore channel
sweet
1 for each arm
<@803575968374849536>  how about this, easier to understand ?
The world is forver changing, every next moment is different from the last one, that’s why change itself is forever unchanging
It’s yaru
The chapter description is about how Bonya realised the true meaning of Reason
She will 100% get the Reason Core back
Bonya <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
Whatever that is, it’s time for True Herrscher of Reason
Seele want to give Dark Seele her own name and Dark Seele chose Seele as her name
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Don’t do that again
Calling Dark Seele as Veli is disrespecting to her character
Earth is flat
Blocking <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
it's so fucking cringe when people saw THAT pic and start to discuss about it with similar stigmata design as if they woke up and just thought about it 5 minutes before
<:whip:1024122299034632272>  ?
when carv was lurking in there
someone posted  that  pic in maincord
<:huh:966619839307321394>

but personally i hope not, i don't like the idea of someone using Cecilia's gene to go against both of her daughter  <:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
well i guess her being Ceci's clone has highest chance rn <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
oh i did notice her silhoutte being GGZ Kiana, i just thinking putting that silhouette there mean Hare has high chance to be her own character than Ceci clone or Ling Shuang clone
look like an original character
should be
checkmate
if reading can actually change people then what is the deal with maincord lore channel then <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
you know that using a translated doc can't stop people from being wrong <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

yea but this dude sound way too confident <:huh:966619839307321394>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
it's all wrong
and when i read their messages
this dude sound extremely confident when talking about lore
bro
Kinda weird how she didn’t need to live to maintain it, unlike her ER death
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
Kinda vague about that part, im guessing probably still die on the moon but her mission was to open the door for Prometheus
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
So Felis didn’t die on the moon
Has she been ever not one ?
rare to see
that's a lot of words and some seriosu convo in here <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
that's concerning
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
but he just confused about how you nickname her
thought carv mean Sushang is Susie
oh <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
but carv mean Susie as in Sushang
who <:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
<:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
like how Carole is also SP valk
she is not our current Ai-chan so she can be the SP valk
my bet is on Ai-chan instead <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

it's just a possibility
about to see the most jebaited scene in history, Kiana + Dudu vs Kevin
act 2 is just trailer for next arc
same with 25EX back then
today story is only trailer
after today stream
yea Sushang's parents
HoS and Hua conversation about her 5th disciple
and it's chapter 21 oops, don't know why i wrote 19
yea i will replay the chapter, have to finish some works first <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
and Ling Shuang is not just human, her existence has different meaning to Kevin at that time
they're supposed to be dead because they're human, but the only dead one confirmed was Qin Suyi
the cloud talk
so she has the highest chance to be Hare
the existence of Ling Shuang is what Kevin needed to believe in STIGMA
when HoS had a talk with Fu Hua
no it's Ling Shuang in chapter 19
she is the reason why Kevin think STIGMA won't change human into other species
because she is not normal
the only dead one confirmed was Qin Suyi
and she is also not dead
yes, her name is Ling Shuang
but Hare has the highest chance to be her 
that's Ling Shuang
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
to think this might be Hare 
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>

Kevin wasn’t even serious with her
She is not gonna have a rematch with strongest man alive nini
No sign of new suit yet
No she was almost became a popsicle

And by letting Kevin steal authority of END, Prometheus is dying for real too
Prometheus can’t do that much, it can only make sure no new Herrschers will be born
Tldr : CE Honkai system was cheated by PE ( MEI, Mobius, Prometheus ) to make sure no more than 13 Herrschers will be born. Kevin is now absorbing the power of END bit by bit before END change into a differnet being compare to PE END

<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
That is true
<:HMM:966625453194485760>

<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
Shouldn’t it be Ego : Herrscher of Human ?
I wonder why did it her name translate to Herrscher of Human : Ego
Who ? <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Mei is just a random girl that was chosen to be HoT
It’s Kiana and Dudu that has MEI’s genes
No
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Lorewise no one look like each other between PE and CE
They just decided to keep it
It’s a tribute for GGZ from the early version of the game
Cause they didn’t look the same lore wise
I need solid evidences <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Even when i want Griseo to be alive
No im also a lore enthusiat
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

Im gonna be real, it’s just reusing assets

Griseo can’t grow up, even when she come back to Earth she would still be a child
<:worrySniperAngry:920552131642142741>
Only share the same multiverse
So far the connection between the 2 games is zero
But don’t take all the talk about GGZ seriously when they tried to link it to HI3
<:TeriDerpMelon:928714410762063943>
They are all in the same multiverse
It’s just GGZ if you saw someone talked about more than 14

I can’t think of any better theme for PE than summer
<a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
PE should have had summer skin this year
<:kleekpoint:858368564251590668>
<:wokege:966623232918712331> i still wait for the days all these skins get added
<a:worryramen:967581731395870770>

My favorite skin is still Time Runner and Oh Summer
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
I prefer the neon one
<a:KianaCookie2:646215964471328789>

The showdown of an era
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
I guess it come down to which extent they go with ignite SP but i have really high hope on HoF in this matter <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Im actually positive that HoF can send DA to graveyard with actual ignite SP
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
without the support part
Vill-V look like S rank ignite
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
I can’t wait for a new fire dps valk, we sure lack fire dps valk a lot
free 2 models
could be APHO Mei into APHO Timido yea <:deadge:975652771082698782>
isn't this look like a pivot Jenshin already <:HMM:966625453194485760>
so it's basically gonna be this : 
-5.9 Vill-V
-6.0 Herrscher
-6.1 anni valk 
-6.2 SP Timido
-6.3 CNY cause next year CNY is around end of Jan
6.1 start in early October, CN anni is mid October
non-Nirv player can exclude Vill-V and Elf
so i will need 150 pulls for Vill-V, around 36k for Herrscher, 30k for elfs and 70k for whatever the hell they have on spending <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
you're missing the full picture, it's Herrscher before big spending anni
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Nini, your pfp is the exact same type of valk
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
150 pulls, if you're a Nirv player you pull all the way till 150
time to play Jenshin Impact
this game suck
oh i didn't account for expa pull, probably everyone will SS her again in Nirv <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
1 free stigma box from event, so within 60 pulls if you can get 1 weapon + 1 random stigma you already 4/4 her
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
yea, basically within 110 pulls you should have 4/4 Vill-V even if you were born under a bad star
so she is basically SW
we will also have 1 Vill-V stigma box for free through event shop
also her stance look cool ngl
look fun tho
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
her gameplay is about shooting as hard as possible
look like it
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
so Herrscher is 6.0
Vill-V supply will have refund
alright, bad news confirmed
<:worrywink:963350381545521152>
no shot they add FGO and HoD in 5.9 right ?
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
forget to add ignite SP
make dps fire valks trigger QTE on ignite
so where the fuck is Fire SP
probably DPS
looking at her gameplay
didn't specify
VG powercreep
QUA Fire
this game suck <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
no Herrscher
refund one i mean
with discount supply
Vill-V will be farmable
if they still have some kindness left
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
a real break patch
5.1 was Ely patch
HoF was 5.0, anni was 5.2
isn't this just a go broke angle ?
Anni spending after Herrscher patch
Herrscher is just either 5.9 or 6.0, most likely 6.0 at this point
bad news keep coming
6.1 <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
I see
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
WoH didn’t attach it to Mei, HoC was born from project Child and attach to Mei when she left WS base to Kolosten and met with WoH later
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
You mean HoC stopped her life ?
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Calm down epi
She is not playable
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Still worry <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
2022 and we still have typeless boss
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
dw Herrscher is 100% 5.9, it's in my wishlist
since Griseo is psy
wait but she can also be Psy <:HMM:966625453194485760>
human only need 1 kidney to live
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
like 5 minutes before act 3 go live, they upload the CGs first
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
through CG scenes
oh i just realised, we may even know if Ely is coming or not even before act 3 begin
time wait no one
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
did Morisa post the result yet ? QUA, IMG or Psy  <:HMM:966625453194485760>
but CN will have it tmr so nothing really change and it's also kinda obvious
probably forget to lock it <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
so she's not mech or bio
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
No more morbin
Those used to be Morbius
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
nowhere to be found on Eternal Elysian
on Kostolen yea
it's now or never
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Mihoyo owe Fire a good SP
<:TeriAhe:973793204237398106>
it's gonna be S rank Elyisa + SP Vill-V
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
Cute and funny
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
so she doesn't look like final boss
we will have a boss fight with Vill-V in act 3
but Vill-V doesn't look like the best candidate
as long as WoH can reach ER then technically yes <:holothink:963352118855626753>

Aponia is the real master of souls

She is even more skillful than Senti
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Why didn’t WoH choose Aponia as HoS
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Carv, did act 2 confirm this bit that Aponia herself soloed PE HoS and restraint Su at the same time on scene
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Did act 2 also confirm Aponia soloed HoS ?

Basically inconsistent of a character
It’s the Eren Yeager
Also before dude die, he said to his crush that “You should forget me and live your life” and then later when he is with the friend, dude went “I don’t want her to forget about me, i want her to keep remember about me for 10 years at least”
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
Like chill
And his best friend got him with “Thank you for becoming a murderer for our sake”
Kill around 50% or 90% human population

What happened with beating nini
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
You’re stupid
The Luofu plot walks into a bar...

The inside is a wreck. Furniture is destroyed, there's blood...

Wow, what happened here? Asks Luofu plot.

Epic stuff, says a hot guy tonelessly, there was friendship, betrayal, people died, relationships broken. But you had to have seen it.

Luofu plot considers asking for more details, but then he sees a kid and focuses on beating him up instead.

It then asks for a bland short drink, pays, and then...

...

...

...

Says bye and leaves. The end!

(But then comes back to do some logistics management)

<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
don't think so
is he better than Kafka tho?
you're too generic
Anyone guess
Which type is heki
There are 3 type of players:
1) Pull for waifu
2) Pull for meta and call them waifu
3) Just pull and call whoever they have as waifu
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
Is Jingliu broken?
She only know how to pull mid valks
Ofc she does
Just build QQ
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
Wait for Fire Kafka
There is only 1 Kafka
where did you copy this one from
is he wrong tho?
<:whip:1090806260540129330>
you have Sumeru and Fontaine to finish
what are you even doing
what if you purposely fail the assassination, does it still count, cause it doesn't require him to die, just an attempt
or he has to swallow it by mouth?
can you inject it in his body instead
can you fuck his wife?
you skip to the 3rd one and get back to the 2nd later once you complete the final task
alphabetical
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
from top to bottom
do all of them
do the opposite
whenever you think about doing something
heki i will give a once in a lifetime advice
that's overreacting, it will get better next year
what's Genshin reward for this year annivesary
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>

Genshin is just annoying when people trying to nitpick my personal sheet
easy to do it on excel than Genshin
i watched Edison Clara's math a while ago
GSR TC look fun yea
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
with how much heki argue with people in WFP about GSR, i thought for sure heki at least know the basics of GSR's mechanic
if you're into Star Rail TC, just join KQM and learn the basic tbh
nice cooking, bud
<a:aothatday:925647030091665438>

HSR already have Kevin
Sakura in HSR will be called CherryB
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Jingwei
Hua does have a nickname
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

Hua's expy will be 2 people, Heng and Ua
Mace doesn't voice JingLiu
what about wasting Ms. Tao Dian on Arlan
still lose to Kafka tho
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
what about wasting Sun Ye on Midyuan
Skip Cloud Quintet for a budget scammer <:Deadge:916024193567559710>

the 3 most iconic builds
DoT, stall, nuke
that's like 1 of the most iconic build of turn based
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
investment require is also too high
Kafka is also weak, relax
The investment require is too high
F2P Jing Yuan is bad
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
For Yan Win
But most likely in the past
That was the first time it was mentioned so can’t know if it’s past or present yet
Jepella is the planet they’re on
Jepella Rebellion = They, the sterallon hunters, cause a rebellion to happen, rescue Kafka and bring the downfall to this planet

The mighty Yan Qing
His only good point is that he is raising future Aeon
Baited dps
Jing Yuan suck without his LC
Why do you need to invest more money in Genshin In Space
I thought it was obvious
Nini got an advice for you
You’re missing 3 slots
Might want to check your game
GSR has 4 slots
Heki last time i check
She deal no damage
I also think HoT suck when i use HoT with JK and HB
“ She sucks because she require investment “
Why does heki talking like GSR reddit
I came back from the future
Cause i already played it
you still get full rewards
if you pick no the quest is automatically complete
he is walking the path of the beast
chill
he is a beast tho
to show the wide coverage

That’s why you need to play all Mihobo’s games
You’re boring

they never did, they're strangers, the only thing connected them was Fu Hua
<:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
like all of them stop considering each other as family anymore
no, after killing Hua they all walked away from the family
what did they do?

yea, all the artists that posted R18 of Uma Musume on Pixiv all disappear after Cygames  confront  them <:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
cause the owners of 60% the top ranking horses are Yakuza
you will most likely get sued by Cygames or get killed if you live in Japan
btw do you know that if you draw R18 of Uma Musume <:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
then the race part is just normal pvp
that training can cost up to 1k per day btw
in that  training  period is when you talk with your waifu, comfort or encourage her
basically you train your waifu, hope they get the right stats
it's a dating sim
the game don't have anything to do with horse racing

If they let you skip the stories, there will be nothing left in Genshin

So when Kafka’s banner is up it’s technically correct to ask “

A good one
human's nature is to protect their favorite toy even when they know the toy can be dangerous <:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
give it 6 months
but turn base eventually not everyone cup of tea
people expecting greatness from Mihobo's game
i don't know if this game will keep being as successful as Genshin tho, the launch is great but it was also because of Genshin hype
that's like going all in on Blind cards
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
if anything i know about Mihoyo is that they do expect it to be this big or else no one will put 9 digits budget for PR
instead of getting rant about predator system of Genshin
<:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
the HSR system will get them more good reviews
maybe, just maybe
while normal people wouldn't do it
they would still make the same, because whales will have to pay more <:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
the pressure on mental is halved
it's half of what Genshin needed
and in HSR it's 1
in Genshin weapon system, before swiping to pay up for it, you have to think about 2 more pities
because the price is cheaper
<:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
how many people actually do that
paying up for my mistake
do i want to use real money to go all the way ?
if i roll on Genshin weapon banner and miss
taking the bait is different with paying up for it <:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
because the system in HSR aim for the money from normal people
it was born to ease up the whales
there is no world that the Genshin weapon system is tailored to make profit from normal people
you're warned before pulling with that system
unless they desperately want it
the guarantee system in Genshin weapon banner literally make sure normal human won't ever touch it
i don't think you understand revenue in Genshin banner to begin with <:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
not for normal players
the new system of Genshin was tailor for whales
the old weapon system hurt even the whale
do you think they can make money of normal people with Genshin weapon banner ?
not in Genshin
they improved it in HSR
idt you know how bad  the Genshin weapon banner make player don't want to pull
that's why they improve it <:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
2 rate up weapons with guarantee system is the same as 1 rate up with guarantee sytem
that's like saying  my mistake is not real when i pretend it's not exist 
do you know how much R5 used to cost ?
are you high ?
lmao
there is no such thing as hard trained
what Mihoyo good at is  making you feel the game is fair 
because it will kill the vibe of the players
that will leave extremely bad vibe for players
why do you want to repeat the same mistake and later on adding the same system with Genshin
that's why guarantee weapon have to appear
because the system in Genshin was bad in the beginning
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
wdym by removing 1 rate up ?
4* guarantee will kill potential profit
<:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>

Right ?
At least you can win in life
<:terixd:652745198518140978>
is it crystal clear tho
yea it's imply that it's DanHeng, Blade and Jingliu
and Blade is also an immortal himself
of 5 people, 3 must pay a price should mean that 3 people involved in the attempt to break Xianzhou's vow <:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
imagine being schooled by Jingliu <a:Yeehaw:999641827080675400>
a form of reincarnation
he probably seal the memories himself
turning that person into a monstrosity
DanHeng was probably tried to revive someone
a sin made by DanHeng should be messing it up
given the Xianzhou's vow to never try to mess up the cycle of life and death
could be
and then Danheng turn his  beloved  into a  monstrosity 
yea, only have some surface clues about it
so it should be Jingliu
it said Blade used to be stabbed by a master swordman
used to fight alongside until DanHeng commited a sin
they're not the same person, used to be friend
it should be in an artifact set in HSR
we already have some clue about it <:ok:1088133019455467560>

they're fated to be successful
Da Wei and 2 other CEOs are just cracked at doing business
tbh the success of Mihoyo is actually just a matter of time now that i think about it
they have 2 rival publisher under their names
Shuseisha does the same
it's actually better to let your consumers arguing about your products rather than comparing it with outside product
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
yea it's actually smart move from Da Wei, creating civil competition is better than letting players compare their game to Genshin ripoff, BOTW and TOTK
that's like 10 pulls

So her S0 is struggle on her own shill
She is not the stronger version of BKE like she is supposed to be
Worst shill of all time
Just look at Hare’s shill
Shilling won’t mean shit if the valk itself is not stronger
Cause the game refuse to do powercreep
And it doesn’t work
Genshin already doing that
<:keqshrug:830244288028999681>

Do it consistently then
I still need to do 1 rotation to deplete it
Back when it was 450D
Never have been
You need to use the correct answer
Heavy shield in this temp is just a no go
At least
They need 1 rotation to get rid of the shield
Triple supports can’t deplete the shield with 1 button
But HoR bosses gimmick is heavy shield
Dps wise triple supports is not far off from other teams
It’s the different in their gimmick
The 2 bosses of HoR
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
Triple supports literally cover 90% of ice content
Kira literally make that team 10 times stronger
RC is still hang in there with triple supports
If we’re being serious
That make no sense but also
Where is the copypasta

chance of getting hit in other teams are >= 20%
see, except when it's with Preservation <:ok:1088133019455467560>
Chance of Bonya getting hit by each team 
-With Serval : 21.4%
-With March 7th : 17.6%
-With Natasha : 20%
What is the team
<:KyaruNerd:608064143773139000>
The chance of getting hit will be : 30 - 30 - 25 - 15
Yea, for example if your team have 2 preservation, 1 destruction, 1 harmony
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
Taunt value per faction :
- 75 : Erudition, Harmony
- 100 : Abundance, Hunt, Nihility
- 125 : Destruction
- 150 : Preservation
No matter the context
So Gepard weapon is always the choice
Which only increase 1-2% chance of getting hit
And Gepard weapon add like 5 or 10 taunt value
Her shield add 5 taunt value to the one that have the shield
Then March 7th chance of getting hit is 33%
If your team taunt value in total is 450
Each paths have different taunt value
The taunt value on skills and weapons are like 5 and 10
It actually does not matter

like actually put in work
the only 1 i know trying to do sth with XInyan is Terrapin
people never try anything with Xinyan before 2.0
why would people give Himeko/Yanqing a chance and not Xinyan
but then
yea but then she is fine, her kit is awkward but you can definitely make it work <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
i also think people downplay Xinyan too much in Genshin
also 1 offrate Yanqing mean you miss the chance to get Clara/Bailu/Welt/Bronya <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
doesn't mean it's the wisest investment
ofc he can still be put in good use
invest in him
it's fine to use him
like
if the amount you think of can be as many as Sushang or others <:shruge:1079371164159311982>

just think of a boss that require specifically ice but not physical
to justify an investment, you need to be able to use it

Theory craft in Genshin is good tho as long as people not trying to jerk themself off <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
because it's not Genshin that's why Theory craft is bad
it's the synergies and contents that matter
no
to begin with the idea of theory craft in turn based is already sound absurd
numbers are not everything in turn based <:shruge:1079371164159311982>

That’s what she said
new question is how long can they keep doing it <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
Mihoyo already solved the question on how to make a hit game
they made up for it after that with 1.1 onward
yea Genshin 1.0 PR budget was normal
probably 3 patches
they spent shit ton on HSR
the PR budget is 9 numbers btw <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
the hype back then was crazy
even AAA game can't come close to that <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
Genshin on the 1st month generate 250M and 300M+ in total of 1.0 iirc
like 7 days revenue or something like that
yea i know, i mean that it sort through a specific time period
HSR is nothing close to Genshin revenue on 1.0
<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
that chart is not correct either, probably sort with 7 days revenue
Genshin 1.0 made 250M

a beggar can become an Aeon, a homeless can become an Aeon, a rock can become an Aeon
if they have the gut to do so or they're worthy
anyone can sit on it
think of it like a crown
no <:ok:1088133019455467560>
this setup is just the basic CN novel writing style
<:eleworry:774196654269792266>
Aeon is someone walking on it the farthest
the path will always be there
the path make someone a god, not a god create a path
not the opposite
Aeon is someone that walk the farthest on the path and got blessed to become god
Akivili is dead until it prove otherwise  <:ok:1088133019455467560>
can only be forgotten
but a concept can't be killed
no clue, that will be a thing to find out <:ok:1088133019455467560>
wdym by no longer <:ok:1088133019455467560>
Aeon is someone that recognized by the path
the path is there first before the Aeon
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
it's the path that acknowledge it
the Aeon won't know about it
if someone work on the same path, the blessing is just there
the same way how blessing of Aeon work
it's your body that make it so you have to breath
the answer is more simple than that <:ok:1088133019455467560>
then how did the first human know how to breath <:ok:1088133019455467560>
do you ever ask how did you know the method to breath since you were born
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
that's literally how it work
i said like how the bible/mantra potrait them
because we're living in real world <:ok:1088133019455467560>
the same way how Jesus or Buddha give their blessing in the bible/mantra <:ok:1088133019455467560>
how about you pull the trigger

and he has like 20 PCs
dude is running 9 accounts on 1 PC
i know someone already got their hand on the tool <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
only bot can
human can't walk in a straight line while playing game
usually company based it on  how perfect an account movement is 
some account is running by bot
yea but be careful tho
idk, like 3 monthly 3 BP ? <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
i mean i won't miss cause i will buy an account to play if i ever want to hop on the train <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
but i just can't bother with it yet
my friend have an account with Seele, Bronya, Bailu, Welt and he can sell it to me for 35$
i actually don't have the motivation to play the game yet <:deadge:975652771082698782>
there is already tool selling in chinese forum
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>

later down the road can replace Bonya with Kafka
on lightning shield you just run Jing Yuan, Bonya, Tingyun, Bailu
number wise she is 2nd Bonya <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

Gepard supposed to be a better Fire MC and March 7th
it's definitely balance, there is nothing wrong with 4* having better numbers than Gepard, Yanqing and Welt <:ok:1088133019455467560>

Just by numbers alone she already 2nd only to Bonya
Yea she will be useful <:ok:1088133019455467560>

Someone already went through it
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Why does March take up all aggro ?
In reality none of it matter
People put them together because they sound good
Team meta rn is like paper work
If you lose 50/50 enemies will target March
Yea that’s why they tie in taunt value
It’s 50/50
If they’re the same value
So enemies will target March more often
She has 125
.
150 taunt value
They do
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
March took all the aggro
Oh nvm then, cause there was 1 time i used them in beta and Clara can’t counter shit
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Let me check again
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
So you need to use the shield on March instead of Clara
They’re both Preservation
Clara and March 7th is not a good combo as you think tho
He is literally budget Fire MC <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>

Genshin tho
so doesn't feel that bad
at least standard valk in SR is good <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
ideally you want shield breaking units to be the 2 buffers/sub dps
yea if your shield breaking rely on healer/shielder it will be tough
but number wise they're equal
if the boss is IMG then Otto will be better than Bailu
and build the supports around him to break shield
it's actually the opposite, you can invest in just 1 dps
you will realize it's all easy
if you keep that in mind
nini this game team building is not even hard, it's just how to break shield 101 <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
ideally just Jing Yuan Bonya Bailu + Pela/Welt/Astra/Tingyun ( switch depend on shield )

Turn on Karen mode
And when that happened, it’s time to give them a call
Only spike ping can make those happen
Delay can’t lead to that
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
That’s spike, not delay
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
It won’t affect your action like other genre
This one is turn base tho, like even if your ping is 2000
Does ping even matter <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>

this will make it more clear, would you rather have Bronya/Welt/Clara or Yanqing
strong or weak is relative to who you're comparing with

but Tingyun is Harmony <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
why <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Erudition
and on full auto she grieve whole team
her damage is mediorce
except for Qingque team, Qingque shouldn't even be mentioned
doesn't seem like anything wrong with it

<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
if i want a cool male protag i'd just have to find the nearest mirror
Herta is ice
like Jenshin Impact
it will probably go 1 dps + 2 buffer + shielder/healer
or if more broken supports coming out in future
2 dps + buffer + healer/shielder
buddy you don't want more than 2 dps in your team
she does poorly on less than 3 targets
yea she is a general farmer
the fuck you mean all 3 <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
better than both of them combine <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
they're both lightning dps
btw if you want to pull Jing Yuan then you would probabaly have to skip Kafka <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
Kafka is lightning
Qua dps/sub dps
if they haven't touch her follow attack on DoT target yet
Kafka + Bronie is a good combo
should be Quantum
but you can skip yea
she just deal shit ton of damage
Seele is a straightforward quantum dps
the more nations we have the more cracked MC will be
and MC look like will be cracked so just keep leveling her
yea you want as many options as possible for shieldbreaking <a:cuakhetday:939810174070321202>
yea Bronie is good, lowkey can be considered broken
the limited one
who do you're planning to go for ?
and depend on who you go in future
leveling Clara + Himeko is good option
actually probably no need for Ice dps
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
just a better Gepard
for absolute no reason
Fire MC is just too cracked
looking good, but Fire MC will make Gepard value decrease a little bit, you will want to open more options on Ice + Lightning dps to ultilize Fire MC + Bonya  <:ok:1088133019455467560>
the higher the value is, the more likely to get hit obviously <:wot:998941267041996862>
i read it in the files so they could have changed it
btw, pin this message if you guys need it, it's taunt value per faction <:ok:1088133019455467560>
it's physical, wind and IMG
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
it have to be easy
they already removed all the complicated part of turn base genre
i mean enemies usually should have 2-3 attributes on them, don't have to be IMG <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
Just use the correct attribute
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
May encounter are the mobs you might face them on your way, not main nini
Your team will take more damage if you can’t break the shield every turn you do
So Bailu and Welt only contribute raw buff
The elemental icons are Fire, Wind + Quantum for left one and Physical, Ice + Quantum for right one
This game strat are basically trying to break the shield each turn
Both Welt and Baili are useless here
To fullheal you
And in simi universe you get break room
No content need intese heal yet
Same case with early genshin
When you get fire MC then it’s gonna be Clara MC Serval Pela
Clara Serveal March Pela/Astra for now
So in your case she is bad
But she is fire, same with Himeko
Filler spot
Average on everything
Hook is fine
Only switch her out in boss phase
You will want Himeko on battle phase
When you do simu universe
Bossing she is mid
For farming yea
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
She is a taunt dps
But you will need Fire MC to work well with her
She is a physical dps
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Which part of her kit scream support again
Get me one gresham
Almost 100$ now
Seele + Bonya account price are slowly going down
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
I just check the story and they only available to end of first chapter in Liyue
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Gresham where is my Seele + Bonya account
Unnecessary
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
For full auto
Her C1 is kinda broken
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
Wind attribute + strongest buff
Everyone wish they could have Bonya
N <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
you mean Fire MC
should be this
Taunt value per faction :
- 75 : Erudition, Harmony
- 100 : Abundance, Hunt, Nihility
- 125 : Destruction
- 150 : Preservation
i don't know if anyone make a pic yet but i will write it down, i check it in the files back then
her taunt value is 150
she is Preservation
ofc she does
Thief’s mask suit you
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
He can compete with C1 Sushang now
That’s not bad
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Im gonna whoop your ass rn
This is normal channel
Guys
March 7th's room <:evil:1049317760984940574>
Jing Yuan is a good lightning dps
no reason to do that, for easier time in Metaverse, you want a diverse line up  <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
strongest dps atm <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
she deplete all of the mana bar
even worse if you do full auto
worst dps is actually Qingque
Fire MC is just cracked
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
i tried full auto, still can't die with Fire MC
bring if you have no better Fire
Herta good for mobbing, Asta is jack of all trades
Fire MC shield is just better
as far as thing go in the last beta, there is no content that need intese heal yet
or your dps is not Himeko
good healer but her value decrese once you get fire MC
Is he good for early ?  -> Yes 
Is he the worst 5* ? -> Yes
Is he useless ? -> No
i mean it's relative <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
worst 5*
yea
yea, on par with C0 Sushang
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
not Yanqing
should be end of Liyue
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
too bad after chapter 1 you won't ever use that piece of trash again
for example, if you main dps is already ice then you won't bring Pela<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
use depend on enemy
who ?
not always using the same answer
but this game you need to bring correct attribute to break the shield so
if you only compare their buff value
Bronya > Tingyun > Pela = Welt
yea Pela is good, on par with Welt <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
at least Seele and Bronya are broken
they somewhat making Genshin 1.0 happened again for no reason <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
he is a 5*
the dude can't
Sushang can get better win cons
just that
he is not useless
im not interest in this game enough to run the math so never <a:cuakhetday:939810174070321202>
that's not enough to make a good valk, a valk in turn base need to be judge on every contents that he/she will be used on, not just kit alone  <:ok:1088133019455467560>
that is 1 of Fire MC best cone
wait why, you got the best cone for F2P
Lil bro is a siscon <:ok:1088133019455467560>
what are you saying hak
but i want the Quantum Seele and Wind Bronya <:ok:1088133019455467560>
that's wrong Seele + Bonya account
200$
<@148145559897636865>  you got me with Seele + Bronya account ?
Seele + Bronya account rn is like almost 200 <:ok:1088133019455467560>
yea best dps and buffer atm
no <:ok:1088133019455467560>
also Himeko need proper team to work
cause you're tripping heki <:ok:1088133019455467560>
is less than 10%
the chance you will get Seele
i'll tell you rn <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>

oh yea buy those expa cards <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
probably can't stick with it
im just keeping up with it from the last beta info that i got in
in general Seele is still better <:shruge:1079371164159311982>

waiting for Seele account from Gresham
i haven't created an account yet
<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
fire MC make every other healers value saturated so much
good dps : Clara, Himeko ( kinda sus ), Sushang 
good buffer : Bonya > Tingyun > Pela = Welt 
good healer/shielder : Fire MC
your mom
<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
and Himeko is also kinda sus too
good options are just Bonya, Clara, Himeko, Welt <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
since after Chapter 1, Fire MC become your mandatory shielder
Bailu is kinda low value <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
gresham, you got me with a Seele + Bonya account ? <:ok:1088133019455467560>
second after Bonya
Who
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Don’t be dumb lil bro <:ok:1088133019455467560>

without taking a break
you need to reach half way of first planet
best buffer
nice
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
good healer for early
but until then he is ok
Gepard is alright, worse than Fire MC and Bailu
all of them except Yanqing and physical MC
literally never <:ok:1088133019455467560>
worse Sushang
better Danheng
nothing
best healer is definitely Fire MC
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
better than starters are only Sushang, Pela and probably Tingyun
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
the one that good are 5* and 4 starters

<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
i always have a boner tho so it's already really good in my eyes
Nikke does have unique designs but i don't know if they qualify as good designs in designer's eyes <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
does any gacha games out there even have good character designs <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>

probably on 1st and 2nd day, cause there were an audio bug <:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
i think
try exit and log in back
so you can do up to like 20-30 pulls on limited banner
along with like 5k gem or sth
yea they give exact 40 standard pulls
isn't the 1st standard pity 40
how come
wait
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but you can still get offrate
so everyone mostly have her
Rahu is the rate up
not exactly
Aether <:gayge:1017439025742753802>
or pull whoever make your lower half acting
the rest you can use to pull their weapon or rank up
only those 4 are a must before Chinese faction got updated
probably something like Tsukuyomi, Hel, Hera, Hades
as in the next few patches ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

what kind of yee yee ass out fit is Leonidas wearing
bro i  got a dupe Rahu <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
the next 3 banners in this order
after Shinri is Pluto Osiris

basically change her finish move into a better nuke
and multiplier
nothing, just give her shit ton of atk
30

any guide yet <@503044914016419840>
<a:pepenarutorun:1081435087901556827>
so 70% of the time you will get Rahu
on current standard, the uprate is Rahu Asura
but character does <:ok:1088133019455467560>
weapon don't
it have 50/50
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
so you will need to get Tyr from offrate
and the uprate on standard is Asura
4*
i just play this game cause they have both Mei and Kiana lookalike on their poster <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>

1 fun line is out of option
but no dodge still feel bad
there are a lot of things you can do with turn base so there are no fixed formula you should follow
mostly for pvp
even if it's sacrifice a turn, steal a turn or anything like that
for tradional turn base, the amount of turns per round are always remain the same, what you do is basically make the most out of each action
yea but the turn is not gone completely, if you can cleanse before full turn of your team are used up, that turn will still be there to use
it's just feel weird
i won't say it's good or bad cause every turn based should have their unique gimmick
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

Who is Marisa Honkai ? For the blind, He is the vision. For the hungry, He is the chef. For the thirsty, He is the water. If Marisa thinks, I agree. If Marisa speaks, I’m listening. If Marisa has one fan, it is me. If Marisa has no fans, I don’t exist.

it's getting heated

the context is that :
- Yaru and Lestan want to pin the rule message on top 
- Moriso said that  there is no need for that, beta info and supply schedule are more important  
- Lestan said  Fuck you orange, im green  
- Moriso got hurt

Genshin cost shit ton
but if you actually care to improve Abyss's time in Genshin even if it's meaningless
it's the difference between kindergarten game and competitive game that make people think Genshin is generous
so does Genshin
each patch give exactly that amount
on avg it took 60-70 pulls
doesn't need to
so does Honkai
it's the lack of competitive that make you think so
Genshin gacha is not generous

She is what Elysia could have been
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
And then manipulate others to think that they want to rebel against the goverment
So she can kill Nihilister without putting in more effort
1 of the strongest on the surface but in new story she used the protag and his squad as a bait to lure out and exhaust Nihilister
She is a walking disaster <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
She just show up
There isn’t anymore than that <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>

Basically for idle game, just clear map, do daily activites and wait for events to give out crystals
<:DK:840944972383780874>
New event will start soon
You just get shit ton of them from events and activities
To increas the chance to get her
Just put Volume in the wishlist
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Or any dps that can make use of crit buff
She needs condition fullfilled to be good
She need to be paired with Volume
Also you don’t need to level up all of them, only 5, the rest just  put in Synchro devices
You don’t, this is an idle game, you can only get exp through events or from the outpost
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
she looks younger now
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
old design
they changed her design from a mature one to a younger one
it's design changed
her SSR version is in waiting room
this girl is just like Lucia <:DK:840944972383780874>

i just got her from pulling Modernia <:DK:840944972383780874>
Rapunzel
<:DK:840944972383780874>
she will become T0 soon with her SSR
she is SR
T0 : broken no matter contents
T0.5 : lacking in 1-2 aspects to become broken
T1 : good pick, some need conditions to be good
T1.5 : good for general usage and filling in spots
T2 : almost trash
that deserve a restraining order <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

best thing is that she learn it from the death of her grandpa, live a meaningful life, die a peaceful death <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

twitter believe everything
this amount of complaining is small compare to the other 2
they won't bend their knees that easily <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>

Or else you can only force your sleep with pills
You need to adjust it bit by bit

Best advice
Weed is the same with sleeping pill

Also you can jack off until you feel tired before putting the mask on

Usually i use sleep eye mask
That will fit someone taste
Drake is like mile ahead of her but usable <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>

lolicon is literally about people that like childlike figure, some can control themself, some couldn't
what ? <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
and you guys intercept it wrong way
what i did was explaining it
because that's how it literally is, because people polluted it does not make the word change it original meaning <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
but then i turn into liking actual children
yea im not really trying to change anyone opinion, read it again, my starter argument was explaining why loli and lolicon is not a bad word  <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
no but they do with knife and metal cane
yes because gun is the only lethal weapon <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
you're just living in your cage if you think no gun access can make tragic events happen less <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
just speak it out Tai, not like it can get any worse <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
good that we have something in common, i am also disgusted by how people polutting language  <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
read it again, i kept giving my stand points <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
if this was a normal argument both side would realised this is just a matter of view
no, i gave my opinions and what i got back was not a counterpoint, i got back a label mark <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
i can tell the argument was going nowhere in the beginning
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
i don't, someone label me as liking actual children, that is some legal matter tho
i mean yea, always have been <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
idk, someone decided to label me and put words into my mouth <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
not like this was a valid argument in the beginning <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
but good for you
don't know why you're acting like you're in the right either <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
without any license
im literally living in Vietnam atm and i can also buy a gun immediately
even in 3rd world country people can still buy gun if they want, that's how far people can do for money
and not the environment
because the gun is definitely what make the shooter go crazy
valid argument right there <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
for 6 months, yes <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
human using it wrong make it look bad but the original intend didn't
it was invented for self defense first when dealing with outlaw people or wild animal
that's another aspect of law, but the current argument is about gun and the one who use it
when gun was also invented to progress civilization
you're blaming gun because the people put it in wrong use
you know the reason why terrible things happen in America due to gun is because of the people too right ? <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
or you blame the people who use it ?
do you also blame weapons for killing people ?
people use it wrong does not make the word become bad
this is concerning
why do your point keep targeting actual children <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
because unlike you guys, im not growing up with people trying to pollute every single slangs ever exist <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
bruh is not even on your side
i can't stand when someone polluting a word right in front of me <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
beauty of words are what matter to me
ofc i can, that's why law exist
it's actually concerning if everything you think of is illegal actions <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
you're not going into jail unless you do some illegal thing to them <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
no, you have to meet them first <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
we don't use discord or tinder for dating
that's not how it work back in my day
no because you can't know a women without knowing what they look like
in front of me
you guys are literally polluting the word
when in reality it's not
because you guys literally say liking childlike figure is the same as liking child
what ?
and modern day polluted the words completely when it's not supposed to be that way
no the literal argument was about misunderstanding of words
<:huh:966619839307321394>
how am i even being offended ?
what ?
wow excellent argument <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
your world doesn't center around you does not make it crumble
you're accusing people for think they won't do
doesn't make it illegal
because you think its' not convincing
because some AAA studio also need background check then
does killing people ingame count as immoral too ?
because it's about the beauty of words ? <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
you're assuming legal action and illegal action
the difference between liking childlike figure and actual child
no <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
put words  in other arguments ?
is this how kid these day argue ?
when i literally specify the difference about it
idk how can you come up with liking children again <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
if mental wall can easily be crossed you'd find teenager commiting suicide every 1 second
you're assuming human can cross over 10 mental walls just because they like something
and then compare legal action with illegal action
and act like its' the right thing
idk it's not like people easily accept a word being polluted
this is just weird at this point <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
don't tell me you actually think im into child ? <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
words being polluted is not something you should accept easily
if you think there is sth wrong then it's just the difference of generation <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
there is nothing wrong with what i said <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
you will need to cross at least 10 mental walls to reach that point
because there are extra mental steps that lead to it
yes, even if you are attract by it, human just don't suddenly go and do it irl
normal human know the breaking point between what's right and what's not
this is the same as saying if you kill people ingame you might kill real people next
liking the beauty of a child is not wrong, what's wrong is liking a child <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
people don't just suddenly commit illegal action
yes, but they can still know the legal breaking point
in Asia there are legit women in their 30 and look like they're 12
lolicon are not people that fall for children
because it's the right thing to stand for, kinkshaming is bad <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
liking childlike figure is different with liking actual child <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
do you expect them to not ever get married
no because there are legal women that look like child because of their biology
a pedo can be a lolicon but a lolicon doesn't have to be a pedo
lolicon is also not all about pedophiles tho <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
it only start being a bad word in modern day
no but the problem is that, back in 1955, even when the book was about a man love female child, people still use the word loli and lolita to describe beauty aspect in art and fashion<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
like how people misunderstand simp, Mary Sue, etc...
changing the whole meaning of a word because some people misunderstand it
it's just not fair <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
so it's a western thing no ?
doesn't loli originated from the book Lolita by Vladamir Nabokov anw ? <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
all those pedo leave bad impression for loli enjoyers <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

Some games got overhyped so the first quarter/year revenue look like they’re going to the moon
But not anywhere close to die soon
The revenue just went back to where it supposed to be
They got on the hype train
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
ToF was also supposed to die soon according to reddit 1 year ago
But game is not dying anytime soon, it’s an idle game and JP barely care about censorship if it’s only 1 layer of thin skirts
Can’t really know what is going on inside their circle anw
Yea they don’t, Tencent is just asking for censorship but Shift Up also apply the change to live server

So good luck with that
But CN haven’t let a single oversea game get into CN for the past 2 years
That’s why they ask for censorship
Tencent is trying to bring this game into CN
Even ToF belong to one of their branch studio
Yea they’re business model
They will reward you for doing a good work but not gonna let you have the ownership
Think of it like your boss ask you to make a project
Shitft Up is just the creator
They fund for it
This is Tencent’s game
This is just like Genshin and ToF back then
Nah
And spamming false info
So not like they’re innocent
People on reddit also defending dataminers anw
Characters won’t spread their legs anymore or some extra clothes like a mini skirt instead of showing her underwear

Pepper is way better
extremely good
but if you have a hard time to survive in campaign then she is good
so not the best option to put in your team
but she is burst 1
best healer
replace Brid with Scarlet
Scarlet and Harran

yea they will go up to 160
only SSR can limit break 3 times to go up to 200
80 -> 120 -> 160
yea, SR can only limite break 2 times
only SSR can
SR units can't go pass 160
cause you can't upgrade pass 80 without limit break but you can use synchro to keep leveling up your main team
later on when they all reach 80, use reset button and upgrade 5 SR characters to 81, 82 and so on
just the 5 characters you're currently leveling
so you have more options to use with synchro characters
stuff like that
51/51/51/51/51
52/52/52/52/52
so it's always better if you level all 5 of them at the same time
and link the lowest one to the one you put in
it auto take in 5 highest level

and at which rank too
and god know when will she get powercrept
50 weeks for a WT valk
that's honestly not that bad tbh <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
so if a F2P play normally they can always 3S WT valk in time
farm other stuffs
wait for 50 frags
and you stop farming her at SS3
if we account in 50 frags from next anni then it's gonna be 25 weeks for SS and 25 weeks for SS3
next one will be JK
this one was MPE
last one was FR
free stamps every anni i mean
so yea you will 3S her right when new one release
you will get her stamps in next anni tho
59 weeks in total ?
it's 25 weeks for SS and 34 weeks for SSS
you will need to troll so hard to be able to do that
yea if you play on the same level then luck come to play
the jump in Honkai are so floaty and sensitive you need more skill than the map in Fall Guys
ice lake is skill based
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
i think SEA is doing it ?
yea you will need a discord queue for 10k+
cause the number on the emblem doesn't go any higher
i stop at 5k
cause can't match 50k with 100 now can we ?
yea the higher you're the longer the queue

she is just braindead
her highgest is like 4 min at SSS i think
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
reptar asked me the same question on Monday
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
because her dmg is so fucking high
you don't even spam A that much
the valk is just so braindead it does not matter
or just great blade alone
yea great blade and cloud walker
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
lmao
she is better than SW cause she has damage to back it up
basically, ult -> sword form -> spam A -> finisher -> ulti -> sword form -> spam A
use her finisher then ulti again
if you pick the time stop buff
the most braindead valk ever so far
just A
you don't even press B unless for ult
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
keilo
you only press A in ER if you pick Great Blade
ult button
keilo did you press B instead of A

Would have been better that way
The exact amount you can get from 4 Paladin BPs
64 balls in total
32 balls ( HoS card ) + 16 balls ( HoS stamps ) + 16 balls ( JK stamps )
You can probably get to SS
If you buy all 4 Paladin BPs
120 frags in total for 2 versions
20 + 20 + 8 stamps ( 80 )
HoT in 5.5 had 20 frags in the BP so for now just assuming it’s still 20 in BP
My brain
Im thinking of non-awaken
Oh wait is HoS awaken ?
Good enough
80 from Bp, 60 from topup
Yea <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
80 from 2 versions
80 from BP
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
4 from BP shop and 40 frags from BP
6 HoS stamps
already do 2 SSS bosses ?
best to use it on SSwords or Griseo
no

not just because she is Kiana, her gameplay and design is amazing
still, i love HoF tho
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
but it's Fire that has always been the weakest
and Nyx is a QUA before she is Ice
people only memeing on Ice because the lack of boss even after HB release
VKE revival last for 3 weeks
like actual wack
Fire look good back then because of HoF but in reality Fire has always been wack
Griseo ?
not the opposite
it's HoF that make Fire look good
Fire has always been weak
also epi because you're new so you probably don't know this but
<:worryEvil:418816807957168133>
not for long
9S HoF
yea they both smoke HoF on Tank
SSS Heimdall you monkey <:okfine:971481680265216130>
extra 30 mins because of downloading
2 hours 10 mins
<:okfine:971481680265216130>
no more boss for her
DA can actually sleep now
with actual ignite support it will remain HoF's boss
i remember it being low
or even 420 ?
but the temp back then was like 440 or something in Nirv
yea last time it showed up, HoF top it
you f*cking idiot
Rimestar is HoF boss
the amount of RNG on that menace is unbearable, Abyss i mean
her SS suck
Rimestar do need SSS version yea
i think Tank is a good boss in term of fixed rotation
if it's fire patch can they even change any bosses ?
yea as long as the amount stay the same or better then it's a great change
they only change sh*t when it's mean for new players
if they're optimizing sth then it mean it's needed to change for new players
cata, the FGO we're fighting is SSS <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>

So as a joke, I went to my friend's house wearing Bronya's wig and clothes. I could barely stop my laughter as he went as red as a tomato and looked at me from head to toe with a bit of drool in his mouth. The way he stared made me feel a bit funny too, but I decided to tease him more by taking off my clothes. He asked me, Are you serious? and I said Yep Broniee.

He went silent for what seemed like forever, so I asked him, What's the matter Broniee? He said he's confused, but then his boner got really hard, which made me take off his clothes. I expected him to scream, Stop! as I kissed him and stroked his cock, but he instead shouted Oh God, Bronya! which made me get a boner myself. Before I knew it, I was blowing him for the first time till he came.

His semen was so thick, it got stuck inside my throat no matter how hard I swallowed. He then said, I want to fuck you now! and seeing that we've already gone that far and we were both naked, I obliged. A few hours later, the jerk went all pale and said to me Why did we do that? Now I'm not fucking straight. But he still looked so cute all confused like that, so I took pity on him and reassured while wiping his cum off my face, Let's just pretend I'm still Bronya.

i actually hate how everyone in Genshin TC trying so hard to calculate a comp DPS on sheet/paper/notepad <:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
yea i used to be one of the TC people working on Hu Tao and was slowly getting corrupted by their weird mindset <:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
i was this close to become one of the annoying people <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>

 im not flexing but just in case you don't know, i just did a 15 seconds run on 12-3 
but it's jerking circle of meta players in Genshin
don't know if they change the name or not
Golden House
they have a whole server to jerk themselves off for speedrunning or making  creative  comp
it's rewarding if you're attention seeker
as free as all the dumbass picking ranged character <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>

Nyx now is worse than SW
not anymore, it's Vill-V <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
granted that no one try in those bad weathers
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
with S0 Nyx
Korath did outscore a lot of SS Nyx in SEA
the problem is that if you're gaming you can time HB ulti to match with Nyx combo
some TDM and extra sp
her rank up are just bad
SS Nyx and S0 Nyx barely make a diff
unless you're a pleb
in QUA fights
i hate to break it to you <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
should have sold spending currency in bchip packs
JK stamps + elf frags are already costed more than the max amount currency we can get
Nini is not gonna have anything left for Nyx card

<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
6.1 start on Sep 29th and somehow 6.3 will end before December

the game was cracked back when i was still into it
been 5 years since i last heard about it <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
the grind need to continue in LAO <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
the weapon is 20s
her ulti with Felis is 18.5s
irl stuff + LAO summer season
i don't sweat in Honkai anymore, not more than 1 hour <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
plus the rng stacking is not helping neither
and FFF is better for her damage in general while don't need to wait 1.5s to use her ulti
HB weapon have bad sync with her ulti
Some idiots are beyond saving
That’s why i always on the verge of losing my temper in maincord <:Discord:1007897636327669780>

guys, you're all minors, what's with this converastion <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
i think HoR rank up after SS1 is lackluster
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
even tho it's niche
and i still think SSS FR is big
efficiently speaking it's always FR cause you can lucksack SK from Dorm <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
i see <:holothink:963352118855626753>
still 42 AL left per week
so assuming you keep buying out FR frags
iirc we get like 90 AL per week ? <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
you should have enough, there is an event that give 50 AL in week 4
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
you're in GLB so you won't have anni AL + AW gift box so i guess it's better to save
and like massively decreasing
the score will keep decreasing if people can't have what he use in this vid
but Marisa is misleading people with SSS JK and 4* Ely
idk if she is good or not
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
everyone JK after pulling on 6.0

tbh if you have the fund for 6.1
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>

JK stamps probably 10k per stamp
so same with last year
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
That’s a heki’d

Dw the dude doesn’t doomposting, if he said sth without sound like being sarcastic then he really mean it
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
Still a half Nirv player so at least doean’t grief his account
The dude prior characters he like
He doesn’t like her
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
He skip HoH either way with or without JK
Who ?
She won’t <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
last one can be Aslaug <:arublindstare:914194172204961792>
exchange shop and forge usually in V3
BP, spending info, outfit details
But i think she is balance <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
Wouldn’t be a surprise if they nerf JK personal damage
In 3 hours 24 mins
<:natsustare:914838084514902096>
Neko asked can you get away with Bastet B if no sp/s
I never said so
Her sp is extremely tight in that boss
Hepha doean’t drop any sp pack
With Bastet B recovery
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
But Benny and Hepha on the other hand
Yea you can get away with no sp/s in Hellmaru and Airplane
<:life:1001518241610485781>
The game end after 6.4
Can’t wait to see tmr JK nerf <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
2 sp/s is even more niche than Newt T
So imo just use 5 atk 1 sp/s
Cause she increase HoH dps <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
But then again it might also change with JK
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
Unless we can cross 470 this patch
For our Abyss i don’t think we will ever need the 2nd sp/s line
Yea 2 sp/s line is for ultra sweat MA Hepha
Too old to be Griseo
new daily ? <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

You still end up need PE for FGO and HoDom
Are you dumb or what
That won’t change anything
Kiana will just specialize in Aerial mechanic
There is like 0% chance IMG Kiana will kill PE
This time they better let her anything but fire <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
It will be new battlesuit for Kiana

Pulling her on release so you can start farming sp for her to use her ulti before Abyss close
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
and 5 card later can be HoH in 5 pulls
because that 10 pulls can be HoH weapon
there is no turning back now

there are also casters during the race
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
keep hiring truck and horse carriage to protest
but Korean are hillarious ngl
bad management plan too iirc
and customer service didn't respond anything
i heard full of bugs on release
Korean Uma Musume is another kind of shit show
yea supports are still overpowered
but money cost the same
but the effectiveness is low
now you need to raise spd to 1600
they lift the cap for all stats
but the recent anni changes pissed people off
fun gameplay if you ask me
yea it's rougelike
and cheer for her

<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
cause Eden never had the intention to live on
yea, she passed it to Hua
but Twitter told me that only STIGMA is important <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
no he said Ark need to comeback and raise civilization again by using the resources on the ship
in chapter 31, Kosma said its purpose was to coming back to Earth <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Ark - Kosma 
Ember - Eden 
Valuka - Su
those 3 are as practical as winning lottery
ARK : run away from Earth and wait to comeback 
VALUKA : looking for a solution from other civilaztions 
EMBER : boost the growth of CE to prepare for Honkai
MEI thought beside STIGMA, other projects chance to succeed is slim
EMBER was impossible to success in the beginning without a proper leader with actual knowledge
which result in the death of Fuxi, Nuwa, Xuanyan
bring PE knowledge to CE and boost their growth

it's not a bug, it's just not healthy for Abyss
but we have para
CN had hitcount husk on type weather
in v3 it was changed to Hitcount
in v1 it was Para
there are both version of Type Husk in beta
saying this is a bug is the same as saying GLB should have had Husk back in 5.1 when they pull out Homu
there is nothing bug about it
the boss has both Hitcount and Para in beta
it's just uncomfortable
this is not a bug if the boss is not doing weird things
no it doesn't what

i was like  what the actual fuck 
i remember when i learnt back then that you need 5 pets to increase your farming speed in BDO, it was 20$ for one and you need like 200$ to max out 1 <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
yea, comparing Honkai to KR MMORPGs, Honkai feel like a good side hobby <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
and cosmetics in BDO actually increase your farm speed
cosmetics cost more
for paying the farmer to do the farming for me, he just need to meet the quota that we dealt per day
i think it used to cost like 7-8k a year back in 2017 <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
much cheaper
but instead of quitting my job i paid a dude to do that for me

1 entry per day, don't know if it can stack or not
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
but there are 4 stages in the event tab of Summer Wars
yea don't know why they don't show it in the mission
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
the mission don't show it but you get 1 entry per day for 15 ice cream in event tab
also don't forget to do the event stage <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
i did simple math and you need 1307 ice creams to buy out the shop but if the missions don't change you can only get around 760 ice creams with the current missions<:hmm:767936100920328202>

I won’t be saying that Genshin team is worse lmao, the fact that Genshin can still run without becoming what ToF is right now is already a miracle even if you don’t know anything about coding or developing
It’s insanely complex
I don’t even know how the game can respond that fast with their damage calculation mechanic
Their combat calculations are actually complicated
Even from an amateur viewpoint, Genshin is already running by miracle
They actually can’t
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

that's a lot
if you use Griseo pri instead of Hekate
i mean on Jizo

well played keilo <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Mihoyo please adjust Kasumi and Assaka ice meter please
i love Bastet
still a good investment tho <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
or else it won't activate sh*t
cat has to freeze
and it's not even just freeze
Bastet is f*cking trash if you can't freeze
you use Marg TB + Avo/Paga M on AE, Turg on Felis
HoH-AE-Felis
i mean yea that's what everyone use with her on Kasumi <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
or just don't use Bastet at all
for Felis to activate Bastet 2pc
so you have to HB ulti -> Felis ulti
Kasumi has huge ice meter
she has too many restrictions on Type Kasumi
im 100% sure she won't
she won't
a good amount of coverage
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
and probably tie with HoF on Type Kasumi
probably still tie with SW due to how strong her raw dps is anw
i think for ranged tank and ranged assaka she will be around T1
im guessing not, the trait remain the same for Abyss and MA
can't use Felis = actually struggling
tank has iron body
she is not that good in ranged tank
HoH literally buff the elf dmg for no reason
it buff ice too much and HoH also buff the elf
lol no joke i think the elf is actually crucial
is it much cheaper now
what if you get SW every 20 pulls <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
now that i think about it, is SSS SW cheaper than HoH 4/4 ? <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
can't bait anymore after she goes live
it's tough these days <a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
<:TeriPrown:972529850676043906>
keilo do you know how hard it is to find someone still think HoH is a bait now after she tie with SSS SW
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>

<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Epi is too sensitive
<:life:1001518241610485781>
I scare that you will bully the junior in your club
You look like the type to pick a fight with kids tho
<:life:1001518241610485781>
Just don’t be in the top 20 of your club
For main evetns at best they only pick 8-10 people
I mean esports club is still your best bet to keep being a cardboard
Dw epi, no one take these kind of club seriously
<:life:1001518241610485781>
my card games club back then, 3/4 of the club don’t even know how to play Blackjack or Texas Hold’em
Sound like Fornite pro scenes to me

Unless you show people that you’re Faker Jr or Simple Jr, no one will ask you to participate local tournaments
I guarantee you 100% no one will care about you unless you standout

Because life is too beautiful to not see it even when you’re a hopeless shut in
If you don’t try new things you will never know what is out there
Better start today then
And play the “ Go home “ game
Epi, start a new club call “
Board games club “
Oh

What does combo help for HoH
By that logic i can also say that B piece has Combo, Ultimate and Burst Mode
That is 2 pc effect, what you’re refering to is B piece
And clearly HoH also doesn’t have combo
It was a fact for me because HoH and the B piece has the gap of 6 patches
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
And for me it’s for SW instead
I started with “ this argument already proven failed “
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
And we can’t tell if it’s for Herrscher or SW
Me and carv already have this discussion before

im actually certain

Herrschers killed billion of lives -> normal behavior

my bet is on bio too
inb4 we don't <a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
not many have SSS Carole back then and the people who have it also have SS2 BKE
SnS being stronger has always been the case, Griseo make the gap become more wide than it should be
AF pri is exactly a new character that let BKE become a more reliable valk 
SnS is a stronger dps than any BKE that rank is not SS+
that's wrong
5.1 : AF pri 
5.2 : Mobius

This timeline is messed up
They better planned 6.0 and 6.1 carefully
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
3* is barely better than Fuxi
Sirin was the biggest bait
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
3* Klein on lightning team is a savior
The problem with Ice team is that it’s not game changing like Klein
Also i still think Elf Ely is not worth going for if you can only afford 1  <:deadge:975652771082698782>
If they can compensate 20k xtals
They could do spending back to back yea
Cope enough in 6.0 and roll her gears + elf in 6.1
I think if 6.0 doesn’t have spending, you should just roll for HoH
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>

Not less than 60k

Sp regen and 3 set extend freeze duration
But part of the reason is also they make Bastet’s value rely too much on ultility
But yea, Cez B is tight rot
Probably can compensate with sp/s <:Cringe:975612628779024434>

I think i wasted like 10k affix mats to get it
10% is still a lot <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
Felis needs 10% sp reduction to use it
Only if you don’t have sp problem that is

No one care about HoV anymore
But now friends come before HoV
They clearly said FT, HoV and friends
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
Not shady stuff
Dw keilo, carv also knew about this one, it’s based on summer skin speculation
<:huh:966619839307321394>
And we have FT-Meme-SK
HoV was named 2nd in production
HoV is so dead that they can’t even put her in ER
<a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
L
HoV in ER is also a myth
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Oh, gacha player moment
Like, Griseo just widen the gap to a degree that it wasn’t a competition anymore
The gap was not even close last HoS <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
HoS and Houdou
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Maincord acting like Mobius and SpA can compete with Physical dps on Type weather
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
So like literally every elemental valks
“ HoF is dead, only score well on her weathers “
50.000 years and still flat <:HoSDerpNggt:996935375832498236>
source on this one ? i need to block it on my browser <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
also they better not releasing Fire SP after Ely or else it will be an actual dps contest between 3 Psy Herrschers
problem with being Psy is that HoF and HoT numbers are both insanely high lmao
only if they can push the numbers far enough <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>

in Star Rail we have like 50.000 universal threats
there are a lot of things beyond the sky <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
storywise they probably setting up something like  Kiana and Dudu are trying to holding back something else, something more dangerous than the Aliens  <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
it mean they're even in a more dangerous situation
if the world is in danger but you don't see Kiana and Dudu
at best we will have Rita
but deal with it
yes i know APHO sucks<a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
on dev stream
it's already confirmed to be canon
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
the strongest human body in the entire world
her body also can't become Herrscher
like even if her soul isn't there
yea, Schariac blood will neutralise all the honkai energy and make it her own
Dudu is physically can't become Herrscher
except Dudu tho
because the cores are dynamic
on paper, everyone can become Herrscher in CE
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
the core wasn't dead, more like the energy was sucked out
<a:KokkoroDance:824886410028515328>
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
cause money isn't grow from tree

<a:diesofcringe:972420698654003210>
<:soulessSusge:816030602263527485>
not 5.9

6.0 might not even have spending

jfc
<a:KianaCookie2:646215964471328789>
without Vill-V just +0
if you have her you're guarantee to +100 every QUA weather
so it's all about goal
her score is actually nut in Abyss yea
actually 1 iQ
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
a dude is actually saying  i use SpA on HoDom, no reason to use HoF 
avg IQ is actually 1
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
how dumb can one even be
maincord is so dumb jfc

<:huh:966619839307321394>
and now here i am playing gacha game and spending money for pixels
<a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
need to steal other kids breakfast to not die from hungry
probably why i turn into a bully
during my middle school my family got in financial trouble too
i felt that <:worrysaddab:658142931646939176>
my kindergarden memory was basically playing family or doctor with the girl in my class
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
because i change
glad i was already apologised to him when i got discharged from the hospital
i remember in my last year during middle school, a kid i used to gang up on stabbed one of the bully in the stomach <a:PeepoSHAKE:931874355267371049>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
stealing money from kids and selling drugs
if i didn't change you'd see me become Walter White
<:worryoraora:653794051308650536>
i change after that tho <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
f*cking broke half of my bones during a motor racing too
tried to fit in and turn into a bully
cause i was the trouble kid back then  <a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
like literally nightmare
only my middle school was bad
my middle school's life was a nightmare <a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
Every cool kids are in EX
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>

<:FelisD:987145546974253056>
At least i enjoy Aponia’s design
F*cking naked nun scamming money
But now HoT score in her range
I got -200 for it
The only week in Abyss i thought that was her debut week
Im dissapointed in you keilo
Bad investment
Aponia is best lightning valk
<a:KianaWaiting:652262801796104227>
I spent money on gacha for future generations
They didn’t trick me, my money is for Herrscher of Flamescion school funding
Honkai is a sh*t game
<a:NODDERS:931874243069751326>
It’s definitely the lack of cup noodle
<a:worryNod:970259799541448704>

Saw the dumb pfp

Griseo looking cute
AE 2.0 with timestop in ulti and Fire SP with constant off-field ignite <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
so next Fire SP is gonna have ignite
Fire SP without ignite is Felis
it's Felis
dumbass
they already made one <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
are you having a stroke ?
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
she can only replace AE spot
and Fire SP is coming
because she is not gonna replace any other SPs soon <:AgonConcern:799494217717776425>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
she needs to comepte with a lot of broken SPs anw
tbh AE 2.0 being farmable is not a bad idea at all  <:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
farmable S-rank elemental support sound good
cause she will be S-rank support
Sushang can be any type she want <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
because Epi is dumb
you compete by 1-10 pts
easy bosses are the worst bosses in general
SK is easy, that's why it's bad
How in the hell SK is not bad <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Maybe if only her bosses are not the combination of the worst of the worst
Ig you could count FGO as 1
<:TeriThink:928714644040871996>

potentially

all 13 FCs, each one of them give Mei a farewell one by one
as if we don't know Kevin is from PE <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>

And my ears got destroyed
I listen to Kiana JP VA on youtube
Im actually don’t understand the hype around JP VA
You need to be the chosen one to have it
And “ reading “ is slowly become a SSR skill
<a:PeepoSHAKE:931874355267371049>
So i don’t really trust these people have basic reading skill
The dude above that also said “ Everything after HoT awaken is filler “

SN is 🚮
<:huh:966619839307321394>
for Bloodlust and QUA
when she was literally the only answer
Nyx was fun in 4.8
Nyx is trash
Nyx is not Seele <:huh:966619839307321394>
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
all Seele's suits are 4fun suit
when you think about it
<a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
literally a 4fun valk
SP is just for fun tho
like literally better options than SP
but nini, you have Ely and HoT
<:huh:966619839307321394>
but that's not the point
Nyx score 700+ tho
<:huh:966619839307321394>
last cycle my SP scored like near 500 i think
im not even capping but last Couatl when i tried SP without Griseo, she is not even that bad
<:keqsip:994857348436865124>
lowkey it's kinda worth to pull Utu if you don't have it yet
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Acheron is good for SP
really lowkey tho
lowkey it's not bad <:TeriThink:928714644040871996>
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
if you even use anything but their signature the result will drop real bad
all 3 of them need full gear
i think DA is a better pick in this BP season
<:keqsip:994857348436865124>
just Carole is enough
but yea BKE is not a good investment now
<:huh:966619839307321394>
the problem with this horse is that it favor short rot way too much
but on Jizo BKE burst is mile ahead
<:huh:966619839307321394>
the bleed boss just favor that team more
<:keqsip:994857348436865124>
and not same row with 7TR
Paga is in the same row with SP supply <:huh:966619839307321394>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
not DK supply
cause they put it in SP supply row
wait do we know we still get Utu supply ? <:keqsip:994857348436865124>

SSS Kosma is f*cking HoT
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
And you realised 90% of it require HoT
Just imagine all of f*cked up combinations of double SSS bosses
You know what is funny
The problem of triple SSS bosses is that they will need to introduce a 2nd HoS first
Or same support
Double SSS already have a lot of bosses that require the same team
Unless they can design a lot of SSS for different elements
They most likely won’t tho
<:worrythumbsup:759845056743473204>
Ofc
And stfu <:worryoraora:653794051308650536>
Epi keep staring at the giant dong
<a:KurikaraArrival:742824449543241789>
It’s always HoT time

If you don’t have SS+ HoT why play the game
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I mean it’s also HoT that is strong
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Is it at least a good nude pic ?
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
The shield that reduce dmg taken and can only be affected by Para
It’s Sushang’s shield iirc
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>

Just because i like her design doesn’t make me a lolicon
Summer Griseo is my favorite skin yet
Ofc i like Griseo
Time to rest
But she is so old already
Im actually like HoR design tbf
The 620 xtals and 7% ele dmg squad
Yea HoR finally join her fated squad
Epi stop taking drugs during daylight
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
HoR DLC is Ely
Just need to keep restart your run for the opener
There is a specific opener that Husk will receive extra lightning dmg
If it’s the same Husk
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
The only boss Aponia can dominate at S0 is Type Husk
They don’t want Aponia to murder SW so Aponia is in a f*cking weird state
If HoT is not SS or SS+ then S0 Aponia win at best 20 pts difference
SSS Eden dps score more than S0 Aponia
S0 Aponia is f*cking trash btw
No point in pulling SW or Vill-V if it’s not their debut supply
Im talking about the value of the pulls tho
Just rerun SP gears more often already mihobo

it's actually troll if Eden is not SSS

you can reset the run if you can't crit
always SSS Eden

<:worrythumbsup:759845056743473204>
most of the time
think about your friend make you comfortable
just think of everyone as baban or bruh
relax
epi you talk in here like 20/24
if they asked anymore questions, just say  I don't remember signing up to a job interview 
no one is gonna ask further
ofc
<:huh:966619839307321394>
and comeback to honkai
get this over quickly
they just don't care
epi no one is gonna ask if you actually like to eat vegetables or not
<:huh:966619839307321394>
screenshare what ?
epi, don't make it anymore difficult
<:huh:966619839307321394>

Carv “ No poverty in here “ Alho
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
So carv only have SS+ valks
But not my cup of tea fun
I guess SK is kinda fun

<:huh:966619839307321394>
<a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
But they discuss their fanfiction and headcanon instead
So people think it’s cool to discuss about lore
Honky getting popular
<a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
You have to get used to it
There are like 50 of them in maincord lore channel
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
I just felt like it

3S
Don’t have any affixes mats for Eden <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
Your score look decent with 1189 atk <:HigoThink:585629884630695948>
Eden ulti = minus 15 pts
Ofc it’s weaker, but it’s faster if you can reach damage threshold

Carv is still alive ?

And Fire has AE and Cat on Turg
2 broken lightning supports and stigs
Cause you know
SS HoT won everytime in mech type counter match up
<:heh:990308225314328576>

if we're being real then 2 months should be enough for 1 12/12 team
<:TeriThink:928714644040871996>
reduce the pressure on RL so that new peeps won't quit the game

but being physical doesn't make her less lightning
why exclude augment out tho, they can change the element if they're forced to make it lightning <:AgonConcern:799494217717776425>
<:AgonConcern:799494217717776425>
DS has red lightning vfx
half of her battlesuits are physical
<:AgonConcern:799494217717776425>
because being physical doesn't mean she can't have lightning sfx
don't be sus bruh
i mean gameplay wise

APHO Mei being Bio physical sound good
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
you're in maincord tier of dumb epi
if you think Seele has any chance to be anything but QUA
why do you need a reason for Mei to be physical
<:AgonConcern:799494217717776425>
no reason
APHO Mei can be physical
we still have APHO Mei and Herrscher Seele for this
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>

if the stars align that is
and valk teaser for 6.0 is also on Aug 4th <:HMM:966625453194485760>
if they go with Friday - Monday - Thursday pattern for chapter 31
which is probably around Aug 4th

Wonder when will they add him in EX for DA
Oh there is also a Psy ignite boss in Masters
Like AKA shill for SpA
We will have at least 1 Husk each patch

At least 5.9 have type husk
Her shill is normal

DB now is just useless
Even Aka with useless buff but she still can be used to get 620 xtals
Zero buff and can’t even use her to get xtals
Any valks in dorm are decent to good except DB

you dumbass <:sky90:976492870204813372>
we already get half of it
i like suit like HoF the best <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
like, most of the reason are  Focusing on other characters  ,  Stop trying to milk the story  ,  Why do you try to break your own promise  , etc...
not like GLB opinions matter anw
im neutral about this one <:sky90:976492870204813372>
only a few are degen
most reasons i saw that against it are reasonable
tbh im fine with another APHO game mode with Su and Kevin <:sky90:976492870204813372>
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
when those guys also have degen among them
 CN this, CN that 
i just feel weird when CN- discussion try to stand on moral highground <:sky90:976492870204813372>
also Sushang, Roza, Liliya, etc...
when Teri and Seele are still waiting for their suits
cause they think Mihoyo will try to milk the story with male battlesuit
even female players are against it
it's just different in perspective
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
 make them playable so i can touch them in bridge 
and those who are agree with male battlesuit also have degen in them
on NGA at least
most reasons are  Focus on characters that has been left in dust since forever 
only a few
<a:Yaeslap:966597937696223232>
how does that even work

just focusing on Elysia and supports are enough for physical team <:AgonConcern:799494217717776425>
Elysia performance is getting boost by Griseo
use Elysia on others
use 3 supports on bio/psy bosses
just use Elysia <:AgonConcern:799494217717776425>
better just use 3 supports at that point
but not like she can outdamage 3 supports team
<:sky90:976492870204813372>
tbf S0 can probably retain RL anw
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
she needs SS
SS is the important one
crit rate iirc
can't even outdamage 3 supports
altho S0 BK = trash
just buy BP in 6.0 <:AgonConcern:799494217717776425>

you need to find that account and link it again to make it a real hoyoverse account
a ghost hoyolab account will be created
if you link with any other methods
someone in technical help found out their account was link to the twitter
they link to their gmail/fb/twitter/apple ID
but they didn't link to a hoyoverse account
the problem is that they did link
or Mihoyo wanting to merge all their data
probably due to some policy change <:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
<:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
turn out that those accounts were linked to a random gmail/fb/twitter/apple ID on their devices

<:KianaFish:423917411465560065>
there is also a guy in lore channel whenever he speaks, he prefer HoV as  my queen  ,  god queen  and keep going on for 2 hours about how HoV will save Kiana when Kiana get cornered in future
the  HoV is still there  group have more than 1 member tbh <:woggers:652740192653934633>

<:woggers:652740192653934633>
what im good at is copying good players
what im good is not at the game
it is true
<:quantumwoggers:855085607398277200>
people will cry because they don't have Nyx
once 5.9 hit
Nyx is meta
they won't
which lead to heat debate
or headcanon
what isn't fine is that some want to stick with their theories
Jenshin players getting into Honkai lore is fine <:woggers:652740192653934633>
on other hand it mean lore channel getting flood with headcanon
on one hand it mean Honkai is getting more new peeps
there are a lot of special  people in maincord lore channel recently <:SeeleSweat:843946435271852103>
some people in lore channel said he has a history of refusing to read

<:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
just ask you donkey
just ask like a normal human epi
actually good change for Abyss, giving everyone choices and reduce the pressure on RL <:woggers:652740192653934633>
but competitive will also rise
slack bracket will definitely happen
so it depend
now it's top 10 tho
i mean most of the time people sleep after getting 15k pts are because they knew they can't get in top 5
do not snitch me out if you get caught tho
and yea, im sure
mention price range too
botting <:woggers:652740192653934633>
<:HoVCookie:599331162690813966>
it's normal, if it's against the rule Sloth will DM you or ask you to DM him
uhh, for this phone matter, better go to maincord and ask Sloth in technical
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
don't waste your money on gacha
it's better that way
time to find a summer job and get a new iphone
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
what about the one Sloth recommend ? Over your budget
but im an apple enjoyer
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
i think Sloth did post a recommend phone once, lemme dig it
<:795357298205655040:799494217717776425>
buy the newest iphone on your local apple store
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
more like RNG fest
Abyss balding
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
that's false, Nyx is an outstanding one
overall good change
more Nirv retainters, less pressure for RL
you can retain now if you place 6th to 10th
Nirv bracket change
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
Griseo supply has good offrates  <:woggers:652740192653934633>
<:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
i mean ofc but not like you can afford it and not like it's worth it rn, she can still deal good amount of dmg with just weapon only
the 3 supports team
it's actually simple, you will realise how easy it is <:worryStudy:695457376245121114>
just put Glutton T and newt B on her
<:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
SnS deal the same amount of damage with HoS and Griseo deal like 1/2 of them
yea you're not supposed to stay on field and bonking like there is no tmr with HoS
<:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
epi istg when you turn 18 im gonna f*cking kill you

Epi istg
<:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
you won't combo like that in Abyss
it's SS Arena rotation
what is complicated about it <:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
i mean Kiana Sisters <:woggers:652740192653934633>
Durandal is all you need playing Honkai Impact 3rd

<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Remy, Nyx already have ADV
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
They still haven’t added FGO in Abyss yet, 5.8 is actually Dudu DLC
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Can’t be that bad
Surely SS Nyx can finish from 6th to 10th
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Another HoDom
Did you see week 4
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
What the hell man
Just saw week 4
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Watch 21k retain Nirv in 5.9
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
But basically Nirvana will be new standard now
Oh it depend on the number of players in the bracket too
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
That’s a skip angle for Vill-V then
<@!385655541248163840>  <@!148145559897636865>  they change Nirvana bracket, starting from 5.9 : 
-1st to 5th : +100
-6th to 10th : +0
-11th to 20th : -200
<:huh:966619839307321394>

VB and SnS is decently fun
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
until 5.9 that is
not really a waste
you will still need hekate in SS MA to pair with FT so
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
it clear better than hekate
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Griseo and 7TR will drain me dry
not like it matter tho
SS BKE is also her biggest upgrade <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
im not even joking but S0 BKE is not gonna outdamage 12/12 3 physical supports
you're understimating how strong HoS SnS SI is
chill heki, ofc he will retain
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
SS TP is fine, still 4% physical dmg buff
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
im also poor wdym
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
QUA weather in general is just annoying
even in Nirv people don't care about QUA weather
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
and try not to f*ck up your account
everything need time
ofc you will feel like you lack everything
epi, your account is like a baby
what's going on
<:huh:966619839307321394>
lot of things are CN only <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
pulling a heki i see
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
you can miss weapon in FOCA ? how is that possible
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
why does your Morb still naked
i'd buy new bridge with b-chips tho <:HMM:966625453194485760>

they're setting up for another captainverse event tho
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Roza died and she became Gamma
Lilya
on the contrary, CNY valks are AE-HoS-PE/SpA
and uuh after HoR was TP
i think it's FT
CNY is the one that alwayas have OP valk
Anni doesn't always have OP valk
V1 : omg she is broken, must pull, meta shaper
V2 : a little nerf ? that's fine, balancing 
V3 : SMFH they nerf her to 6S tier, trash valk
i actually can't wait for CN-discussion in maincord to discuss about Herrscher <:wokege:966623232918712331>
37 days from now
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
before that patch end
but we will have Ely teaser to cope
it's 6 weeks
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
summer Felis can comfort me for that 5 weeks of hell
at least it's summer theme <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
for whatever reason
their RL has the same temp with CN IOS
KR is nuts nini
<:FelisD:987145546974253056>
i'd say KR > JP > NA = SEA ~ EU
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
or top players competing each other
yea this strat is for people that want to break into T100 or T50
just restart until the stars align
that's as realistic as it should nini
cause if you're tryharding you will want to use Holmes and Dracula on HoS
actually Griseo make physical Abyss become more intense to restart for crit <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:GriseoD:974851955446927390>
the savior of physical is coming
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
easy rotation, tons of dmg
physical bosses will be more fun when Griseo arrive tbh <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
maybe RL for a while is a good thing
honestly im thinking about that too <:HMM:966625453194485760>
they also make a flying QUA mob stage for Vill-V i think <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
it's uhh, 10 Couatl in 5 weeks <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
i don't know what to say anymore
if it's another 4.8
im more worry about Vill-V abyss <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
i will see how it go in next bracket, if i see 10 Griseo's chair in my bracket i will need to pull her too <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
and next week is Jizo again, surely my fellow SEA players won't grief me again
please
stop rising temp when next week is physical boss
bunch of M in SEA
<:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>
the AKA cycle 2 weeks ago rise SEA temp to 449 and i have to change my BKE affixes again cause Jizo always stay alive with 2 HP
Bunch of M
For some reason SEA just love AKA
SEA always rise again in AKA
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Oh wait Glb also dropped that much ?
I think
GLb is like 8D higher
It’s SEA <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Which is literally impossible without pausing
Rino used that to reach 780
You can cheat 2-4 pts on AKA by spamming pause when you strike the last hit
It’s general things tet
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
You already know Rino will post a clip and pause like there is no tmr on Homu
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
HoT is god of SSS MA
They also give HoT life insurance with double SSS
Because Morb is dying, pull her skin to save her <:deadge:975652771082698782>
From S0 to SS1
All kind of HoT
Currently all the ref i saw from CN use CF on Fischl with HoT
It does matter with HoT
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Yea should be
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
That’s why it’s called 3 free cycles
Still 400 until you demote to AG3
Not sure if it’s true or not
My friend said Glb RL always dropped after Andrius <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
No more free 3 cycles
Im not sure if that’s a good thing or bad thing for new players
Beside HoS and AE ofc <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Last time i think keeb think only HoF and PE still worth as general pull
What about general S rank pull, did it change
Interesting

Aoi, heki, epi and who is the 4th
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
If you don’t need to pri any weps rn then ig just let them there, wait to see if you will get Griseo’s cross or not
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Sound good, how many mats you have left ?
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Pri all of them first
So don’t waste your resources
WoTP is decent in IMG bosses too
Senpri is fine ig but i’d prefer CD more
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Wait to see if you get Griseo cross or not before pri Hekate
Hold them at 50 first
Don’t max any of them
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

PE also has good score in MA Couatl
And she destroy IMG
She is the 2nd best option in every phys bosses
Are you high ?
Epi
She is exaxtly what you think about as Physical Herrscher
Just because PE doesn’t have Herrscher in her name doesn’t make her any less than any Herrscher
And her coverage is as huge as any Herrscher would be
But she was realeased in CNY
She doesn’t have Herrscher in her name
PE is the Physical Herrscher
Why do they even release another Physical Herrscher
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
not mine
Mihoyo's fault
but still
kinda my fault for not pulling SS Aponia tho

no you don't
epi stop confusing yourself, relax and wait til next week to make decision
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
it's 10 pulls
you only need Morb's weapon right ?
just roll for it
why does she have no gear

I think Morbius is the easiest boss for HoF
Big damage
Sakura core 1 and Ely signets
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
HoF is a beast if your run go smoothly yea

heki the flight can't wait
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
every survey
i wrote  Can you guys fix the god damn RNG aspect in Abyss 
cause the standard when you go to EX is like 2 fully built team
if anything it's more easy to access now
i don't think double SSS bosses is more inaccessible <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
the 1 single attack every 1 hour
but i don't hate it
i'd be lying if i said i miss SK attack pattern
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
the key is to enjoy RNG aspect
but im a Abyss player so i can't say  i understand how you guys feel  so i will keep my opinion shut <:TeriAhe:973793204237398106>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
the most impossible thing is that those 4 weeks i just mentioned, HoT will definitely be  in there
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
account check will be so hard with double SSS
uhh, i just find it annoying that there might be such week like :
-Wolf + BKE
-Tank + BKE
-Jizo + FGO
-Coutal + Tona
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
do you see how many weird comps they bring
CN dalaos enjoy SSS boss fight more than us
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
they can't hide SSS Pig anymore
there are 6 weeks per patch
lmao
can't hide it anymore
they have to bring back SSS Pig now too
oh now that i think about it
actually HoF is still useful, her useful in MA is different with HoT tho <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
yea they guarantee PE and HoT future so hard with this change tho
lmao
fuck Nyx
just use Vill-V and HoT
i still laugh at Nyx what
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
like the top tier valks in ER barely care about what kind of boss they dealing with
so does Morbius
i mean let's be real, PE doesn't care about boss at all
just do Husk with PE <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
and you clear hitcount shield with ?
wish.com PE
is that what you have on your amazon wishlist nini ?
her damage was bugged to have extra 12% TDM
Aponia buff is a compensation
so much skill expression
i like Ice Hellmaru the most
it has to be Abyss
if that is MA then it's delusional
wait what
the Abyss one ?
what couatl are we talking about ?
Like for some reason my competitive blood doesn’t boil when i play PGR
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
I tried PGR up until end of Bianka patch then i quit cause i was bored
I can’t seem to get into PGR
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Maybe double the trouble double the fun ?
Wait for it to hit and see if you can enjoy it or not
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Cheer up keilo, can’t be that bad
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Half the fanbase rn is Genshin players
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Yea i enjoy Abyss with its RNG aspect
1% skill, 9% gear, 90% hit the reset button
Like Ice Hellmaru
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
I mean if you enjoy Abyss you will get used to RNG
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
I just point out why it’s bad
Tbh i don’t hate double SSS cause i enjoy these fights
<:TeriAhe:973793204237398106>
Jesus
But for a week like Wolf and BKE
Griseo does fix that
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
She spend useless time to farm 70 sp
That’s why current Ely on tank sucks
Like, in a game mode where time even more matter, spending time to farm sp feel like nightmare
Her team have 55 <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Don’t have starting SP
MA is worse than Abyss in a sense of SSS tbh
MA is more of a hobby tbh
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Like 1% ?
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Most of the time everyone settle with mediorce score in SSS
Because in week like Wolf and BKE it’s all about who have both HoT and SpA
Actually you will have more chance now with double SSS
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
We will see
They can revert it if the change cause a riot in CN <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
If CN is unpleasant with double SSS they will raise their voice but if not we will have to live with it
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>

that's like paper
GLB A3 is like 320 last time someone mentioned it
yea ofc

<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>

<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

i finished pulling Yelan 2 weeks ago and quit Genshin 5 minutes after clearing Abyss
she just doesn't have Herrscher in her name
technically last Herrscher is PE keilo <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:catblush:963351912235810826>
that's what she said last night
i think Global even had 1 week patch in 1.x day
it was from 4.6 to 4.9 i think
from HoS iirc
there used to be a lot of 5 weeks patches back to back
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
go back to RL and touch grass instead
maybe they're encourage Nirv players to stop pulling
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
maybe SSS Nyx can retain in Vill-V weather
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

i mean rolling for S0 Vill-V is kinda a low EV move since you will most likely need ~70 on expa and another 30-40 for 4/4 <:whaleri:973697463984717836>
basically as random as it could be
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
i don't think there is any reason for that except that Dudu had a journey into SoQ in her VN
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
cause if they want the type to fit lore, it's really hard to fit QUA in except for Seele
QUA valk doesn't really have a pattern for them
3.8 sth
VG was before BK
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
should be 2020, after HoT released
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
find out yourself which year is 4.2 in normal language
4.2
i respond in honkai language
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
and in V3 everyone called HoF trash
in V1 she killed every bosses, ignore all type counter
i still remember HoF beta
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
im human tho, but for stuff like Abyss week or year release, i don't speak normal language
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
i don't speak normal language epi, talk with me in honkai language pls
farmable S rank usually after Herrscher
4.2 after HoT
that decision alone is already suck
nini you want a QUA valk
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
even in my dream i saw Couatl
whole 4.8 was QUA
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
i can't use it tho
yea it's nice to have a replacement for HoF
free HoF for SS bosses in tank week
good enough
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
look like 760 is max for 7S keilo
and CH was released back in 1.8
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
epi, Judah is even older than CH
they did carefully create 7TR this time <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
with hands ofc
im pretty sure even SK or HoTF is competitive in RL
i'd like to have 10 more cats
Cat is a good deal tho <:worrywink:963350381545521152>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
in general she is not
like, on nirv standpoint, she is still a good valk
on her patch that is
she did a really good job tbf <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
last QUA valk didn't end up doing so well but maybe they won't make the same mistake
well i sure hope Vill-V is something <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
like extremely low
yea the goal RL only now is kinda low tbh
she does look more fun than Aponia
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
that is sth ig
they just slept through it
cause last QUA cycle, everyone in my bracket didn't even play the game
when Nyx and FR will probably be more than enough
yea im not sure about pulling Vill-V to retain RL
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
oh im not sure about pulling these kind of valks for S0 only, opportunity cost speaking you lost a lot of pulls for no reason
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
i was gonna said wait for V3 but usually these kind of valks need SS or at least S2+ to actually perform as good
i don't even say hi to Rino
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

Until the real HF came
She used to be called HF
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Im pretty sure everyone in here only chat in WFP to keep the honkai section alive

<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Yea now i read it again my brain was talking about 2 different versions at the same time
Kinda messed up the wording right there <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
She scored equally with Aponia before the changes
Oh about Sushang and Clock i was talking about her V1 <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
Yea weaker type mean Up only
Dream shattered
Sorry nini <:HMM:966625453194485760>
Oh weaker type, not type counter
Lemme dig the pic
Isn’t it say type counter <:HMM:966625453194485760>
Good weapon
And those scores for S1 HoT look solid, i’d say HoT is a better investment in lightning now than the other 2 <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Cause Hot also top score Husk and Sushang
That’s why CN outrage 4 weeks ago
Yeppers
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Not just mech only
Yea but 7T +45% TDM against type counter or countered
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
7T buff 45% against counter type so probably better than Aponia
HoT can probably score a decent one against Wolf now too
E-girl world <:huh:966619839307321394>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Seriously
Double Pri patch back to back
Can’t wait for Vill V to be another SP with Pri
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Don’t think anyone even compare that, just assume you can max pri arm
Damage wise
Hekate pri is like 94% compare to Griseo pri
Take it slow aster <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
Griseo is cute
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Fun police <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
not like they need it
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
biri said that they shadowbuffed HoDom core or sth
<@218762069338619906> when you get in beta, can you test oneshotting HoD core with SnS to see if it's still possible ? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
oh i need to ask carv to test HoDom in Abyss, i heard that you can't oneshot HoD core anymore with SnS <:HMM:966625453194485760>
wait for Paga and Bastet to have their rerun
you think Zhenyi rerun is a myth
you do realise that Zhenyi is starting to have rerun more often because it's the 3rd SP set of relevant valks right epi <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
neko is a fish, he forget every 5 minutes
wait so you have 1/4 TP ?
i see <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Kafka TM Ely B ?
wait what is BiS TP tho <:HMM:966625453194485760>
half-ass investment is even worse than wrong investment
i mean you already have 4/4 TP, better go along with it till the end
epi do you have SPA ? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
yea it's kinda easy <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
just need to pri-arm weapons wisely, don't pri-arm HoF weapon on physical week
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
and you should be able to get 15k as long as your account is not a ghost account tbh
or else based on how many waves you cleared
if you clear within 5 minutes, you get full 6k <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
you only need to complete 2 main stages + 15k point for 100 xtals
what is so confusing about that
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

not meta
my only S0 valk is Aponia cause i play game for culture
F2P confirmed
i don't even have S0 HoF
never spent more than 100$ per swipe

<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
chance people have SSS Ely is higher than SS HoF
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Tank will probably be on 5.8 tho
so SSS Ely > HoF S0 on tank now, that's not bad  <:HMM:966625453194485760>

<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
yea she called Sakura Rondo
not her weapon
i mean, if she has ignite mechanic then it better be in her kit <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
QS6SZRALKU94
holy i just realised nini gave the wrong code
cause they have special mechanic that even SP is really hard to overshadow them
look at AE
S-rank support tend to live longer
if she is S-rank then tbh you can skip her til anni or CNY <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
this one they just need to show how Ely look like
not as a lot as ER chapter 3 act 3
what the hell is that
much less about Elysia sitting, wating and said  Hi, im 13th Herrscher 
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
no one even saw Aponia's boss fight coming
this one is special, they has been keeping everything about ER in darkness for a long time
animated
at best we will have a glimpse of how Ely look like in chapter 30
end of chapter 31
it depend but in Ely's case the animation will probably in chapter 31
but Cyberangel was in chapter 11
if you mean end of arc animation then probably <:HMM:966625453194485760>
at that time everyone think she can summon a giant sword
and also we knew about Senti because she was a boss and not even playable
HoF didn't have any files to datamine <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
it was story
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
like, if she appear now or later won't change how Mei learn the answer
we don't need to, Ely Herrscher can just show up and explain later, that's her story, she already know she is a Herrscher, there is nothing to realise <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Ely outright said she hid her legacy in an island
unlike other Herrschers we need to see their journey or realization
there is really nothing much to say about her
ofc we will
5.7 is already over nini, no one care about 5.7 anymore
yea should be wednesday's night

Houdou is the worst boss <:felissad:987316204286922784>
14.021 crystal, enough for 7TR <:wokege:966623232918712331>
You mean SK ? <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
i think this season BP is just either HoT stamps or torus
i'd just get 210 torus then <:HMM:966625453194485760>
in the long run HoT stamps is better, SS her eventually with free HoT from anni and stuffs <:HMM:966625453194485760>
4 more days <:TeriAhe:973793204237398106>

Elysia/Morbius/PE/Aponia
Jenshin Impact <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Yea we have one, HoF
Ranged tank is a joke tho <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Im not trying to down your mood but pulling for only Elysia weapon sound like the last thing you want to do
i mean heki, you're already in Ex, ofc you can afford to buy max FR frags every week <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Hello aster <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
Im happy when someone give me money keilo
Turg is always the best prior <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Prioritise as in gearing or rank up ? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
I had a dream where Pardo still alive
For SSS just which ever SP on the team you use the most
You will have to use them with FR anw, and SS is not that expensive <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Already have plan B
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Only lack HoT i assume ?
Looking solid heki
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
So uhh, SS Fischl -> SS Eden -> SS Griseo, SS is the borderline for a useful SP anw
FR is good enough
And not a imaginary HoT
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Do you have a proper lightning dps to pair with those 2
It depend on the state of your account
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
Cause she is PE
PE is 2nd best for all phys bosses <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Can you just use PE at this point <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
That is 1 sad FR <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
You can use FR on Sushang <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
and some crazy stig to powercreep Turg
Ice SP Timido to kill off HB <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
maybe 2 patches of captainverse
not that many suits left in the game
wonder if they will hold off for a while after Herrscher release <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
i need to pull Griseo and new DK
did you whisper that everynight before sleep ? <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
there are so many things to pull <:felissad:987316204286922784>
Vill-V will save fire <:felissad:987316204286922784>
yea im just kidding, she is still a good lightning support <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
not a good way to advertise Aponia
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
cause S2 HoS can score 800 in CN RL
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
they fixed Sushang Physical and Ice Res in 5.8 so HoS and SW score probably go down like -200
joking, she is still useful for Sushang and stuff <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
she is fun in ER tho
FR is dead <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
well you can use VK-PX +1 to do MA HoV for meme purpose
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
there is no reason to use VK anymore
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
not because VK is also dead in lore ?
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
could be worse
no Paga <:felissad:987316204286922784>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
without Dudu elf you might lost extra 2 seconds on P1
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
the max one need intense reroll
this one is an easy setup
yea she can score 31.520
you can also use PE <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
if i met nini irl in Starbuck i will proceed to flying kick nini
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
heki without HoS : you worthless donkey
everyone else without HoS : oh dear, you precious
5% for non existence HoT <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
for dorm buffs
well ideally you still want all of them SS <:HMM:966625453194485760>
why do the first valk you think to get is SK <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
more rhythm games next patch
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Next anni will probably be either free HoT or AE, last year we had free HoR already
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Save up a lot of resources cause you only need Ely all the way to EX
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
I think for new players, it will be best to invest in Ely starting 5.8 instead of FT
But ngl with Griseo
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
I mean sure that will be Ely boss but that is because HoF can’t touch it
Not much chance for Ely when she is competing with HoF on MA
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
LWH HoF can score 47.616 while SS3 Ely by Fhem can only score 47.600
55 SP is SSS lead
Yea even Fhem couldn’t
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
But not vs S1+ HoF
SSS Ely vs S0 HoF maybe
It’s not Ely is bad, it’s that Psy dps in MA are all better than her <:felissad:987316204286922784>
Griseo leader skill is good for Ely in MA
Yea, before Griseo, Ely leader skill is basically useless <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
She get better with Griseo
Her leader skill sucks
Always end up at 2nd best option anw
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
PE weathers is every phys weather
Kiana sisters are strong
Technically yes, yea <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
she just can't be killed in MA
well technically they did kill her in Abyss with all the SPA shills and Morbius shills for a while <:Terichew:973794176015675392>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
lightning Seele is possible
it will be lightning
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
AE-HoS-PE/SPA
only CNY valks were always strong one
well looking back, Anni valk didn't really need to be a strong one <:HMM:966625453194485760>
or all of them
1 of them 3 fire dps will die in anni
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
but Anni valk is also fire valk
next Anni is probably AE yea
4.6 you can get VK or S-rank frags from spending too
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
they did, started since the 3rd or 4th anni i think
lemme check it rq
not sure
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
usually they give you 1 for free on Anni too tho
Anni or CNY
S rank character card in spending is only for big spending
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
yea max that one first
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
<@385655541248163840> apparently everyone did get a lot of Zhenyi on 7TR supply nini <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
got anything good alongside ? like Zhenyi TB or Turg TB sth <:HMM:966625453194485760>
taihen how was your pull for 7TR ? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
i like her design tho
PX = 🚮
NS is fun, HotF is fun
said no one ever
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
<:worrywink:963350381545521152>
any kits that have SP battery will replace Raven
you know that kit will just push Raven out even further right
can't wait for next week <:slacc:963350438940397588>
if Vill-V is S rank then she will also have special mechanic <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Hua battlesuit is eternal
but i don't think the chance for Vill-V to push out AE is high  <:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
if she is S rank then she might compete with what AE is doing rn
it also depend on Vill-V rank
oh you were talking about random frags drop, thought you mean HoT ADV, it will have random frags drop too nini <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
new valk
No suitable valks <:felissad:987316204286922784>
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
Im down for 7 forms of 7TR for +70
I don’t mind it tho
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
That is another +10
AF didn’t have +10 on release because they didn’t add AF slot yet back in 4.7
It’s +10
after you tuned it
For 7TR you don’t need a 2nd weapon
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Get it and +10
Yea it is
Don’t need to sync
7TR is free +10 once you get it
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
Don’t do it aster
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Im also on phone

These felis emote are too cute
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
<@!803575968374849536>  can you add this felis emote 
<:huh:966619839307321394>
i'd want to use that pull on lottery instead
that is a once in a lifetime pull <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>

2 boss fights
Remember ER chapter 3 act 3
Technically we can see Ely Herrscher form at the end of act 3
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Ask them if they can retain RL or not
E-girl Armanda
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
unless
you only need 4 pulls for 4/4 Griseo
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Nini, it’s called Heavy FIREarm
<:veldurp:963351014755434516>
Did you write it in your Christmas wishlist ?
<:huh:966619839307321394>

Good job aster
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Can they even clear ER
Not even AG1 <:huh:966619839307321394>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
Me :  HoV is dead, you shouldn't use her  
They :  But i play Honkai for her  
I will still give them advices to play her after tho
there are a lot of new players who insist on using HoV<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
i will give heki some credits, except for his own account he does give good advices
abusing HoF is way easier
i tried to copy Fhem by using S0 SN, after 2 hours i decided to  fuck this  <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
wait actually, im more F2P than Keilo cause im not a T100 MA enjoyer <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
istg im as F2P as nini and keilo, ask them
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
im also F2P
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
does sidestage even hard <:HMM:966625453194485760>
if i were you i would just ignore all 3 bosses and prepare for the 4th one <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
but Hekate will still be safe for a while
it also kinda depend on Griseo's cross performance
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
SoS is Rimestar only
always hekate
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
choose wisely on which to pri
if you're an EX newcomer
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
even Hekate see more use in Abyss than SoS
SoS is like one of the last weapon you want to pri because it's just for MA <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
just -100 yea
wait until we know what element Vill-V is first
first of all, if you haven't craft Pledge of Sakura yet then hold off on crafting it
Honkai has been doing that for ages <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
all FCs are dead and we have 3 SP Flamechasers in a row <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
oh wait <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
that's why you should never use Genshin pfp, reducing your IQ
these genshin players man <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
that mean AE and HoS ADV soon
DA ADV <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
so 60 pulls for Griseo
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Does ER valk first clear 620 each ? I thought it was 520 each <:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
what is this abomination
nini being mean like usual <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
exactly what a bait before Herrscher need
yea, good supply with good offrates <:HMM:966625453194485760>
looking solid <:HMM:966625453194485760>
On avg everyday you get like 800-1k exp last time i check with my cadet
The stamina pot that give 30 stamina per use, can’t really recall it name <:HMM:966625453194485760>
if rn you're at 12k then you won't be reaching EX on Houdou unless you can burst out 100 stamina pots <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
max pri this thing instead of Neb
why does your Neb still 5* <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
try using CD and Hekate instead neko <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
That’s the script i wrote when i still working on ER
No, in act 2 the culprit confront Aponia and try to delete her, Eden step in to help Aponia but she hand over the golden key to Mei first before dissapearing with Aponia.
Act 3 SU and Vill V try to open the path to the island for Mei while Hua slowing down the culprit 
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Vill V ignite support with off field dmg ability
Yes
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
I know what will be there in act 3
I already looked into the future
24 hours
Tmr act will determine everything <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
I don’t even read because im a Honkai player
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
What happen if you’re not in their Armanda but still use their icon
<:slapbaka:974814370817273876>
She is not official in GLB yet
Hey <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Call her battlesuit name
Sweet and Spicy <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
and yea, should be fine with 2/4 SnS too <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
her T and M pc buff her own dmg
3/4 SI and 4/4 SI diff is almost non-exist
the same apply when you replace Griseo with SA
cause HoS-SA-SnS, all 3 contribute dmg
most of the time it's team effort tho
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
HoS dps is 3rd most use after BKE and PE in Phys Jizo
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
lemme bilibili it real quick <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
gearing DA when no SSS pig in MA and no Rimestar in Abyss
<:terium:973796767793569802>
is that supposed to be good or nah ?
108 pulls to 4/4 cat
remind me of my bastet pulls <:deadge:975652771082698782>
if you still want to morb later on then what you're doing before is fine
that's about it
can also do para
to have at least a decent dps for lightning weather
if you actually 100% sure about pulling Griseo gears then your prior is FR now <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:veldurp:963351014755434516>
yea no sh*t, i'd rather play MC and start spinning than FT without sleep pri
SS2 FR at the very least
having a mech dps on type weather will always come in handy but if you're considering pulling for Griseo gears then i suggest focusing on FR first
so i still think Irene TMB is fine as long as your balls can't be used on other important stuffs
but that will be require too much
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
iirc it's still Zhenyi TB Handel M
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
for now
Hekate is still safe in MA
i think he only give advice in Abyss context
basically his idea was  do not investing backward 
alright done with backreading, his whole reasoning basically centered around opportunity cost :
-SS TP doesn't exactly outdamaged HoS or even outdamaged her at all in physical up weather so it's not worth if you're farming TP to SS when you already have 4/4 HoS is what he was saying 
-Your lightning team is already a sunk cost so instead of spending resources for TP, better to spend it on FR to cover for lightning weather as much as possible
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
that conversation need more context, lemme backread in maincord
<@781539392039682058>  btw this is Jackal's death scene in CN server heki, no censored <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
I see <:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
It’s 300¥ to pre-order and 1200¥ for final payment, not including shipping
<:huh:966619839307321394>
SW also deal physical damage before coming into main game so not really confirmed but she looks like fire <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
the cmt in Moriso Vill V post <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
and i think 9S SN HoS DK can also cap score QUA crab <:holothink:963352118855626753>
yea SN still see some uses with 0 SP cost burst <:slacc:963350438940397588>

My only 3S
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
HoF HB FR, only have enough dmg for 2s kill if 3S HoF tho
I will check bilibili later for you heki <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
You woke up 2 hours late
5 AM is already too late <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
Enjoy the game first
Play the game how you want aster
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Senti ADV when
I want SSS Senti
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
That mean Heki will miss S2 HoS <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
But weekly quiz told me that 6S is broken when you fight tons of mech enemies
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
<:veldurp:963351014755434516>
She is the only SSSSSS valk
6S is broken aster
You still want to raise her to SS anw, all good <:slacc:963350438940397588>
Only DB is useless
BN is good, her dorm buff is TDM <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Fire need some love
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
If she is fire then i just hope they don’t make the same mistake with Raven design on Vill V
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
5.9 already have the expensive vibe
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
I hope i can get 4/4 Griseo in 20 pulls
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
HSR doesn’t have auto when you do story
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
But if that’s all then HoF can bruteforce it with Fischl
Maybe it will take extra lightning dmg
Typeless Goomy, Moriso vid did not help at all  <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Lemme check it again
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
I only remember aoe check that require Fischl
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Actually why would you need to para it ? It also has para shield ?
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Just run Fischl with Aslaug
HoF can bruteforce it
If it’s a mech
You can also bruteforce it with HoF
And maybe another mech boss
Type BKE and Lightning RPc
Which is for HoT
There are still lightning shill and type shill for Psy dps
It’s wrong image
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
No DB just sucks
BN sucks but her dorm buff is good <:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
and get out
best case possible is you get Cezanne TB + weapon
that is true, but that is worst case possible
if i have Wotang fist i could have used PE for fun <:deadge:975652771082698782>
still para, she is just para boss
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
we do have Sushang now
he does have 4/4 HoS
he can also take on Psy type with dps HoS too nini <:HMM:966625453194485760>
not PE high but also not demoting low
Ely can score on both HoD and FGO pretty well
what do you need PE for ? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
don't need to make the choice now
just collect advices and wait for when 5.8 dropped and decide later <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
does heki even have a choice ?
you
not like you need to make the decision now <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Morbin
but overall i respect your choice epi, gotta enjoy the game first <:worrywink:963350381545521152>
yea i still think skipping first SP supply is not a good move <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
keeby didn't account for after 2 years there is still people without AE in EX
<:jahysmug:973697741656059944>
if you believe hard enough
Phoenix
there is
with that said, focusing on your supports <:worrywink:963350381545521152>
you can make TP work with good supports
AE is a support, PE is a dps <:HMM:966625453194485760>
RL or A3 ofc
like, if you already have HoS + Ely + TP, you can almost guarantee to survive phys bosses
PE will probably remain good for a while but you need to consider the upcoming abyss cycles <:HMM:966625453194485760>
don't investing backward
phys patch is faraway but still
actually, 6.1 is fire patch and 6.3 is lightning patch <:suswokege:966623262912163850>
is that what you write in Christmas wishlist ?
keep investing foward
investing backward is really risky right now
now hold up right there, don't even think about pulling PE if your plan to pull her is 3-4 patches from now  <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
dynamic duo with heki
kinda tragic
epi doesn't have AE
type buff > fire res
SPA AE RC
you can also use SPA nini
fire res
you have 3 free cycles, just make sure to clear stages for 500 xtals
yea basically just use mech dps
i mean you do have lite BKE <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:worrywink:963350381545521152>
it's BKE boss
it's type Houdou in p2 week 5
you're thinking of Ice Houdou
you have lite BKE so guess you can still clear stages
so you will join EX in type Houdou
7k exp is like 1 week ?
p2 of week 4
3 swords performance is consistent throughout your run <:HMM:966625453194485760>
for now only HoDom with PE
GPN is better in the scenario where you need it
send a hydra in mod channel
Is new announcement target heki, 90% of new members this week are heki's alts <:HMM:966625453194485760>
Ai-Chan provide failed info <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
The 2nd one will be better
First IMG dps <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:jahysmug:973697741656059944>
So i guess FGO and HoD’s code conflict with each other
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
Unexpected PE shill
Double FGO next patch
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Yea i treat balding as my hobby after a day of work
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
And call it a day
My way of playing is just spend a little 4 hours everyday to try and try until i got exhausted
Actually even if you’re in my bracket i won’t even know cause i don’t  pay attention to it, unless i saw a familiar name like Akayuki or Rino  <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
There is still 10% that know what they’re saying but the voice of 90% tend to spread more and brainwash some poor souls that are lost
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
The 50 combo with Himeko was hillarious
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Can’t believe this scene didn’t win the Oscar 

<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Sony is thinking of a 3rd rerun for Morbius
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
Cat is such a good design
And maybe Handel Cat ? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
There are some runs with SS Bastet now so there are some new changes for type Houdou
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
You just put Bastet on SS neko
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
Everyone and their moms have SS BKE nowaday so you have to sweat for 2-3 pts diff
5.8 Last week is type Houdou
That is ice houdou
The boss is so simple that everyone actually sweat so hard
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Houdou the sweat boss
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Especially 90% of maincord
<:veldurp:963351014755434516>
Oh the Ely 47.600 on tank is fhem
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
But most likely never
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
Also if i 1 day i can replicate what fhem does i can finally think im a good player
You’re jelly
SEA has a lot of X’s chair
<:suswokege:966623262912163850>
How many Fu Hua’s chair are there in SEA anw
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
I will retire from Abyss the day i surpass Fu Hua’s chair
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Heki pls, that’s not sth you should proud of
Why does his transition phase even exist
But he is a messed up one in Abyss
Tank is cool in MA
Probably Hua signet effect
It’s PE week
Weapon active TDM +20%
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Good package
Now im actually want Griseo even more
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
He did waste a lot of time to farm SP
I remember a dalao in KR score 47.600
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Won’t Ely will take over SSS tank from HoF
But now thinking about this
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Yea i think it will cap at 1 sec kill
55
Was thinking about her battlesuit name
Oh Ely i mean
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
With Griseo lead skill, don’t you think MPE value in MA will rise quite a bit ?
Auto complete activities
Aslaug is good tho
Raven is beyond saving
it mean she is also provide better buff than Raven
the issue is that, even if Vill-V provide better buff than AE
not even close to replace AE
if anyone has to go in fire team, it's 100% Raven
<:veldurp:963351014755434516>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Iirc BKE need to be at least S2 to compete with S0 PE
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
Or Griseo will kill Kosma
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Have to kill the 2 prophets if you’re playing werewolves
My money on SU die next
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
53 minutes
i mean Mihoyo is not that dumb, ADV is for the  need rank to compete  group
and somehow maincord brainwashing them
but that's about it, AE adv is just nini and epi fever dream
yea GLB did have AE expa on 5.6, it was different from CN
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
cause AE adv didn't happen yet
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
are you sure you're not mistaking AE Expa with HoT ADV in 5.6 nini ?
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
You can dodge 2 times when she spin her scythe and another 2 times if she do a double low slash
That’s the beauty of fighting AKA <:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Good luck on rerolling for it tho nini
There is a rotation where you can dodge 4 times in a row in less than 10 seconds
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
the Felis one, Can is actually headbutt Tona
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
So it’s more than enough
Paladin is like 14 balls per patch
wait, it doesn't need sync level <:HMM:966625453194485760>
will probably just pair with KoC anw for sync level 1 <:suswokege:966623262912163850>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Think it’s 5.1 ?
Im remembering when did Black Abyss come out for 10 atk
<:slapbaka:974814370817273876>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Senti ?
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Wait keilo, you don’t like SSS boss fight ?
I only try to improve in SSS MA <:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
On Abyss Jizo PE is better unless rank advantage for BKE
No more Mei til CNY
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
We already have a Mei suit on stand by and CNY valk is Lightning dps
5.9 is double valks again tho <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Fu Hua also became a MANTIS and her body stop growing since then
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Not like he can actually look old, his body is not of a human
<:huh:966619839307321394>
What’s going on
Fully built Jing Wei
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
2863 asterite <:jahysmug:973697741656059944>
More missions when FR event start
Til
<:huh:966619839307321394>
There is a bird name Great tit ?
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Crit Damage issue ?
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
oh EX newcomer i see
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
you're in Nirv ?
not sure if Mihobo actually intended for her to be this good
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
i actually like FT design gameplay wise and meta wise
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
not sure about MA, i just use her without knowing anything
for Abyss context ofc
cheap but powerful
i think FT is still a great valk
i think last SK cycle, i tried FT and scored a good 500
with Senti
FT can score decent against mech type in Abyss too<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
can have fun with anything
is this what life look like when you have skill
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
why did i write SN
oh wait it's SP
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
SN with Bianka Theater
also nini
i always enjoy their contents
good skill and good taste in music <:catblush:963351912235810826>
no Senti no problem
don't worry heki i got you, just do exactly this rotation even on Jizo abyss 

Heki don’t do it
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
What a joke
Hidden techs with maincord
But yea ig maincord is just maincord after all
But im Nirv so im not sure about RL, just want to make sure i don’t missing some hidden tech
<:huh:966619839307321394>
347
I remember trying Mobius on Lightning Husk
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
So im really confusing
Some GLB peeps in maincord keep saying Morbius is better in RL
Does Morbius score better on Husk in RL than HoT ?
Also im actually curious about 1 thing
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
Due to S0 Aponia
I got -200 on hitcount Husk
SEA love Aponia tho
Even Herrscher
Them seem to be able to skip everything
I actually envy them ngl
7TR suck
The dude just come in and said
Talking about 7TR on HoT
CN discussion true resident
Did you know this conversation in CN discussion, it happend 2 days ago <:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
Even SEA has a lot of clowns tbf
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Everyone actually hate Jizo
For example Phys up Jizo
3 cycles but high chance you can retain in some weather due to how lazy some brackets are
Not sure about the numbers
Also you have free 3 weeks in RL i think ? 280 virtual trophies or 320
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
Look at Heki, he still spent for Cereluean happily even tho it will reduce his chance at getting Senti
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Eveyone just joking
Just relax your mind
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
actual dynamic duo
Heki no Senti and Epi no AE
Til this info
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
You don’t have AE
<:veldurp:963351014755434516>
He is even more ready for EX than Heki
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
His teams are good, he is nervous taihen
Especially when she said “ It’s Morbin time “ in ER chapter 2
I also like Morbius
But i respect your opinion on wanting to get Basilik for Morbius tho
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Are you sure you can’t 4/4 her
Griseo supply is 4 weeks
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Not exactly Morbius patch
5.8 is also lightning patch tho
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
TP also gain some advantage because she is also mech in this Griseo shill
And also other stuffs
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Her lead skill
Griseo is speficially strong against Bio
And the boss is Bio
For bleed weather at least
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Still Griseo
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
And your Carole is also not 4/4
Not that she can’t be used
No Cezanne Griseo mean she is not a better option than 4/4 Carole
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
just put Marg on Griseo
ofc <:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
Dead man tell no tales <:deadge:975652771082698782>
can you say the new avg as if im 5 years old <:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
That is cruel
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:suswokege:966623262912163850>
Wait we won’t have Himeko’s letter ?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I was gonna say maybe Mihoyo will messed up the code but that is unlikely, bleeding core may actually break the boss
Unless <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
Abyss FGO  for Dudu who doesn’t have shield
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Which is pretty normal compare to what BKE AF used to had
At least 4 bosses in 5.8
They can put even more effort as long as it’s Herrscher related <:jahysmug:973697741656059944>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
How sure are you that it’s not to match chapter 30 act 3 with valk reveal day
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
They actually delayed chapter 30 on purpose
I was gonna say wait 2 more weeks for story but 2 more weeks is also valk reveal day
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
After ER come to an end, we’re back to main cast story with 2 Herrscher candidates
Don’t hope Mihoyo will go easy on your wallet
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Or a lightning dps, could just be APHO Mei
6.3 looking like a Lightning Herrscher <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:jahysmug:973697741656059944>
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
but air charged in abyss
oh i know about that one messed up code
Griseo exclusive
Cezanne is combo
5.6 ?
also when was the last time we have Ice Benares anw <:HMM:966625453194485760>
don't investing backward
at the pace we are going
that much is enough for everything with mediocre score in MA and retain score in RL <:worrywink:963350381545521152>
you only need M
which paga piece do you have btw ?
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Yea that’s fair
It was fire but they can change it to lightning
They can change the weather
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
Joking aside, i predict beisde type BKE and lightning RPC we might get to see Heimdall in Abyss again
Do you
Im not so sure about that now
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
Jesus
Back in 4.7 era
This much is normal nini, i can guarantee you this is better than 4.7
27% against Bio
Her lead passive
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
It’s Griseo shill
Oh it’s the 50 xtals pack <:HMM:966625453194485760>
Where is the last 50
Wait ER 450 <:HMM:966625453194485760>
Here we go, the quality is kinda low
Lemme find the picture
300
Time Runner at home
<:HMM:966625453194485760>

Someone that go into HI3 lore channel and start talking about Persona 5 or some crazy anime when everyone is discussing about lore
I will report it to the mod tho
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
It’s the weirdo in lore channel, Carv tricked me into reading his worthless messages
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
Im still trying to find what i should look at in lore channel and i realise the one Carv mentioned, i blocked them
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
But is Genshin vegetables healthy ?
This conversation about vegetables is confusing me
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Or just some rumor vegetables
Is it even at least edible vegetables ?
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
I don’t even keep up with Genshin leaks so i don’t know what carv mean anymore
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Wait so is it leeks or not ?
I thought carv was angry because someone talk about veggy in lore channel
Oh it’s leeks
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
What’s wrong
<:veldurp:963351014755434516>
A true American
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
That is worse than gacha
But xQc played slots
<:HMM:966625453194485760> that is true
I used to watch his stream a lot when he played Rust, suck to see him addicted to gambling <:Terichew:973794176015675392>
xQc the streamer
Isn’t X suffer from gambling addiction now <:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
Time for Xiaozhu Luofu showcase <:wokege:966623232918712331>
that is normal behaviour
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
RL temp you can use Griseo with Paga M
for DXY case i think you only need Carole for Nirv temp
that is true <:HMM:966625453194485760>
SK, Otto and probably Nirv DXY  <:HMM:966625453194485760>
new generation support
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Griseo is for phys/type/bleed weather where you don't need to break heavy shield
this will sound mean but 90% people in A3 don't use more than 1 finger
Panini is <:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
SK attack that happened once every 2 hours
there are so many RNG moments in this game that it's actually fucked up
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yea Hitcount Husk somehow became a RNG roll
it's a  if you know, you know  moment
he can't replicate it a 2nd time so he didn't even bother to public it
he said there is a specific try that husk will take extra dmg
in general
i don't know how but when i asked Rino he just said  it happened 
oh keilo do you know that you can actually rng roll hitcount husk
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
literally miss 300k
my Ely QTE crit a lot but it won't crit when SK finally attack to dodge on SnS
i don't want to make fun but that take is actually funny
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
are they your armada member ?
7TR make HoT coverage become smaller <:wokege:966623232918712331>
oh wait, CN gameplay discussion is talking about how bad 7TR is again <:wokege:966623232918712331>
Felis
2 more weeks
S rank is Elysia <:suswokege:966623262912163850>
Fire SP for Fire dps in CN anni
doesn't it make more sense for Vill-V to be Fire SP tho ? <:suswokege:966623262912163850>
<:worrywink:963350381545521152>
Herrscher Ely
her corpse
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Felis -> Freeze
Eden -> Paralyze
Griseo -> Bleed 
Vill V ?
it's the logical step
if you want to kill AE off, send double fire SP
you can't replace AE with just 1 fire support <:deadge:975652771082698782>
i don't really mind double S rank like 5.5 but will they have anything left for 6.1 big spending  ? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
looking solid i see <:HMM:966625453194485760>
is it actually wise to skip Griseo gear to pull on Morbius supply  <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:jahysmug:973697741656059944>
they thought you and them had a connection
that's kinda mean nini <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
oh btw i just realised, if they apply this change in 5.9, doesn't it mean 5.9 will have S-rank gacha valk
300
You only need 10
50 pulls or not doesn’t really matter with next Morbius supply
The change apply from 5.9, Morbius supply is 5.8
For example : If you ger Linn B in first 10 pulls, the guarantee will reduce to 150
It’s 50 per piece and 200 for 4/4
<@!385655541248163840> <@!375625398542925825>  more context
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
nvm
oh wait they're foca card <:HMM:966625453194485760>
look in stress test
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
And SR Himeko already acted like a mentor figure
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
She is a Himeko, it’s her fate
Murata’s death will probably be Final Lesson Genshin version <:wokege:966623232918712331>
Murata and SR Himeko
we have 2 Himeko on the waiting line
Not enough yet
If it’s Honkai 4th then why does Himeko not dead yet <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Where is Hokai 4th <:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Who <:HMM:966625453194485760>
It’s my fault for mentioned Carv back there, sorry Carv <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
wtf <:huh:966619839307321394>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
2 more weeks until the truth, this wait is so long <:slacc:963350438940397588>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
maybe summer Juan is an eel
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Juan is kinda big
what if it's the texture for Juan ?
after Keqing accident, im kinda don't believe much it those outfit model leak <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
kinky
Carv knows it, he just want to have censored tag
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
fake until Mihoyo announce it
that skin is still on the same tier with  Highschooler Keqing 
PSY Ice is already reserved
but also they need to save for Sushang
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
that is the worst type they can put her in
small chance tho
but still could be QUA
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Ice bosses most of them are typeless
except for Ice Ely
not like with Mech she can't take over most ice bosses anw
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
double collapse mechanic
but still has small chance to be QUA
Mech is most likely <:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
gameplay wise PE is CNY Herrscher so they can't also give her competitor this soon
nice dream <:deadge:975652771082698782>
but PE is Physical Herrscher, she won't have any competitors that soon  <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
nice cope tho
why can Vill-V be QUA but not Herrscher Ely <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
god i hate physical weather <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
next 2 weeks has 2 BKE's bosses
cause Raven is still big dmg buff
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
RC win in Nirv but for RL i believe Raven is still better
1 work
i tried it and out of 20 tries
dalao ref can dodge with AE 2 times in 1 AKA double slash
i mean the rot to maximize the dmg <:deadge:975652771082698782>
it make me realise how bad i am
i actually hate AKA <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
for AG3 you can just use SR with SoS or ranger
<:huh:966619839307321394>
what is this
i can promise you, wait till Heki demoted to AG3, you will realise how easy AG3 is <:HMM:966625453194485760>
have fun first <:deadge:975652771082698782>
don't worry too much
you can still slap Hekate + Marg
naked Griseo <:HMM:966625453194485760>
Marg TB Mei M
you can still use Griseo with scuffed gears
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
think about the consequence later
pick outfit first
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Honkai is still a game, if i see an outfit i like so much but i have to demote to RL to get it, i choose RL anytime
but heki will manage to retain in AG3
Heki is still RL without Senti
you're overstimating AG3, don't worry <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Can't enjoy the game if i don't have what i like first
If i like an outfit i always go for it tbh
0 HoS
3 Heki <:HMM:966625453194485760>
is it ? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
but we're still not getting any invitation mail <:Terichew:973794176015675392>
<:suswokege:966623262912163850>
is that 5 minutes before she got impaled by Kevin ? <:wokege:966623232918712331>
cunny ?
who do you need so many alts
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
you do, use SP
Holmes is useful now if you want to bald in Nirv
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Nue, dark star, surtr
What kind of offrates is that
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
the higher the temp go, the more hindrance Raven become, she takes way too long to recharge her big buff
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
best stig set if you don't want to pull signature set
Glut T Mei M Newt B <:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Just need to play around it
GMN work too
Best support for fire
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
And her buff mostly is universal
Also Turg uptime with Felis is 90%
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
The big buff that need 10 rotations to recharge  ?
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
SSS your cat
It’s 5.7 already
Who even use Raven anw
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
Raven was already killed
<:jahysmug:973697741656059944>
You need 2 fire SP
You can’t kill AE with just 1 fire SP
It slow as hell
So when you pick up item
The problem with Samsara is that it was young back then
Iirc 1 common item is 200 exp ?
Yea that’s the way to level up Samsara
If you want to torture yourself, you can speed it up by collecting items in the OW
Good luck
That is one hell of a journey
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Which level is your Higo at ?
From 20 to 30 Higo is like the worst experience ever back then
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
You should stop at lv 20 Higo lmao
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Wutang is still 90%
They can’t delete Schicksal HQ
If she is QUA she will take over all the ice bosses
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
It can also just be another PE case
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Are you sure we can buy out this shop
Just slack on your first EX patch
Sound like a plan <:slacc:963350438940397588>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
maybe the hacker can make better decision than Heki
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
it's actually 14 days cause we need act 3 to know who will be next S rank
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
they delay it on purpose till next monday
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
my curisosity is killing me
either way im fine tbh, just that this wait is killing me with the delay of both chapter 30 and Ely new design  <:worrywink:963350381545521152>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
So for the sake of their HQ not getting flood by trucks i guess they can also delay Herrscher to 6.1
Kinda messed up yea <:HMM:966625453194485760>
So 6.3 is their CNY patch
And next year CNY is early
6.1 is anni patch
That’s only the start of the problem
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
If Ely didn’t show up in 5.8 then 5.9 will probably be farmable Vill V
sound like Morbius's snack <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
breakthrough to EX
if you want to play Honkai Impact
if you just want xtals in general, stay masters
they're just foreplay
i mean it's kinda make sense for Masters and below to be easy <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
and can only appear in sword form in ER
it's a simulation of 7T
imagine handing a divine key to another
over her dead body first
lore-wise KoC is still HoT true weapon
they will probably pair it with KoC tho <:HMM:966625453194485760>
you will
pulling just for the sake of pulling <:worrywink:963350381545521152>
they replied so genuinely that i actually laugh for 10 seconds
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
in a sense eternal slumber is also a sleep
is this gambler tunnel vision <:HMM:966625453194485760>
heki is actually a natural born comedian <:HMM:966625453194485760>
even the 10 pulls pity
FOCA select pity get destroyed
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
you don't deserve to be stopped
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
Too bad global won’t have half the media contents link to it
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
I guess CN playerbase like spooking feature ?
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
They want to keep the spooking feature
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Yea they revert that part
They only change the background into gold
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
Will still get spooked
For valk cards it will still be purple
Only when the valk show up
75
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
It’s 35% to 10%
Max 3 pc debuff
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
It’s not like FR can’t use Handel but FR can’t trigger the most important part of Handel
Also for 10 atk
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
You start to deal ER dmg in normal gameplay
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
The 2nd coming of HoS will be physical breach
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
Except for PE week
Physical week in Nirv is the worst week
And having HoS QTE on  will cut your score down by 5 pts
That Ely will need later
Cause that hit will result in 2 sp
You want to UE that hit
There is a chance for SK to stand up and hit you
If you QTE with Carole in to break shield
For example with SK
Not sure about MA
In Abyss you don’t really want to have her QTE on
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
No it’s PE 1, PE 2 and PE 3 week
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
In general i turn it off most of the time
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
So far with Griseo i don’t think you need to turn off HoS qte
It depend on the rotation
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
Usually FR cause she can use Paga
Jizo-FGO-Bio Bleed Boss and maybe type HoS
5.8 should have at least 4 physical bosses <:holothink:963352118855626753>
You can use anyone
As long as you can burst during para duration + 4 seconds after
Para up
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
There isn’t
i want to use HoV in ER <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
<:jahysmug:973697741656059944>
oh i thought carv blocked everyone because they morb'd all over the place
still can <:HMM:966625453194485760>
is it time to Morb ? <:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
im not sure about skin tho
PE's case make sense cause she did appear in 5.4 story patch
how can you even datamined sth that is not even up <:huh:966619839307321394>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
seahorse ?
what will Juan be to fit the summer theme tho
Physical Herrscher deserve a summer skin
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
my bet in this year summer skin is PE
onto the train for next summer outfit
good job heki <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
shield breaking MA Jizo is the worst experience ever
now that MA Jizo is gone, i can't wait for Griseo  <:deadge:975652771082698782>
1 step closer to SSS HoS
HoS going to BP will be the best BP ever <:TeriAhe:973793204237398106>
not like they're that old compare to HoT <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
4.7 is Turg <:HMM:966625453194485760>
from 4.6 onward is a dangerous area, Mihobo is trying their best to delay bringing those gears into BP
rerun a stig set is not impossible
i mean you can only put so much on BP between the 2 valks, so not like they have that many options <:HMM:966625453194485760>
520 xtals in ER each
Dante
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
you can unlock DA and BKE nini
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
i guess the random set inbetween DA and BKE will be Shui and Columbus
they put random gears inbetween
we only get 2 S-rank valks
so Herrscher Ely powercreep normal Ely ? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:worrywink:963350381545521152>
cause you're new
these cakes <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
checkmate
<:worrywink:963350381545521152>
new players can't get old mooncakes
source : trust me
Marco Polo is HoV BiS
just put Marco Polo on HoV
HoV-HoS-Griseo
i just realised new players can get 12/12 phys team in 5.8
wonder how much xtals can new players get in 1 week tho <:whaleri:973697463984717836>
HoS supply in the first week
but 5.8 actually look decent for new players
Felis shop-Shrine supply
Turg exist everywhere if you look close enough
i just told them to save or whale
<:whaleri:973697463984717836>
but this time of the year is so awkward to give pulling advices
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
i guess pulling SSword is fine as long as you can math out your xtals income
especially this time of the year
yea these type of pull advices are really hard nowaday
they can't runaway from it anymore
cause HoS is 4.6 <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
i know for sure that next BP cycle after DA and BKE will have SSword so i guess for most new players they can consider it as skippable
replace GlutT with Schro T and you have nostalgia set
GluT Mid Mei NewtB
but i still don't think that is enough of a reason to skip SSword
i guess if you can wait 5 more patches then SSwords is kinda skippable ?
 Can't be Tuna, she already HoV 
 Himeko is coming back 
i don't know if you know but in 4.9 peeps were like
HoF is not that obvious with maincord
<:terium:973796767793569802>
like in 5.4 when Dudu turnt Juan
they're hiding something
they even push back chapter 30 to June 13th
<:terium:973796767793569802>
maybe it's Herrscher Ely
but they're hiding something with chapter 30
instead it will be farmable Vill-V
im kinda worry that 5.9 will actually have no Herrscher <:HMM:966625453194485760>
too much words, i die
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
PE summer outfit
June 23rd
ELF Ely, summer outfit, Herrscher
there are lot of things i want this summer
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
now it's Griseo exclusive, not like it's a bad thing for everyone wallet
with better uptime
in V1 it's a better NewtB
i guess that is both bad and good
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
but Mihoyo changed it
Cezanne B was so close to become the new national piece
lower to 36% dmg taken
this happened  <:Terichew:973794176015675392>
and Herrscher in 6.0
yea, if anything they will most likely release a farmale range physical dps in 5.9<:HMM:966625453194485760>
the standard for powercreep these days is kinda weird in maincord
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
oh talking about that, 1 random peep in maincord yesterday showed up and said  Can't believe Paga got powercrept in 5 patches 
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
name calling 90% people in maincord, that's rude keilo
these Flamechasers are not balanced at all <:wokege:966623232918712331>
9S HoS got 47.776 on SSS Jizo
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
like hacker and  not hacker 
Or Morbius
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Most people will just use HoF with Fischl for it
The same will happen with HoT boss
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
He is a retired staff iirc
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
For talking too much
Don’t concern me
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Love is a poison to one’s mind
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
Sound like a normal relationship
<:veldurp:963351014755434516>
Affixes fire dmg on hit and pick fire side
if you're lucky, you can get the oufit with just 2k  <:HMM:966625453194485760>
basically starting from round 4, you have a chance to get outfit in the bingo card, you have 9 refresh everyday so you can refresh the big prize until it show the outfit
and only cost you 3k
so you can reroll in round 4 for the outfit
but you have % to roll for outfit in round 4
basically safe route mean you play normal bingo until round 6
it can be 3k if you reroll at round 4
you only go up to 6k if you go for safe route
bingo is the cheapest
2 fully built teams are good
your Phys and Fire looking good
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
their temp is kinda low
i think
but won't be that much problem in A3
for fire
missing AE is kinda a lost cause ngl <:HMM:966625453194485760>
i really like it when Xiao said  It's Morbin time  in this quest <:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
is the real question
why shouldn't they
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Did anyone die yet ?
she is 9 50.000th time
it's for science <:HMM:966625453194485760>
Hua is even more flat than Griseo <:huh:966619839307321394>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:veldurp:963351014755434516>
hacker with the hate for 4 digits xtals strike again
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
but yea then i guess you can go for BKE if she is free
that is kinda backward
i don't think it's worth to get AF for BKE just to retain RL if you already have PE but i guess it also depend on if hacker already has PE or not  <:HMM:966625453194485760>
but PE is just more useful
BKE is still competitive at SS <:HMM:966625453194485760>
i'd say unless your BKE is SS, just use PE <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
time to enslave another 1
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
imagine Nirv bracket with 20 Ruby from 1-100
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
with power of Void i can open a portal to the bank's safe and whale 100 Honkai accounts
you can take a piss while watching it
HoV ability is quite handy when watching movie
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
and security had to come in
i remember my first time watching End Game, i heard peeing noise in the theater
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
some pee in their cups
My country theater don't have it
<:fuckingwhy:963697607690055711>
yea i remember in 4.x version, i was able to invest in 6S before Mihoyo throw out 10.000 things to upgrade since 5.0
oh you mean valks
full sync DK slots ? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
if you're a DK puller then the amount of weapon from that supply is depressing
once you start pulling for DK
yea that amount is kinda normal <:HMM:966625453194485760>
but unless it's Husk week, you won't use Eden in MA
oh, i knew that one <:HMM:966625453194485760>
also no Pri
no need to keep it, the weapon only work on Eden
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
Binding will be the one that over working again
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Only Sirin did
CE Herrschers didn’t meet their quota
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
SSS cat is like 15% TDM iirc

<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
why does your xtals always in 3 digit area hacker
next week is rough
13/13 team, kinda gaming <:HMM:966625453194485760>
that's racist <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
<:worrywink:963350381545521152>
use Felis with phys team
<:TeriAhe:973793204237398106>
it's a happy face
skip Zhenyi for Griseo <:TeriAhe:973793204237398106>
dorm buff, god keys, affixes
don't think so poorly of yourself, your account is still new <:HMM:966625453194485760>

Don’t let the game win <:worrywink:963350381545521152>
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
Less crit rate to gain more dmg and sp regen
It’s mald strat
DoS is still useful or SS MA
too bad you're not Elysia, can't deny the script <:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
doubter
3 more weeks
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Ofc you need a priority list
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
But you will be fine once you can max pri all your dps
You might struggle in the first patch
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
But she is strong to take it away from BKE
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
You mean PE
Yea that’s true <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Wonde if the new Herrscher is ice, how can they even shil her with so little bosses
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
It’s PE patch
Jizo, new Bio boss, Type HoS, FGo
<:jahysmug:973697741656059944>
so satisfying to watch
Fu Hua gameplay are still the best gameplay ngl
<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
so does every single one of the SP line up <:huh:966619839307321394>
yea, Griseo pretty much solve the hitcount problem by herself alone <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
that's why she delete Jizo shield
but Griseo cross has a passive to explode bleed stacks
i don't really know the answer for that
Type Kasumi
yea, easy, 1 whole month away <:HMM:966625453194485760>
it's easy then, chill <:HMM:966625453194485760>
wait, i thought you're already 80, 1 month is enough for 81 <:HMM:966625453194485760>
July 7th to be precisely
np
as long as you go to EX before that
the shop will dissapear after first week in 5.8
metal and torus
yes
so 81 ic<:HMM:966625453194485760>
the Eden event shop
he keep asking why does his shop doesn't have metal
i need to confirm this for my cadet
btw, can you buy Metal in Immortal Hymm shop when you're level 80 ? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
no BP season is garbage, they're all Torus <:worrywink:963350381545521152>
better to slack 3 days only in case miss out currencry to buy out the shop <:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
look like a fish to me
<:chickHappy:981170092240928819>
what's going on here <:HelloFbi:977468843884691456>
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
I can’t recognise Genshin term anymore, when i see ER i think of Elysian Realm
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
1000 immortal notes <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Mihoyo said it’s 1000 in their announcement
<:huh:966619839307321394>
FMC is just MC with different hair
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
SSS boss mission reward widen the gap between EX and Masters by a lot
Yes, a whole lot, 35% in EX have the same rewards with 0.2% Masters
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
I don’t even know what im doing this event
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
3 daily entries per day, you can slacc 4 days and do it all at once i think ? Don’t see any daily mission
but Vill-V look like she will be Mech
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
i mean Vill-V will kill Elysia in ranged weather
just like in the story
Elysia
Griseo also buff the same amount of crit rate with SA <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Holmes TMB will do 100% dmg to your mental
at least try to get 2 pcs for her
budget Griseo is the same as not using her <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Why the gaming mouse tho
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
But her chunnibyou letter is fun to read <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
We didn’t even get Fischl’s birthday letter in Honkai
The coffin
Yea
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
Kallen also got a new suit in Star Rail too
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Is she meta in Genshin ?
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Sakura got a new suit in Genshin
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Why choose waifu over meta when you can pick waifu from meta valks
No one force you to play meta
At least try to pull efficiently at first to retain Agony
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
I hate it when new peeps be like : “I get what you mean but i play for characters “
Buddy you are not gonna get any xtals to pull in Sinful
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
if you like an outfit so much always go for it, think about the consequence later  <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
So does Ice Ely <:slapbaka:974814370817273876>
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
You can stop after getting Cezanne TB too
Yea that sound good, you should consider pulling for Griseo gear if you think you can
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
You should pull Griseo gear then
That’s not bad
Or both ?
Your current phys SP is 4/4 Carole or 4/4 SA ?
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
But you won’t demoted to AG3 just because you miss out her gear
And it’s her debut supply with 30 guarantee
But skipping Griseo gear is also not a good idea because overall Griseo is a stronger phys supp
GlutT Mid Mei Bot Newt
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
You can always go the poverty way GMN and Hekate
You won’t be fuck by bleed weather just because you don’t have Griseo gear dw
the obvious answer is save ofc, but how close are you to 250 felis balls <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Lot of experts on this matter in there
You might want to ask that in maincord, channel technical-help
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
A 2nd set of Handel is also good if you consider to revive your HoT in Abyss
I think Moriso said so
Unless this cycle everyone decided to wake up
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
I don’t know when but like, the hate for HoF just happened
Don’t know about RL
According to my cadet
I think she is most popular in Master and AG3
The 5th retainer use Ely
My bracket had 4 HoF
Yea last tank cycle
<:veldurp:963351014755434516>
It’s easy to retain in SEA dw, most players in SEA refuse to use HoF for no reason
and i use her not because of her gameplay
the only Claymore i like to use is Eula <:HMM:966625453194485760>
only a reincarnation can save him
M die with her cooking skill
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
only Ei alive
but M die
when will Murata die tho, Himeko lookalike is fated to die in every universes <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
where she can impale Murata
when we arrive to Natlan
<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
i only watch his highlight but i love the guy energy
oh, the 1st row girl is SenTen gf <:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:kyoukaconcern:967581142641430580>
most HoV simps failed to realise HoF is the buff HoV got
is this what they call actual copium <:terium:973796767793569802>
this one is so funny <@218762069338619906>
Does kid these days think Hero = highest killcount <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Isn’t tmr Children’s Day ?
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Skipping Ice Ely smh
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
Always believe in your luck
Only stig offrates matter
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
If you offrate into weapon it will all become Torus, doesn’s matter
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
That offrate is decent ig
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
~~that's what she said ~~
extra wet every night ? <:wokege:966623232918712331>
Barbara <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
Yea 4/4 PE when fighting IMG type is miles ahead of others
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
Lot of stuff to consider
Dorm, DK, affixes
Been so long since Huodou last show up
Dps HoS go full Ssword all the way <:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
Still have to grab it all tho
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Cezanne 3 set effect look fake in the comparison chart
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
*__Test Conclusion__*
- No Cezanne B, no Griseo (so it's recommended to get B)
- Griseo's signature cross has an advantage with auto weapon active + ultimate evasion on QTE
- Griseo heavily benefits from having her signature cross and 2pc Cezanne with B (TB/MB)
- Gap of Griseo with alternative signature gear can increase in actual combat
<:veldurp:963351014755434516>
Mobius might never get her outfit
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Herrscher skin maybe in annivesary patch
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
Highkey it will be PE summer outfit
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
yea they should increase frags per week for FR and Ely if they already prepare new newbie guide for 5.8 <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
5.8 seem set in stone now
Griseo is not included so her perfomance is probably balanced already <:holothink:963352118855626753>
good change
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
the Ultimate change from 13 seconds to 11 seconds is probably to not kill of FR rotation
so you can get DB and BN faster
you can save 2 seconds of tutorial with it
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
rerolling new account faster
it's White Comet
the first line is : changing WC QTE from 375% atk + 2250 physical dmg to 375% atk + 5000 physical dmg
you're starting to imagine things <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
that's suprising <:holothink:963352118855626753>
like, around 4.7 sth ?
16xxxxxx on SEA is not that old <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
HoDom
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
big hands gaming
yea that score is legit
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
Cute
Instead you will have 10 sleepers
But in reality you rarely have those people in EX RL
Everyone always get scared from EX because of some perfect runs on youtube
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
But no one bother to build SNx
It still exist
The same as QUA weather
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
The element is getting carried by Turg and Felis
Ice is not a top prior until their real dps show up so don’t worry
Your dps is Senti ? <:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
Cause here is the thing about A3, usually they don’t play the game/slacking or just step into EX like you
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
I mean investment wise on each team
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
What is the current state of your account ?
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
Retaining in A3 is easy, no need to sweat
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
You will need double that for safety purpose
12k for valk is rough
For GLB it will be around July 7th
They done fixing in 5.8 V3 beta
Otto will be back in 5.8 live server
<:huh:966619839307321394>
they replace FGO with HoDom
still at work unfortunately <:veldurp:963351014755434516>
they're playing different game in CN <:HMM:966625453194485760>
last time i check
i think CN RL now is 435
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
not that often
sometime i do tho
only retain in Nirv, can't retain in Myriad
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
but gotta accept reality
if im a better player i can probably get into Myriad here and there <:Terichew:973794176015675392>
and i messed up 20%
cause crit troll my runs 70% the time
only balding run i have were phys bosses
im lowkey not even balding, i just mimic Rino and pray that my run not troll me
like Myriad will have like 5 people with 770+ and the rest are 750-765
and the rest are just players with actual good hands
yea, there are like 5 players that bald for perfect score in SEA <:holothink:963352118855626753>
and the former is Rino himself
2 simp names i know in SEA are Fu Hua's chair and Seele's chair
<:huh:966619839307321394>
and we won't have ice weather in Abyss for a while
Hekate pri is good for Jizo
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
that's a weird PE you got there
too soon to celebrate
be careful what you're stepping into, the last piece may cost infinite <:HMM:966625453194485760>
im not too familiar with MA
some MA strat on CH i think ?
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
G4 Ice soon
SK is just terrible
im glad that i won't have to meet SK in Abyss for a while after lasy cycle
Griseo shill for at least 2 patches
they will stop pushing out SK/Assaka/DXY for a while
but yea, i think pulling for Paga after Griseo is not a good idea either <:HMM:966625453194485760>
not a Paga enjoyer smh
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
oh, Genshin will finally update tmr <:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
My hands are boomer
But im not him
I think Akalao can definitely bring my account to Myriad
So usually my routine for Abyss is just :
-Spend 1st day learning the boss
-Wait for Akalao and Rino ref
-Try to minic them as much as possible
It depend on your goal, i can come up with my own strat in Abyss too but compare to Rino and Akalao, i just suck
About how good it is for humanity ?
<:terium:973796767793569802>
I take a peek at the script, it’s QUA Ely and she will show up at the end of Chapter 30 Act 3, greeting Mei
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Rank up on other hand
If you think Nyx gear investment as offrates you won’t feel that bad
Great time with you Nyx
And QUA Ely is soon to send Nyx into the graveyard forever
Not Felis kind of better but still good
Yea Eden is so much better <:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Somehow still manage to hang on Nirv
I really pushing my luck with S0 Aponia tho
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
So i also know everyone feeling
Yea i think she is a good pull, but even then i didn’t pull her till SS
People are saving for Griseo and 7TR
Thanks to foresight
I think most players in GLB and SEA don’t pull Aponia
Another bitcoin miner
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
You dissapoint me
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
That’s called been denied
Interesting
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
So we might get a free cycle
They only done fixed it recently in 5.8 V3
<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
Numbers are better than i expect
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
like Domineer ?
he probably won't hate Dudu that much just by seeing her name <:HMM:966625453194485760>
i just answer someone question
huh ? <:holothink:963352118855626753>
luckily Aponia shill will over after 3rd week <:HMM:966625453194485760>
I score 500 and he score like 775 lol
<:terium:973796767793569802>
I got Akalao in my bracket
Yea i did pull her, only S0 tho, barely manage to retain in Nirv <:slacc:963350438940397588>
Typo
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I hate clock man
I actually like Sushang in Abyss
<:veldurp:963351014755434516>
Due to HoT and Griseo shill
Funny enough i don’t even think Husk will comeback anytime soon in 5.8
<:veldurp:963351014755434516>
Her shill is already over
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
so Griseo will pretty much take over a lot of phys bosses
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Did they send the email for ZZZ yet ?

Going straight for Aponia’s cabbage
You’re not gonna craft 2 sleep pri once you reach EX
DK is still useful in your early day on EX
<:yaesmug:963351773869903874>
so SA probably sleep forever when 5.8 go live
and she can also use SA stigs
yea, she has better weapon, better stigs, same crit rate buff as SA <:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:GriseoD:974851955446927390>
for my future Griseo
yea, asterite and mats is a must <:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
yea that one is a skip unless you believe in your luck
actually asterite only cost 100
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
yea but to buy out the shop you need 1800
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
only 1000 Immortal Seals in 5.7
cause Mihoyo did warn us
really ? <:holothink:963352118855626753>
900-1000 notes to exchange
only Immortal Hymm shop you have to choose wisely
yea we do
Griseo will still be best choice for 3 phys bosses in Abyss, that's a fair amount <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
she is the backbone of physical <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>

no more F18 after main story end
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
what do you even have to say if they say sth like that
i haven't typed since this , they refused to read
i will miss all the FCs when it's end
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
updating new enemies is possible but i don't know about new story on ER
where is your HoF if you're in Nirv
like dude, just use HoF
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Ely and some even use SS+ HoT, i remember the one used HoT score like 300
<:huh:966619839307321394>
like suddenly after 5.0 everyone just refuse to use HoF or even outright hate her or sth
S0 PE can score near 900 with 420D in CN
and last cycle only 4 people used HoF
i remember in 5.0 my bracket had 20 HoF
no one in my bracket had HoF
the last time Tank show up
you know what is even more funny in SEA Nirv
valid reason but why call it useless when it's their wallet that can't handle it <:HMM:966625453194485760>
getting full Zhenyi buff on HoT somehow reduce your dmg <:huh:966619839307321394>

<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
must be because i pull every patch
that's a lot, how can i never notice that <:HMM:966625453194485760>
near 65 pulls  <:holothink:963352118855626753>
how much do you think is fair ? 18k ? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
near 50 pulls
16k is fair i think
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
and some measurement error due to not being able to clear ER 2.25x
completely F2P peeps only get 13k as F2P, im couting in 3k xtals from events per patch
and Honky is around 15k-16k for completely F2P peeps that retain in Masters RL or EX AG3
so soft pity <:HMM:966625453194485760>

I won’t mind full gear her too
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
Still need to try for her Cross

Cute is justice
i like March 7th and Clara in HSR more
<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
they're saving it for Sushang
how did the conversation even shift to PE
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
better make it worth right now
i don't mind the FCs being all broken, cause they won't ever get new suits in the future
yea Eden and Griseo doesn't feel like the 2nd coming of Felis <:HMM:966625453194485760>
Vill-V better be bonker to compete with cat
Cat even make  fire team better
let her go
twice a year
she wasn't even alive except for like
yea i hope Ely will be QUA Ice <:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
the most cursed element
lightning will soon have 5 valks for 5 types
oh yea maincord just remind me about CNY Herrscher might be another lighning <:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
i miss when memento is usable
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
1 region start lacking, the others make sure that region is not alone
it's like a plague
i think even SEA RL is kinda slacking now <:HMM:966625453194485760>
i don't know RL temp rn tho
for Nirv context Eden is 100% better
i think CN peeps just prefer Eden more than FR <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
neb wording is confusing
the 2nd part mean  7TR better than DoS vs non-mech by x % ( x < 20 ) 
these numbers are quite good even after the nerf
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
v3 7T vs. DoS against Mech
- HoT (Handel), Eden (Margrave), Fischl (Zhenyi)
- 7T DMG is about +21.2% better than DoS against Mech, lower than 20% better vs. non-Mech
Handel M is better
Zhenyi TB Handel M
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
which most of the time is just  reset until it happen 
<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
he just love Honkai competitive contents
<:huh:966619839307321394>
who wake up sooner
yea fairsky and akalao is just
and sleep again
they wake up at 3 AM to do MA
folks are trying too hard in SEA MA istg <:HMM:966625453194485760>
not in SEA tho, you know the picture of waking 7 AM in the morning and 50 mfs already score 0s  <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
i want to be serious toward MA too but retain in Nirv already require lot of pulls every patch
<:naruge:964203717278715994>
all my xtals are for Nirv retain
i know a lot of people don't take MA seriously, me too but MA is still 50% of the competitive contents
<:huh:966619839307321394>
the first message i see of him in there
Herrscher Ely is the perfect bait to lure new folks
you already know
and when 5.9 drop
i think it's normal for Mihobo to do it, cause Genshin players are jumping to Honkai a lot <:slacc:963350438940397588>
 Im telling you im actually a competitive player, but i prefer mobile 
literally dumb
peeps in maincord was like :   If HoT can get new DK, when will HoV/HoR get their DKs 
even though she doesn't
look like she hitting hard
cool design, appear soon in the story
ngl, HoV is like the perfect valk to bait newbie
and change the pulling system to golden card
Mihobo even notice the number of players in Genshin jumping to Honkai so they make new starter event
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
and the number still rising
Honkai community right now is about 30% Genshin players already tho
cause no way you can ignore the most obvious things ever
tbh i think some people in maincord actually have reading comprehension issue <:HMM:966625453194485760>
it was fun
CN channel in maincord be like :  HoF can't minus 1 second Hepha anymore, trash tier 
for the atk
i think the threshold is like 1415 sth ? <:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:kyoukaconcern:967581142641430580>
Elyshua about to burn Mihoyo HQ
10PM Patch
- Added G2 Gustav (Grey)
- Griseo ult time fracture 3 > 2s
- oh cezanne 2pc got this in v3, but I missed it [When you trigger this extension effect, trigger Sketch debuff cooldown. Trigger interval 16s] 10 pm patch changed the wording a bit
a good Yae is a dead Yae
time to cope for Herrscher design in 5.8
<:TeriSegs:966624167338340372>
so we can expect a teaser PV
in like 22 hours
tmr is dev stream
June 2nd
or they want to release all 3 acts in 1 go
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
yea it's actually easy and more obtainable than pyramid
so i can pick her weapon without pulling
in this special time i really need another real dawei card
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
i sacrifice my kidney for both
last minute changes can always happen
language
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
sorry Nini
not Mei
i cope for cunny patch tho
there might still be a, b and c for beta  <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
if she were to be better than SnS for shielded type it would cause another riot
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
no more cunny patch
Ely Herrscher will save ice for real this time
old SNx can't catch a break these days <:fuckingwhy:963697607690055711>
<:rozad:963351043800981504>
and while im at it i will just grab her neon outfit along the way
10 atk
still can't skip 7TR
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
she will have like 3 top score bosses and 2 sub-par ? i think that's a fair amount <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
yea back then HoT was like the new HoV
i don't even know who maincord hate anymore
they will try to shift the idea  HoF is dying  anytime they have the chance
ngl i don't know the hate of maincord for HoF
<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
Vill V ignite support is coming
but little do they know
people think HoT will steal HoF bosses with 45% dmg on mech  <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
maincord is too fun, you should join for this channel only
give good laugh after a day of work
<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
he just charged in and start malding
there is no context
that's the best part
<:huh:966619839307321394>
there is a dude in CN gameplay channel that mald so hard i worried for his mental health
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
this year summer skin will be either Mobius or Dudu
cunny cult
cause they will pull no matter what
no one even talk about Griseo nerfs
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
should have made Aponia Mental Dmg
it make sense for story flow but make zero sense for gameplay experience
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Aponia into HoT DK
this one timing is terrible
AF wasn't released after a top phys dps tho
that's what cost this mess to happen
Aponia raw dmg is lower than a 50 pulls weapon and a 2 years old valk
i don't think the nerf is justified enough for a DK but the timing of this DK is awkward <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
her raw damage in V2 was kinda unfair when i read it on bilibili
yea i mean the nerf was heavy but it's still stronger than DoS just because of TS
im damn sure i did not see 10 Mobius in my bracket in Husk cycle
<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
my brain stop working for 5 minutes straight
the funny part is some dude outright said  They don't want HoT to powercreep Aponia when Mobius already did that 
they're malding over 7TR nerfs
no one care about cunny meta, sadly
<:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
Maincord is actually on fire right now with V3 changes
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>

Not worth to go Bchip as far as i remember
<:terium:973796767793569802>
Maybe Mihoyo realised that 5.8 bait is too hard so they want to save us some money for 5.9 Herrscher
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Pulling for Cezanne and her Cross seem a little concerning now
That’s something
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
that's a lot of nerf, i just saw her multipliers nerf too
but still
not as bad as 7TR <:huh:966619839307321394>
im a little concerned about Fire SP Vill V
seem like Mihobo doesn't want another Felis
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
did Cezanne get any changes ? i only read 7TR changes <:holothink:963352118855626753>
oh you mean Cezanne ?
that will be omega grief
unless you want to use TP in the next 2 patches Abyss
im positive that Griseo is still unskippable <:holothink:963352118855626753>
7TR did get gutted hard in V3, i don't think they need to nerf it anymore<:pikaWrinkle:977407938916417546>
but what's wrong with other bosses scores <:huh:966619839307321394>
i think the worst someone got is like 6k <:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
what is the avg for bingo again

Did somehow HoF score higher in Airplane than HoT in beta
wonder what is this one for <:holothink:963352118855626753>
and buff physical dmg for 20%
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
i remember they cut down around 2000% multiplier
AF did get a lot of dmg nerf in V3
<:holothink:963352118855626753>  from TDM to Dmg against mech enemies

new ice elf better be on par with Dudu and Klein
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
probably only SS, i only SSS Kiana suits
Ely Herrscher will surely have some top notch gameplay experience <:catblush:963351912235810826>
cause my eyes are always on you
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
it delude me from her press ulti gameplay
yea but at least DA kick the bow
Ely will save ice
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
And the rest copy them
There are like 5 people in help channel that play the game
Maincord living in the past and giving terrible advices is normal
Cat and HB is cracked <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
On support parts tho
But i do think ice is still worth the investment
<:veldurp:963351014755434516>
Feel like my fingers just left me that day
Leveling up SW in ER back in the day is a nightmare to me
Carpal tunnel in ER
SW is good but her gameplay is terrible

Nyx is for QUA Abyss that happen like twice a year
can you catch them all ?

how sure are you
You guys should be ashamed nitpicking stuffs
People are celebrating Ganyu and Shenhe’s chroma
It’s against the rules
If a valk suddenly change her outfit completely Teyvay will collapse
Relax alright

It look fake then it must be true
4* skin
Okay but wtf is this
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
From the very 1st loop
I think it belong to the case of Unfade can only be Feng
Unsleep is kinda fucked up tho
Unfade and Unsleep <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
Just need to win against the odds
Some also don’t kill everyone around you when awaken

I mean there is a 1% chance you can hit the jackpot Undead

There is only 1 doggirl

Once she is live, her contents will be 3 times that patch
You know the time people post the most contents about a niche dps is during the beta period
This closed beta make no sense at all

back to <#966951945103347794> <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
it was like 89k Norwegian Krone
some days ago Aqua reveal his top up
oh keilo
relax chessie
S3 is the lead skill
is night and day
especially discount valk
the difference between S2 and SS for dps valk
srs tho
the people with S0 gHua don't play the game seriously
for dps valk it should be SS0 minimum
or SS even
nah gHua should be at least S2 if we're being real <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
what do you eat on Loli Day
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
Her buttons doesn’t shine
DA is harder tho
Only S2 QK is neccessary for Myriad
Hare, LB and QK both work to their 100% with S0
Oh i actually don’t think it’s the avg for new valks
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
S0 will be 50% of her power
So her defalt rank is S2
Yea should be discount
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
DA die for this

Honkai 2023 design directions:
-Can we make this character boobs bigger?
Yes -> Make it 10 times bigger
No -> Show her tummy
Cause this year QUA was HN
HC was still top scoring QUA
She wish to be HC
The best they think of is “Alright, let show her tummy”
They’re punishing Hua because they can’t lewd her
Literally only Bio Fire
So she is just Bio Fire
And not beating HoF in Psy weather
She is not beating Sirin in Bio weather
Yea raw dmg doesn’t matter
That’s what she said
Is a filler valk
Hua of all things
She will be a filler valk

i think of Blue Buff
yea when i saw BB yesterday
hekipilled
they just don't fucking read any comic they created
like im not even kidding
the disrespect for comic characters are off the chart
it's as real as Genshin Impact 3rd
look how they treat him
1 of the most dangerous villian in the comic
like they don't have actors/actress full of charisma that can convince people that they're meant to play this roles anymore
after the Infinity Saga they just ran out of talents
in term of lowest opening week iirc
their new movie beat Morbius
<a:pepenarutorun:1081435087901556827>

It’s banter, if eli tell me he feel uncomfortable i would stop

Huoooh huoooh 😭
Gundam also seperate male Gundam and female Gundam

look at her <a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
still waiting for this peak waifu from Nikke
a literal brain <a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
check out this waifu
speaking of scifi
even HoR is just Madoka with a huge ass motorcycle behind her
SK is the only one that fit the mech type
and use a huge ass railgun
i wouldn't call her suit a mech one, she just put on a goggles
the only scifi part about Honkai is that it has someone speak science language and a fiction work
the only mech suit is SK <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<a:classic:1058849393370992650>
split numbers mean easier to replace later
but they always leave 1 door open for powercreep chance
if they want to make bleed support just make it all bleed multipliers
but i don't like split buffs
can you adapt to this
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
buff both lightning and physical
she is HF dlc
you guys got it wrong

How many lines are you gonna try?
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Are we really going to try 6 lines of lightning hit on LB
but probably SS1
hopefully the trigger
thots on pulling S0 4/4 LB?
<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492>
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
or
who is better
good rotation is not optimized rotation, that's why JK has her whole kit force into 1 combo if you have 4/4 JK
that's what 2023 valk is
do you know that JK's stig force her whole kit into 1 single combo beside ult effect
don't pretend like it won't
you already know her weapon will fixed it
ult only usable after combo
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
look at him go
just press shiny button
no one care a valk in 2023 gameplay
which is the most no one care part
this one is probably only post what matter as gameplay
her SP skills will just be increase buff numbers
there is nothing remotely interesting in her kit
no that's literally her kit
you press it
you see button light up
there is nothing to tldr
it make too much sense
you know what's wrong with these
imagine Veliona grabbing my balls with that one
you idiot
wtf
just type it out
which fucker even make an emote for W H <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
you moron

aight if nini think she is mid then she is probably broken
sonic's transportation
but it is what it is
so yea, suck to be a gacha game <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
and even with that there are still a lot of things that aren't shown in Luofu
so no time left for we to even know the story of each characters
it took them everything to even tell what is going on to fit in 3 patches schedule
cause world building of Luofu and the depth behind it are too much <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
<:Life:1089579344508223558>

Gresham need to start doing sth really quick
he was supposed to guide us to heaven
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
but aqua does
epi never change
yea there is no reason for her to not be Cross
she is either Lightning or Bleed
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
what is the pros for the players if she is Cross
alright serious question
unless it's a different model, probably no

oh i just count all the bosses that exist on paper

does this look right or no
Top score
-HN: Bleed Vill-V/Jelly/HoS/Whale

Mediorce score
-HN: Physical Jizo, QUA Crab/Lobster/Whale/Kosma
-Hare: Bleed HoS, Summoned Crusader, Physical Otto, Shieldbreak Kallen
oh i was talking about only their coverage, not how many time does their bosses show up
let me see <a:pepenarutorun:1081435087901556827>
i don't like LB design that much but her gameplay visual does look appealing
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
the opposite will happen with LB tho
but not her gameplay so too bad for me
i do like Hare design and her origin <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:Looking:1154847280529162260>

what else
oh, probably Summoned Sentinel Prime
<@370438895965306882> need backup
i zoned out and now i have no clue what i was writing
what are the other bosses people use Hare on
wait
Mediorce score
-HN: Physical Jizo, QUA Crab/Lobster/Whale/Kosma
-Hare: Bleed HoS, Summoned Crusader, Physical Otto
i couldn't have known HoT was stronger than HTF until Mihoyo shove a lot of BKE in my mouth
between her and HTF
because obviously people need to know HoT is the stronger one
so they only put BKE in 4.2
and HoT was the previous valk
oh it's Superstring just debut
would you look at that, 4.2 Abyss roulette
do you know which valk is the image of Abyss
cause she is BKE 2.0
if we include mediorce socre then Hare probably win
Top score
-HN: Bleed Vill-V/Jelly/HoS/Whale
-Hare: Physical Jizo, Summoned Aponia, Type DXY/HoS/SK ( for Type SK, only 490D+)
let me list HN and Hare bosses out, im curious too <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
but her boss frequency is even more than PE
ofc she has more bosses count cause she was released first
SW still keep her frequency of 1 boss per patch like HoH
it's the frequency
and they won't be dead anytime soon since Mihoyo introduce new type next
same goes for PE <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
Mhy does love SW
SW bosses show up kind of a lot ngl even tho she is supposed to be dead by now <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Boss count

-5.7: 1
-5.8: 1
-5.9: 1
-6.0: 0

Total: 15
sure <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
and HoH boss got reduced by 1
she literally has 2 new bosses
you will be surprised
if you count how much SW get used and how much HoH get used
she does tho
for no reason
SW outlive all of the ice dps in her gen
you know thinking discount valk = weak is kinda wrong right <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
SW outlive HoH
and discount S-rank valk mean nothing
she can't be the cracked CNY valk
she is Fire <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
what, why
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
i would lean on the former
7.2: discount S-rank Garuda Hua
7.3: S-rank Ice dps + free S-rank part 2 valk

or

7.2: S-rank part 2 valk
7.3: S-rank ice dps + free GH
listen listen
there are 2 scenario that can happen right now
7.3 will be Free Hua and S-rank gacha Vita
if they don't make 7.4 onward part 2 valks only
probably
cny yea
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
so AG can be anything but Ice dps
the slot for S-rank Stardust Ice dps already have someone
cause it's Ice Elf rotation this time
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Vita
the Ice dps slot for Stardust is already booked
she can be anything but Ice dps
she won't
cause it would pissed off Aladdin dupes puller
but she probably won't be Bleed SP <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
good one bro
what's there to explain
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
pull yourself together
you're playing too much Genshin nini
everyone look like S-rank
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
but im not even joking, Bleed SP might do more harm for LB than helping her against HN
if they want to be greedy then Bleed SP
honestly this time it's probably Lightning SP
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
so we need to exclude that option because it's Mihoyo
Stardust Lightning SP right?
what is the most logical specualation here
that one is probably from the story model
private beta just started
kit won't be here anytime soon
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
they need to catch up with SEA
only for NA and EU in the early day
this game work on the tightest schedule one can imagine so they will never go for the best design, they always go for the most logical design
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
just look at anni HoT artwork and her actual ingame model
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
i know it's hard to believe
because it's easier to draw than to make model
the dress <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
but the head and lower part are <:okk:1110244301184696360>
there are too much detail going in with her shirt and arm
you can ping the gang
alright
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
nothing pervert
oh it's just a step on me joke
Unless
Jk jk
I can be her shoes
i feel like her upper part have too many accessories <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
100% SP yea
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
she is SP
wdym might get AG
do you have better resolution <@503044914016419840> ? This one is too small, can't see any details  <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>

<a:howody:1143461710150250557>
Be honest
Is tooth fairy and easter bunny real or no
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
i just can't play Stardew Valley
it just depend on how comeptitive the game is for me
we only need to watch Mihoyo's part
like 6 hours long
it's an event
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
watch Murata Archon about to sacrifice herself for a fucking stranger she just met 1 month ago
that whether Stelle and goon being there or not isn't gonna change the outcome
like Star Rail is openly admit that fact
that is on his level or even better
and they have 6 others out there
like just Jing Yuan is already enough to solve the issue
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
Stelle and goon is only their to after Kafka
like Xiaozhu can still solve everything on their own
it's like the whole fucking Teyvat got stopped
like a beast
the whole world moving when she wake up
but everything is definitely centered around Lumine
not everything centered around Stelle
there is still a difference
they can write normal story when it doesn't include self insert
this is the future
we're gonna Genshin the Impact
good for you
like aight, good one bro
and dude literally said i would do what Joker did when it happened, he is me
i got into an argument before with someone in maincord about self insert
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
saving the world, sleep with girls
like good one bro, i know for sure when apocalypse come, you will definitely become Him
to create delusion of choices for their audiences
but the game itself has to make him a self insert
Joker is literally his fucking character
like in Persona 5
can become Him
because they feel like they can become soneone else
Genshin has the worst self insert ever because they're just not used to writing it
and traveler is just an audience of her journey
the protag should have been Amber
for no fucking reason
i just don't like how everything is centered around traveler when the country itself can solve it fine
using the power of Justice and Genshin Impact
but the problem is how they are gonna solve it
a pathetic and bratty Archon is cool can't lie
they should have copied Syuen for Furina
but not this way
a pathetic Archon i guess is kinda new
god this is so lame
remember last time something cool happened in Star Rail?
stop lying to yourself guys
Furina will become the real Archon after the story end anw
ngl this is Genshin
will that work
what if they drown her
that's all i got from twitter
she doesn't have the blessing of Celestial <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
and the reason why Furina is weak because she is not an official Archon
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
they want to take away her power, some sources say that Neuv might become the hydro archon
public execution by burning her to death
she was French's hero but after she help ending the war, the king of France kill her in order to please the English
she got public executed
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
but the most important detail is that in 4.2 they pull a Jeanne D Arc on Furina
oh not that big, he just didn't want to send it in 1 go and have to comment on every piece of information he knew
not a proper leak
it's like a dude talking to himself
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
i just saw the story leak
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>

god will give you some signs, no?
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
just tell the criminal to kill themselves

<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
What’s wrong with QK animation, i don’t pay enough attention to her
so Sunny and LB stance both look awkward
might be prepare for engine upgrade also
they're making new models and want to use it to test out new stuffs
testing new model interaction honestly <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
but never making it to the game
Mihoyo's designs are only avg or slightly above avg at best, only the draft designs have a sense of unique
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
in a sense it just lack the uniqueness
yea the designs are honestly only cute, not amazing or anything
made an even to shrink her to the below pic  <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
appreciate the design for a moment and then forget about it for another 6 weeks
to see if it's good or not
i only like check their twitter every 6 weeks for new character <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
they do have some good designs, the only reason why i still check out the game once in a while <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
i don't care about the game that much either <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
good design but weird fetish <a:NopeNope:1045725686834401300>
what's the deal with making everyone a minor
honestly part of the reaons why i don't like BA that much, they made mature looking characters and then mark her as 17 or ??? <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
not if you round it up
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
Than others
Like they’re closer to 18
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>

Alright i got one <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>

<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
you're being too strict
some of them
well at least they look mature <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
from 9 to 18
at least the age is variety tho
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
they made an event that she turn back into children
the only character that is canonically above 18
not even 1 yea
just straight up 100%
not even 90%
and like 100% of all the students want to ride you
like it's full capital
and the goverment are made of ADULTS
oh it's like a whole district full of minors

Real question now
Reveal is in 5 hours 13 mins
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
But human ego are too fragile to let them realize it
People acting like every patch is a must pull but it’s their gambling addiction instead
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
If you want skip patch you need to fix your gambling addiction
So what valks were powercreep like hell
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
And there is no Garuda Hua
There is no easter bunny
There is no tooth fairy
it's time to wake up
Tet is still dreaming

<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
it's best to not go back to Honkai
after what you tried to do on the dude in WFP account
i mean no flame but
That’s how we roll
And bring home the treasure
Sail the sea Tet
But i won’t be a part of it
TC might be Her

And i like <:PotFriend:947188517153439784>
What’s up
Why
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
Will she do this tho
TP on my nuts
Honkai need to have a collab with Genshin 2 and bring Her to Honkai
The only thing that make sense rn is Kafka is Her
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
How sure are we that it’s not a shitpost someone made up?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
But bleed  is physical dmg
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
How can you be bleed dps and lightning support
Slow down with this
Why does Eli not believe it
Can’t see anything wrong with that
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
Now help me catching up with the news
Sure man
What’s up nerds
And there is no french
There is bo easter bunny
There is no tooth fairy
Did Jayson actually just post something new and asked “chat is this real”
Biden?
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>

<:ApuShrug:986764322430673057>
Big bro and lil bro?
Why is your <:shruge:1079371164159311982> look different tho
:godge:
Rules are my words
There is
Teri combo with PV
GD will still die
Lowkey tho
<:gayge:1017439025742753802>
*breach
If Teri has breast then probably replace HTR
Trickster
It was you
Thots?
Aatrox 2 on 7
You know what doesn’t sound right
Be more specific
You idiot
Just like your gender
isn't that Fate
wait why
not interest
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
let me find out who that is
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
need variety people
no one like a game with only mature models
when Eli get one
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>

<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
that's terrible
or no
will Griseo grow up
real question
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
But you still got no bitch from max spending
Should be DA
careful with your ass
is this an info you supposed to mass ping?
And bring home the treasure
Go sail the sea and bait the idiots Tet
What the fuck are you even spitting
Their ideas
They’re immortal
No
No
Stephen King’s novels have more scary scenes than that and they’re for kid above 6
GSR is like 8 or 9
hi3 is PG13
Lower than HI3
But zoomers refuse to use normal word
It’s charisma
For no reason
They keep making new characters
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Why does Mihoyo stopped adding variant of 1 character anw
But will there upgrade beat Kafka
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
Like Summer Kafka?
Be honest
Will Mihobo ever release someone better than Kafka or no
serious question
Alright chat
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
Should have SSS Kafka
Because
No
Where is the ass
What
Skipaz
Pull Guinafen to support Kafka
Sound like a skip
I’ll allow it
Mid
Be honest
Can she beat Kafka or no
<:Clueless:947671183103508530>
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
Nini still think someone can beat Her
keep pulling mid characters
probably nini's fault
that is true
embarassing
10 new characters and only good one is Kafka
they realized players can't play the game with all the mid characters
be honest
are you trying to cook
1 second faster clearing Abyss
replace for what
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
order is what i said
no i do
im not allow it
because
no
that's what all the idiots said
you idiot
the cross
we already saw it
she is a Theresa
she uses a cross
<a:Segz:924258302697820201>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
but no one said that irl
Bi can be called nitouryu
it's a misunderstanding
i know that one
why is your omegalul like that
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Witch = burn to death
it's cause other Knights sentenced her as a witch and blamed her for using charm on Lancelot
can't blame Arthur tho, imagine the Queen of Britain prefer to be with 1 of the Knights intead of the King <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
there are many versions about it but the one that center around their relationship was that they deeply in love with each other but then the Knights and Arthur found out, wanting to capture them but only managed to capture Guinevere and let Lancelot escaped. Arthur wanted to burn Guinevere to death for her betrayal but Lancelot and his army saved her. That moment created the conflict inside the Knights and later on the fall of Britain, Arthur was later killed my Mordred
she is the Queen of Great Britain, the wife of king Arthur <:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
it mean Silver
Argenti is a Latin's name that being used by French and Italian
i mean ofc you wouldn't
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
and they might be lover too
maybe in Space Inazuma we will have Ruby and Aqua reference
maybe Mihoyo is cooking
 sis i like to be this guy that want to fuck you 
tha'ts worse
but isn't making Lancelot as Guinevere's siblinbg kinda fucked up?
hak's google suggested him a fucking episode of Ly Myreur Des Histors
she didn't
what kind of google filter you're using that it suggested you an episode of Ly Myreur Des Histors
Chinese Yoimiya
Or used to belong
No info on who it is belong yet
I mean actually empty
The 10th seat somehow is empty
Ranking rn look like this:
0) Pierro
1) Capitano
2) Dottore
3) Columbina
4) Arlecchino
5) Pulcinella
6) Scaramouche
7) Sandrone
8) Ashes 
9) Pantalone
10) 
11) Tartaglia
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Yea that’s why Arlecchino will have a sad backstory then become friend with traveler
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
It mean she is too strong for our retard traveler to handle
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
Too strong to be a villian
She will become the good guy anytime now
It’s fucked
She is 4th?
me
ahahahaha
it used to be
S0 won't be able to beat SSS HN
if she is Bleed dps it's the same as sentence her to death
world best male and female actor
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
bro think we're him
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
and we paid the price
3 is us
and the 2nd is Ferryman
1 is the one that is with Bronnie, Delta, FR
there are 2 useful captains out there
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
captainverse haven't reran Ferryman part since nini start playing
he is him
<a:gigachad:1090865071321776159>
the one that touching her is Ferryman
we're the useless pos in Ai-chan's universe
it's not us
<a:mhm:1088510781756276756>
I mean in term of the way they try to emphasize it
Even Aponia is not that <a:Booba:1081435431540903936>
The area around her chest, they make way too much space for that part
Tericula is the only one they need to emphasize her breasts are that huge
Also of 3 characters that got big honkers from their small version
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
They didn’t do it with Eden or Aponia but they do for Tericula
I just think they cut off the part around her chest to make sure playerbase know she has big honkers is funny
Oh i don’t mind her big honkers
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
She dresses like a whore
Cause that’s the era most vampire’s setup used
In term of Victorian theme
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
A person is smart, human are dumb
The problem is that human’s nature are “ dumb “, they are easily being manipulated by a single idea to decide on good or bad
That’s as far as Hoyo’s fan can think of
Corpse can’t grow up
She is dead
That is true
Oh they will probably use the same base model for Adult Teri ngl unless she remain 12
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Why doea Clara need adult model
That’s horrible
chill
bro no one care
she revived and chose the body type that captain like
it's probably captain's taste honestly
<a:Booba:1081435431540903936>
from the side it's the only thing you can see
but you actually have to pay attention to it
only look <a:Booba:1081435431540903936> from the side
it look normal upfront
people will actually send truck to the HQ
can't fuck it up
oh Kallen use the same model with Kiana
they make a new model to put <:BOOBA:1009042663825219666>  on TC
this one is probably new model
this angle it look huge
What happened to her chest area
probably a manga/anime/game with Alucard related
her weapons are probably just the coolest stuff devs thought of by the time they were working on it <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
come a full circle
now people are going back to playing anime-style MMOs
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
so no more anime-style MMOs for a while
later on technology explode and Vindictus, WoW, Guild Wars showing up
i think i growing up with Maplestory, Grandchase, Elsword, Dragon Nest, Dragonica, Ragnarok Online, etc...
compare to Maplestory and Elsword
Grandchase was the goated honestly
they don't even try to hide their intention to milk money
elsword is just so fucking bad
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
i grew up with Korean MMOs and Western MMOs so HI3 to me is just a chump change compare to the real cash drain
a valk can live from 1 year min to 2 years max is actually a miracle if they're trying to milk more cash
unless HI3 is the 1st game you ever play (that's quite depressing) then HI3 is on the tamed side of powercreep
move along with it
it's just how competitive system work
that's just the natural of competitive gacha
when real valks start showing up she lost in 3 days
her competitors were straight up trash valks
her competitors were NS, LK, BN
she was competing with trash
but not because she was actually cracked
real players use HoV because she was the strongest valk at that time
that age is nothing but circle jerking
also AE was alreaady got replaced by half of the SP valks before HTR even coming
no she didn't
did you also expect for HoV to still be top pick
you guys are playing competitive gacha
what does that even mean
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
why, so you can rub one off?
Genshin Pom-pom
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
Eli asked about 5* selector, not 3*
<:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
does people really exciting to hop from Genshin 1 to Genshin 2
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
no amount of pulls can compare to how worth that wings are
hey, a pair of wings worth infinite
make up emote?
<a:xddinside:1004308940835799060>
<:ICANT:921403877285306399> ?
soon it will be midhil
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
they will probably end up mid
if nini like a character
here is the catch
Dhil is QQ without being trainwashed
she'll be 3 star Hu Tao
you should change your name to mimi too nini, to fit with midyuan
midyuan and midwallpaper <:OkayChamp:1088507397762453655>
Schrodinger’s gender
Where is the tldr? <a:DinkDonk:1060958068709535854> <:whip:1090806260540129330>

Genshin will never have more than 4 skins a year
even when hell freeze over
what's the hold up
then get one
eventually they will stop doing it
<:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
and not the other 2
rn if you mentioned Honkai it's Honkai Star Rail
oh it's a given
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
too cool
and then she is just a sleepy head
everything about Kokomi are dragon related <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
you guys should learn sth by now
bro it have been 4 years
So trying to piss off the Yakuza is not something Cygames want
Those that left behind amazing legacy before they retired
And there are some legendary horses that are used in Uma’s scenarios
And they don’t want to see the lewd image of their favorite horses
70% of top racing horses in JP are owned by Yakuza
And they were never heard again
There used to be some artists tried to draw Uma’s lewd pic
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
Like Uma Musume
Involving with the Yakuza or the Triads mean your bodies on the river next day
Yea it does
It might bring up unecessary problems
Yea they don’t
they usually need to design about 16-20 models a year
and they usually not release only 1
5-6 weeks for a design is mental exhausting
the problem with Mihoyo in general is that to catch up with the deadline, a model and design must not include weird physic interactions and long skirt
nini
that emoji has always been gross
<:worryFeet:887143086046720071>
the color is fine, there are just not enough details on her armor to make it look more stand out as an armor
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
that's kinda original
and totally not APHO Mei?
people start having weird expectations when they think of a character as another character expy
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
and not actually taking it seriously
i really thought people were joking when they said about expy
the most Mei is Mei herself
Same for Tsaritsa, Seele died, Bonya went rouge
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
Genshin doesn’t have Mei, she is dead in Genshin version, that’s why Kiana went rouge
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
That’s a you problem
what part of her resemble Mei?
yea here is some motivation
<:BatChest:1087075069139898528> ?
I will be there no matter what
bro think he is him
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>

so they spend a lil bit of cash to get Eva HoR rerun in 6.9

same reason why Eva HoR never rerun ever since 4.5

then they will come up with more dumb excuses

APHO 3 will be a mess tho

but she doesn't know you
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
wait what, the fact that her hair is Rapunzel's long is not enough for everyone to think it's Sirin or what?
he kicked the kids
if you keep reposting it long enough eventually it will become real
cause the people in it are fixed
when 6.8 is live then 6.9 beta is started
they started it way sooner
the real beta is private
you're thinking of public beta
ofc, beta always started at the start of new patch
6.9 beta is already started
the soonest we get reliable info will be next week
not reliable
and for fun
which 99% of the time is meaningless

yea it's for TC

look competitive
you're a 4*
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
they keep his gender
especially in exploration
that many layers of clothes is hell to work with
i mean it's kinda obvious they won't go with that design <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
<:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
players can't handle that
that will make the game too competitive
the author doesn't have the balls to go all the way
yea i think so
so they're not related by blood during the final arc
author chicken out last minute tho

For their 2nd anni
This is kinda crossing the line tho, maybe those were meant to be in Genshin Artbook Vol.1
Be careful
1gn on twt might also contain 800mb of Nahida’s feet
With their employee name
Even Mihoyo’s sign is there
This one is a big yike tho
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
When they make fun of Mihobo all the time
Yea but the problem is that they never dare to post it
They make fun of Mihobo all the time
The big leakers of Genshin never post it
Why does whenever it come to leak that might send them to jail

Yea you can use Sirin in the event

did you just post an image and ask everyone  is this real  ?
it's for SEA

so he will shut down Apollo on June 30th
according to their CEO
Apollo is charged 20M$ a year
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
the bots to manage all the comments so people can't post dumb shit
and it cost 10 3S valk
you need to use their official one
for big subreddit, you can't use outside tools and bots anymore
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
r/manga is still online, that's enough

Domain Expansion ? Like the hit manga Jujutsu Kaisen ?
then it mean physical is getting their version of HoH
if there is any reason why her sp cost is this high
250 cost mean nothing, her weapon will regen 200 sp on active
not TF
oh im pretty sure it mean the field last 40 seconds
Ult 2 is overlap it with 75%
Ult 1 is creating a field with 50% impair
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
yea but i thought we're already done with this niche situation, guess not  <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
no shot HoS has 75% on both
no it's definitely 50%
can't remember
or is it the spear <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
no the chain is only 50%
but obviously you want to use Ult 2
it's 50% if you don't use Ult 2
<a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
any knowers know why she has 50% impair for fun
the last villian they kill will remain to be Signora, no shot they have balls to kill any others
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<:smoothbrain:1114520186280751175>
HoR, HoS ? <:smoothbrain:1114520186280751175>
the sp cost of ult mean literally nothing for modern valk, ofc they will have sth to make sure you can ult every rot or every other rot <:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
yea if JK need 500 her current regen will also not enough
 what if JK has 125 sp regen but she need 300 sp to ult  is what you're asking
weapon and stig are a part of a valk in modern standard
and if JK doesn't have her weapon, she is dogshit
that's the weirdest example ever
<:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
You do know that HoS sp regen is high right ?
<a:modcheck:870823155344756746>

On the market rn JP gacha are getting replaced by CN/KR gacha cause not everyone can be a millionaire
CN gacha is just a way to sell product while the company gain the most profit possible
JP gacha at the core of it all is the true gacha
That game require 10 times the cost of Honkai to be competitive
Mihoyo schedule is actually mental
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
The JP gacha game that have actual models only release new contents/characters every 3 months
Less work and more time for lewd arts
Isn’t that also why Japan only make chibi gacha
I allow it <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
A lot of good designs didn’t get selected because they wouldn’t make it in time for each patch
No fabric, no physics
No need to work on models and motions
cause it’s art only
I mean yea ofc their design slap
So any complain like “ it should have been different “ is just wrong
But the theme is correct
Whether it have room to improve or not doesn’t matter, some people like it, some people don’t
It should have been her default skin
Her uniform is better <:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
While 100% wrong
Most of the time people bitch for the sake of bitching
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
The only correct complain are Susannah
Theme wise it can’t be help to have the same color pallete for Elysia and Trio <:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
Herrscher of Death has both Life and Death power anw, she can be any color she want
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
Deadweight too
<:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
The MOBA spinoff is too popular
As long as your tittle have Challenger in it
And to think that you can avg 2k easily if you stream League
Maybe he could do it with set 9 tho
Yea avg 4k for T-game actually take a lot of effort <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
But he can only get that numbers when big bro isn’t online
Yea but if you want to get a better contract from orgs you need to avg 4k no matter what
The rest are from big bro viewerbase
I think his loyal viewerbase is only around 1500 to 2000
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Only when big bro is taking a break
TL new contract nego didn’t go well so he had to leave TL
So next time an org sign with him, he could get a better contract
Trying to become a big name in TFT
He already add set 9 comp
Open the TFT’s bible <@148145559897636865>

You press her 2nd combo
You don’t press weapon active with GC dumbo
Dw i got you, if she is a support here is her gameplay : QTE - weapon - ult
Your face is weird <:ok:1088133019455467560>
Yea ice husk is for Kira
Sushang, Elysia, Kalpas, Ice Husk and the rerun of 10 other Husks <:ok:1088133019455467560>
Especially when it come to HoT and HoF
Damage in MA is the 2nd thing that matter
That is not matter
Compare to last year, Bio have gotten a lot of bosses now
Lack of bosses, that’s why they’re making new bosses to let Bio be more useful
Too many works just for her to be Psy
So that people can’t run HoF
And big ignite trauma
Her SSS boss will have to have Phsyical/lightning/ice resistance
Meta wise there is also no reason for her to be Psy, it will make the SSS designed for her being difficult
That’s why she won’t be Psy
There is no chance HoF lose to Psy fire valk, especially WT valk <:ok:1088133019455467560>

So that her best team could be WS SI GC
A QUA Physical dps that can impair on her own
But
WS isn’t HoS 2.0
What if
Alright
<a:Yeehaw:999641827080675400>

maybe it will be alongside with White Seele tho
oh right it's physical elf next rotation
white Seele in 6.8, red Seele in 6.9
maybe it will be Seele back to back <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>

it was SP -> discount -> standard
you remember wrong keilo
Seele is 100% discount, trust me <:ok:1088133019455467560>

unless they introduce APHO 3 in 6.8
no more candidate for 6.9 <:ok:1088133019455467560>
i can guarantee that much
100% <:ok:1088133019455467560>

No flame tho
Or bad at the game
If you think everything are a must pull then it mean you’re addicted to gambling
Also no hard feeling
To fit the theme
Do i need to act surprise too
Is this some kind of a conspiracy or sth
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Why are you guys acting surprise when it was already that way since 5.0
They should make Kira farmable
You know what they should do
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
Yea not like Kira is free or anything
Skip both genius <:ok:1088133019455467560>

HTR is actually beast ice dps now <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
The problem with QUA dps in general is that Mihoyo never allow them to be beast on their elemental weather
But QUA dps is kinda <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
If it is HoS replacement i don’t mind to spend 200 pulls on her
<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
Still have to spend 200 pulls for QUA dps
This is so bad tho
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>

Yea probably a bad pick, even with PE back then you still need to meet some stats requirement for her cap
just thing of Honkai like a side game, play when you want to, not when you need to
don't stress it out tho
yea, it happened <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
MPE cap is 47.554
and no, it's not 10 times harder with MPE if all you need is 46.800
or try to improve
better stop thinking about it
it's hard to hear but if you can't 46.800 with MPE, chance is that you either have skill issue or you just don't want to play the game anymore
even the Susannah's boss
you can still clear all bosses without that said unit
you just lost the interest in the game, that's all
like i get that not everyone is competitive but no reason to pretend that the game only start to change recently, Honkai ever since ER patch have always been about shilling <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
try to fight FGO with anything but PE and you have to mald 10 times harder for lower cap
ever since 5.1
Honkai have been that way for more than 1 year
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>

they can see my blade instead <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
what about Sep 11th
<a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
not HSR
that is in Honkai main ver tho <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
only took part in killing Hua <:ok:1088133019455467560>
you need the role to chat in this channel <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
ping again and you die
:piratege:
who the fuck ping for your fetish
?
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
maybe me, maybe gresham, maybe eli
probably someone discussing leak again then ?
why did carv leave server again ?
how about you check this out <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
she appears to investigate on the abnormal signal from deez nuts
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
so yea a lance
look like gun-lance
that look like Diluc and Ana
oh it's the 2 people in the trailer
<:TeriHeadpat:987375761155575841>
Yea with her popularity in CN she’s a bigger seller
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Vill-V was also a W H <:omegalul:1030461063197626409> before her backstory kick in
And then Seele in Herrscher of the year spot
Slightly stronger with S2 and cracked with SS0
And make S0 AT giving the same buff as S0 HoS
If i were in Mihoyo’s shoes i would put AT as discount valk
Yea it encourage people to spend more on a sleep patch
In CN Teri is more popular than Seele
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I wonder if putting AT or WS in Vill-V spot like last year will get them more profit
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Actually cracked
Btw this can score 39.920!
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Haha weird bug
My favorite bug is when my SS Nyx can’t deal any damage
She is hard to play due to all the bugs
Senti is braindead
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
So in next 2 patches if you want to pull sth then the prior is gonna be : Trigger > Prometheus >>> Susanah >>>>>>> Hare
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
Unless she has some insane combination with Prometheus
I think in term of being skippable, Hare > Susanah
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
Herrscher of The Bonya
HTB is kinda lit
not on my watch
ever
there won't be 4 letters battlesuit name
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
the only difference is that instead of giving refund supply for GD, they give you guaranted weapon in 50 pulls and extra tickets to farm mirage
that's about what GD needed too
if you think about it
50 pulls weapon banner too
White Seele
but yea, im like 80% sure that will be the schedule
maybe they can swap between AT and WS
.
front to back ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
when they spam the hell out of shieldbreak
maybe only during 5.3
i actually never think SnS as a support tbh
new gen physical are degisn for 470+D
yea, HN is the sign
their dps are not designed for 470+D
it's their dps options that suck
like no joke, physical currently have the most cracked head multiplier of all teams and well distributed too
an SP that can beat Cezanne will be a disaster
her gears and stuffs
do we even have Prometheus numbers yet ?
Adult Teri
she is a preview for AT
GC won't replace SI
heki would put 29 pulls in and stop for SP supply
if you're Heki everything is a skip
there is one reason
that's what your mom said
crit bald is a feature of physical
the shield timing will be off
also if any of her QTE don't crit
more than 5 hit that don't crit and you failed to kill zombie
if you use her on Type SK
crit bald with MPE can also go really bad
that's what make DiP a bait
they use SS+ HoT
but no one gonna compete with DiP using S0 HoT
S0 DiP beat S0 HoT anytime in her weather
it's the same principle with HoT vs DiP
it's not that way
which is almost impossible
S0 Hare need to beat SS0 BKE
yea S0 BKE is like non-existent
but i actually just can't see her beating ranked BKE
then Hare win on physical/type weather
like maybe S0 BKE vs S0 Hare
i actually can't see it
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
AF deal like 10 morbillion damage
good luck beating BKE on normal weather
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
either Ice or Lightning
wonder what element will Alvitr be tho
get yourself together Tet
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
her bosses will be Bio
Hare is Mech
if you don't pull Hare then SSS SnS is your only way to clear her weather
you should still SSS your SnS
Adult Teri and Honkai Nilou
as of now GD is a burden to lightning
could be GD
or GD
100% RC
im so impressed rn
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
then also Kallen
HN boss and Hare boss
imagine MA week
because HN still need them
Grucio and HoS still won't die after AT and Prometheus are out
here is the best part
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
they're getting better at creating valks and meta
yea that's like really really smart
just have the exact same buff but don't need a shield to apply it off-field
AT doesn't need to be better than HoS
and they found a really creative way to do it
yea HoS is kicking the bucket soon
that is true <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
they don't have the intention to do that either, all her summon entities only count as 1
don't think so
Cross is summoned entity
any physical team work on her weather as long as Si is in your team
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
but old gen valks can still find the leeway around it
kinda creative tho, they managed to dish out 3 types of new weather that only new gen valk can be broken
that sound kinda sick if the animation match with what i have in mind rn
cool bro but where is the broken part
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
That Dehya ?
Dehya, the Lion of the West ?
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
I don’t want to farm another set
Can she use Kokomi’s artifact tho
So she want HP stats ?
Hare new MC confirmed ?
Like Kiana <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
Is her kit broken or no
But i only read that much
Yea but as of now only she has it
Like Bleed and Ignite
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
The entities dmg is consider her dmg
It’s the strong part for herself
And im not sure how much broken it will be compare to just using Griseo and SnS
But only on her own weather
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
Yea she is broken on her own weather
Oh wait i missed the first half of her weather
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
Azir from League of Legends ?
Same spot with HN
Just read it and you will see why
Her weather is literally not giving her any advantage at all
She sucks
I only need to read the weather to know if she suck or not
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
<@370438895965306882> <@416445660443967491>

Holy fuck
<a:aworryFlashbang:897712369843716126>
I almost choke myself reading her desc
Give me tldr
<@148145559897636865> it’s your time
So many words
Holy fuck
<:DK:840944972383780874>
I will answer it when she is out if i still remember about it
<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
back to TFT, ping me when we have GC kit
they will all end up in the same spot
this schedule is nothing special, just pick whoever you like
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
she will soon die in 6.7
yea it's a bad thing
as White as American
new Seele is meant to be White
her weapon is White Flower
for the game itself they let AI do the job
they put more effort into advertising than balancing the game
it's Mihoyo
just depend on your taste
every trailers are a banger
not being useful for 3 years straight ?
fixed
i forgot Seele
oh wait
6.6 : Hare + Prometheus 
6.7 : Alvitr
6.8 : Seele
6.9 : Adult Teri
7.0 : Hua
let map this out
probably Alvitr tho
your mom
lmao
Vill - V = Seele 
HoH = Adult Teri 
JK = Hua
Hua will be the farmable valk lmao
oh wow i just realized 1 thing
Aponia + Eden -> Griseo -> Vill-V
literally the same last year
also next patch after Hare is another SP
what are you guys talking about
it's literally the same as Aponia and Eden
literally every single old valks have random status on their kits
every old valks have that
Super Gravity <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
don't try to steal that spot
im trying to be the dumb one here for fun
heki
as long as enemies are in range
even if you fail to block it, it will automatically trigger after 0.5s
on HoO it's also not matter
you guys are terrible at giving examples
yea it's not what HoO weapon is
that's kinda pog
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
so what the hell is that
but im not
i want to pretend that im one of the player who read
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
she doesn't need to topscore Bio Bosses
it's all that matter
as long as Prometheus's bosses top score is Hare
yea lmao
alright, what the hell is that
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
she will need to beat SSS SnS at S0
that is kinda a bad news tho
look like a normal mech dps
does not look like she will form a combo with Prometheus also
my mom lost a 50/50 to me instead of Ryan Gosling <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
look like your mom when she lost 50/50 to you
it have always been like that
it's just compensation for double gacha valks
there is no such thing as quick or slow
or else Handel will also have refund supply
the only reason why GD didn't have refund supply was because her stig are farmable
are you dumb ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>

Danzai
It was supposed to be DS new support set but they decided not to
It got removed and we got Shuijng instead
It’s Liebig
literally no one can confirm if that proof is fake or not
leakers be like :  guys, that dude is lying, i have proof 
a what now
:oldjj:
i can't age, i just want to look old
Madam Ping playable will be her going back to her youth and be like
only leave the playable model alive
they killed all the variances offscreen tho
god forbid them to make the 5th skin in the same year
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
we're talking about a game release 4 skins per year
that's too much work
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
it's a real weapon <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Oh wait LK
It’s a box for various weapon
Cause Judah is not exactly a weapon <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
New weapon don’t  mean shit in Honkai
try to deny this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
that's broken
look like your mom
bella these nuts ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
I met those kind of calc a lot back then
All calc make sense when you skewed the conditions
That sound like “ in 0.5 second window when Eula’s sword explode her dps is the highest in the game “
did anyone ask for it ?
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Ignite dps
To top it all
She will look like 2023 valk
I can’t <:ICANT:921403877285306399>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
With the current flow then 
6.6 - Teri 
6.7 - Hua
6.8 or 6.9 - Seele
Teri = HoS 2.0
Seele = QUA Physical
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Genshin <:KyaruYikes:702989593661800559>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>

what's the context ?
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Buy this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>

<:dongerk:1061701790640373861>
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
the dude is confuse her with main timeline Ai-chan
no, her existence is just that
refusing to read but insisting on yapping
average Honkai player <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
but you can't change this one <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
time for Susanah to become trash
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Zhongli speak purely in ancient Chinese
like how Zhongli talk to be more specific
like way back in the 1500s
it's ancient Chinese
because the dude don't even know the word exist
i even have to ask my friend to ask his grandpa to know some words some time playing Honkai <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
that without context you literally can't tell what the heck it is
Mihoyo writters use so fucking much ancient Chinese
because i can find at least 100 wrong translations coming from 0 context
i know 1 thing that En translations are done by 
>Give translators the source
>Refuse to give context
>Get the raw translation and post it to the game
they don't
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i use Vietnamese or Chinese to learn the language
yea i don't use English when playing story so i don't know if it's bad or not
i don't think it's hard to understasnd the principle behind Project STIGMA or Bronya's power but when they put in some metaphor it confuse people <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
cause due to metaphor most of the time
but i can understand why some people find it hard
i don't have any problem with understand it cause this is like High School level knowledge at best
for this last act they use a lot of complicated words and metaphors
i think the main reason why people are so vocally this act is because they struggling to understand it
when i struggling to find who asked
because people that hate it like to shout it to other faces
do you know why you think everyone hate it ?
are you downloading the wrong game for 6 years ?
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
and now you complaining about power of friendship
the whole game is about united to go against the odds
power of friendship <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
i don't think 100% people like The Last Of Us either but the show is still a hit
literally W H <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
shit ton of work on Friday for no reason
back to work and rewatch act 2 later <:bejj:1067071810853679194>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but for some reason most people i see assume the opposite
the reason why Time Runner look like Finality is because it's its role
Time Runner is the hint of HFI
the name itself already hint that it's the other way around
why do everyone think HFI is copy paste of Time Runner ?
Also CN community do the same
When both communities are dumb equally
It’s still shock me how usually Western players always refer to everything as “ I can’t believe CN players do this “
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
It’s the reason that is different
Yea, the complains are pretty much the same
But people shouldn’t mark other opinions as invalid because it’s go against their own
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
It’s just human in general, every human think differently from others
A lot of Western players also complain like that
But at the end of the day it’s for the devs to decide it
They think that X character should act and wear like they think
It’s relate to normal human behavior about creating an image of a character in your head
Kinda cringe if you ask me
But they speak in regard of Chinese culture
Because Western does not understand the culture behind China at all
GLb complain is even worse
Western or Eastern
Because human are dumb in general
That’s kinda racist
It’s CN Ai-Chan
<a:KyaruSMH:665062713076088848>
“ I saw the born of Origin and Finality and the fall of Deliverance “ - Ai Chan
She has been leaking the future since chapter 32
Ai-chan is literally just a walking leaker tho
They already explained it
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
They’re not kissing <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
Kiana kill Mei after that scene
Ideally a completed story with mysterious vibe sell more than the on-going one
It’s the same case with Nikke rn, the shroud of mystery about the 1st Squad is more interesting than the current one
PE is cool because they have actual villians
Need new story to sell new toys that will appear out of thin air
So you can’t sell shit
They already have established villians
Problem with that is that
She was supposed to be the big bad of ER
Nah, it’s not her OG purpose
But oh well
Ely could have been the 2nd playable villian
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I don’t dislike the retcon of Kevin or Ely but it’s kind of a miss opportunity
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
Like after Mei joined WS, Jackal did a great amount of experiments on her
The supposed OG purpose was to have all the cores being able to put in use when he or Jackal need it for experiments
Actually emote from the 90s
is that the legit summon from the court ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>

they force the lore to change for fun
so fucking sad
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
QUA boss but Bleed weather
i mean yea that will be the gist
Susanah serve no purpose
Seele is QUA Physical anw
yea i don't get this part
the new boss is for her to dps not to support anyone
SP QUA dps
she is dps
they force her to be SP
ain't no way
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
but just wait 3 more hours
i won't say that is baseless because she does look like 1
Im gonna snap your neck instead
<a:KyaruSMH:665062713076088848>
Not even an original one
HFI and HoO’s complain were terrible
Yea they’re funny to read when they actually complain about sth make sense
3 more hours to find out if Mihoyo want to piss of CN playerbase again
Mihoyo better not make a new event just for SP Susanah
yea last month they made the same with HoH patch
wtf
it actually net them more money
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
as time went by she will look exactly like Kallen
it's that she was just unlocked the Vishnu genes
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
her mature model is just Kiana or Kallen
i mean she is physically can't be like Aponia or Eden
cope this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
Fire, QUA and HoS 2.0
i don't think that's how it work buddy
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
Senti vs Kevin
all of the event with her appearances until now are all main timeline
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
yea still main timeline
let me check again the event which she wear bear hoodie <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
Event Susanah is the main timeline Susanah
that's why Raven is A-rank
SP can only be valks that belong to other worlds, in the past, in the future
current timeline valk can't be SP
unless they want to break the rule
it can't be SP
she just lack confidence in herself
she is cracked
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
Susanah has to be A-rank unless they break the rule for her to be SP
im more curious if Mihoyo will break the rule tonight or not
8
Susanah look like A-rank dps
unless
won't be Herrscher
prediction for next year <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
6.5 : A-rank Susanah
6.6 : Mech physical Hare
6.7 : Random SP + Teri 2.0
6.8 : Timido SP
6.9 : QUA Seele
7.0 : WT Bio Fire Hua + G4 Fire
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Timido will also be 1 of the SP valks in 2023
<:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>  ?
it's 4 S-rank that can be spread out for a whole year
don't expect them to be release anytime soon tho
Fu Hua is definitely Bio Fire
square this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
im gonna slay you instead
QUA Herrscher of the summer
Teri can be HoS replacement
Fu Hua is definitely S-rank Fire dps with G4 Fire
4 S-rank in the waiting list
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Fu Hua, Teri and Seele new suit
<:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
<@416445660443967491> <@148145559897636865>
Hare will come in 6.6
yea only Susanah
yea bleed damage is too lit in this game that you need to increase it off field
Susannah this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
looking like A-rank dps tho
they will need to break the rule if they want to make her SP valk
And the T100 in Chinese gacha ranking make millions per year
Fyi, you only need to get 40k-50k per month for a normal gacha to bring profit
Yea, gacha are the way to go nowaday, you must be hit in the head to not make a mobile gacha
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
Surely designing 2 costumes can’t be harder than designing a whole region
But what’s wrong with 2 costumes every 6 months tho
They didn’t bring Botw mechanic to genshin, not 100% at least
Cause what make BOTW exploration read while just being Mondstadt and Liyue are ingame mechanic
Only starting from Inazuma they started to adjust their own read on new mechanic
All the mechanic and stuffs
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Cause they literally copied 1st and 2nd regions of BOTW
I mean that is to be expected tho
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i mean yea Mond is beginner town and Liyue is where you learn how to play the game
new mechanic, stuffs
exploration is still fun yea
i mean people only complain about Inazuma Main Story tho <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
so that they can lower the expectation
i feel like Inazuma being bad was intentional
literally answer none unless you don't explore Enka
people be like  OMG Sumeru answered ton of questions that other 3 couldn't 
just more questions
we still don't have answer to anything
yea Nigguang was the only sane person in Genshin
if i got a vision i would sell it on Ebay
and they use it to protect cabbage
Inazuma have like 10 NPC with visions
Rana this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
she live with her resolve till last moment
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Rosa died because she didn't need to be save
so Mihoyo can kill 2 evil characters in 1 region
her and Marionette will be the one in charge of Fontaine
yea this one
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
the Senti wannabe
so does Marionette
Arlecchino will also become a Tsun
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
they still save him
Scara doesn't need to be saved
they just bitch out
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
from mad scientist to tsundere snake
they also bitch out with IO
peak design in term of Chinese representation
but AE was a big hit
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
she was 2nd or 3rd in all time revenue without accouting inflation rate
Honkai playerbase do not care about character's personality
after that they realized 1 thing
AE made the most money
it's C btw <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
A. HoV
B. HoT
C. AE
D. HoF
quick quiz : Which battlesuit do you think make the most money for Honkai ? <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
because
they bitch out at last moment
yea what i don't like the most is that, Mihoyo didn't go all the way with Evil Elysia
cause she also create situation where they need to rely on her
it's just that they're forced to trust her
like 90% people in EDEN knew Dorothy is twisted to the core
i mean someone being evil to the core got revealed to be evil does not really make the story less interesting
i don't know, will probably need to recheck, if im wrong then it's probably from other games <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
first impression is the most important and Dorothy make sure to gaslight people into trusting her
also the reason why Dorothy dress like an angel is because it's easy to manipulate people if they think of her as an angel in EDEN
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
cause Elysia's popularity blew up during 5.0
but after part 1 he stopped talking like that
Kevin speak like he want to slice Elysia into 100 pieces
like in ER part 1
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Elysia was meant to be Dorothy
yea definitely
just a part of it
no, it's just the same with Kevin as far as thing look like
they're all her Finality's power that eventually become true
yea cause all authorities are Finality's shadows
if they want to cross the door to steal away Finality power they need an equal amount of power to open that door first
it's the same principle with Alchemy, if you want to achieve something you need to offer the correct price
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
and its power still not show yet yea
even for Origin, Mei call it the Origin Authority just because Ely like that name
it's man-made name
the name of any authoritiy does not matter
you're confusing stuffs keilo
because lore yea, they need to make an artificial Finality so they need to gather all the authorities together
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
they need the authority of Origin to open up a way for Kiana
the 2nd Hare was another attempt at creating the Will of Schariac
she killed herself yea, after the death of Bronya's mother
the suicide one was the 1st Hare, the current Hare is the 2nd
It just prove the one wrote it don’t play the game or pay attention to story
HoS dying is already proved that it’s fanfiction
Also
The trust worthy leak are the one about Mech Ranged Physical S-Rank + Seele new suit = HoS 2.0
That’s fanfiction
<a:dam:939814527455854642>
and World 4 will be inspired by half of Middle East ?
That much is guarantee to make millions
It have Honkai in its name
I mean the game will still be a hit
That’s enough yapping, back to TFT
And turn based gacha kill all the potential of the game cause what make turn based so great is the unlimited potential of synergy, skill tree, position
Turn based is a niche genre and HSR have nothing unique for it
If you think there is any hope for HSR you’re delusional

<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
they will make another version of her
i mean if they want to make Susannah SP
even for cross over stuffs
but for unknown reason they always keep the lore on solid ground
yea they will break any rules when it come to gameplay
so far they still respect the lore
they still don't go shady on these things
so she can't come from anywhere
i mean yea she was born in the main bubble timeline
what she did, why she appeared were just a part of the grand scheme
she knew the outcome of future
that's the problem with time flow in multi dimension story
she only show up because STIGMA messed up the connection in IMG space
she wouldn't be a part of main timeline
you actually can't
she show up from another bubble
instead of just making Ai-chan playable
they went out of the way to make CN another version of Ai chan
you can't
so far no SP valks were out of the pattern yet
they still respect the lore reason behind SP valk

there is no change at all from the start of this loop for her

oh i just realized why Change is so pissed all the time
fuck it just let Fuuko and Gina become idols
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
the author can take some time off with Unchaste and Unback
yea now that we know Andy can still hold them off for a while
i wouldn't even mind if he has some filler chapters in

he seek for the meaning behind Fuuko's actions
only 1st seat do this
also of all Master Rules in there
and her relationship with Luck is really good

Death is the nun girl

the one that look like a caveman is probably Nature tho <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
we did have Past as normal rule
idk if Time is Master Rule or not
but the old man or the one look like Andy might be Conflict
Justice is probably not one of them
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
they can't be as specific as Language, Sex, Galaxy
10 first Master Rules need to be Principle kind of thing
i got the gist of it
if Language is not a Master Rule then Sex is also not a Master Rule
probably not <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>

<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
it's either Kirito or Biri-birito
the first batch to test these games either become saviors or zombies
i have seen this cliche in horror scifi before
The Game Award more like The Game Awkward <a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
can't see shit, useless emote
but what the fuck man
still not their fault tho
and Kojima + Peele got 10 minutes
there is like absolutely 0 respect for winning titles
not invite them there for fucking nothing
send the fucking trophy to their home
like if you don't want the winner to give out speech
i still fucking pissed
and Baldur's Gate devs got 30 seconds
i know it's not the guy fault but he and Peele had 10 minutes to show a fucking teaser with 0 value info
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
so when will we gaming
and let scenario play out
sometime you put your input in
yea i haven't touch Death Stranding cause my friend told me it's like watching a movie
from garbage to playable and won the award
cause you can't get lower than Cyberpunk launched
this shit is wild
compare to the previous 4
but Metal Gear V story was mid
i haven't touch Death Stranding
btw, is Kojima a beast?
<:ICANTTAKETHISANYMORE:1154037205082320947>
you mean the supposed version we should play?
fuck you mean ongoing
idek how Cyberpunk won Best ongoing
keep pressing the devs for no reason and release unpolished game
i fucking hate these company man
which will probably still bugged
they still need 2 more years to release the game
after 10 years
ok but how come
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
GTA 6 trailer most replayed frame
it's time
wake up kid
<@148145559897636865>
You mean Hungary? <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
<a:therehego:1183176161996570664>
She is busting with those stick arms and flat abs
Is lil man genuinely believe new release in the offchance worse than Luna
“There is still chance Luna is better than new release”
I can decipher this one
<a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
Like a beast
P2 will start and bro would still advise people to reroll for Luna
<@370438895965306882> <@148145559897636865>
4* included
Genshin are 18 on avg
:quota:
S0 is just bait
They better be
I mean after their effort to make S2 the standard
Gotta keep up with the game tho
<a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
Then rub one off while posting it on twitter
People will pull H3 Sardine and use all the mats to craft HoH’s stig
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Does H3 and 50/50/50 cost more than 4/4?
Btw
<a:TheVoices:1167902356646674462>
Yea H3
<a:TheVoices:1116001413370228877>
H3 50/50/50
Require an absurb amount of mats to level up your gears
The change also do more harm for new competitive players
The 3 new valks Sardine Coral Helium can form a team so not getting P1 offrates won’t affect you
Also P2 valks work in different way now
<:5Head:888981972456730634>
Yes but not in the way you’re thinking
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
I will let keilo answer that
<a:therehego:1183176161996570664>

<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
:buddy:
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Think about that
Ok but we could have had Twisted Elysia
And APHO was made before ER was a thing
Yea they changed the direction of the story by a lot during Mei’s depart to ER debut
:peepostrip:
UNHINGED
And we have a CG showing his ability
Isn’t it sick if Captain just turn out to be a Negator
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
Relax alright
No they just added Uma Galaxy
It’s the obvious
It’s like a rule was added
Only the player
Void Archive called Mei as HoT while she was HoO
I mean til now about all of APHO already fucking lost
No longer <:frenn:1114114240509395005>
Yea Vita and the friend
Allowed <:Ok:1113492724050575420>
And they went seperate way
Her friend body got fucking vanished but her mind still stay intact
they’re just a creation of Vita’s friend in Venus
Remember the Sky People?
So far seem so yea
Something like an Astral Express
We lack a train
Yea pretty much
Venus citizen -> Planet got destroyed -> Anger corrupt her mind -> Dive into the Abyss -> Become the new master of the Abyss -> Swear to revenge the source of Honkai -> Send clones to every worlds to absorb them
Vivo la vita
<a:therehego:1183176161996570664>
After Ei’s development we end up with new weekly boss and that’s all about it
<:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
Probably from this
No she embrace it even more
So idk champ
Fischl character development result in her wearing the same fit but just more accessories
2
<a:NopeNope:1045725686834401300>
No thots
<a:therehego:1183176161996570664>
Weed, drug, steroid
You’re always on sth
Yae is 1 valk and 3 towers
Fischl and Oz are 2 valks on the field
So the AI between the 2 are different
Instead of using 2nd character for it like Oz
They use the “tower” model in tower defense event for it
For Yae’s totem, the dumb mechanic behind it is that
Or else it won’t work
It would cause a delay and you need to apply it again
So if the last NA were left handed
But Nigguang’s CA can only be used on her right ahnd
You know that Nigguang use both her hands to do NA right?
Ningguang’s CA is bugged cause how it’s coded
So like it just about how fast you can do Abyss rightb
Even the “weakest” valks can 36* Abyss
Ok but what does it mean to “feel shit playing X character” in Genshin
Everyone still obsessed with how good a valk is in Genshin
Isn’t it crazy that for a game with 0 fucking competitive value
If i see your face i’d go <a:sett:1159553311511412818>
<a:therehego:1183176161996570664>
You can get SS G-fuel with just 10 pulls
Yea and the MC hunt the shit out of them
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Oh probably not yea, but some will definitely do
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
You need to kill to live
It’s like alien invasion
That will depend on the pact between mankind and them
What kind of Dystopia world is that
Saying it out loud
On a big screen
All characters can’t have character development until Traveler see it
But the game isn’t even taking their characters seriously
They deadass want to die on the hill of making a serious game
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
NPCs ask for some useless things in events
Traveler: “No”
NPCs: “Haha you’re funny”
Can’t say “no” also
<:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
Like Aqua
But still gotta keep up the act
Timeline wise it make no fucking sense
Oh definitely not
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
cause some events does require you to finish up to some parts of Main Story
Most of the time yea
<a:therehego:1183176161996570664>
But fuck no
With how much the traveler go back and forth between Inazuma and Liyue, you would think Ayaka should have wear Kimono at least 1 time to greet us
Also
That’s why Ganyu and Shenhe wear 1 piece each of a full clothes?
Like does a normal person need someone else approval to put on new outfit
<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
End of story
Nikke’s skin story “The characters want to try out new outfit”
While in Honkai who give a fuck if Captain is there or not
Like every skins so far they need to fullfil these conditions:
-The traveler need to be there
-It need to be a special occasion
-And it’s a 1 in a lifetime thing for that said valks
They still want to roleplay Genshin as real time story
You can add anything you want, if someone ask just reply with “alternate timeline”
Yea cause it’s Honkai
Nah in all seriousness i just think they’re lazy to design the context for the skins
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
Did they stop hangout in Genshin? I thought they still add some
<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
Can you get any bitches with that achievement tho
That’s a lot points missing
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Why is your elf still up <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
Compare to veteran account
They also sell it to new player as insane price
Even if he did buy coin and xp
So his pull numbers are way higher
Cause new player have insane foca + expa packs
400 pulls per patch before were just a lowball number too
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
What do you think is his motivation to roleplay as luckiest man on earth
Still roleplaying like always
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
What is the setup
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
Probably 30 pulls again
How was Aqua’s AG pulls going
Pilgrim Duo <a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
Normal Duo already meta shaping
Chime and Crown will fucking nut tho
Yea my Tetra and Missilis also start catching up with Pilgrim <:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
<:ta:1114126122783883326>
Only if you play Genshin Impact 3rd
I also don’t really care if i got lucky or not
Ofc nothing happen
That’s 3 pulls above avg
Like 79 pulls
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
Turn out you need full gauge
And started reading her skill
<a:RAGEY:1002384343622221885>
Then i got mad
Wondering why i can’t use AG’s special weapon into ult
Btw yesterday i spent 30 minutes
That’s a lot of pings
<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>

Hiding some real weapons under her normal clothes
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
So all of their gacha also make the endgame content center around grinding gears and stats
Yea Korean gaming culture are heavily tied to MMORPG
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
But she has nothing to do with attacker gears
Marciana is good actually
The weakest faction
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
I have 8 set of Elysion
My 2 strongest valks aren’t even 4/4
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
The real endgame is farming gears
At best to keep leveling up
But it took people like 3 months
It sound a lot when you first get to it
So you need 5 Nikke all 3* to keep leveling
And lv cap for SR is 160, SSR is 200
How it work is that there is a system call Synchro, the 5 Nikke you put will determine your team level
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
It does feel that way if you don’t play tho
Can’t be any more wrong
She died so Tia could fly
Yea she was a failed experiment
<a:sett:1159553311511412818>
They just want to get over it with her bosses
Im sure people that don’t have 4/4 HN also don’t care about her sp problem
<:Pog:816798522275004466>
She uses bandage
Snow White doesn’t wear pantsu

Also is her dps team even good
<:susannahD:1095901201586995210>
Which is kinda sus
Yea she should not be considered a dps option unless you don’t have both LB and HN
What are the other role and the other team
But what are her “2 roles and 3 teams”
47888
Triple supports with AG score the same with HN + HoS
In Big Jelly she does
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
He predicted AG will be busted since LB was announced
That’s understimate him
Sick tier list
<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>

what is the other role and the other team

Matt Smith was good too
Dr.Who had a jump in tv series viewship during David’s runtime
Yea David was crazily skilled
Only for New Year movie
Hoping for the best
They invited David to make a road for the black one
The black one hasn’t started yet
The female one
New Doctor was so fucking bad they have to invite David Tennant back to save the franchise

<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
idk how her combo go but if SS has something as connect N5 then it's definitely fucking important
but her SS is definitely fucking important tho
honestly
probably another HTR
better than SpA at least
but only do part
she can definitely do Bio bosses yea <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
but i guess 500D Carvati is also not the best thing you want to deal with either
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
also AG can deal with Stardust until 7.3
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
son of Goku?
Roku <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
just run Carvati 3 times and Rimestar 2 times in 7.2
i mean they also can always pull out the HoH card
right now it's like Carvati and Rimestar
probably
they will add 1 more for her
so now you use her like twice a patch at best
but her usage is limited to only Bio boss
like how Hare also a strong valk
not bad but it's the same case as every S-rank dps
<:ICANTTAKETHISANYMORE:1154037205082320947>
the trigger?
<:yikes:739810947824222258>
both are yikes but AG is cheaper
one is niche dps
one is a niche support
but im not sure about skipping AG for gHua
you can definitely skip AG tho

isn't gresham like
Street Fighter 2? <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
yea norway
<a:ChattingFast:876267204511952926>
it's the standard currency in r/manga
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
he is an unwated child
yea his lore is pretty fucked up if you take it as face value
what is his opinion on gHua
oh btw
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
we should always calc in Norway currency
pissing him off can lose hundred of million dollars
yea i wouldn't either, it's Stephen King we're talking about  <:sajj:1067071714518892584>
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
they don't have the balls to say no to him
the problem with Stephen King and his publisher is that
the boys were shaking so the only girl of the group propose an ideal that they should run a train on her
to defeat him later
not how they defeat him but how they surpass the fear
probably on drug while writing it
King is just high
but there is still none
i reread Chapter 22 of IT yesterday to see if there are any deeper meanings behind the Child Orgy
<:ohnocat:1127849488879472700>
that's fucked up
you think you're lucky until you actually calc it
that's how it goes for spenders
he pay full price for everything
nothing outstanding
yea it's normal
he used 2 dawei cards for Dkey
96 ona vg
like 30 foca cards for 4k bchip
cause newbie have insane pulling packs
like i calc it was around 1600 pulls but it's definitely 2000 pulls at least
he just want to roleplaying luckiest man on earth
ofc it's not the truth
after he got S2
SS2 in like 70 pulls iirc
cause the game give it to him for free
yea he still do dailies
not really tho
i would even suck his dick if he told me to
yea i worship him
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
how many pulls is that on avg
so far we only confirmed that he pulled:
-4/4 SS2 HFI
-4/4 S2 HoO
-4/4 S2 HTR
-4/4 SS0 QK
-4/4 SS0 Hare
-4/4 SS1 LB
-4/4 LY
-4/4 S2 HoH
on avg he spent like 400 pulls per patch
8k3 in 190 days
<@148145559897636865>
might still make it
and still 6 days left for the event
you're 11/54
you need 54 * 30 = 1620 stamina to get the stig
might be tho
you probably can
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
if QK actually work on Kosma HN can definitely score 700+
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
i did the same run like last time with HN, got 658
Is LB actually good for 501D
you mean Kosma? <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
haven't had any issue with it yet
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
So they made that scenes for the sake of doing it
Even for manga readers you would still confuse as heck too
Yea and that scene was meant to never happen
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
The ending of From Me To You i mean
Yea spending a whole 5 minutes for a manga scene that will never happen is wild, no?
<a:xmaspls:1180158163660591224>
That’s how an immortal should be
And he is skilled at almost everything
They should be able to analyze the negator abilities after a period of time
They’re skilled fighters
Yea also not like the characters are retarded either
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
They about to show Unjustice
The manga only start reaching greatness when we enter Autumn
Idt any studio would do UDUL without actually loving it
Yea make sense
Yea only Anachiro and Liberallip

some tricks were really interesting tho
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
so the power up is literally just he make it bigger
yea Hamon is too 1 dimensional
Stand is more healthy with Araka's imagination
it need to go
Hamon is definitely fucking busted
yea i also think it's not to blame
yea idk about Spin <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
bro forgot
so Araki just forgot
he was still using it in P3 after aging
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
he did admit it in an interview
he forgot that Hamon users can't age
cause Araki forgot about Hamon
that one is also can't blame Araki either
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
and Joseph just getting old and retarded for fun
knowing all of it never should happened if he was still a beast
but it just feel wrong when he lost <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
he was forced to participate in a mission to kill a vampire take over his ancestor body
he has always been a pacifist
yea i wouldn't blame him either
bad guys always appear
but it feel wrong the same time cause you know
i guess it's also fine since he is a pacifist himself
it mean Jotaro didn't train at all from end of P3 to start of P4
that's the messed up part
and Star Platinum was still 5 seconds timestop
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
yea compare to himself in P3, he was definitely more relaxing
same case happened in P4 and P6, Jotaro look like a jobber most of the time
Joseph was too fucking broken
can't really do anything about it
but i think it's fine <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
yea he would handle Dio alone with his yeye ass stand if Araki didn't nerf him
bro was a beast at innovating <:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
my favorite Jojo is still Joseph
in term of the quality
lowkey i think P3 of Jojo is the weakest <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>

What’s up nerds
I find it hard to believe he still not realize the intention behind the movie
Like for someone with that much connections
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
What’s the hold up
Jerking off to a corpse?
What is lil bro even doing rn
Hikaru
You know who is still in mystery
She only realized it in her dying moment
She doesn’t know what it mean to love someone
It’s confession
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Only waiting for it to explode
He planted the bomb
This part is the key of Ai and Hikaru relationship
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
And Aka only uses him as a plot device
The most important role in making a movie
Im still kinda pissed about the director role tho
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
The “rage” part
Even Kana didn’t know what were Ruby missing until Akane said it
The others including Memcho + Kana just doing what they are told
Cause the director is a plot device and Akane is professional stalker
Oh only the director and Akane know about Ai
That would be peak fiction in the bad way
Like a beast he is
Then next panel show Hikaru sense it
Imagine if next chapter Ruby become Ai 2.0
Or Ruby become Ai 2.0
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
But Aka on the other hand
I can guarantee you if the UDUL’s author write next chapter it would happen exactly as what i said
Aka better cook next chapter
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
Can’t really blame anyone, just salty
yea cause she is also gifted
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
But overall she is a good girl so she would never burn her relationship with them because of that
Then growing up seeing gifted people like Akane and Ruby, she is bound to have jealousy and frustration
Kana lowkey has always suffer from inferior complex ever since she met Aqua
If next chapter Ruby just hug Kana and thanks Kana for doing it for her sake it would be peak fiction
Too cliche
Yea it’s as old as the sun now
Path of Exile
<:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
twitter moment
yea cause you hate Mei
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
kinda cliche
but she did it now cause Ruby need it
the despair and jealousy of Kana is real but not enough to make her act like the Nino girl
oh it's actually what she felt, but not to the point she would burn her relationship with Ruby
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
Even Eminem is in there
Lol fortnite keep having the most random ass character as possible
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
The metaphor in her bond story 5 is actually about human trafficking and prostitute
Even though her design is 1 of the best, can’t really have any ill thoughts about her

why is her name Teddy tho
looking sick
<@416445660443967491>  
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
cause she is actually young
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
or got raped
even though the MC fuck a lot of Nikke
also Nikke can have some lolicon baits but they didn't make it weird, the relationship between MC and child models are all friends or partners <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
<a:Aware:889021591776817172>
there is this girl that got kidnapped when she was young and then got sold to be a prostitute, she fought back and ran away so they chase her down and beat her up, the huamn trafficker accidentally hit her on the head and then the rescue squad came to save her but she was bleeding inside her brain so they had to turn her into a Nikke, the shock from the strike make her mental age is now like 5
Nikke lore is like omega dark once you start following it <:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
this is  Snow White
she is a glutton but the surface doesnt' have enough food supply so she just eat whatever can give her protein, bugs and plants
Snow White is like Kiana on hard mode
the design choice and her lore is what make her stand out
mine is Snow White
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
Blanc and Noir, white and black bunnies
yea cause it's just their jobs, they're dancers in the casino ,she and her sister

<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
he doesn't like PBE
he didn't play PBE that much iirc
dude is just that good at reading board strength
he still roll on 7 and 8 with the least gold possible
like he doesn't try to fast 9 all games
Setsuko's read on his spot always correct
you need to know your spot on every stages
but i think level 9 meta is the hardest
Mort doesn't like level 9 meta for some reason
might be
he can build a whole level 9 board under 30 seconds
and he roll insanely fast
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
he just doesn't make any mistakes in early and mid game
he is just too good at level 9 meta
not even close
but isn't Sesuko gonna win this bootcamp anw
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<:WorryYou:1101221412817092650>

<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492>
who
<:KyaruNerd:608064143773139000>
Klee and Nahida
i can tell which valks in Genshin have most R18 art
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
probably Kirara
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
does Rei have lewd arts?
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Master <a:sett:1159553311511412818> ?
or just straight up naked and call for pedo
be honest, are the loli desgins even lewd
<:yikes:739810947824222258>
feet fetish or pedophile
like full of fetish
it just weird
is not even lewd if i were to be honest
the game that people called lewdest of Mihobo, Genshin Gakuen 2
all the lewd one fucking blow
all off their traditional chinese designs hit the mark
i think Mihoyo better off design traditional chinese designs instead of trying to do whatever they think are lewd <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
sick
4 Liyuans
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
my Genshin fav designs are probably :
-Hu Tao
-Zhongli
-Kazuha
-Xinyan
-Furina
don't you think Genshin players deserve to get 1 more skin a year
on Genshin i mean
anyone know
when will Mihobo release 5 skins a year
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
my top design in Genshin are Klee and Nahida
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
but not like i actually like it
i can go <a:Yeehaw:999641827080675400> with you guys
yea i never like too horny designs
i like designs that make you want to see more
i don't like too extreme design
yea she is on the tame one
i don't even play AL anymore, i just comeback whenever they released her skins
<:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
my favorite AL design
short skirt and big boobs are all they know
yea they don't know what it mean to lewd a valk
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Yostar is like 100 times better than Mihobo
when it come to horny design
instead of letting him do it
ok but why did she ask her husband to record it <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>

but Andy can do it
probably not
could have had a superpower shonen where MC has to work with his friends instead of become a god
what a shame
also the author bitch out too much with Deku power up
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
and All Might has so much charisma Deku look like a fucking newborn baby
fighting with both AFO no.1 and no.2
these are during the current arc
new valks make you like the MC more or at least the MC learn from them and be more likable
shouldn't it be opposite
like Deku was so fucking better until Mirio show up
ngl i have not seen someone write a MC that keep getting worse when new valks show up
now the Academy doesn't even get mentioned anymore
he just use the Academy to introduce battle festival and senior meeting arcs
the author doesn't even know how to write a school arc properly
like MHA
you get free events that can be used in the story
their world feel fucking empty
cause most new authors and old authors suck at worldbuilding
yea but it's also easier to do school scenario <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
shonen is like from 9 to 18 years old
cause most of them target Shonen
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
all of her works are about highschool girl
the author like highschool girl
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
not a single male
Saki's playable cast
remind me of Azur Lane
oh the artstyle look really familiar
it's pretty popular in JP when it was still running
yea all of the valks are female <:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
Shit look lit, time to start it
cause idt anyone watch him play 17 steps and be like
only a little of them play because of Kaiji
Akagi is gambling majong and Saki is yuri mahjong
some are inspired by Akagi and Saki
can't go wrong from there
first Mahjong experience and it's a gambling setup
not even your fault
keep it up
start to sound like big bro
wait only swiping?
how do yo pull
big bro kind of scores
Have you tried winning tho
What’s up nerds

usually
yea that's the start of greatness
yea just chill, read some porn, or furry <:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
take it easy <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
no exaggeration
like even 17 steps can't compare to it
yea you will know once you read it
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
beast gambling
but the mental gymnastic are off the chart
like even a 6 years old can play it
yea it's extremely simple
so was taking it easy now with new kind of gambling
but he wrote a little too many Mahjong manga before
Fukumoto is a beast at writing Mahjong <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
yea it's all Mahjong
reverse Kaiji
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
until he feel like he actually won against Akagi
so Iwao keep chasing Akagi to ask for rematch
it always end in an unsatisfy ending for both
him and Iwao Washizu never settle their scores
what made Akagi unique was also that
so Fukumoto wrote another manga about Akagi himself
but people got charmed by him
Akagi started out as a rival of his previous work
yea one of his first work
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
what he had was unwavering confidence it gambling his life
Akagi is not a super smart type
but they lack what make Akagi great
do you know that all the mastermind type MC in game/gambling genre are all inspired by Akagi
<:Pog:816798522275004466>
they have Akagi?
wait holy shit
R <:omegalul:1030461063197626409> L L E D
!vanish
already die first game
oh so pulling the valks don't do anything for your gameplay?
More chance to hit certain tiles?
What can you get from pulling tho
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Yea there is no way a gacha tutorial can cover mahjong knowledge
I have seen some posts talking about BM-ing and got ran over by bad luck
Yea it’s pvp
Mahjong Soul i think

he didn't even want it
lil bro always accidentally getting dupes
<:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
and HTR dupe in 10 pulls
so it was also an accident
7 HFI in 50 pulls or sth
SS2 SS S2 yea
every rank up only took 10 pulls but still need 400 pulls per patch
since he start at the start of 6.7
but lil bro spent at least 400 pulls per patch
cause newbie have like shit ton of expa and foca packs
the result will definitely be off by like 10-20% at least
ok i finish mathing <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>

the only time my top up skyrocket was during 5.0 and it was only 14k Norwegian Krone
probably gonna cost 10 times
imagine him being unlucky tho
and still 89k Norwegian Krone
10 pulls for every 4/4 valks
50 bucks a day is definitely more than me
<:Pog:816798522275004466>
89k Norwegian Krone
how much is that in Norwegian Krone
how much is that
<:ApuCry:969982697252466789>
he just recycle old recipe
yea but he doesn't cook new food anymore
bro scores lower than 6S Trio in lower temp
making shit up again
his food is plain and boring now
<:o7:1147223647946293289>

no wonder he's a beast at cooking

Next game better not making the same mistake
So that people will remember my name when we go 8th together
That’s why i climb to challenger
Yea i don’t like scouting either
If they want to get into competitive TFT
But will be hard for new players tho
It’s definitely healthy when the game is balanced
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Or deafen and go 8th together with griefers
So you need to scout really fucking hard now
And 4 cost only support 2
Reroll now only support 1 player
Bag size nerf won’t let a comp support 3 players
Yea but only when only 1 player contest me
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
flexibility C
look at my match history tho
other than those 3, you just take what you can <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
like Heartsteel Ezreal, Sentinel Blitz, Country Thresh
it's good for some useless traits
but you need to cycle through a lot
yea it's badluck protection
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
not even close
peak gambling yea
yea probably can't cook up anything better than P5 for the moment <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
gotta keep it simple
they're playing Catch me if you can now, no gambling in P6
oh P6 is Tom and Jerry
<:ApuCry:969982697252466789>
gambling manga
you know what is lacking tho
<a:sett:1159553311511412818>
which will be the case if im in charge
twice a week in manga industry is the same as working 20/24 a day
but depend on context you will know what do they mean
it mean both
so hope he learn the lesson this time
his previous sport manga did get axed
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
author is walking on thin rope there
like it's 50/50
there is a weird balance between human relationship and technical detail in the new sport manga Green green green
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
mangaplus is actually all Jump magazines
the bi-weekly magazine
the mermaid one is Jump Plus
they're all WSJ yea
but the author is picking a really fucking dangerous route here
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
yea new title of WSJ
it definitely does
the new sport manga have potential
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
i have seen worse arc in romance manga so i don't really feel anything
yea i think the common complains were weird pacing and can be done in 10 chapters  <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
and not Andy smurfing on him
bro just want to see Sick get killed through a sick fight
not like he did it out of malice either
you know i still think it's funny that after Move saved Sick, Fuuko just ignored it cause it's pointless to even talk about it <:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
their house look fucking rich tho
bro is probably leech off Latla
consider he is cooking ramen in the morning
<:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
Rip gain 50% more free time for his 2 wives
imagine they were to kill Sick there tho
without Move bro would be dead
can't even blame it on anything
he did lose fair and square so bro probably chose to shut up
<a:mojjcheck:1113492691288871063>
roast the guy that was just sliced in half 2 minutes ago
1st rule did say Sick was the weakest of them all
is Justice really fit for master rule tho <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
a sick translation tho
but the translators cook out that line
Andy said sth different in JP
cause it's just localization
interesting idea but they won't
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
right, then Language was not a master rules, my bad <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
the reward was united of all languages
yea Nico soloed it during Spoil
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Death and Meaning make most sense to pair, no?
i know for sure that 1st rule and 2nd rule are related
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
bro look like a beast
does Sick look like he is sick tho
like everything exist for a meaning, that's why rules exist
1st rule is Meaning
lowkey i think
only Luck was through chapter 182
Sex, Death, Language, Race were from Juiz
Sick and Pain were from Ruin
no, from all the hints
making out on their table
imagine Fuuko and Andy pull out the ultimate technique to kill all 10 Master Rules <:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
so far we knew Master Rules consist of Sick, Pain, Language, Race, Sex, Death, Luck
isn't it kinda fucked up that Fuuko best fighting condition is being alone
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
remember what happened with Nico last time
yea but not like she can use Unluck freely while they were around either <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
can't she just ask him and let Shen use Untruth if he want to refuse
Fuuko need to cook up sth so that her Union can do something about Pain next quest <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
anyone else?
still missing Unchaste, Unback, Unjustice, Unstoppable, Unruin, Untouchable <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Fuuko won't use it anytime soon
we need a time chamber here so everyone can get out of newbie phase
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Sick almost got them
but can they actually do something about Pain tho
yea in Fuuko's mind rn she just want to meet Andy and ask what happened in those 4 billion years <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
since next quest Pain will definitely show up
do you think they will rescue Andy when they finally get to Sun <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>

As an European it was always hard for me to understand American culture. What was fascinating for me is that they like bragging about their freedom which was weird for me, because I didn't think that I have any less freedom than them. I always thought 'What is the difference'. However after this game I finally understand it. NA is just so fucking free.

The only reason Eiffel Tower still belong to French was cause it’s too big to put in the museum

it's already mercy that they're still breathing
a Him argument
holy shit only him can throw with a trait this strong
big bro did go 4th with 10 Pen <:ta:1114126122783883326> kill
maybe it's balanced
10 mana per second on whole board
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
that pris trait is not balanced
10 KDA losing is more surprising tho
big bro alone tank 10 pentakill winrate
but they're just under DSG for fun
he might consider signing 1 or 2 depend on the result
after Vegas they would all be kicked out
oh btw lil bro said that Toast only sign them under DSG for Vegas tournament
can't really expect more from him
it's still early season so big bro is still in influencer mode
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
the Karthus has nasho nashor red buff or sth
like item builds and stuffs
he griefed the game himself tho
10 pentakill winrate is 99.4%
oh only big bro can pull that off
what does that mean
<:icant:1162065269611565116>

The extra hit is actually really fucking big
Yea i use that one

Cause each ego is 50% of her dmg

You actually lost more time tho if not restarting for double ego

In their CV they probably have “Used to work for Mihoyo’s Online Security Management”
Why does these guys think “internet janitor” is a job
That’s the same as calling Luna Theresa Apocalypse
If you’re a beast at lore then no way you call Aponia a nun btw
But dude self claim that he is a beast at lore
She does look like one yea
but he just doesn't have it
dude is definitely searching for acknowledgement from others
forever be a clown
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
kinda sad
and in reality he is nowhere near both
this guy truly believe he is a beast at playing the game and researching the lore
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>

Gresham is SS0
No reason to run mini on 7.2
So it’s big spending

That’s why it’s mini into big

Yea GH would be either Bio or Psy
Around 20% lightning in V3
It’s fine to skip her but you will suffer on some bosses

If GS were to be lightning LB would be much better

My bad
<@516591030326525983> check out OP 1098 leaks <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
so they took it to court and Shift Up had to publicly apologize and refund all transactions in that year + $500 worth of ingame xtals for each account
and the rate is much lower than it's stated
a group of KR whales suspect the rate in their old gacha - Destiny Child so they hired people to make 10.000 new accounts and pulling on it to check the rate of each banner
yk the studio that made Nikke, Shift Up used to involved in lawsuit too <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
KR company trying to run a game normally challenge:
just finished Loki episode 5 and the whole season was built up for God of Stories Loki <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>

The only time JP ever come close to it was like 6 months ago in GBF guild war
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
They’re fucking competitive on all games they play for fun
But yea it’s KR gaming in a nutshell
Their upside is that monthly balance also revived old valks
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
Cause meta change with speed of light
Valks in E7 may have like 2 months life span if lucky
HI3 is not even close
That will fucking stomp all the valks that were used in Worlds
They immediately put in a trailer of new valk
My friend said after their Worlds end
This game powercreep is fucking sonic ngl
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
Probably doing this irl
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
But CN whales just contact with KR company since this is KR game
Yea they can’t do that in CN due to lawsuit
And some valks need max dupes to be “viable” as niche pick
While the games already needs 10 dupes each valk for pvp competitive
They added new system that require more dupes
Oh neko already sent it

cap is sth 761-762
im at 754 <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
isn't that kinda fucked up
QK lost 100 pts just trying to deplete Sentinel Prime's shield
i got it 1 tho
no data but it's the same case for everyone, it would be a miracle to even get xtals tasks in Shicksal
yea
yea when the manga is too philosophical people can't act like they're a beast anymore
not bleed hitcount
Luna has real hitcount on her skills
i didn't remember the hitcount shield can't be affected by bleed <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>

what's everyone reaction
i heard that infamous scene got animated
this boss look worse than i remember during beta
might be MPE
im not even sure if it's HN anymore <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
and outsiders waiting for fandom's reaction
cause the fandom waiting every weeks to see what master class the author will cook
it's like 1 of the most active manga community
their subreddit
wait SSS QK only score 555 <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
a real family yea
his relationship with his wife has been worsen recent years because of that
the author
because the author has been drawing her dating with him and posted it on twitter
so he doesn't want to give her to the MC
the author love his female MC
the fandom think the reason why the MC has 0 character development is because
yea and here is the twist
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>

Chapter 1: imagine his ex-girlfriend getting fucked by literally anyone, just pure delusion
Chapter 300: imagine his soon to be girlfriend getting fucked by literally anyone, just pure delusion
peak character development of Rent a Girlfriend is probably when i read in comment section that
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
just move on with life
you can't fix it
no matter what you overcome with your family, 1 crack or some will always be there
Ichinose i feel like a realistic scenario
it's probably not, it's just his way of telling story
i check the comment section every week
oh i don't
300 chapters in and the characters has 0 character development
Rent a girlfriend is basically the opposite of UDUL
it's peak fiction <:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>

people was deadset on believing HC was a bait before HoH

HN won't cut it this time
there is a huge difference between Physical and Dominance Jizo
wonder if HoS dps can do sth on it
Dominance Jizo
Holy shit it's actually here
<@370438895965306882> <@416445660443967491>
just use HoS dps from now on
in Abyss it's not
relax
no it's not
but yes
what kind of question is that
always beasting
and not Them
it's always We
whenever he mentioned beast players or top players
i really like Aqua's habit of talking
it close the gap
also QK has mech killer passive
she can reset her ult 2 times
her rot is better for this boss
that's about it
LB > QK > HN
QK T2 it
not that bad
or not
oh shit already bug fixed

<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
like a beast
and then blame the game later
instead of trying to improve
they always blame the game first
i think that's the common problem for people with huge ego
Yea this boss is kinda hard for casual can’t lie if you refuse to learn that is <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
Be honest
<@370438895965306882> is it you?
Who is “We”
He doesn’t even know how to say the truth anymore
This guy ego is too fucking big man
And 100 pulls SS1 LB
21 pulls 4/4 HoS

any 9 trait
cause they just need to hit Bingo to win
you can't even griefed a player efficiently
this patch specifically
yea it's actually the minimum game you can play
and win Worlds in 3 hours
bro about to hit Bingo on game 4
rather than winning
im 100% sure other 7 will definitely focus on fuck him up
and Kaiji is 21 pts atm
and win next game to win it all
Checkmate format is above 20 points
reading Kaiji into watching Kaiji irl
a Japanese player too
already Bingo on game 4

seem kinda cocky to me with the picture Gresham sent
thought he was playing the humble guy

ok but counter point, if HoS is so good then how come Aqua still in Myriad without HoS
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
because if he doesn't need it then everyone shouldn't need it
that's why brick is useless on 90%
he doesn't have HoS in his account
yea i got you guys with this one
he still a retarded tho
<:o7:1147223647946293289>  Aqua

combine with tmr checkmate format
this bingo meta
they just double down on the Bingo championship
<:DankUp:1061806229455896646>

they buff 9 Ionia
instead of trying to tune down 9 Demacia/Noxus/Bilge/Shurima

Isn’t that what they start WoW for
Like everyone just start new games or old games because Soda want to play it
Is there any lore reasons why Soda is the center of all streamers
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Probably asmond or esfan start it

not much room to improve
but rot feel weird
it's easy
this boss rot is weird
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
Tencent does have a share in WW
They’re probably waiting to see how Wuthering Waves gonna go tho
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
The only one i can think of is Tencent but they just refuse to make anything to compete with Mihobo
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
I think it’s due to how polish it look compare to others
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
Can they threaten Genshin tho?
There are at least 10 titles just pass the check and are on CBT now
Chinese gacha industry is banking everything on open world next year
Like a beast
Im not even kidding but billion dollars are on the line for Valo and CCP ignored it
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
The game is still in TBA
Like the name check
They only pass the 1st round last time i heard
Like they’re still waiting for Valorant to finally get in China to start investing in pro scene
While 70% of Chinese’s big names pressuring them
Valorant took 2 years to pass the CCP check
This one is hard af btw
Is ToF still lit
What’s the hold up
It’s already 3 years
When will Genshin killer show up tho
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>

but she has lot of moments where she turn into loli
wicked sick

but most people i see all say she is the best Honkai's design

idk why people obsessed with Jyahnar tho <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
even Aqua wouldn't be this retarded

GSR already have a Vietnamese publisher
All Mihobo’s game actually
Yea i just saw it
3 years and they’re still waiting for their turns
Liyue Qixing must have negative spd
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
So Genshin is a dream too
Like the time Tsubasa think he woke up to real world was when new turn start
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
I don’t think they have waken up to real world at all
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
So someone is still hiding sth
But new turn still start
By now the whole family should have already finished their therapy session
On the surface yea
No he didn’t
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
Maybe Dom can solve the family’s problem
Thots on Ichinose collab with Fast and Furious
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
The wife’s parent is rich af and they let her stay overnight for fun
Straight from Fast and Furious
Tsubasa brainwashed him with that
They’re still family
Yea but family is family, even if they’re not perfect
idk whose turn it is anymore
kinda dank
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
so Souta went home and they started dreaming again, began Kakeru's therapy turn
don't let them play family with Souta anymore
the kid and the wife's family called them back
his turn just end and now new turn start
last time was Kakeru's turn
they go back to dream because this is turn based therapy
on a serious note
gonna give them that
they really love to dream tho
they're back to dreaming since 2 months ago
you really haven't read for 2 months
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
they're trying to do this irl
cause i still need to save for GS's affix

<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
it just there
yea they still have decoration up but they don't celebrate it as a big event
and infinite people getting traumatized
159 people died, 196 injured
so it's a like a domino collapsing
last year in Seoul, they held a party in an alleyway and suddenly someone fall and keep pushing up the people in front of them
cause of an accident last year
do you know that some KR games now don't celebrate Hlw as a big event anymore <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>

What kind of ending is that
He is telling Kohaku and Chrome to help him in killing them
Yea but the intention
Is he stupid
That’s basically the same as killing Kohaku and Chrome
He wanted to create a time machine using alien technology to prevent everything from happening
Bud literally say to everyone that he want to kill all of them
That’s basically the ending
“I want to kill everyone so i hope you guys can help me”
The ending is dumb

You need to alt tab it in and out for about 20 seconds
too dumb to realize he is dumb
i don't even think the guy is cocky, i think he is just dumb
like genuinely dumb
but he is just so dumb
bud is nowhere near a bad player
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
as if it's the obvious
but bud was going around advising people to turn off GD QTE
can't remember
turn on QTE like a normal human should
you just do normal rot until BKE die
this boss is easy
not much to talk about
doing that might get him depression
yea with how big his ego is
if it's Betterdiscord then why don't Discord buy it and implement to to their feature
<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492>
but he doesn't have HoS
yea he has brick
that will corrupt the balance
1 game can't have 2 Aqua
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
chill
Aqua is EU exclusive
<:DankUp:1061806229455896646>

need SSS HoS and SS QK at least
SS0 HoS and S2 QK can't cut it
519 is too high <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
but main server is a beast
other servers HoS can still get to T20
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
so no reason to use HoS
but T100 in ios basically all have 6S at minimum
9S HoS can get to T100
yea T100 won't have anything but Aponia or Luna
Nirv is 519 atm
oh main server <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
what server is this, do you know your Nirv temp <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>

lil bro is done for this patch

cause he doesn't have either a proper lightning team
especially this patch
he won't be able to cook
yea lil bro think MA putting him at disadvantage
i lost interest in that topic
lil bro just brush it off with old rotation feel kinda pathetic
but there is no rotation that require disable GD QTE
he mean i disabled her QTE in old rotation, still enable it with HTR
he was choking
not worth to ping the gang
this guy is just beyond helping
old rotation
you need to pressure him cause he already knew he is dumb
ping him with this message
with Griseo
he isolated her
you need to pressure him with his own statement
cause he realized how dumb he is
no he already turn on her QTE
:ignorege:
keilo failed
yea ping him and asked why did he say that turn off GD QTE is better
eventually he will block everyone in this server
aren't you already blocked, lumi?
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>

just like Mihobo wanted
yea everyone pull rank nowaday
we need his wisdom
ping the gang when he answered tho keilo
like this
S0 LB smash her
not even ranked LB
here is the neat part
<:ApuCry:969982697252466789>
i have another set for her but no affixes mat
cause i use HoT's Handel
and my GD is dealing 0 dmg
the buff still linger until GD ult
so after her rot
yea LB has lightning buff
so i still can't think of a reason for him doing that
like his vid he is not that bad of a player
when 50% of the buff is in her weapon
how slow you need to be to think that turning off GD QTE make her animation faster
why did he do that
ok but seriously tho
he is baiting
look at the deerussy
The biggest oversight with Lillia is that she's unbelievably sexy. I can't go on a hour of my day without thinking about plowing that tight furry ass. I'd kill a man in cold blood just to spend a minute with her crotch grinding against my throbbing manhood as she whispers terribly dirty things to me in her geographically ambiguous accent.

i will wait to see if someone can cook a higher score and copy later
or else can't 1 rot it
unless Gresham fund me 2 more lightning hit
probably this is it
but don't know if it do anything
S1
and boss die
so just do 3 rots
currently i can't
if 6x lightning hit then i can 1 rot it
probably nothing to talk about
<a:mhm:1046326820389273600>
the sfx of LB is nice
<a:mhm:1046326820389273600>
owo math 47728 + 39920 + 31946
that one im not sure <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
if below 250mb then upload it to streamable
upload it to youtube
be more specific
you know that info alone won't do anything right
today or tmr
why is your pfp Gyokuen
but we will see
i do want a 5th lightning hit
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>

He like to roleplay
It’s probably real in 1 of his recent books
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
And not just getting 20k and ignore
Or at least sell the info
Honestly i’d be farming those 20k if it’s real
I keep failing to decipher his messages
Bro is Uncommunicate
Good one
He does need to see God
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
I think only the mom part is true
The story
How much do you think it’s true tho
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
Are they stupid
Instead of compensate 20k
Why didn’t they just kill him
At least his plot is connected
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
He almost killed himself for 20k and his mom still advise him to this day that he need to die now
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
Can we make a competitive dress up gacha
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
When it needed it is needed
That’s how worth atk is
And SSS HoT has way easier time to do that
But timing is as tight as it can be due to damage window need to be perfect
On theory SS1 HoT can score 49920
Like for MA BKE
Until it happen
Serious answer is that it most of the time it won’t affect anything
Worth 10 years of playing on live server
He farm infinite exp in beta
He is super veteran
Luna is a broken as fuck lightning dps with support capabilities, able to cover a lot of weathers on her own just due to sheer numbers, PSY and double dps coverage - if there's a question between two units and Luna is one of them, no matter whats the other, then yes. Luna is the answer. Also newer = more longevity, as a support she also gets that support life insurance warranty on top of her perks

Bro is a beast in ER tho
In ER
His rank rn are like HFI > LB > HoH > Hare
It’s HoH and Hare
In his ranking
She barely live
No reason to invest in SI anymore
Just use GC
Yea if you don’t have SI

Im 25 frags short from S2
Send me the fund too

Can you realise this
but Love is War
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
ok but check out this guy moves
the cannibal
like Hannibal
or you can eat your responsibilities
it even out at the end of the day
if you are a spender, there is no such thing as lucky
i can tell you 1 thing
SS2 HFI: i got 5 copies of her in 30k crystals
S2 HTR: i only did it for the rank
S0 HoO: only need S0
SS Hare: i got unlucky
SS QK: i got unlucky again
SS1 LB: i got 5 copies of her in 100 pulls
his pull went like this
the problem is this
the problem is not it can't happen
he went for SS1 straight up
no
im sorry
ok that was kinda dark
he'd rather get drafted for military than admit he is normal
<:icant:1162065269611565116>
this guy ego is way too big to say anything true
i already told you guys
:Himge:
there is Aqua
even if there is no God or Buddha
<:ICANTTAKETHISANYMORE:1154037205082320947>
im missing 3 frags for SS PE in 7.1
you run Betterhonkai by the end so i can't see it
how many lightning hit you got in the end
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
S0
better avg than me
that's pretty good
owo math 53480/280
owo math 59080 - 5600
<a:Streaming:1039019999811088414>
<:clueless:1009089400174559294>
but still have to keep the vibe positive
he doesn't believe in set 10 either
yea it's Robin
yea people said the same about dragons and hero augments
bud gave Ichico Unsleep
some powers are definitely random af
i don' think he wanted to be burn
Unburn also
yea Unfade is also weird <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
i don't think so
so like does Ruin wanted to be ruined instead?
not all of them, power usually go against their ideas <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
just down right fucking cult behavior
not even broken
like bud was completely a jerk last loop
do you think Fuuko will try to save Ruin too? <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
probably cause he has Unfade sooner this time and met Fuuko <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Typical fight junkie
Bro doesn’t really have moral code either
Feng is actually a fucking beast
Feng killed it
probably no one, only pixel character
who will become the Her for Him tho
his delusions just can't be ruined
isn't Aqua just Unruin but instead of worshiping god, he worshiping himself
Unwavering confidence
he will never doubt himself
how many times have we talk about him btw
letting him know
thots on inviting him to this server?
definitely not
he thought he found a place where he belong
poor guy
his ego got damaged so hard in central tho
but this guy attitude make me can't take him seriously
yea some rank enable a whole different rot
<:icant:1162065269611565116>
bro i actually can't with this guy
btw
ok but he got to Myriad with S0 JK
he is Him now
he is finally free from the dorm buff curse
but now he can't use that excuse anymore
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
for fun
he pulled all dkey on 1st month
N <:omegalul:1030461063197626409> A Q U A
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
Im lacking damage
he will never have that problem
that's why he play in EU
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
im not stupid, relax Mihobo
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
the button doesn't keep reminding you to press or hold it
if
LB's gameplay will be amazing
like not even wasted 1 second
he went with 6 lines after he logged in to beta
must be
SS2 HFI - S2 HTR - SS0 HoO
this guy has a hard on for scamming rank
specifically SS1
SS1
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
only missing an S
more than me
i believe in Aqua
yea that's why i pull her
probably fine, i still think pulling LB is a troll
<a:catPls:1113921108094242898>
this guy defintiely doesn't have LB
i know that 1 person in my bracket doesn't have LB to begin with
ok <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
be honest
shall i go for the 5th lightning line
<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492>
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
but i only have 4 <:Life:1089579344508223558>
every games in CN are forced to have hard pity
GGZ had hard pity around 2016
since 2.5
no one care about it before even though Honkai already had it
people only start wanting soft pity and hard pity after Genshin
about how gacha should be
you're tripping if you think other games change people's mind
Genshin is definitely the one pushing it
you know CN games are forced to have hard pity due to laws right?
it's the impact of the game that make everyone acknowledge it
what are you even talking about, i said pushing
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
They update it so fucking slow
Also what happened with Genshin standard anw
Like 1st pull and the 300th pull have same value
It’s always 3%
Yea but because they don’t have soft pity
And you need 300 to spark
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
You get around 150-250 pulls every 3 weeks
Like for a standard JP gacha
Cause Korean are always so competitive for no reason
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
It’s the Korean that have it
JP gacha also doesn’t have intense powercreep
Yea not every games follow Mihobo’s standard but Mihobo make everyone think their system is good
Genshin 5* rate is like 0.1% before 76th pull
Like even though the spark doesn’t carry over and you need like 300 pulls, the rate is definitely higher
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
But i don’t know if i can say Genshin making the gacha industry more generous or more greedy
Most gacha are 50/50, Genshin is the 1st one pushing soft pity and hard pity
But Genshin is not the 1st one
The spark doesn’t carry over
<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492>
What is the total damage on Gresham account
Still in the positive right?
How much it cost already?
How the pulls go

You can only use it when i use it
no flame
if you said otherwise you're wrong
LB is best investment since Honkai ever launch
it mean Brick low prior compare to LB
he is busy jerking off to LB's dps
that's the tech
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>

highkey
probably still better than her
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
more than SS1 HoT
better than SSS HoT
i will test it out on Wolf
S1 lowkey is already better than SS HTR <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
lightning dps with 1 extra bleed boss
S0 already cover enough what you expect from her
just some extra damage
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
because
so i just went for S1
i got LB in the 90th <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
that's not bad
so it took me 60 pulls for 4/4 HoS, 105 pulls for S1 LB, 60 pulls for 4/4 LB and 10 pulls on fire supply for fun <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>

13.1 lightning dmg is 10% better than 12.0 for example?
does the value matter
btw gresham
it's rigged from the start
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
and Chinese national holiday start next week
all the whales somehow already knew the tech
and on 7.0 first day
beta testers didn't report lightning hit went through bleed multiplier during beta
and have all their employees searching every single account history activity
unless they rollback and refund from 7.0 launch till now
so now they physically can't fix this bug
million dollars is on the line
but here is the fun part
Judah was marked as a bug
it's a bug
it's not
fuck does that mean? <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
are you fucking dumb
and Griseo doesn't have anything but Bleed multiplier
how lightning work is that each hit went through bleed multiplier
still better
<a:mojjcheck:1113492691288871063>
knowers?
like 13.1 is 10% better than 12.0 for example
or as long as it's lightning it's broken
does the value of lightning hit matter
wait
how many lightning hit can we get
now is the fun part
lowkey

but run is probably not fully optimized
i got 655 with S0 SS SS
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
is S2 to SS HoO a big diff?
dw you're always being rude
are you trying to cook sth up
wait what
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
look like it
why did Aqua talking to Heki
Unwavering confidence
time to check on lil guy
she is Her
Cause she has highest dps ever since Honkai exist
so LB will steal Kevin next patch from S0 right?
real S0 Trio will keep struggling
but yea, temp is too high now <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
<:worrythink:398047795119915010>
that's lower than S0 SS SS
how slow do you need to be
this guy need a vod review
if he get more points from turning off GD QTE
im not even kidding

Like Act Age author was senteced for riding his bike and grab highschool girl’s asses
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>

Act age author is not a pedo but a molester
And his name were still on the credit

That they still making live action of it
Rurouni is too fucking good

So you’re using 4G now? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
That’s +1 dish for dinner, no?
in MA it does yea
i will see if it stop the clock in MA
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
it doesn't
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
but in here she goes by GS
her battlesuit name
Skywalker Impression
maybe but the fact that Stardust has 2 or 3 phases i can't remember mean they leave the window open for the 1st S-rank to ignore at least 1 phase <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
if it were to be PE that shield is gone in 1 ult
rn Griseo only give them the capability to damage the Stardust shield
to be the PE you need to at least ignore 1 phase of the boss
yea that's the problem, even in RL it's still too long to bypass Stardust mechanic <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
they will cook up a PE Stardust soon
and Griseo is still taking too long to bypass Stardust mechanic
S-rank Stardust will probably be Ice
same case with MA and PE <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
is SSS HTR worse than SSS QK in term of value
im thinking why can't LB beat HN at 9S
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
HN got buffed and beat LB again
cause result will just be the same
probably no right
do you think they will ever release S-rank bleed support?
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
it's not even close
and HN still is best bleed dps
i can give 10 patches
best bleed dps
she still is
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
which was 510
in CN temp at least
S2 HoH do better than real S0 Trio
can't really tell if it explain his score or not but maybe
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
wait is it
oh that explain it
bro said wakes up
also his score is pisslow too for SS Hare and SS QK
<:ICANTTAKETHISANYMORE:1154037205082320947>
Wakes up
i have not seen anyone turning off GD QTE and be like Bet, this is the idea setup
<:ICANTTAKETHISANYMORE:1154037205082320947>
why is this guy dead set believe on turning off GD QTE
<a:nessie:1163272765651042334>
Getting close
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
cause below T100 is probably at least 3 more person same score with him
2 points
i don't think it's 1 point away bud
why is it always EU

he suck at both

not before new Bio Lightning
and SSS QK is better than SSS HTR
like a beast
HN does
she doesn't have S-rank bleed support
you know what is Luna's problem <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
it's not even close
and HN is like 802
i saw that one yea
like a beast
cause LB 1 shot all bosses in RL
he only did 1 run S0
probably not enough info from his Bilibili content creators that he trusted
he didn't talk about GS yet
yea that's all
what did she eat <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>

She isn't meant to cover Bleed weather
-> The boss made for her is Bleed weather
we just change Luna to anyone else in the future
this one is copypasta worthy
Luna is a broken as fuck lightning dps with support capabilities, able to cover a lot of weathers on her own just due to sheer numbers, PSY and double dps coverage - if there's a question between two units and Luna is one of them, no matter whats the other, then yes. Luna is the answer. Also newer = more longevity, as a support she also gets that support life insurance warranty on top of her perks
Luna solo entire HI3
HTR bad, Luna good
the usual
<:dautim:998125864904572939>
his ego got damaged
but after he realized how bad he was compare to people that actually good at the game
like he was humble for 1-2 days
isn't it kinda fucked up that joining Central actually make him worse, cause his ego got damaged so now he has to relieve his stress on maincord even more
yea and Him + B-stastion content creators also already proved that fact
cause he is competing with a lot of people that doesn't even exist
im starting to think he actually play in VIP EU
bro has too much faith in his server
no but that server is called EU lolicon center for a reason
you are in that server Tet, why are you acting surprised

i will probably only do 10 runs on Kevin anw
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
i will give it a try once im home
my transition is still scuffed
i need to work around the transition
maybe 816 with 4* Punny
with 4* Dabber
yea capscore is definitely around 814 <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
Dabber is still fine, just less good compare to Punny
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
But overall Punny is still not worth if it cost you future imporant pulls
It’s the window of dps that Punny improve
Probably Punny tho
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
probably not matter but if you pull 4/4 GS then it will help on HoS
Griseo Skywalker yea
crafting Holmes is fine, GS is still gonna be T3 <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
Wil see if i can push to 810+ at least

but can you do this irl tho
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
A-rank was more expensive in term of getting to SSS <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
kinda messed up
if Griseo is just bleed support mean there is still window for lightning SP
no, GD was 5.7, CN was 6.2 <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
not necessarily Fire
maybe Lightning will have new SP after S-rank Hua too
actually <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
after S-rank Hua, CN is next
no, she is next in line to be replaced <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
they was trying to replace her asap
like AE is fun but she was definitely not HoS in term of lifespan
and they was going to replace her eventually with new SP
AE was the elemental support
i mean that's exactly how it supposed to go with AE <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
why <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but pulling her might also be troll
not pulling her is probably a troll yea <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
GD HTR
a bug that Mihobo can't do anything about it
but if she is T1 because of lightning hit then it's just bug abusing anw
cause people didn't use lightning hit in beta
she could be T1 <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
and LB is T2 there
with Bleed Vill-V for example
they already fixed all of HoS's bugs so only need to repalce Bleed Optimus <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
we didn't
no
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
only Optimus Prime is bugged
like an idiot
and LB won't even be T1 there
we will get another Bleed boss
they only fix valk bugs
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
it has 99 hitcount shield bars instead
it doesn't have spiders yea
Bleed one, outside of transition should be the same boss tho <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
it come back next patch <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
yea <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
cause it's fucked up BKE opener
and the only one everyone noticed
and PV is 1 of them
like in the patch note they wrote optimized some valks QTE range and trigger condition
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
no clue why they did it tho
they did say it in the patch note
they change PV QTE range so now you have to dash a whole yard back
which is a feature if you use it
it's free if you window dragging tho
yea they changed BKE opener this patch so it's harder now
shall we window dragging?
47904 is free yea
<a:nessie:1163272765651042334>
oh wait i thought you mean 47920
<:Oldge:951410911220989983>

okay but check out this guy moves tho
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
HoS weapon switch, most of the time it happened because you try to press button too fast too many times
no seriously tho, don't try to cut too many steps
don't try to go too fast
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>

<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
transportation, groceries and stuffs
he doesn't but still got affected
cause i think warzone become more intense
but i will let it slight this time
750 with SS Hare and SS QK is kinda low
does it matter
already lost before the fight begin
cause NA stand for No Aqua
still better than NA right?
does no one playing in EU
isn't 785 S2 QK score in EU temp
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
Pig, Rimestar and +1 new boss for Hua
they do right?
does Fire lack Bio dps
or just Bio dps
S-rank fire support and ignite bio dps potentially
isn't it kinda obvious
<a:paimonWhale:865505065660579871>
don't let the game win
can't wait to fight LB's boss without LB?
why are you even waiting for next patch
What’s up nerds
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
Hope it’s enough for 7.0
Finally saving up 1k4 wafers
Can probably 756
That weapon switch delay 1 pts
Except for the weapon switch when transition start it’s only missiles yea
<a:nessie:1163272765651042334>
it's already out in SEA, HoS can still do double evade
they always leave a window open to improve
that's just how Mihoyo create new valks <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
won't make that mistake again
so Echo turn out omega cracked to powercreep RC
they overdid it back then with JK
they still leave a window open for Lightning
Lightning is also lacking in shieldbreak
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>

<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
probably a lot?
how much is her S2 affect her dps btw?
i think HTR + LB is capscore for 9S
LB dps on wolf like a beast <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<@416445660443967491> <@370438895965306882> 
for cool ending
still believe in Easter Bunny and Queen of England?
what other Teri
i still don't know if S0 LB is actually worth it <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
Ice ignite dps will want Ice hit
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
yea the next Ignite dps
so it's a feature
everyone affixes lightning hit now
but probably too late anw
if they want to keep the game environment clean they will just refund all the money got topup in Thursday
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
but they also can't track back how much did the whale put in their affixes
it's obviously a bug because they marked Judah interaction as bug
this lightning affixes situation is kinda fucked up ngl
on patch day all of them affixes it immediately so Mihobo wouldn't be able to rollback
oh they did, they didn't report it back to Mihobo, the whales in Nirvana beta figured it out <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
for no reason
i checked some vods and the sp on SS1 HoS always match SSS HoS
don't know if they fix it or not
oh i think there is another bug with HoS that close the gap between SS1 and SSS HoS
too bad they won't deliver the bug version <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
BKE can also miss her combo if you continue the wrong opener
on every valks
you always roll the right opener on HoS
if you miss with her it's because you continue with the wrong opener
HN doesn't have that issue
you moron
he is next to you
like wtf man
oh yea, for some reason you can miss Optimus after ult <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Dudu is busy flying around like an idiot
cause she can full buff instant so you can use it with GC handslam
Punny is actually really crucial especially on this boss yea <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
and chain commbo -> swap weapon -> sword AA is the fastest
spear combo -> swap weapon -> chain AA is slowest
using other 2 combo will slow down because the AA animation on spear and chain is slower than sword
<:YEP:1114107892908429354>
using anything but chain will be slower than chain -> swap weapon -> AA
at that exact sp amount on HoS
and to prevent Optimus from doing his next animation
chain was the fastest there
<a:nessie:1163272765651042334>

dude literally explain with 10 A4 paper
like when i asked my friend about slots mechanic in gambling site
to even call it a decent hit
you have to hit it by 5 more layers
even when you hit
but do you know slots nowaday have 10 different layers of RNG
there is joy in it
so you keep praying you get it early
if i have to think of a reason, gacha pull is more fun nowaday cause you know when you will hit
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>

for what reason
yea i don't know why you want to watch someone gambling slots
for no reason
dude still have 40k viewers even on a gambling streaming site
with how much he made, even when he lose 1 mil a day, i don't even think it's net negative for him
yea he saw the chance and he immediately took it
:angryderpmelon:

owo math (14000/600)*100
owo math 560*250
660 - 100 = 560
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>

oh shit gratz
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
check this guy moves tho
looking for everyone
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
for fun
the trinity of combat
game is just over
like when you see someone hit Gifts, Long distance and Cyber Leech
good job man
Fiora just suddenly have 40 AD, AP, Amor and MR
like bro fucking Gifts of the fallen
the augments in set 6 wasn't giving this much power compare to all the set after <:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
it enable the weirdest board possible by putting up traits to gether
that augment was so fucking good
there was an augment called Stand United 1/2/3 from silver to pris and that augment give you ad + ap based on how many traits active on your board
augments should be like accessories only, make your board better, and not hit this or 8th
yea they need to tone down all the specific augments and get rid of half the busted augments
it just dead
there is no flex play
like if you deadass commit to play Nilah then you want Ionia and Vanquisher as your trait on 3-1
but now you need to tailor your board to get the augment of the line you're commit to
set 6 introducing augments was fine because there weren't that many specific trait augments
while slamming Titans BT on 3-2
Kaisa and Fiora 2 on 7
but because his game plan went well and he hit the units he commit to early
like boxbox did really well on tourney not because he is better than soji or robi
the difference between a good player and a bad player is the ability to see the line the game giving you
you commit really hard since 2-1 or the latest 3-1 by slamming items already
anyone that say just playing flex is delusional
there is no flex play
flex is literally dead
yea the problem so far with TFT after set 6 is that
actual AI generated balancing
top comp previous = trash next patch
this set has been a roller coaster of balancing
not a whole line of multicaster
yea i think only TF need a lil buff
like actual terrible
but god the balancing of this set has been terrible
B-patch soon in 3-4 hours
<:icant:1162065269611565116>
so everyone and their moms just run TF legend into forcing TF
can top 4
2* TF, Galio, Velkoz, Sona, Taliyah, Swain and 1* J4
oh they overbuffed multicaster
holy shit <:dongerj:981641448057356289>
<@148145559897636865>

Moriaty reveal and that’s about it
Yea what’s up
<:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
That’s what make a 10 for me honestly
Just keep writing the world that you see, the ideas that you want to share through your manga
Like who care if your manga might become less appealing to the mass
Undead Unluck stand out the most in Jump for me along with Akane and CSM
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
And end up with writing safe routes
A lot of new manga with interesting ideas come nowhere because the author become afraid to keep going on
I see, for me it’s about how far they dare to ride forward with their ideas
like the 1st one of that genre
all of my 10 are actually because of their unique tbf <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Reading it fullstop actually make it stand out as an amazing ride
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
i think i would give it 9.5/10
I just finished reading Undead Unluck again,now that i read it in 1 go
<a:catPls:1113921108094242898>
like do this irl
they just have a bunch of money lying around to custom TFT for CN playerbase
still same client
reduce of playerbase and stuffs
they thought it would be too much risk to seperate T game from League client <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
but T game devs refuse it
you know Riot actually thought about creating a seperate client for T game
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
or concept room
like a public beta?
if you think about it, isn't League rn just a holder for T game
no Silco = inferior game
is there Silco in it
<a:Timeout:1157060847894544495>
too bad the game fucking blow <:DankUp:1061806229455896646>

You know roulette right? If the ball land on Red 7 times in a row then the probability of it landing on Red the 8th time will be 0.5^7, but if the bet you have for that round is all of your saving, would you actually believe in probability of 0.0078% or the gut feeling of 50%

how much did he spend again?
S0 LB >= SS1 HoT
so the result will still be the same
it will also buff HoT
if the new SP is lightning and not bleed
also <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
so like there is no disconnection in LB dps rot
she use Handel
cause she doesn't use Turg
but GD work fine with HTR <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
with the direction they're going, if i don't go for at least S2 LB and GH, they're not the support slot <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
LB is also not a lightning support for my account if she is S0 <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>

Or is the ele lines bug being busted
The gap between her S0 and SS1 HoT is it actually because she is strong

S0 LB 4/4 is basically only a better HoT for my account
Probably depend on my mood <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>

cause it's too easy
that's the neat part, not even a Kaiji game
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
the 1st episode's game was inspired by Kaiji Part 4 story iirc

even a simple game can turn scary with high stake
what matter is the thrill and stake of gambling <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
like Tonegawa and Kaiji was basically playing rock paper scissors with more steps
yea he doesn't really spam game in his work, and all of his games actually got simplified to the extreme
after finished introducing Kaiji in part 1, Fukumoto only do 1 game per arc and 2 games at most
Part 2 only have 1 and a half game
if you read part 2 anytime soon it will have less game than part 1 <:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
so his organ can't sell
oh that's cause Tonegawa is old <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
yea because of a card game
all of his life working for Teiai mean nothing in Hyodo's eyes
man is as cruel as it can be

it also a 50/50 gamble
yea the trick are smart too, it's also not perfect <:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
it's the most realistic way to counter Tonegawa's cheat instead of adjust your pulse and hearbeat
yea the moment Kaiji chose to cut his ear i was amazed too <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>

about this one tho, if you can't kill Tank in RL with 9S Sunny then i think you're just disabled
his ego is too big for him to be the next fragile
like i think Aqua is definitely good at the game but he will never reach the level that he think he is atm
but his attitude make him a clown
like he is better than 90% of people in here and maincord
if we are being serious, Aqua is also a good player
do you know that Aqua used to try to correct Kyo once in maincord?
if Kyoshiro is doing it then it's definitely the correct answer
and try to fix your rot from there
just watch other refs and form your own with their runs
but instead of spending time like a moron for meaningless part
im not saying you shouldn't try to make your own rot

Hare TF is terrible at any given rank
even 6S won't be even close to HoR
cause 9S can compensate the lack of damage from elf
that's 9S only
wtf man
owo math 47904 + 39853 + 31946
what's up nerds
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
You get to use HoH
Shouldn’t you be happy

Don’t blame him
The only woman he ever touch is his mom
But at least know the basis of how to shut up
Like, i don’t even ask people to respect literature like how i expect everyone to be
Simple as that
Do not talk
If you are a retard
People nowaday lack so much respect for literature and at the same time trying to sound smart actually tilt me
Retard no.2: This captainverse event is so shit, Sirin hair suddenly turn back to purple without explanation
Carv: They did mention her hair got changed back
Retard no.2: I didn’t see it
Carv: Sent proof
Retard no.2: Oh i skipped everything after the CG cause the event is bad
I will give 1 example and it will be more than enough
Everything come from his mouth are the same as Aqua giving advices
Everything

you act like a bot
<a:classic:1058849393370992650>
i think i act like 19 <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
if we weren't online friends
i will probably be the one to tell the cop to arrest you guys irl
definitely not gonna happen btw <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
i really need to ask my friend to buy me the digital copy of other Devilman versions that doesn't get translated
i think there are like 10 different versions of Devilman
Devilman is hella good, all of it versions
Sukuna vs anyone is hopeless atp
at least there is that
at least Yuta and Kenjaku fight will definitely be a good fight
like i get that a story need a strong villian but Sukuna is on impossible level right now
im down for Gege to just say fuck it and kill all of the main cast, Sukuna win and end the manga
the author basically explain that Sukuna modificate his body that way for the best use of jujutsu, 4 arms and 3 mouths 
bro if last more than 1 chapter it would be crazy
Kashimo get teared apart likea  fucking balloon and having a flashback about his life before dying so Japanese reader are saying this flashback shit is definitely Sukuna's power atp 
oh btw, you down for this week JJK leak?
and not i outplayed you like a beast i am
cause the author is still new to the industry so all of his fight end up with i have a trump card and you don't
but the fights are honestly not even that hype
2 good things are character designs and power system
JJK has a terrible storyline
cashout with 9S Trio
you already know i will not pull anything for 1 year
like if i knew trio will be a thing back in 5.5
or else it will be too vague playing the game like that
if only you know the future honestly
and 2 of them need rank to unleash the beast within
like the only exception for S-rank in this game so far is a combination of 3 S-rank valks
that's for sure
but not better than the next S-rank valk
she is definitely a good pull value especially for new players
Valk value 
- Power : strong, meta 
- Usage : 2-3 bosses, good coverage
- Pulling advice : don't because she will be 1 patch old by next week
this is the only true meta advice if you don't have crystal
where is my guide for new players
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
cause she is the only one after HN
i won't called LB as mid
:sherlock:
dude is on some sherdock level of investigating
not damage wise
oh he was talking about boss frequency
cause everytime he speak it turn to gold
his real name is probably Midas
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
yea 19th
is 7.0 5 weeks or 6 weeks
3 weeks from now
5 patches from now when Hare get 1 boss per patch dude will probably stop praising her
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
she just has most use of this moment for him
bro i don't even think this guy like Hare
if he doesn't like something then its' wrong
this guy has god complex
valk he doesn't like
<a:Timeout:1157060847894544495>
that's the weird part
bro he is the same age as me
EU lolicon center
you already know he will hit them back with im always right but thanks for your input
just make sure to stay in research facility
but i will give you the link to central
he will get cooked instead
he can't cook in Central
bro relax
he just pour all of them into his account at once
and he actually sound like he doesn't have that much dispoable income
this guy invest in the weirdest way possible
what a beast of valk
and great for MA even
this guy is deadass believe LB is the strongest dps in the game
at least SS0
and get a hair cut too maybe
she gives him money every weeks for him to take a shower
cause it's mom money
he is technically F2P
she must be below Kiana 1 tier
no but it's Teri
just like his SS2 HFI
like a beast
he will go for SS1
Aqua is going even beyond
Shall we go for 4/4 LB?
it's either black screen or fade away scene
that's the only way to show dead scene in CN
really? haven't see any trouble with her yet <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
what's wrong with it? <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
only need to finish all missions for all good rewards
you don't need to get all the chests
after the bridge game
oh you will soon know him <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
but he never complain when playing game
like he is sick in the head, greedy, cruel
the final game of part 1 is what make Hyodo stand out the most for me <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
yea Hyodo always playing fair
they still have flaws because he is not the super smart guy, he is just desperate to win
also i think what great about Kaiji is that all of his plans are not perfect <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
if i were to play a game like that even 1 in my life i would be scare shitless from gambling and debt
<:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
and somehow Kaiji addicted to that thrill
yea the bridge game is basically all about courage or luck
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
you also need luck and the courage to pull it through
yea Fukumoto philosophy about gambling is not just strategy
the rock paper scissors game? <:okk:1110244301184696360>
<a:Aware:889021591776817172>
that's what your mom said about you
it's now or never
time to make a nobeta's role
yea they mentioned it in chapter 1
which one
in fact all the sound smart manga out there wish it could be World Trigger
if only the author does not suffer from genetic disease of his family, World Trigger can easily replace MHA
it has been 3 years since the start of new arc and every characters are doing paperwork + playing videogame and i still enjoy every single chapter
you can give it a try, one of the best strategic manga out there
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
<@148145559897636865> do you know world trigger
Soon
<:xdd:1099462604386205758>
nice hair, granny
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Or funeral
It can be used on wedding
And rebirth
In flowe language it stand for purity yea
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
You know what White Lily mean right
Yea it was HoS that started the whole new generation
<a:PepePls:1063201226747027466>
<:ICANTTAKETHISANYMORE:1154037205082320947>
and Trio
then he should have shut up about HN
the start of 6.6
so that's like 3 patches
130 days atm
like if you start in 5.5 you're banned from talking about 5.4 backward
we should have banned people from talking about patch they never play
but his brain will never get the pri version
holy shit, HoT's dedicated support, Fallen Rosemary, which was as useless as his brain before pri
<@148145559897636865>
It’s jail time
Ref is only 756 iirc
That’s sick o<:WorryYou:1101221412817092650>
do you think his ego got damaged in Central so he has to let it heal once in a while in maincord?
idek who are everyone he talking about
even when hell freeze over and heaven turn upside down, Aqua will always be Aqua
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
human will never change their nature
what a steal
:pawgchomp:
or fuck each other
so they started making male devil that want to fuck the protag
Destiny Child started out as a game where every female devils want to make out with the protag but after the 1st annivesary, the survey came out as 20% of the playerbase are female
after a certain of time if the % of gay and women are high enough they will adjust their direction
yea a lot of gacha games start out only target on male audiences
bro spent 2 hours malding on Inferno ER
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
probably Beast
9S LB can definitely 47952 without the tech but she is busy on Heimdall this week in CN
what test
:thetech:
with window drag
9S HoT can 47952 tho
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
this one is +2 compare to HoT and HN iirc
wonder what will Akainu react when he learn about Imu existence <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
will Goofy beat Kizaru or no
probably gonna beat the shit out of everyone
Saturn will going all out to capture Vegapunk
yea leak is out
after 27 years finally
1 of the Gorosei will finally going all out this week
yea i had fun on all 3, only annoy by hitlag and no stagger res  <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
still worth the Bchip
Sunny is fun but her bosses are all terrible <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:yoimiYAY:1057068376222085210>
time to sleep until next cycle
i got this 30 mintues in
@ gresham
904 should still be free
cause you waste another frame for it
that dodge probably screw up 920
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
i remember when CN was mentioning about it
oh right they increase PV's qte range
still working
<:chicken:850323396624908299> ?
let me see how your damage going
time to stream 1 run <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
he is the limit
not including Aqua tho
but the point of malding is still trying to see your limit
like if your score happened to be among the best of the server, that's good <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
yea being competitive is always trying to beat the you of yesterday, finding out your limit
time to guess which server dude is playing
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Homu and Homies capscore now is 9S HoS

<:WorryYou:1101221412817092650>
Aka: Do i really abandon my character morality to save my game time? Am i that kind of person? Probably
If you still want to play games, include my incest ship
do you think Mengo is helding Aka hostage or no
sure man <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
Ruby during filming be like: We need to do it seriously for better impression

im down for them to include Ai and Hikaru making out scene
guess who is happy rn <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
in the movie they're making, next chapter confirmed that there will be a kiss between Hikaru and Ai
if i were to be a beast ~798 is still possible i think
795 seem to my cap <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
<@148145559897636865> you down for this week OnK leak before tmr chapter? Just a fun detail

your level 1 Nahida?
what's that
having to keep acting uncontrol, yelling and entertain his chat for 8 hours straight is killing him
btw setsuko is reaching his limit
cause dude is literally a brand risk
for them to promote him
you know im pretty sure Tectone also give OTK's members either money or sucking their dicks
and not another Female C
what to say to make you unique
like outside of streaming hours you need to do research on how to gain more viewers kind of stuff
tbh if you want to make it big in streaming you need to commit really hard for it
<a:streaming:1114109761076596816> ?
you guys are meant for jail
like the amount of behind the scenes he pulled to make it to his current spot is insane
yea but he is meant for success anw, he is just that type of people
he pulled all the strings he can to make it big
but pandemic happened, people start watching stream more and he ride that tide
if it not work out he will move on and apply for a job
his plan was to stream for only 2 years
he is new
time sure flies
now he is like 1 of the biggest names in the industry
i still remember when Ludwig was just an Amongus streamer
<a:Thinkge:1000116410384658482>
yea Qt and Ludwig really know how to make an event
do you think if you buy both you can slam it into Jugg spat
bud really brought his jersey and a spat to the auction
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
someone bid $676 for a spat
<@148145559897636865>
the odd are not that bad
129 pulls for S0 4/4 LB <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
owo math 36120/280
owo math 57400-21280
owo math 76*280
so 57.400 xtals for all PE stamps
owo math 170*6
Punny
the only non 4* are the one i don't have
all of my elfs are 4*
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
maybe S0 4/4 LB
idk what to pull to get all the PE stamps
preferably QUA crab
ngl i do want some QUA bosses back in action <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
will still probably score lower than SS0 HC SS0 HTR
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>

I just want to see the emotes moving
Like if you see me randomly spam emotes it cause i don’t want to talk
If i don’t want to talk i just spam emotes
Or else he would actually go crazy
Big bro has to take 3 weeks break at the end of each set
Even big bro can’t stream that much consistently like X
Oh it’s extremely tiring
Is he in jail yet
What’s going on with X these days anw
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Like 10k a month? Without including other sources, just from ads and youtube
Remember it’s easy money
Be honest
If you guys have the chance to do like that, would you guys do it or no
like a beast
on Twitch
the last guy just stream Family Guy
speaking of stretch, time to check Twitch Just Chatting section
<@148145559897636865> <@416445660443967491> no it's fucking not
maybe it's only 1 vid
i will check the channel of the girl in the vid
tbh i can't blame them for doing that, it's the easy way to make money on youtube but it just feel wrong <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
you're pregnant?
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>

<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
like the one recently with Abyss BKE
i only trust live server result
basing results on beta is fake anw
might change on live tho
but she is the only 2nd option as far as beta go
she is way behind LB
only HN
need the jelly to rerun tho
she might do well in MA Big Jelly
SSS BKE: 9S LB > 9S HoT (+1)
SSS Tank: 9S LB = 9S HoT
SSS Clock: they use both for capscore
SSS Heimdal: <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
i think so far
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
she just stop the clock for 40 seconds
HoT doesn't have good dps but she has the best TF this game can offer
is already one hell of an achivement
in MA, even matching HoT
im not even kidding but
she tie with 9S HoT
or triple physical supports
but great in MA is HN
i know she has all the lightning bosses of HoT
chill <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
and he hit them back with best dps and great in MA
oh context of that is that some newbie asking him if LB is good
Unwavering confidence in his word
but when someone point it out he hit them back with i don't live to please other so your opinions doesn't matter to me
oh cause he is just wrong 99% the time
he who become Him
one of a kind
serious answer is that this guy is peak entertainment
cause he is Him
he missed that part
yea Tet at bottom
this guy is actually thinking MA = Abyss
great in MA
<a:LETSFUCKINGGO:1012872161763008602>
still delusional
he is not completely gone yet
<@&1148979669950021692>

Easter Bunny
you know what is also not real
TFT is game for real men
what's worse than playing League
she is playing League, can't be worse than that

<@516591030326525983> 
of all the 3 names hak spit out, Spirit Circle is the actual good one, Masturbation Master Kurosawa is the interesting one and Molester Man is hak amazon wishlist
Spirit Circle is good yea
i think it's called Twitch.tv
the manga where they banging? <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
also i would say i don't have specific taste in reading, i would read anything, some i will drop after 1st arc or 2nd arc but overall i just like to read <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
just like your bitch list
Molester Man is a manga based on a shitpost in 4chan
2 out of 3 are good, the last one is just hak wishful thought
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
but the manga has 6 arc
no, each arc only last like 100 chapters to 200 chapters
<a:GAMBAADDICT:1088508671144759358>
<:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
but that's not how gambling work
other gambling manga always have the MC be a beast at mathing and 10 steps ahead
i really love Kaiji, the only author in manga industry know what it mean to gamble <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
i would say a solid 8
it start out goofy but got interesting after
158 yea
but he get addicted to the thrill
at 1 point he did
and yea, Kaiji is real fucked up <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
i think
mangadex does have full Kaiji part 1 in Portuguese
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
it will not be Hina just saying

Like about 50% the time
Probably old news, he has been taking break a lot this year
Then either die a meaningless death or never mention again
cause the authro keep creating problems and have a new character appear to solve it
Yea it get messy af the more the story going
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
The fuck are you smoking
And had her died next chapter to seal off 30% of AFO 2.0
So he created a female hero of USA with All Might personality
Literally AFO 2.0 from out of thin air
And the author probably was using drug but he scale the lil bro way too fucking much
Also i take a peek during the arc where MC start fighting the successor of AFO
Like, great job bro
But now it’s literally a power to steal other powers
It was supposed to be a power than rely on effort to defeat prodigy
I like the early symbolic meaning of One for All
So now One for All become a budget All for One
The author give him 10 more abilities instead
Instead of having the MC learn how to use his power more efficient and team up with everyone in his class
And the 2nd one was when he scaled the villian power to heaven
So he decided that it’s time for Mirio to fuck off
He made Mirio too interesting as a human and a hero that the MC feel like a mess next to him
First was Mirio’s power and 2nd was One For All being able to use different abilities of past owners
For me it’s 2 events
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>

Japan industry work in a <:poggfrenn:1087713199215886377> circle so like all the big names in the industry just let the band sign under them go around and share the work

Mushoku wish it could be Frieren
That’s like comparing PS5 to Atari
Alright relax
Like calm down man
Instead of supplies
That’s right, buy a slave
Like in manga a literal newbie just start his adventure, what is he gonna do first?
Manga has a hardon for slaves and Manhwa has a hardon for elves
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
Space Elf?
That make no sense at all
So we have game genre
Not with a bunch of cavemen surrouding MC
Usually they want to write an isekai story with modern mindset
That’s where it get complicated
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Like does these authors realize how absurd that idea actually is
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Also why does manhwa always make game currency have 1:1 ratio with real money
There is no way a game with 10 million players ever let that happen
Like chill dude
There are always a secret achievement or farm spot that only MC can unlock through some random shit
The most tilting part of all manhwa about games out there is that
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
what if it's Honkai
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>

dude got sent to another world and his only ability is summoning other people from his world in the form of avatar, so he spent 2 months to setup his base like a game and tell people that they're playing the newest VR game
there is this novel i just started and the author fake the VR game troupe
UR is basically just everyone gather up
i don' think SAO has that much game genre to cook anw
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
this time he said hope so
he said might be
bro calm down, you literally just got brain damaged like 2 volumes ago
the most crazy part is still how Kirito despite being traumatized by games or VR technology, in the beginning of Unital Ring, dude still working in a VR lab
from 21 to the current 26
6 volumes actually
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>

you know Reki said that Unital Ring will be the finale of SAO

but Cosmic mean you without enough atk you can't reduce the cross HP to the threshold
the damage is awkward if you use KoS

Cause i know it will be about HoH
No
I think
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
@ gresham this is this week best setup if you have 9S HoR
That’s neat
Is this real for troll
<@516591030326525983> 
NA will probably be in 12 hours?
yea SEA just got it
i mean the chapter in our client
wait, your CN Honkai? <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
the enhanced Hua
just let you know if you're interest to test it yourself
they're on beta yea, Moriso did have a vid about it
don't know when will it be up for NA tho
oh Honkai new story will up today, it's the chapter where you get to play enhanced Hua suits <@148145559897636865>
<:dankHug:888543978377584670>
i was planning on reading Dandandan like 6 months ago
i will have to read it later tho
yea dw, im not that strict even tho i sound like it, i just hate it when they start forgetting their roots <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
like, just relax
relax man <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
the final battle of Shaman King is 5 against 1 and the antagonist completely crush them, like just 1 sided it so the protagonist pull out his trump card, telling the mother of the antagonist and ask her to scold him 
it's the perfect example of the former
do you know Shaman King? <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
just who yell the skill name louder
later down the road they don't even exorcise anything anymore
i just feel like getting jebaited into reading it with the former
like Make the exorcist falling in love
i like an exorcist manga that have shonen theme
i don't like shonen manga that happened to have the MC being an exorcist <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
i know that one is actually good
oh i keep forgetting to read that one
no way he just get off of seeing dead bodies right?
killing all the talents so that he can become the very best
isn't that what Hikaru doing rn?
the one kill them become the good character
yea she went poof
probably like real life honestly
just meaningless death
like not to accomplish anything
for fun tho
yea they kill a lot of characters later on
Gojo something
the teacher dude died
so they're trying their best make sure everyone not laughing at the manga
they're still butthurt that their fav character get Offscreened
probably due to JJK fans honestly
it's the Morbius of WSJ
for some reasons everyone hyping it up
oh it's a meme
when the plot start moving
i'll allow it, the manga looking too safe atm tho so i would suggest waiting for like 10 more chapters <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
safe opening, nothing stand out of the line or extraordinary, action scenes are good, characters are decent
i read the 1st chapter
<:Clueless:947671183103508530>
<@148145559897636865>
amazing even
Carv is typing up a storm
<a:TheVoices:1116001413370228877>
like father like son?
next to a corpse
cause dude spent 1 whole page talking about stars and talents
it would be hilarious too
ngl if it turn out that Hikaru is also just a normal person without any stealing talent ability and he is just fucked up in the head
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
the allegation looking like it's right
spitting some random shit next to him
Aqua let a lil girl he didn't know anything about
so you're saying all this time
also i for sure thought this lil gril was some kind of a ghost <a:mojjcheck:1113492691288871063>
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
but there is always that 1%
yea im also 99% sure it can't be Ai
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
or a random girl
is it Ai
who do you think the lil girl is
serious question
i will let Aka cook this one, a movie that big he will definitely have to explain behind the scene works <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
or Miyako even
Akane, Kana or Ruby
i only interest who will Aqua end up with now
yea if i were to be honest
is the plot in the room with us or not yet
i can't take OnK seriously until the plot start moving again
that's why he is a clown
but he is not even 10% of what he think he is
if he is 50% of what he think he is
you know people wouldn't make fun of him that much
ofc he know about lore
cause he is a beast
that i want to believe he is a lolicon
like he has no idea about anything in lore
but he is so dumb
probably the latter if we are serious
that much is guarantee
the beast is 100% a lolicon
Aqua in Oshi no Ko
not the beast <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
he is proving the allegation that Aqua is a lolicon <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
He is cooking
You might say
Aka is up to sth
<@148145559897636865> time to catch up with OnK
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
<@82358863155703808> new character, Mayden
S2 QK is definitely not as needed as S2 HTR
pretty much same with Abyss too
the difference between S0 and S2 QK in MA is 1 CA in the opener
QK doesn't need S2 to beat HoH
what no
and not because you are competing with 10 players for T100 leaderboard
yea it's definitely a miracle man
<a:wawa:1118831924509675530>

<:worrySniperAngry:920552131642142741>
LB and GH will always win
Basically if same rank
Moron
She already won in V2
Ranked HTR is still better than non-rank LB and GH
Unless you only go for S0 LB and S0 GH
Yea definitely
like a beast
go for LB and GH
the problem is that do we ditch HTR in Lightning and Fire or no
trust
GH will save Fire <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
even at 9S
but overall it's definitely not HoR boss
so make up for the Abyss buff
Ice just has a lot of shieldbreak atm <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
but 9S HoR did better than S1 Sunny in Nirvana
she is T2
HoV is definitely not HoR boss btw
save the mental for Kallen
this boss is not a good one to mald anw <a:NopeNope:1045725686834401300>
Aqua probably talking out of his ass again <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
yea when Tet said he act normal in maincord i would figure he has 50% chance to be Central resident <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<a:duckass:1148861036351471637>
gresham is okay, he typed a storm yesterday
cause people in Central really hate to talk in maincord
maybe he is actually the no.2 of EU
lol sound like a beast actually
<@370438895965306882>
and see if Gresham has any excuses for doubting the beast
need to summon Gresham to ask about him
he just spitting shit out of his ass
this guy doesn't provide context
friend of the beast
obviously right?
is he better than Gresham
who is Smiley
bro pull the most random rank up as possible
he is SS2 S2 S2 yea
compare to the beast
misssing 1 s
yea SS HTR
i would use HoF whenever i can, i still use HoH from time to time on other ice bosses  <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
<:WorryYou:1101221412817092650>
i just like to use HoF more
Fire doesn't have enough shieldbreak atm
S0 HoH is probably better than SSS HoF tbh
SSS HoF <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
HoF yea
700 atm <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:4head:634509223841103872>
Just don’t have stress
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
Wonder how many valks do you need to max out new dorm buff
These guys really hate SSS valk
at least one before i pass away
i really want to use that quote 1 day
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
tell him as time pass, history became legend, legend became myth

it's so fucking grey
holy fucking shit
<@148145559897636865>
<:4head:634509223841103872>
that Astral Ring is 95% to be story mode only, not sure if old valks can use it or not  <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
No team buff duration, just hitting the buttons with your valks
No, more like a “bonus round” kind of thing
You enter a state where you can do whatever you want, only need to account for the duration
Basically think of Frenzy Mode in some puzzle games
No it’s your fault now
<:dankHug:888543978377584670>
The beast
This one
<:WorryYou:1101221412817092650>
Mean whenever he spit out stupid shit it’s your fault Carv
The beast said his lore knowledge come frome Carvati’s translations
need to adjust the rot
680, my damage is awkward atm <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>

Present to you by Moriso Honkai
why does the gif has credit
what does that mean
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
only exception is HoS SSS
cause it got overwritten by Abyss starting sp
SS1: When Luna Pledge is off field and deal Bleed DMG, gain 2 > 2.5 SP for herself (CD: 0.5s)
i think her crucial rank is SS1
it's like good when you need it and not when you don't kind of rank
i would say decent <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
saving until EOS?
but no HoS gear
yea should be enough
owo math (70+96+70)*280
is 250 enough for S2 4/4 <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
making 7.0 expensive for no reason
the most fucked up part is still no discount on HoS gear
she does extremely good in lightning weather tho <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
that's not discount, it just SP supply
<:Looking:1154847280529162260>
but how good is S0
she is definitely good
owo math 76*280
so it will still be 76 on avg
HoS new gear doesn't have discount
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
serious question, shall we pull LB or not <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
did you sleep during his teaching or what?
pull QK you moron
just like Ame
<:Oldge:951410911220989983>
he will probably never be able to win the cup
Rtz is close to 30 now <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
it's so fucking sad man
and move to EU league for better environment
like the best player of NA CSGO got bored of NA
it would be miracle for people to start comparing NA to other regions again
cause NA is too shit now
no one do it anymore
i miss NA vs EU copypasta in Twitch <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
<:KKonaW:889032091357036584>

Eli is american
but i will keep making fun of him anw
i also don't hate Aqua, if he come to ask me anything i would answer it
oh i don't hate anyone, it just my way of talking
<:Looking:1154847280529162260>
if you think eli is also a lolicon then say less
<:Looking:1154847280529162260>
heki also think like that
if you think eli hate you then you're probably right
Nobody will get mad at you for following my teaching
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
<:WorryYou:1101221412817092650>
i only ping people that wouldn't be bothered by it, if you want i can add you to the list

so the screen split is to get vertical resolution to fit with Kakao clip
Twitch, Afreeca, Kakao
i asked my friend and he said cause the KR girls stream on 3 platform at the same time
<:Looking:1154847280529162260>
look at Twitch Just Chatting section
<@416445660443967491>
so good luck bud
i pity this guy but i prior my entertaiment more
<:dankHug:888543978377584670>
good entertaiment
cause he is a great clown
and all the beast players just ignore him
the problem is that all the people in that channel that tried to teach him is as bad as him
im on the side i want a clown too
i can't blame them
they want a clown instead
but all the beasts just doesn't bother to teach him
like he probably genuinely want to improve
instead of trying to help him improve
so they just let him say what he want
all the good players think he is a clown
i actually pity this guy tho
it's like a middle school kid dicussing about NBA
his skill and knowledge is not 1/10 of what he think he has
bro keep talking out of his ass
that took 6 months to rerun
1 single boss

<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
now he love <a:GAMBAADDICT:1088508671144759358>
yea old X used to love OW
for no reason
i think he played 25 hours off-stream during the Mid only to challenger challenge
T1 just like to play
like other streamers stream because it bring them the most profit while having a game to be competitive
the most impossible task
that guy is genuinely love League
if i saw some fuckers in my lobby i will run it down
i also have my int list in TFT
that surely narrow it down
who
fragile needs to play with his tounge to make if fair
so much for grinding experience
he would have scored better than fragile
if bro use Trio
you know what is the funny thing
still below fragile
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
and if we count EU, NA and SEA, fragile is still in top 5
cause when he is in the zone he is the best player of EU
fragile is literally what you should not do when communicate
who in their right mind would want to talk like fragile
and who even does that
like he tries so fucking hard to copy fragile mannerism
basically he backseat everyone, interrupt all the convo as many as possible and not with even the intention to help, he just want to be Fragile 2.0
breath
but that Gurdil guy ego is just huge for no reason
Aqua is just delusional
like for someone that is only my level at best, that Gurdil guy is definitely have bigger ego than Aqua
<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492>
they always talking as if they're god
always have the biggest ego in the galaxy
why does EU players in that channel
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
i got dizzy mid-way
yea i saw it, what is the context, lot of people talking
that's how he keep the unwavering confidence
he will ignore everything that doesn't favor me
but he keep pretending like he is
bro doesn't know how to play the game at the highest level
at this point i don't even know what is the foundation for that unwavering confidence
8S HoR score better than S1 Sunny <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>

yea dw CN complain about it enough this time
not how it work
no
my guy does LB replace GD or HTR
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
So she will solve both Carvati and Rimestar
Hua will probably be both Bio Fire dps + Fire support tho @ gresham
There is nothing mention in his description that he is supposed to be tanky
I still don’t get how the pig is that tanky
Parvati is just tanky for no reason
Parv
Oh i think she is much easy than Carv
Her big lantern will be tanky af
Rimestar in current temp will also be hell btw
But yea not fun if you don’t have her
This boss is easy if you use the only solution
<a:cluelessing:1150177774540169367>

9S LB <a:VS:1118343706920112129>  9S HN

damage shouldn't be the problem, but probably due to shieldbreak <:terimad:1066677583548260363>
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
so 8S HoF probably tie with 7S HoH

if a valk can't get it done under 8 mins then it's dogshit in my dictionary
maybe my standard is too high
he was supposed to be Him
does bro not know how to play the game
bro really type HTR and HN
but the playerbase are still as dumb as ever
but after 5.7 they make it a lot more obvious so the playerbase stop confusing about the purpose of ER
like before 5.7 i get that they didn't make it obvious enough
people still think it is
even when Mihoyo make it more obvious that ER is never supposed to be Genshin Abyss
isn't that show how dumb Honkai playerbase actually is
is so pure
the last one

how insecure you need to be

Yea i was gonna spoil it but if you interest in it then i will let you find out about it
Did you read that one
Oh Dr Stone also has the same ending with Neverland
<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
The author cook too good in the 1st arc and he ran out of ingredients later on
Enma just die but another girl born in her body now has to burden her past relationships cause no way other kids stop finding her
Also the ending is cruel af too when you think about it
<a:HECOOKED:1123904665088688198>
Neverland should have ended when they finally escaped tbh
Keep axing cool manga
I wish they make more “mind games” genre <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
The manga has some low but really high high
If you’re into mind game genre i also suggest Alice in Borderland
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
The manga is called Kamisama no Iutooti btw, there are 2 parts with 2 different protag
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Only the games are borrowed
The setup and everything are original
More like inspiration
The show is different from the manga, they only borrow the games from the manga and change it a bit to look more realistic
With some 10/10 chapters
It’s a solid 7 to 8
Talking about squid game, have you watch the original manga
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Why am i a mole
What’s up nerds
<a:catJam:1076171671762894928>

If you don’t have SS0 Sunny
This boss score is way lower than i thought it would be
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
can't remember
or lower
S1 scored like 700
miss 2 frags last week tho
so i just fuck it and buy all the stamps
yea i got annoyed by how low the score is <:dankHug:888543978377584670>
but missing 15 atk so can't do anything about it
-7 from cap <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
what about romane scam
what's up nerds

why did Kaido eat the Uo uo no mi
where can i get the Uo uo no mi
be honest
don't lie, if you don't type in here for 1 day you will miss this server
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
wait no that sound wrong
if Genshin even has 1/3 of Honkai competitive content i would abuse the fuck out of Nahida
Honkai is not even close
all the interaction between characters to elements to weapons are like cracked af
Genshin combat mechanic has the most depth of their 3 games
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
did they fix the bug about resetting Abyss but skill CD still stay yet
oh btw
in a 1 minute 30 seconds fight
or a fucking boss that just float around for 1 minute
their Abyss design choices are basically
but their design choices are just terrible
Genshin combat mechanic is definitely cracked
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>

Back in my day, Aqua and Ruby weren't husband and wife yet

<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>

and you can finally say
only 3 more months
isn't it kinda crazy that
<a:NopeNope:1045725686834401300>
should have deleted coop 6 years ago
and i don't think it's new gimmick even, they're the new Trio, they're at best free A-rank
i mean so far gimmick is just do this irl <a:duckass:1148861036351471637> <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
joint atk and new kind of QTE most likely
especially with the system they have been with for 7 years
like you can say the new combat system look cooler but not everyone want something precious for them to change
joint atk, different QTE
it's the concern of them wanting to revamp combat system or not <a:mojjcheck:1113492691288871063>
they will fucking blow the company up
lmao imagine CN outrage if SS0 LB lifespan is 3 patches
shall we?
shall we pull 7.0 to 7.2 stuffs
we need to address a bigger elephant
i mean just wait
this redhead is so Kiana it's not even close
but no Sinadya

yea i guess sp is our generation
isn't Rick and Morty a zoomer show
<:dankHug:888543978377584670>
South Park
they grew up with Rick and Morty
i still don't get how this generation is so sensitive
now you can say that it is made for people who like women
back when it was made
yea it is <:WorryYou:1101221412817092650>
im sorry on their behalf
yea cause they overcooked her by 5 minutes in the microwave
and since SW is after HTR, she can basically fix her entire body, the power to make possibilities come true <:WorryYou:1101221412817092650>
forgot how to walk
all the time spent floating around
she just used to floating <:dankHug:888543978377584670>
she gain control over her body
you can hear Bonya's voice changing between pre-HoR and after HoR because Herrscher body fixed her brain damaged and disability
she can already start walking again when she became HoR
like calm down man
people just look at it too much
SW's design never emphasize on her boobs
bro pls, you're making it too obvious
like how most people also keep talking about pedo or lolicon when someone posted a child type valk
bro pls, you're horny af if you think boobs is the problem
people think they're complaining because they are not horny
the problem is thaat
do this irl guys <a:duckass:1118359716217757717>

It’s kind of joint atk
<:worryWicked:920970765623525377>
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
From left to right 
-New Captain
-New Kiana
-New Mei
-New Bonya 
-New valk
she is new Kiana btw
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
wait is that racist
Eminem in Shadow is just 50 cent
that's why people like it
it doesn't take itself seriously
yea EiS is a just a parody
i think you actually need to enjoy the game, its contents, its events
like if your whole reason to play the game is for the story then im sorry bud, you won't last more than 1 month
i will be honest, you can't play the game just by enjoying the story alone <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
new Bonya, new Mei and new Kiana
it's new generation now
OG cast move on
yea in term of story, they're done with part 1
by new user friendly you mean genshin user friendly then maybe
Luna looks like Eden now lil bro
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
baban is still stuck in 2020
no one is sucking anything
calm down lil bro
what's with your balls and Luna
<:WorryYou:1101221412817092650>
Pull out King
they called me the POK of Toronto fyi <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
we can have a pull party <:dankHug:888543978377584670>
but in story and new mode only
get creative all you want
i just hope they don't change the core gameplay
but too soon to say that honestly
it does look like Genshin 3 <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
like with ER
they can make a new mode for it
especially when they literally say nothing about important parts
it's normal to feel anxious about part 2
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
and i quit
worst case scenario, they mesh new system to Abyss and MA and old valks, making them become something new, something not Honkai anymore
best case scenario, Part 2 will be same structure with APHO, everybody stay, new players join, rub 1 off of new valks and move on again
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
<:WorryYou:1101221412817092650>
i don't play a game for the story, the game must be fun first before i care about the story
changing it to other kind of system will most likely kill my interest
this is personal but of all the hack n slash gacha out there, HI3 combat fit my taste the most
worst case scenario, Genshin 1 and Genshin 2 can still cover all the expense needed
they do have the money to bet on these odds
if they lose all the whales quit and HI3 become GGZ
if they win old players stay and new players come in
50/50 odds
i mean they can also just say fuck it and change everything <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
and they don't need to do it
suddenly change the core gameplay mechanic for fun is the most risky move ever
because Honkai 3rd combat system fit their taste
instead of PGR or other similar game
why does people play Honkai 3rd
think about it this way
it won't or else it would be too risky
with new valks only
im down for Abyss 2
honestly
SW in Abyss = <a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
SW in APHO = sick gameplay
they won't bring all the new kits into Abyss and MA
just like SW
cause old valks doesn't have joint atk all over the place to spam like in new gameplay
but make sense if it does
probably when they're yapping <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
get simplify in playable
sick af in story
playable new gen will probably just like SW
that's the most sus part
Abyss and MA definitely stay the same
OG cast become legend figures
new story, new Trio, new main characters
Part 2 = moving from part 1 cast
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
reading lore for fun
lore beast back at it again
guys wake up
<@&1148979669950021692>
thots on this?
<@218762069338619906>
i found gold in maincord
holy fuck
<:dankHug:888543978377584670>
just not playable yet
there is 1 actually
the list go on
✅  Gyaru
✅  Pierced Tummy
✅  Loli baba
✅  Bratty loli
✅  Racist 
✅  Rapist
✅  BDSM
Nikke check all the boxes possible in pixiv or r34
they just have good L2D
AL doesn't have variety on fetish
they know all kind of fetish ever exist
yea Nikke's artists are true horny
yea
trust in Mihobo
part 2 will probably get better
<:dankHug:888543978377584670>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
you know for a game that everyone says that is focus on fanservice, Nikke has more body types than Honkai, Genshin and Star Rail combining
as long as they don't make it the whole point of a character
i don't mind it
there is nothing wrong with big boobs honestly speaking
Ein's daughter = Bonya
Dudu's no.1 fan = Mei
Redhead = Kiana
yea they keep the formula
The smart girl, the serious girl and the dumb but energetic girl and somehow related to god
it's actually the trinity of shonen
sound Shonen enough to me
so the Trio is Ein's daughter, Dudu's no.1 fan and the girl who related to god
the redhead girl
ofc he has to know how to speak English
he is the fucking Director
the fuck is this supposed to mean
jk jk
that's what your mom said
7.4 is CNY
7.3 onward is new generation
this should be it
7.1 - SP Adult Griseo
7.2 - S-rank fire support Garuda Hua
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:WorryYou:1101221412817092650>
if your age is on the clock, you're ready for
<:WorryYou:1101221412817092650>
for the bear
still gonna buy it
there is just no hope <:terimad:1066677583548260363>
Nikke is what depressing should be tbh
against all odd they still manage to get happy ending
Honkai is far from depressing <a:NopeNope:1045725686834401300>
7.4 onward is new generation
maybe 7.3 we still gacha old valks
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
this doesn't lookr ight
7.1 - SP Adult Griseo 
7.2 - S-rank ice dps + free S-rank Fire support
7.3 is part 2 so we only have 2 patches left
<:dankHug:888543978377584670>
but Mapo tofu is definitely broken
ngl i don't click with Peking duck <a:NopeNope:1045725686834401300>
why does all Chinese food are broken
also Chinese noodles are just too lit man
we will meet again in this vast universe, until that time <:life:1001518241610485781>
<a:mojjcheck:1113492691288871063>
Tet do the scouting
what is Aqua's opinion on this
alright alright
<:o7:1147223647946293289>
regain Herrscher status, back to being god
once Kiana back to earth with all the Honkai energy
i mean yea 3 of them are technically can't die anw
the OG cast will become mentor figure, myth, legend kind of characters
as long as we keep moving forward the future, we will meet again in this vast universe
every journey must come to an end <:o7:1147223647946293289>
the fuck is that emote
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
the one that Einstein used to have feeling is no longer in the world
you genius
it's adopted
protag is either a full character on their own or a self insert
like ffs man, make up your damn mind Mihobo
deez nuts
Operator <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
how is 1 of the largest game company in the world struggling to do it
lot of games do it easily
Counter Side
PGR, Nikke, BA
how hard is it to make a fucking self insert and not give them a name
you mean he's <a:Streaming:1039019999811088414>
what
don't give them a fucking name
if you make a self insert
like make up your mind you moron
Aether <:Gayge:1100803137792655441> 
Adam <:Gayge:1100803137792655441> 
Calculus <:Gayge:1100803137792655441>
they have a fucking name man
that's the problem with Genshin self insert
Open Heimer?
Aether <:Gayge:1100803137792655441>
Why did god remove your bitch content then
Be honest
Thots on AG design?
Alright gang, we need to address the elephant first
Just like APHO honestly
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
It already has self insert protag, it won’t translate anything to Abyss and MA
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
It just won’t translate into Abyss and MA, like APHO, different combat system
Time to Genshin the Impact
Yea just open Star Rail and you can see it
Probably Big Mac with fried fries
And no APHO 3
There is no tooth fairy, no easter fairy
peace
i need to go outside and grab sth to eat, update me later gang <a:pepenarutorun:1081435087901556827>
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
bro think streaming views has any meaning
probably part 2 alright
yea the ship is Hyperion
oh wow it's actually part 2 <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
they didn't even release ZZZ yet
<:monkaStop:816801542211895327>
wait new game again?
do you think Eden design emphasize all on her side boobs like Luna
look at Eden moveset and Luna moveset
what are you even talking about
<@416445660443967491> does she look like she has side boobs or no, be honest, focus on the angle that her left arm cover
damage are just missing everywhere
capscore this boss will be nightmare
i will just go grab sth to eat and try HoI again <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
if they make Griseo design emphasize on side boobs again istg
her arm just cover it
look like she is the same with LB
no i lie
At least her boobs isn’t that massive
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
This shit suck
The fuck are you even crying about
Also the difference between ranked HTR and no rank is as massive as it can be
if you miss 1 tick of damage your run is just over
<@370438895965306882> this boss is tilting me <:monkaStop:816801542211895327>
and not because no one playing in EU?
Solve the puzzle
Basically just do the quest
Refuse to get some bitches?
Then you need to uncap fps first
Idk how much effort it took but if fairsky use it
well it certainly does <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
until she invited me
bro i live in Canada, not America, i didn't even know KKK exist in Canada
so i went along with it
i thought she was joking
im not even a racist to begin with
ofc i said no
<a:NopeNope:1045725686834401300>
last time i got close with someone like that, she asked me to join KKK and got sent to jail after
i will be honest, don't get too close with people that are easily sharing those kind of info <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>

do we have Golden House in Honkai or what
for ER
take into account atk and dorm buff
Yea yea but i get to Myriad with no JK rank
Aqua when someone asked anything about JK:
Tet: attempt to try
should have added Tet in there too
SS where? <a:mojjcheck:1113492691288871063>
mean the last 2 are not even helpful

his self jerk are still beast tier
<a:mojjcheck:1113492691288871063>

he only write guide, the website was made by someone else
look pretty good actually
he is busy working on ER website
looking like a sandbag for Aqua
everything in RL deal too much dmg

yea 1 of my Uni's friend is having mental breakdown

the most popular game is either Fornite, League or Mihoyo's games
now that i think about it, isn't new generation just fucked

then he really need to see therapy
if he got fired and his only source of cheering up is Mihoyo's games
he better be
that's fucked up <:monkaStop:816801542211895327>
that doesn't sound right
wait he is 27, currently unemployed and spent 5k in gacha
calm down, no one asked your opinion <a:mojjcheck:1113492691288871063>

where is the realistic writing
where is that writing huh Mihoyo
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
dude got taught by her about grey moral
and instead of trying to calm her down
there was also a Nikke that specialize in killing human, her mission is to take out those with no value
and she reply with a shotgun
1 of the female Nikke is a terrorist, the protag confront her for the 1st time and told her he want to save her
and dude almost die
and the female load a shotgun to his ribs
lol Nikke also has that scenario
Nihilister and Heretics are also like that, defeat them one and they fucking bring the whole army to revenge <a:mojjcheck:1113492691288871063>
for no reason
they don't need to be in the side of the protag
good character stay good character
Dorothy is the most fucked up female in Nikke and her banner generate 30 millions
Mihoyo is too scared <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
<:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
she would rather die trying than forgetting the past
but she doesn't need to be saved
the most fucked up female in Nikke also has sad backstory
1 of the thing Nikke still hook me in is their writing direction
repsect their choices
but some need to besaved, some don't
that is true
everyone have their stories
my take is that Hoyo should stop bitch out when writing villians <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
or an accident but that beyond the point
calm down man, you're the result of love
like people just love to being edgy for no reason
i would be more surprised if they can even easily find work that does not use power of friendship/family/love to overcome challenges
or love
or family
even Harry Potter have power of friendship
it's like 90% of novel work in general
actually delusional
have the gut to brag about how good she is in maincord
god i can't believe someone this bad
> I had major issues with her QTE before CN released, thank god CN fixed it she wouldn't QTE at all before that (I was copying refs in these scenarios too) and it wasted so much of my time
this lil girl probably play game for the 1st time
reading that hate speech again <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
who? <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
wait a minute i will find the hate speech gresham sent
like a beast
so he hate HoF
he went to 90 pity for HoF
like man actually use i use HoV to clear ice Abyss as an achievement to show good he is
and dude ego is as huge as the sun
the HoF hater is also a trial mod
maincord is a joke now <a:Classic:1102006776540434542>

they're like 20 chars in there

that server can't say the same
you can tell that Hei and Eli only half joking about cunny

i don't join it because i feel like they're actual lolicon, i just asked Shino when i need

it's like the beast round table
if they're T5 in EU then they probably in Central
ask gresham
grinding in beta for nothing
he better know how to play HoF by now
dude doesn't know how to play HoF
i almost went blind
i saw a vid he posted on this cycle
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>

@ gresham lol i hit the 2% perfect run, 4 tiles in the same place but my mind went blank so i dash to other tile by the 4th explosion like a beast
cause i want a reason to use both of them
the only reason i even bother to mald on tank
yea the outfit is lit <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
beasting
it's SS2 HFI and S2 HTR
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
and half of the good runs got destroyed by tiles position
damage variance due to ember stacks and shield is actually amazing
i spent 4 hours last night to get 702
alright i will give it a try once im home <a:howody:1143461710150250557>

You need to be omega flex
This meta is tough tho
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
So stream until he die
Fastest bot 4 of NA
He played all of it in 4 hours
You know the scores i sent yesterday
No one can go 8th as fast as big bro
I don’t think so
Can he pull up big bro’s scores tho
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Just in time for Griseo’s replacement in 7.1
Like the beasts they are
People are still wishing for Rimestar to comeback
Yea old bosses tend to be like that
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
Should have played in EU
That’s my biggest regret
Because you’re terrible at the game and play in story mode server?

Curisu is just curry in JP, no?
Isn’t it the name of food
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
With S2 HTR SS2 HFI
By like 10 pts
Oh he did surpass fragile btw
I need him to acknowlege me
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
Thanks but you’re not Aqua
To actually feel like being good at the game
You know sometime i wish i had Kyo’s hands
I just hope he still have enough money to buy food
Like he doesn’t sound like someone that can drop 500 per patch consistently
I think this guy spend too much for his budget
But honestly speaking
Like a beast
He just straight up skip her
Yea i think so
Cause she was not worth it
He skipped HN
Shall we do it to
Aqua is definitely pulling LB
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
does Teri kill on spawn or what
it's legit in the 800
does he not know HoT score in RL
my guy actually said -200 points
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
i will settle with anything 700+
but that's too much work
my cap is around 720 <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
yea the difference between S0 HTR and ranked HTR is crazy <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>

Trash
Sunny is already out of meta
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>

They did the same with HTR cause she also need double ego
Yea Sirin need double ego start
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
Bro no one in their right mind would want to click weapon and basic like a dumbass
These moron
Why does ER trial Sunny use the inferior build
10 out of 11 is more than 90% playerbase
cause EU only have 11 players
then it's still competitive yea
if 10 people still trying to cap their scores
okay tbf tho
yea best server
they're just omega cap their scores
i know for 1 thing that KR doesn't have that many 9S
any knowers?
do they have 30% of CN playerbase or what
why does KR temp so high
ok serious tho

this boss hit like a tank
i died like 3 times in 10 tries tho
i just do 1 run to see how the rot work
i will need to mald later for tiles position
still 3, im missing some damage in transition
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
i have exact 127 sp on last rot

speaking about Aqua
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
Lil guy look confused
I just like the emote
Not really
But do i want S2 Luna tho
I will need at least S2 Luna to cook
I have SS HTR and SSS HoT so S0 Luna not gonna cut it
Yea that’s the messed up part for me
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
So they only test it when they feel like it
Everyone all say it’s awkward, her rot with GD
No one test her support role in V2 yet <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
Yea even with S2 the best you can do is 2 ults in 3 rots
100
In support role
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
Luna also can’t ult every rots i think
Not that big honestly, only the sp matter
So it’s just whether i want to roll Luna or not
Hua is definitely a pull <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
The only thing im scared rn is new SP won’t sync well with HTR
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
Or vice versa
While Luna and Hua is just a support with dps abilities
HTR value still hold as the new AE
New SP will sync better with them than HTR
But if you do have plan to pull Luna and Hua then probably not
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
Looking at beta adjustment they’re trying to make S0 Luna/Hua > S0 HTR but lose to S2/SS HTR
I’d say decent if you don’t plan on pulling Luna and new Hua
enough to sit on top of fragile
he set his goal at 720
probably back to malding
okay maybe this setup is actually scuffed
W <:omegalul:1030461063197626409> W
<:HmmNote:1064549352208597022>
honestly i would estimate that he had already spent around 4k to 5k
he only pulled CN gear this week
so he pulled SS2 HFI S2 HoO S2 HTR
i just checked and his HTR has always been S2
yea he probably just pulled CN gear this week
and he has 25k Bchip in his account
3k after 2 months
atm probably 4k at least
CN M piece > SS2 HFI + S2 HTR
that SS2 HFI and S2 HTR can't carry him over fragile's score
maybe M piece is actually omega important
lil guy HTR is S2
nvm
this guy keep jumping between the line of God and Mortal
can't tell if he is back or not
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
do you think Aqua will back to his normal self if we all told him it's not his fault and it's the M piece fault
you need the M piece to be lv 50 to ignite Aka bar with ult
oh this one is definitely a tilter
we send Tet to beat him up
ask fragile the address
yea, real life
now we lost him
<a:rainsmoge:1089311108764028928>
to fuck his mental up
at this cycle
but fragile decided to comeback right now
as long as the 9S Trio guy is below him
like even if he is T50 it doesn't matter
what he truly want is the feeling of being superior
<a:rainsmoge:1089311108764028928>
and lil guy is SS2 HFI S0 HTR SS CN
S0 HFI S0 HTR SSS CN
it probably hit him super hard if he knew fragile setup
<a:rainsmoge:1089311108764028928>
we lost Him
im sorry
guys
like a bunch of moron
probably getting back to circlejerk Moriso
we can't lose Him
i will throw the bait again
because fragile is sitting on top of him
we fucking lost Him again
<a:mojjcheck:1113492691288871063>
where is Him
what happened
<@309634550273933314>
but only the DK is important
but wait for V3
Sirin T Dirac MB is alright
if you get the weapon first you can consider skip the stig
A-rank <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
if she is A-rank you can skip
AG in the patch after is also kinda important if she is SP
HoS DK is definitely too important to skip tbh
he make like 3k per week i think
oh it make that much
he only stay because he make a lot of money
yea he completely give up on Honkai
<:Fishinge:1046324838911987763>
farming contents steadily
now he only make guide
Moriso stopped making tierlist and valk power judgement
no but with the amount of shit he give fragile he deserves a spot
no, Moriso is EU Moriso
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
let him cook
he is on the case
<:o7:1147223647946293289>
the one 9S Trio in RL
at least he still consistently beating 9S Trio
he is fragile on steroid
can't end this cycle below fragile
i thought he gain infinite experience in beta
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
cause he doesn't know how to rotate
probably getting cucked by S0 HTR
SS2 HFI even
711 is omega low for that setup
lil bro has 4/4 CN?
wait a minute
probably back to teach Aqua who is the real fragile
<@370438895965306882>

dropping the senpai
<@148145559897636865> a lil bit daring today, aren't we
it's time for cleaning spring
we fucking lost all the important emotes
Tenmaku died for these kind of works
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
never seen it before
the plot look unique
new manga just drop
<@148145559897636865>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
compare to the Big 3
like i don't see wtf is unique about JJK
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
and people praise it to heaven
the manga is honestly so fucking safe
exorcist theme, OP teacher, hot-head protag, cool-head 2nd protag and a girl
cause JJK stick to the safe route
so they kinda stopped the intense release schedule
Kubo almost died and Kishimoto is now scared of drawing
after Naruto and Bleach end, they don't want to have any mangaka report that they almost die from working anymore
that's the norm nowaday <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>

That’s some determination
But SS
Can’t really say it’s right or wrong since it’s only 2 patches since her debut
This guy must love Hare
Wait he backpulled SS Hare?
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
I sure hope he does
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
He swiped 4k in 2 months
He did not swipe 3k in 2 months
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
EU price is like 20-30% higher than normal due to some policies
I just remember sth
Oh also
It must be 31k by now
Before the patch start even
Lil guy has 25k Bchip
He already spent like $500 this month
<a:duckass:1148861036351471637>
5/5 Ego
If anyone can inherit Elysia’s legacy it’s Aqua
The world can’t handle that much ego
There is no way there are 2 Aqua

Why is he not beasting
What does all the grinds in beta even for again
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
Im not sure if lil guy know but S0 and S2 also has lil difference by his definition
3% more breach
Or else the server will be fill with his ego
Thanks god this guy doesn’t have 4/4 Sunny
Lol i don’t even remember about it

What kind of server that still let members have @ everyone permission
Isn’t Magnus Carlsen basically just Aqua of Chess
His Sunny will be useful when 6.9 is over
He is grinding G4 Fire
But Aqua is holding back
Yea definitely can, if S1 4/4 Sunny
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
So everything look young to me
I can’t, im an unfunny person <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
<:Evilge:1113819647381356576>
What are you even noooing about
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
So yea, you don’t feel guilty because you worry about someone else, you feel guilty because it affect you first and foremost
You feel guilty because it affect your mental scale, human usually tend to feel guilty when they did sth wrong to someone that they later think they didn’t deserve it
typical 14
Like
He just want to get the reaction out of you
If he ask you sth then it mean it already happened
That guy only asked when he already did it
Can’t guilt trip me
I just said it so i won’t feel bad for laughing at him
Yea honestly true
Isn’t it kinda fucked up
But he is too funny
I do want to tell Aqua to meet therapy asap
Probably have problems with their lives
But on a serious note tho, people that have too much ego for placing high in Honkai
For fun
Cause i successfully wasted my time
I feel more proud when i get to T100 in event leaderboard than Abyss and MA
You’re just T100 in a small playerbase game, in a non-competitive server
But at the end of the day
I know a lot of people actually take pride in placing high in Abyss/MA
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
No flame tho
You’re not supposed to build confidence in a dead server
No Aqua
Do you know what is NA stand for
Cause you’re T10 in NA
I hope that run was not his best
Then proceed to record the slowest Myriad’s run possible
It’s EU
But come on man
I know that his confidence are built on the fact that he can get into T10 Myriad
My guy is new to the game and already think he is Fragile on steroid
It’s just the attitude
isn't that more amazing that going 4th that game
only big bro can go 8th from the freest top 4
bringing down the avg
trying to make that augment look balanced
so now it's probably avg an 8th
but he tried to cook with Endless Hordes
the 1st augment avg 4.08
he is cooking an 8th rn
dw he is back

if you keep saying random shit eventually you will hit something
isn't that the strat <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
fire is lacking in shieldbreak
Garuda Hua will definitely have shield break
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
i think
but you need SS LB to beat SS HTR
i think in V2 S0 LB beat S0 HTR
<a:DinkDonk:889016538684850249>
sound like it's time to pull SS LB tho
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
yea ranked HTR is crucial
trust me Itto is jacked af <:Copium:1113620861921021962>
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
and grow up
you start as a kid
that's how human work you moron
but from the money i made so doesn't count
i did spend a lot in card game when i were a kid <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
a kid spending a lot in gacha
Tet knew 1
too bad
jobless and stuffs
but somehow having adult problem
he talks like a kid, acts like a kid
also this Aqua guy really confuse me
not having problems in life
i mean i think you guys are just sick in the head <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
can't believe NA surpass SEA in lolicon aspect <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
there are so many games but not enough time to play <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
he is addicting to  Starfield i believe
fairsky doesn't swipe this time
Aka and Rift stop at SS2
that's more lolicon than SEA <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
no flame tho but i think playing gacha while having problem in life is not a good thing
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
-2D make a huge difference on this boss
oh i'd be way higher in EU
probably not
should be enough for T50
-3 from cap
this is as high as i can get <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
why are you digging
there is farming route in the vid
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
also i noticed that, if you WA HTR to the left in the opener, CN chakram will 70% of the time won't trigger Sunny QTE before the mob fully spawn
<a:soulessClown:866719327322505256>
@ gresham
Aka is also 3/4
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Cause he only has 3/4 Sunny
Someone in SEA with SS2 Sunny SS HTR score lower than Shino
Yea 4/4 is really big <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Her dmg is overwhelmed on AKA
Yea SS can cut more time with the mob
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
Standing still like a moron
And im doing it exactly opposite of it
it just cutting frame and not standing still like a moron
nice, i think S1 Sunny + SS0 HTR cap is around 807-810 <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
im gonna physical into your asshole
he believe in tooth fairy and easter bunny
he is waiting for Garuda Hua
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
4/4 CN is actually omega busted for Sunny
Sunny feel strong for me but i have all the toys, don't know about her cope setup <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
i still skip it
so even when i can pull 4/4 Hare
i don't vibe with Hare neither
yea dw i get it
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
oh gameplay

who is Targonian
does Diana and Leona still canon?
<:Gayge:1100803137792655441>
there are a lot of gays now in League
<:Gayge:1100803137792655441>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
is Varus and Kayn Shuriman?
Shurima has like Azir, Nasus, Renekton, Taliyah, Cassiopeia, Naafiri, Aatrox
Shurima has Azir and that's all what matter
now that i think about it, only Ionia and Shurima has cool valks
they're kinda doing nothing
yea isn't for a nation that is known for war
no wonder Noxus lost to them
Ionia is cracked the fuck
oh Xayah and Rakhan is also from Ionia

The biggest oversight with Lillia is that she's unbelievably sexy. I can't go on a hour of my day without thinking about plowing that tight furry ass. I'd kill a man in cold blood just to spend a minute with her crotch grinding against my throbbing manhood as she whispers terribly dirty things to me in her geographically ambiguous accent.
is Yone still a beast
if the manliest man of League want to bang her, there must be a reason
only 1 way to find out
<:BatChest:1113620829578727444>
those 3
i would bang Lilia, Kaisa and Fiora
yea highkey Lilia is the hottest in League
like how Yone want to bang Lilia
and Yasuo want to bang Ahri too
Irelia, Jhin, Sett, Karma, Yasuo, Ahri
when you think about it
isn't Ionia lineup crazy
<:BatChest:1113620829578727444>
to see if someone dare to fight Ionians on their home soil
highkey i want Ionia in season 2
like he is blue and carrying a cane
or just some random blue guy that want to cosplay Ryze
oh btw does the mage that Jayce met Ryze?
Jayce Talis <:BatChest:1113620829578727444>

Gresham did you watch beast king's gameplay
not a slow-mo run
i expect a flawless run
with that much confident
it's just that
yea im not flaming him
it's S2
it's so slow i feel like im watching slow-mo Honkai
did you see his gameplay
bro is talking like a fucking novel
Find the frame perfect, uncap fps, surpass my limit
wait

Everyone is your rival
Never trust stranger
The lesson is that
I got it
What kind of philosophy he want to teach us this time
Not a single thing change from the one yesterday
Honestly speaking
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
Cause Turg CN is nowhere near that set
But the whole set is definitely broken
Could also be im tripping
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
I remember it’s Aladdi M but for ignite
CN M piece
There is no guarantee you moron
Mihobo better not fuck me up with no stig for Sunny
Or at least i hope so
I better get into T50
But i have all the toys for her
Just harder to get into Myriad
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
Definitely not
The M pc is too broken for Ignite dps
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
Turg CN is only like 70% buff value
Also for Sunny specifically
HFI need 3 combo to fill the bar
Trio SpA <a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
The classic
All of her bosses are in first 3 weeks yea
By that time Sunny’s value is already gone
You still need 3 weeks to farm for all 3 Lee into G4
Than having weapon in first 10 pulls
And got full stig
I’d rather hard pity the weapon
Isn’t that a good thing? <a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
I hope i can get 2 pcs
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
After you get the weapon it’s up to luck
She is a guarantee weapon banner
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
To have her 4/4 by 1st cycle
You need to get 2 pcs from gacha
<a:Aware:889021591776817172>
Let me join the beast round table
So that Aqua can notice me
I will get S1 to secure my T50
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
What a great show
I miss that show
That’s for sure
Not 714
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
S0 Sirin is already strong enough to take over Ignite boss honestly, S1 is for Myriad contenders
That’s it for 5 weeks
Pull Sunny’s weapon and buy some rank up

so why is ToF a better Genshin <a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
and they're all underage
the whole city want to ride protag's dick
Blue Archive is anything but wholesome
is he okay
is this guy only play gacha or what
<:clueless:1009089400174559294>
because Teri is definitely a pure design
sexualize a smol character
probably disgust by it
Marisa at home <:ICANT:921403877285306399>
i don't watch HI3 yt's contents
oh he definitely not a lore person
along with Kiana
yea and SS Hare + SS QK is definitely the Trio of Honkai 3rd
S0 HTR
and S2 HoO
is beyond me
but what is the thought process behind SS2 HFI
like i know lil guy like Kiana
no one competing in EU
cause he is in EU
no one teach him how to spend and he just think he is doing it right
but he won't last long
i'd say this guy like the game
drop the roleplay for a bit
and no one teach him
he just doesn't know how to spend
his Trio being SS2 - S2 - S0 should be obvious
is he busy grinding again
does Gordon not cook at all today
i still don't know why this emote is called ShallWe
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
is he baiting me again
why is Rei repeating what i said
<a:aworryhehelollmaoLick:526758057292726282>
he is probably playing with his tounge
that's definitely nerfed run
yea his HTR sp gain was normal
like a beast he is
he is teaching you how to fish, not giving you the fish
so you can avoid doing it
what mistake did he make in the vid
he want to let you think
maybe it's intentional
not optimized at all
even without considering that his run is just flawed in general
too many mistakes and wasted input
nvm i just take a look at it, this is RL gameplay <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
Armored Core 6 iirc
i heard the game is lit
have anyone in here play AC6 yet
oh btw
i only care when raid starting
yea it's just a sidegame
that's like double the amount of Genshin
outside of that i log in Nikke for like 10 minutes a day
when raid start yea, it's competitive
like Aqua
maybe competing with children
i wish
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
i play Basketball
i do
<a:believer:1018349083800379482>
definitely not addict to gambling
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
HI3 just happened to be 1 of them
also i don't play gacha in general, i play games that make my competitive blood boiling
<a:duckass:1148861036351471637>
i have always go outside <:terimad:1066677583548260363>
tell gresham or someone to look at it first, im outside, won't be home for another 30 mins
Thursday
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
like parent to their child
because they want to take care of them right
it's probably be the case
honestly with how many lolicon this server have
that will be a tragedy
all will have SS0 on Friday
unless SEA just love Sirin too much
or i better be
at least i will 100% be in T50 for Sirin's weather
im not cut out for it <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
this boss require fastest hand of the West
494
too slow for this Husk <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
S0 HoH cap should be around 780~782
im at 770 <a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
SEA T100 will probably be 780
like a beast
just uncap it
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
<a:duckass:1148861036351471637>
Do this irl
Do you think she will give me a discount on coaching if i show her i play Hi3 too
💢
sound like she needs correction
sound like a scum
what's both
all are suffering from stockholm syndrome
like everyone that still play HI3
has to have a reason, no?
like if someone this devoted to this role
or it's 0
probably in the 0.000001%?
what is the chance she actually has a girl heart and got misunderstood
maybe just want to live the life
be honest
are any of you guys among these

<@370438895965306882> <@148145559897636865>
Or instead of coaching they let you hear ASMR from AI generated female voice
They’re offering coaching so maybe they’re a beast in TFT
Or his sugar daddy
Aqua would become her sugar daddy
If Aqua joined when this biri person still in maincord
Im not even joking
Can she be Him
Idk
Or is she
Is he?
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
Cause she got banned
Every hoyo’s servers except maincord
Has to be the same person
I think gresham once told that person scammed someone and that someone got disowned by their family

Idt DA use G4
he only notice EU color
but changing the role was correct move
they're not cooking anymore
cute pfp
i will give lil bro 1 pass
like a beast he is
Aqua is just trying to be polite
below Aqua tho
not like he can get into the convo
reptar doesn't use discord, he made an account to learn how to gaming
when you see reptar typing dumb shit it's me
it's me <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
i will change reptar role into EU color

Then go get a job
Nini is a pimp
In her server
<:hmmjj:1122638686362812456>
you think so?
so she is just at S2 atm
i did want to rank up HFI to SSS but it will kinda ruin impression in some runs <:terimad:1066677583548260363>
so far it's only HoF
i have never spending a shit ton in 1 patch unless i really want to rank up a valk
or some resource packs
after $100 it is just for rank up
you only need $100 per patch for Bpass, monthly card, monthly + weekly packages
<:peepoOkayDank:859217713578770472>
yea he already spent more than me per patch
 250 for xp mats? That's broken. 250 for asterite? Trying to scam me or what?
and be like
bro stock up 25k Bchip

not even mocking
like im sure this guy has some mental problem

25k Bchip rn in his account

this pepe look like he needs a beating

how can you even struggle in EU man
 4/4 or trash  kind of advice

why does it's always EU that have these legends

it has been 1.5 years
that's a lot of effort, does his point also include she needs correction
he think the server that 0/4 CN can get into Myriad is spending for SS0 Sunny
this guy is actually playing in VIP EU
that doesn't help narrow it down gresham
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
also EU
the other beast
beast king keep telling people to stop playing the game
he doesn't have it
relying on others show your weakness

these guys are not cooking shit

bro that's Aqua

that outside of CN
isn't it kinda crazy

about character designs
did lil bro actually join HI3 discord to praise GSR
these guys are trying so hard
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
the cat probably asked why not GC over Hare
SI is a staple in MA Jizo
then your belief is not strong enough
When he want to grind experience
Why is god of Honkai ranking up all beta valks to SSS
Also
You moron
Be grateful you can receive his wisdom
Must be exhausting
And has to bestow wisdom to these idiots every 2 seconds
Imagine being God of Honkai
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
Bro called Gordon Ramsay wrong
CN = EU > KR > SEA > NA
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
worst server
cause you're playing in NA
and she got into car accident the same day
my aunt got a license that way
like around 6th or 7th time
in Canada
even though your driving has not improving at all
you can keep trying until they sick of your face
oh you have to pay again too, that's for sure, but i mean is that
I heard America is the same
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
Just keep taking the exam until they give you a pass
In Canada you can basically bruteforce it
Is it hard to get driving license in EU

I thought you were gonna make “ cause they swim all the way to the womb “ joke
When you go to the pool
Would you prefer someone ask “ are you a bitch or not “
In a public pool, alone
And in their head it’s like “ wow this is it, im fucking dying “
Most of the time it’s scare
Probably “ Will you die if i turn my back for 5 minutes “
Most of the time i go to the pool for exercise purpose and idt people judge me when they realized im going to the pool alone
I just can’t be with friend groups all the time, it’s physically and mentally exhausting me
I went to the pool alone 90% the time
Pretty normal tbh
Why, to drown yourself?

who is it?
why do they stop beasting
why do i feel like Gresham has been using this answer for every beasts in maincord
cause your supports are not gonna suddenly deal fucking 2 morbillion damage
but that too much dmg really rare to occur on SSS bosses
yea that's just every MA bosses
i don't think spending in something you like is bad, just need to work for it
it was like $40 minimum per expansion
i had to work my ass off every summer to save money for MTG new expansion
like when i were still in middle school

American roleplay

is he a beast
who is s5

bro has sp issue with SSS HTR
i just realized too
also
can't bro just chill with jerking off
bro is playing in fucking RL man
this guy is top delusional
drop the roleplay for a bit
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
EU is the most competitive because now he is there
he doesn't think EU is the most competitive server
maybe i think it wrong
wait
unless he actually believe EU is the most competitive server
no one is competing in EU
just because he is playing in EU
it's a waste
i will be absolutely honest
you don't want to see Him when he is jerking
that's him being humble
where is the beast
why is he acting humble now
Bro really think Rimestar has mechanic
<:o7:1147223647946293289>
he is about to get banned
i think the day we part away with him is near Tet

<a:HECOOKED:1115919462680498196>
talk about showing no mercy
bro started with  i don't care  into  no one love you 
do we let him play it or not
but the beast himself want to play the  my money doesn't buy me advantage  card
do we trust this one or no
alright folks
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
it's mental damage coming from them
we already have new damage type
which one
he mean the black bar
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
none talking about bitch because still don't have one
<:life:1001518241610485781>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
if you don't pull you guys are going against his will
LB is broken
like just straight up teach the CEO how to run the company
do you think he also went beast mode irl?
because if someone just quit/got fired from his job and still playing gacha game i'd rather setup a meeting with therapist for him
the legend better be still 18 and the job he mentioned is part time job
<a:gamba:1114450826468020327>
gambling addiction
need the money to cure a disease
thots on that?
but he didn't skip any valks so far
also the legend said he is F2P in GSR
god know how many he is playing out there
1 gacha game
in a gacha game
and still spent 3k
i still can't believe the legend is jobless tho
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
from now on, use the role to ping when he bestow his wisdom again
where is the hammer
are you trying to doubt his words?
no money can't
why did someone disband the server during HTR patch <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
VIP EU is the round table of beasts
not normal EU
he is in VIP EU
his words are gold
inspiring
You moron, there is no diffence between S0 HTR and SSS HTR for him
But this legend is jobless atm
Also im not sure if we should laugh at this info or not
Fucking round table
1. I think he is on drug
there are 2 scenarios
i just finished decoding his words
Yea they put too many events this patch
<:o7:1147223647946293289> Eden
But i want to know what wisdom is he bestow us
Yea i think he is right too
That’s too many fucking words btw
Any reader?
<@148145559897636865>
Yea orange is called orange because it was named after orange
<:Evilge:1113819647381356576>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
is Sapphire a color
Sex
Sirin and Funny 😭 Sunny 😭 uooh 😭
Like idiots
Keep calling her Sunny
Do we ever decide on Sirin abbr btw?
Just use Sirin on Tank
Trying to sneak under the radar
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
Or Gordon Ramsay has stop being Him
Is it me
.
God of Honkai deem she is worth it
we all in on LB
change of plan Gresham
Asking the real question
<:Evilge:1113819647381356576>
By yourself
Keep asking and you will find out
:calculating:
only believers get rewarded
better stay away from them if you still want to be noticed by Aqua
<a:HmmHmm:1045706220595585024>
seem so
who is Camelva
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
the 3rd doubter
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
look at the consequence
Tet is the 1st one that tried to doubt him
if you think about it
even though he is the one above all
too humble <a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
he deem that Gurdil guy worth it
nini max her topup bonus in like 3 patches
idk, i max the speding rewards long ago
avg $50 a day
in 60 days
so he spent like 3k
6600 xtals = $100
i forgot
how much is that
your life?
the 40sp hasn't loaded in yet
yea maybe he is too fast
how does Gordon have sp issue with SSS HTR
alright hold up
try muting kneecaps
mute kneecap
if carl mute nini because you say her name i would uninstall discord rn
that kinda scary
wait
this is why lil bro have 4/4 VKE
blasphemy
he deem LB worth it
<@370438895965306882> change of plan
he is consider pulling LB
<:o7:1147223647946293289> GD
you moron
it mean she is not a good investment
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
JK is safe for now
the god himself has spoken
alright JK is safe
how much faith does this guy have in EU
does bro actually think EU has more than 10 players
but with new dorm it's probably elf + stuffs
i just gacha the elf
before i was getting valk frags and other stuffs
like how Aqua did it
and they cooked me
or im putting too much faith in Mihoyo
so i think CNY one will let you exchange new ice elf
like they did fix the elf rotation with Kiana
he just assemble them for fun
he is Arthur
and the next ice elf will be CNY
but probably because Kiana elf was fire + lightning
better luck next year
i think we just lost the 50/50
no new elf, no free new elf
yea no sign of it
that's like TFT worst nightmare
<a:Aware:889021591776817172>
isn't that fucked up
maybe 5 is more realistic
or 5
like 10 years from now
inb4 in set 30 people still say  next set will be lit, trust 
for TFT i mean
i would try to find out which set will be best set ever
first thing i would google is whether HI3 still alive or not
if i travel to the future
lowkey
Sept 13th
9.5 next week
<a:HECOOKED:1115919462680498196>
Is Gordon Ramsay back from his mute yet
dorm buff
<:Handshakege:912215230573060138>
why is bro jerking to Aqua
or can you?
i don't think you can slap a slapstick
play this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789> instead
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
there is no way
ofc she is hot
she is lite FR
the avatar one is with us now
the real Vita i mean
like Makima kind of bad
yea really bad
the live action fucking blow
<:BatChest:1113620829578727444>
she is an avatar of the real Vita who is no longer called Vita
but our Vita is also not a real Vita
not sure about all the details tho
i think so <:terimad:1066677583548260363>
right now
i need his contents
is Aqua still muted?
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
there are 3 boys and 4 girls
just share the same appearance
yea so far they're all different kids
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
bro no one care about all the smol vitas
obviously
and Vita is the S-rank stardust
AG will be the SP Stardust
Griseo first tho
maybe Vita is the Ice Stardust one
Honkai In Space
story part 2
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
like a beast
Ice Stardust
wait maybe
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
SW is much older than JK ig
but next elf is ice
yea ice is in good spot
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
but ignite dps
S-rank ice support Hua
ngl i feel like the one replacing JK will be Garuda Hua
might be JK turn next
there is also an Ice valk coming soon
Roza and Lili is the last wall
what a crime <:terimad:1066677583548260363>
Adult Griseo
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
so you can use her both with HN and LB
AG will be the SP bleed support
lowkey if Mihoyo feel generous
SI is probably die soon
and you're a beast
because Gresham sucks
S1 should be busted enough
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
and finish the rest with 7.0 BP
honestly, i will only buy up to S1 for Sirin
we're back to keeping the dragon in the circle
if they ever rerun Ignite Benares in 6.9
also i just realized that
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
probably just sleep
yea im currently at 720
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
that's too much work honestly
if i spend shit ton of mats on Sirin T and reaffixes Dirac
i can probably get around 770
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
the combo of QK after the hitcount wall won't connect
but if i use too much time to finish it
im missing 1/10 of P1 HP bar
my spot was also awkward
you mean the run
oh wait
you're naked in the airport?
but we will reach heaven with that 10%
yea you die like 90% of the tries
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
Time sure flies
6.9 is next week
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
You moron
No it’s 2nd sentence
i should have went for SSS HoS during her ADV, her SSS is huge for dps form <:terimad:1066677583548260363>
cause 7.0 is 2 S-rank valks
should be discount supply
probably gacha
it's only useful for now and useless forever
i would say don't waste too much mats on Sirin T and Dirac MB
<a:morbus:990619554424160316>
what about morbillion
i don't think you understand how much money affixes cost
wtf
they're still muting Gordon Ramsay
<a:pepenarutorun:1081435087901556827>
finally a real Bio dps
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
isn't SS0 HoT already score 47904
do they know the consequences of muting Gordon Ramsay that long?
how long is he gonna get muted
i still have 2 left
but he give everyone 3 chances
yea it's already 1st mistake
no, that way Aqua won't notice me
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
isn't that embarassing
my HoS has 1400 atk at SS1
probably sleep then
i need it for 47902
Dirac B is reaffixes for HN
i ran out of affixes mats
i mean they even replace her impair
fulltime dps yea
cause she become a fulltime dps with new DK
i think it's full dps
alright time to brick all Sswords
doesn't seem so <:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
let me check if i ever need to use SSwords in 6.9
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
<@370438895965306882> thots on bricking all SSwords stig to do HoC
<a:duckass:1148861036351471637>
it better be troll then <:monkaS:838690840259461140>
<:monkaStop:816801542211895327>
even during 2010s Nintendo didn't send anyone to jail
i think it's the company that make Stein Gates
<:monkaStop:816801542211895327>
first time i know big company actually do it
<:MONKAS:984237220422615090>
got sent to jail due to posting his walkthrough
<@148145559897636865> <@516591030326525983> 
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
<:Clueless:947671183103508530>
With stable income obv
by now people should have been divided by 50/50 on love and hate Genshin
what make Genshin still keep their popularity tho <a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
be honest guys
what make Mihoyo games so famous
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
<@148145559897636865> there is just sth about SHY's artstyle that it feel really charming
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
when they're both gacha
yea i still don't know how Genshin 1 and Genshin 2 become the mainstream game
like they know how to make an easy kit look awesome to play and give satisfaction to their players
character design Mihoyo is probably above average a lil bit
and gameplay wise
i think Mihoyo is just a beast at advertising
yea her color theme can have more use but im not a beast at designing so maybe it will just turn out bad <a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
even if no one ask her to do it, she will still do it because she want to save the world
cause becoming HFI is her choice and not being forced by anyone
and HFI tone is a mix between HoF and young Kiana
HoF has a more serious tone cause she need to answer everyone expectation around her, they want her to overcome her past self HoV
the tone of 2 suits being different make it more clear too
specially the cape
oh it actually doesn't, Kiana voicelines complain about the suit a lot
HFI reference is every suits of Kiana
HoF reference is everyone around her
HFI is about what Kiana choose to become
HoF is about the journey of her with her friends, her teacher
you can see it by all the references in each suit
HFI is everything of Kiana
HoF is Kiana answer everyone expectations
Like how you fuck the Zakorian?
execute him <a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
can people really banging if the song is about  fuck that pussy 
anything not English is Brazilian
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
<@148145559897636865> setsuko play Hawaiian music and people spam brazil emote
<:life:1001518241610485781>
but eli still can't pay to get any bitch
require bleed trauma to break shield on enter damage phase
just for her bosses probably
be honest
do you guys have access to VIP EU or no <@309634550273933314> <@483689649727078400>
EU has more than 10 ranked QK
because there is no way
bro is playing in VIP EU
unless they already banned reptar
i already have an alt you moron
What about Halloween Kafka
Do better
You idiot
That is Summer Kafka
You moron
That is just Kafka kit
No
No thots <a:NopeNope:1045725686834401300>
<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
PE
And cashed out in 6.5
Should have saved from 5.5
6S Trio above is still the greatest investment of 2023
Oh they last more than 2 months, they’re still not dying anytime soon
What’s the scam
Sunny 😭
9S QK > 9S Trio by a small margin
Pretty sure it just depend on ranks
there is just no Fire Weather
no one is beating Trio in fire weather
imagine him starting during FC era
this guy should have played this game sooner
or no
do we have tyle wolf yet
im gonna be more surprised if she can beat IO in Type Wolf
she doesn't need shit to beat anyone in there
does bro know that Benares and Parvati is also ignite weather?
When she get high ranks
it will be legendary
bro i can't wait for his first cooking section
didn't turn out well
yea Tet was trying to copy Aqua
or else it will be unfair for EU
his Hare and QK stop at SS because Mihoyo prevent him from pulling further
starting from 9S
im gonna learn infinite
this guy is beyond real
<@370438895965306882> <@148145559897636865> <@309634550273933314>
9S
bro this is his way of learning
because Hare is the greatest investment of 2023
and Hare is definitely not the same case
not her strength
it's her weather that carry her
Sirin is good but she is only good in her weather
but Aqua think beyond that
you would think so
LB beta
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
this one is true so can't really make fun of him
cooment
he has been playing for 3 months
imagine how many meals have we missed
that we have only discover this guy recently
bro i cannot believe
what the fuck is that
EU is noob, NA is worse and SEA is W H <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
he is already challenge KR server
dude will start to challenge CN server
when this beta end
there is a Time Chamber in Dragonball, time is faster in the chamber, 1 year inside = 1 day outside
SS3 when he step out
SS1 when he step in
basically Goku, no?
gaining infinite experience in beta
he is using beta as a way to make up for his slow start
bro is actually Goku
use this strat instead
do you have Paga TM?
no
<a:duckass:1148861036351471637>
Aqua first cooking section
Tmr is beta
Ignore dia, do you realize what is tomorrow
They can convince themselves to believe in their lies
Highkey isn’t those kind of people the most dangerous one
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
I don’t see anyone name Aqua in it
Nerds
What’s up
HoS SI QK yea
HoS dps is better
Stop him <a:alert:1090867785141334116>
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
That jump sec is annoying
Idek if i want to 47776 on Bull
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
Owo math 47902 + 39813 + 31946
What is the equilavent of 47776
Yea i forgot
Wait
Owo math 47902 + 47776 + 31946
This week is an easy week
Yea don’t bother this week
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
and T1 with 9S
with S0
Aqua would have scrore 745
relax, you're not Aqua
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
136 UID is like 2nd year player in SEA
bro his UID is 136
he is even older than you the fuck you mean he is new
<a:ModCheck:1021871712339505232>
any readers in chat can click that link and tell me what is he cooking
clearly not doing their best
guy is talking about RL and below
i was looking for Aqua but i found this gem
but it is more legal than Ruby Aqua
yea that one is definitely the weirdest
yea probably not as weird as Aqua and Miyako <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
she can cook if she want
she is the artist
yea her ship couples are weird but hey
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
instead of any of them with Aqua
btw do you know that Mengo also want Kana to end up with Akane
in BG3, female NPCs/characters can have bigger cock than you
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
can't handle the truth
but they said im a racist
yea that's what i have been telling people
there are racism and sexism flying around
like a beast
if you pick wrong race you can be captured and enslave
good storyline, options can lead to different outcome
just your typical D&D honestly, but they make it great with the freedom of choices
<a:pepenarutorun:1081435087901556827>
yea i just finished saving my progress in BG3
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
oh wtf Mengo already sneak it in
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
with Vin Diesel
maybe Tarzan is planning for a collab
fucking Fast and Furious out of nowhere
last 3 chapters:
-Souta this brat is bad news. No you
-Wait he is bad news? Yes but he has backstory
-Maybe he is not that bad of a news? No he is but this is family
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
the amount of fanart she draws for CSM is more than anyone
Mengo is also CSM number 1 fan honestly
she draws the 1st ever Aqua x Ruby fanart
do you know that Mengo is actually the 1st Aqua x Ruby enjoyer
 aight, it's lit, send it 
he read the title and be like
god know if he actually looks at it
on theory ofc
Aka just check it to make sure nothing stand out of the line
these interlude chapters are made by Mengo
oh he didn't make it
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
Now don’t bother me farming these noobs
“ Good enough “
Aka probably look at it and be like
Yea cause they’re only half canon
got a good laugh out of it, time to continue BG3, need to get to Act 2 <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
should have played in SEA
be honest
isn't these EU storyline too funny tho
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
the lolicon type or the cosmic ego type
what type of cringe
then he became fragile
he pulled it with some of his original personality left  <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
do you think fragile sell his account and his personality to this guy
oh the fragile's clone
what about the 2nd
i know that the 1st one is not a beast
that Aqua guy does act humble toward these 2
don't get ahead of yourself now
the Aqua in you?
cause he is a beast
or when he cooked Tet for lacking lore knowledge
like lumi said  are you stupid  and he replied with  your opinion won't change anything in my life and im glad i wasn't the one wrong 
if you read his msg he actually act like this
only 24 hours since i discover this guy and he already cooked what maincord couldn't
he is too entertaining
i hope this guy won't change
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
would he think  how ignorant am i  or he think  what a humble man i used to be 
do you think 1 year from now, when Aqua look back at his old msg
serious question tho
<a:hump:963351392171483176> ?
i would beat Akayuki using my feet
if i had 1/10 of his hands
probably not
just put it in <#963613297943412756>
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
<@82358863155703808> nvm i lied, all the HC coming from thin air
<a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
although i bought coin packs too
like a beast
he is buying coin packs
seem like a skip
hmm
look at HN and be like
like im not even saying Hare is bad but there is just no world that someone started playing during 6.5
it has to be SS2
yea cause S2 is heart shape
and pulled SS Hare + SS QK
then he skipped HN
he pulled SS2 HFI, SS0 HoO and S0 HTR
but this guy is a beast
for anyone else they will just pull both
like a beast
when i were edging around
yea he is me if i started playing HI3 during my middle school years
only because CN is mainland
yea the 2nd hardest server, only behind CN
this guy is either Him or the most narcissist i have ever met
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
truly inspiring
<@370438895965306882> <@148145559897636865> <@309634550273933314> <@385655541248163840>
beasting even irl
he must be a beast at Blue Archive
and it's not even beta yet
and this guy already cooked more than half of CN gameplay discussion can cook in beta period
also do you know that it have only been 24 hours
and it's not even close
if Aqua has 9S valk he would be T1 CN ios
so he only blame the valks
his runs are perfect
but Aqua is too much of a beast
for 2023 valks the tech lying in the boss itself
<a:wa:1113490287860396072>
that's 2023 valk in general
don't ask if you don't know
do you know it?
only beast players know
there are secret tech to play SpA
no
i just asked reptar for his account
you moron
1 of 1 and where is the emote
or no
isn't that disrespectful
ofc he was mad, a moron came in and doubting his greatness
ran out of it when he wasted it on idiot like you with no lore background
probably charging his beast energy
no i backread he went offline too
there were like 30% useful classes and the rest are just torturing you with group project
that's how i felt about most of my classes in Uni <a:alowo:1139655599492182086>
like a beast he is
or he is Him and he knows how to truly play SpA
dude has serious skill issue
but if dude manage to make SpA look good comapre to Sirin on Sirin's weathers
idk what is this guy cooking

<:peepoSit:1009060765887647846> guys, what's the hold up
sign up for group project, only appear on submit day
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
i will get in 3 pulls
but it is a sign
They’re supposed to be a team
Why are they fighting each other
young, wild and dumb
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
unless he think they are  worthy  of his attention
he probably doesn't care about other opinions
and based on his attitude
being stupid is privilege of youth
he is young
SS2 HFI, SS HoO, S0 HTR
dude roll like this
like how a normal human should
basically instead of getting all new toys
fully invested in Hare
relax
that's $500 man
i would be in denial too
if i were still 18 and someone tell me i just put $500 on something that is only avg
can't really blame him <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
Bro probably just moved out his home and now he think he is Him
<a:duckass:1148861036351471637>
Relax, im still young
Uni freshman
Probably a kid honestly
<:monkaw:1079360170821423154>
He noticed our group
He is baiting you
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Maybe they know sth that we don’t
Maybe there are secret tech
QK’s timing just not fit in
You just don’t use QK in Kosma
Also that FrediSK dude is wrong too
There is just no world that Hare is a better investment over HN
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
<:Susge:838690098802720818>
isn't that canon free in storymode
wait, turn back a little with this part
the maincord spirit live on
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
unless it's Rei and gang
<:soulessSusge:816030602263527485>
he is trying to lure us out
maybe he is in Rei's group
must be a bait
can't be real
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
wait what
jk jk
i bet dude is sitting wondering when will the 3rd QUA attack coming
bro probably doesn't know how to use SS with QUA canon
keep spitting facts
this guy might be him
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
Akayuki only T1 SEA because he has more SSS valks than me
i will be honest
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
definitely just because of SSS QK
<@370438895965306882> <@148145559897636865> <@385655541248163840>
Just use HN
If your fire team is that scuffed
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
Or HC rot can’t do it?
The 2 lil bro already take care of 1 layer, no?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Why double collapse
<:Handshakege:912215230573060138>
why are they jerking each other off
you meet 50 moron from EU first to see 1 beast
their beast to moron ratio is like 1:50
that Velvet guy is EU too, no?
what's wrong with EU
okay but seriously tho
i'd rather kill both honestly and go to TDC
this is the same as listening to X explaining how him betting $10M in 1 night is a good experience
that analogy make no sense
it doesn't work man
yea im gonna ask my boss a small loan of 50k next Chinese New Year
im gonna put T20 Myriad SEA server Honkai Impact 3rd in my CV
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
answer the damn questions you morons
 wait, you don't know that.... ,  it's basic skill.... 
i really hate when people start their fucking answers with
valk knowledge should not be gatekeeping
in the pic it's not about investment, it's about how to use a valk
are they gatekeeping knowledge
what's that
why are you adding plural
and no bitch
Sunny 😭
haven't keep up with it
what is ER meta build nowaday
or he is pretend to be dumb
i can't tell if this guy genuinely dumb
bro is playing in beta RL
i don't think it's a tall enough wall
her competitor is SA
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that's good,no?
Hare gonna do what now
are these guys still cooking
you need to let them cook
no shit if you're asking real problem they're gonna reply with useful advices
are you stupid?
you need to be stupid
you can't act stupid
cherry
i knew that guy is my level cause he make the same mistakes i made
haven't seen your gameplay yet so can't tell
you know for someone that only around my level, that Gurdil guy has a pretty big ego for no reason
gameplay help is EU beast den now
Tet is not fighting shit
SI and QK iirc
think it's HoS
why do you laugh like you're being threatened
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
<a:duckass:1118359716217757717>

<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
even his sister's bedroom
i will follow this Aqua guy to wherever he want
alright i got an alt on maincord <a:hacker:998945514894671912>
he doesn't acknowledge you
based on my run, X > Y even though i don't know if im doing it right
this guy effortlessly entertaining
so she just become a mascot instead
heki knew she is an idiot but she is too much of a narcissist to be able to change
in WFP
of a stranger
you know heki almost ruined an account just by logging in right?
does she?
they will never feel guilt
im banned and nini left
he is born to be an entertainer
this kid is actually a natural
Professor Oak don't like him?
this guy is too entertaining
i will get an alt on maincord just for this guy alone
<@370438895965306882> <@148145559897636865> <@309634550273933314>
getting cucked by Hare and HC back to back
not making it to T50 again
<a:Smoge:1088508675062239282>
<:FrimaSleep:1044440069295067147>
where the fuck are all the HC coming from
start sucking some dicks then
Feel free to do it if you want, can’t guarantee if your run is already perfect or not tho just by looking at the score
Was gonna told you to upload it to see any minor mistakes in your run
Did you record your run?
Or else she can’t one rot Kosma
Need to be at least 120 stacks
Probably 600-620
So probably 600+
SEA T100 is currently 550
<a:DinkDonk:889016538684850249>
Unless it’s T50
Im -4 from cap but i don’t really want to go for it
50/50
with 493D at least
next boss will be Meele HoC
i just realized
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
that should be around 5.4 and 5.5
<:Oldge:951410911220989983>
i like that part
tbh the only boss that argument is true is only SSS Tona <:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
<a:DangoRoll:782266386978046002>
this emote is fucking ugly
that's just how it roll
they focus too much on the collapse attack so the whole rot become stiff
highkey the reason everyone think QUA bosses are hard is because of the pressure <:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
collapsed timing is honestly not as hard as people make it out to be
it's reset
if 2 lil dude not hitting the moment they're gathered
is the opener
the hardest part about this boss
HN also wasted 120 points at least
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
tbh i still don't understand why everyone all think QUA bosses are hard
or is it supposed to be HN
where is she
what happened with this year QUA valk anw
Do sth about it
Pull S2 HTR then <a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
Tried SI in ER, didn’t really like it
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>

But you’re not getting DB
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
Should have gone for SSS HoS
Even at S2
Im starting to think this QK valk is a bait
Barely enough with Cosmic
My 3rd ult i have 130sp on HoS
still probably not
Oh definitely not
SS HoS = SS QK
SSS HoS can probably use MKP
SSS HoS > SSS QK on Kosma
lowkey
Shino is -1 from capscore but he already tilted to heaven
he will probably upload soon
wait for Shino
on Kosma SS HoS = SS QK
good enough
aight -4 from capscore
and lost to tutorial
swipe 250$
big bro play GSR
<@148145559897636865>

<@385655541248163840> <@148145559897636865>
capscore for HN team with SS HoS is 680
the rot doesn't fit
can't use QK on Kosma
it's the default setup
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706> ?
and not superior rot and buff
Echo definitely kill RC because of HP loss
don't let your blood stain the carpet tho
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>

oh wow i almost forgot that is a thing
she needs 2?
ego signet?

any knowers?
or i have to use QK
any broken ER builds this patch
not with that attitude
what are you doing?
better question
im Him
below me tho
if anyone in SEA can be him Kyo is one of them
probably
<:Fishinge:1046324838911987763>
496 now
good news is that SEA -1 this time
don't be shy
<:Fishinge:1046324838911987763>
i still accept fund for 4* Punny
shit is not real
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
but Dabber you only get max buff for SnS
with Punny you can get elf's buff across all the rots
yea without PB the timing become super weird
T100 is like 750
4* Dabber triple supports only scored 680
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
i wasn't even close to T100
<:whip:1090806260540129330>

<:whip:1090806260540129330>
what's the hold up
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>

<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Shouldn’t it be Sheki
If heki is a she then why does her name is still heki
Ask him wtf is a 4/4 CH
“ I got 4/4 CH for phys “
He is Deki
He is just heki but his name start with D and not H
This guy is beyond saving
“ Getting Mobius was worth the investment “
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
No

no one correct them anymore
this is what happened to EU when fragile quit
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
i saw it in reddit like 2-3 weeks ago
i just remember there was 1 guy in twitter that got screenshot for  im not a pedo but  and  children can also consent 
he is about to spit out the most racist sentence ever
 i don't want to be racist but...
EU is like -5 rn
there is no way that setup is 806 in EU
or Herrscher
god of Honkai
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
he only did 1 try and get T6

<a:PPSOHARDBRUHGONNACOOM:1084713695881474098>
wtf is that emote
cause he survived EU
but his ego is 10 times mine
that Gurdil guy is around the same level with me
my bad, highkey
highkey
lowkey EU is 3rd hardest server
<@370438895965306882> <@385655541248163840> be honest, does NA Nirv = EU Agony or no
and NA is just bad
or it's actually hard
what's up with that
why does all EU players think their server is hard
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
so he is the 6th beast?
wait that guy is T6
or they all pivot into real life
<@370438895965306882> is there any beast left in EU myriad
i will just ask gresham for this one, i need an expert
EU population has always been low after the Black Death
EU has no competition
no flame
Aka would rather die than playing in EU
Aka is SEA
all the whales probably dead already
fragile finally quit
no one play in EU anymore
he was the guy that said NA is slackier
EU is a good server
he seriously think
the problem with that guy is that
i would feel like im a fucking beast too
tbh i understand that guy feeling, if i were to play only 4 months and getting into the highest ranking of my server
yea should be him
and there is no Honkai Impact 3rd EU server
there is no easter bunny
there is no tooth fairy
EU is gone
S2 QK T1 Myriad in EU
nini
lil man has SS HoH
Ice Maru
in maincord
that he posted it 10 times a day

Don’t let your blood ruin the carpet tho
Is Marisa him or no
make sure to be honest
serious question
he was him
made by a girl in her 2nd year in Uni
only have a discord server and a scuffed website
and KQM wasn't big enough back then, no youtube, no twitch, no sponsors
so people started to think he is the announcer of KQM
it was because he was actively sharing KQM's math in his channel
people trusted 1010 not because he was good
he used to be him for the casuals
and how they managed to build up a new continent every 6 months is kinda crazy
a lot of Genshin's interactions work on black magic
just so that he can publish his retarded vids
that guy harm a lot of ideas
the one i hated the most back then in KQM is Tenten <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
It just work
No
Just because the EC math were a mess
And KQM hit him with “ we can’t publish it “
He was working really hard on KQM to publish it
It’s in the upper tier
The dps of all the team he used with Kokomi
Which actually harm Terraspin
They want to be seen as “ Genshin Math Guy “
And KQM didn’t want to publish his team with vids only
The math behind Electrocharge were a mess
This is actually not true tho, Terraspin did prove it in KQM, he just couldn’t publish it
Every 5* after Liyue are a big waste
Oh Eula is not bad, she just lack window for error
People just overlook her
Kokomi has always been good
yes
You get more servers and better connections prior

isn't it kinda sad
dude has inferiority complex but huge ego
i called out that clown like 10 times
that Khai guy is just butthurt when it come to me <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
why does the mods still there then
there is no room for jokes
<a:yay:1090867707907416095>
<@148145559897636865> <@370438895965306882> <@385655541248163840> <@416445660443967491>
no
that's why her bosses are gone
you didn't 4/4 her
it's your fault
no
trust
lumi is free
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
an Abyss boss
you know what she doesn't have at S3
IO weapon -> SnS ult ->Elf -> LE weapon -> IO ult + B
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
good
do sth about it
why are you still 2080
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
i have like 5 sets of abnormal attackers
for this <a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
get 2B and hope for the best with A2
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
Pilgrim rate are lower
i will probably save ticket for Red Hood and Crown
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
at least Chime and Crown will be gachable
Liberalio and Invidila
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
there are 2 more of them
why does his hands look like that
this studio sometime make questionable decisions
they put a sword into her burst animation but not the gameplay <a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
imagine 2B sitting on my face tho <:dongerj:981641448057356289>
for clearer comparison
is Volume inferior to 2B
what about Volume
not like they have any difficulty in making blade gun nikke, Scarlet is literally there <:FeelsWeirdMan:845253230648492052>
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
her ultimate in full scale
2B doesn't need gun when she has these <a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
don't know why tho
A2 use her original weapon in Nier, only 2B use a gun for fun
Nihilister use the twin dragons
they will always include alternative options
don't rub off to minors tho
rub one off once in a while
copy it and play the game
let the calc for KQM people to do it
yea do the same for building
check them out


until next time
and dip again
try them out
if you think a character is cool, comeback and pull
it's just Genshin In Space
there isn't that much going around GSR either
<:hackerjj:1113568704718974976>
watch their run and copy it
you just copy what others do
you don't  get better  in turn based
you go to KQM and ask  guys, what's the tech 
you don't  learn the game 
you're misunderstand how to play GSR
What

<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
he keep mocking the games that sponsored his vids
man i love this guy humor
jk jk
just turn to the nearest mirror
Hanser and Funny 😭 Hanny 😭
how sure are you that he is him
no
be honest
is he a beast or no
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
bro think he is him
skipping fire as a whole
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<a:MODS1:1118832858094633000> <a:MODS2:1118832860816740432>
fuck him up
are Riot stupid?
why does Sett and Aphelios suddenly in love with each other tho
<a:zoeDiscipline:1115919485870805012>
Zoe?
what stop Asol from launching his attacks btw
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
and Asol attacked from the sky for fun
isn't the dude literally fucked Leona's army up by himself
can you even kill Pantheon
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Ngl these Darkins feel like all bark and no bite
<:susjj:1114114505581023276>
That 1 of the strongest being in the universe
Isn’t it kinda sus
Why did she do that <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
What is the reason
Why is the body 12 if the soul is millenia old tho
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Damn it
Is Zoe legal btw
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
<@516591030326525983>
is it the same as Interpol's list
what is that list
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
and ranged Assaka is a tug of war between her and SW
Aponia is good but her bosses doesn't rerun that much
of all the bait valks that everyone said to be, i think it's HC > Hare > Aponia in term of usefulness tho
yea Aponia is also a good investment
when 90% of playerbase thought she was a bait
isn't it kinda crazy that HC is staying alive for more than 1 year
looking forward to Kosma more
i will probably sleep on DXY again to play BG3
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
can you hold this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
although it's mostly because of SSS JK
it's the same situation right now with HoH and ice triple supports
perfect rot
it's just that physical triple supports rot is the most efficient one out there
oh Hare is definitely strong even without Dominance buff
don't even remember what happened
i only spent like 3 hours on last day of DXY
last cycle i went into coma
enough for Myriad
probably around S0 Hare
jk
better than S0 Hare
unless TP is SSSS
it's always SnS
like Hiếu Lê is definitely a Myriad Player but dude never leave RL
so isn't Myriad standard should be based on skill instead
but they definitely will be Myriad in NA or EU
some of players have never been in Myriad ever
like if you're playing in CN/KR or even SEA
what is the standard for a myriad player
be honest
Genshin or us?
what changed
<:clueless:1009089400174559294>
time to search PGR Pu Lao in gif
the real Kafka
this one is from the game itself
any Nier players?
4 more days until 2B
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
that's why you turn on beast mode
change it to Cez B and Mei M
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
what the fuck is this
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
72 more ER runs
now i have Vill-V, Kosma and Kevin left
i finally finished Aponia today
<a:xddinside:1004308940835799060>
how about you turn on beast mode and get a 800
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
mean this
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
yea in RL i don't think any bosses survive 2 ults from HTR
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
HTR didn't have free box
you know what is not understandable
SS0 of free valk is the same as S0 paid valk
nothing wrong with that
it's just the natural of free valk
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
and never again
i used her once in 6.0
i don't know shit about S0 HoH
probably none
oh
so it's fair
and you pay extra to make her a dps
but that is because she was designed to be the SP slot of Trio
the one that actually need S2 to function is probably only HoO
like even in RL i don't think S2 QK is better than SS HoS
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
honestly the  s2 or unplayable  only apply to Nirvana
<a:xddinside:1004308940835799060>
It’s Morbin time
910571 other Cherry
what about the rest
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
cool, might to show who asked
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
Jean is Jean'd Arc prototype
<a:luckbegging:1113819333374791720>
@ gresham
any funders?
but my HoH is S0
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
triple supports cap is also lower compare to SS HoH
yea HoH look easier compare to triple sup
even worse
and it still feel the same
we have 2 biggest upgrade for ice since the last Maru
how is this even possible
<#1069296932863877230>
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
i will probably settle with anything 790+ tho
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
back to the fight
need to calm down
yapping is done, i think it's my fault, im trying to speed up the run too much <:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
fucking what man
fast and the freeze bar is <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>  to refresh
slow and you lose 3 pts for fun each Echo's ult
but the timing is actually tight
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
SEA is 495
your might be enough
what is NA temp
<a:Aware:889021591776817172>
1440 yea
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
and im actually lacking atk on RC
timing me is tight for no reason
is tilting me
@ gresham this triple supports shit
Damn brat 💢
To correct her
Always go for Furina
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
2 ult and it’s already over
Using HN on Jizo now is too relaxing
Literally 0 damage
Won’t have dmg for P1
Triple supports using dabber is -2 or -3
Yea it’s elf diff for triple supports
<@148145559897636865> check this out

for everyone you know to decipher what you want to say
lumi do you have some kind of personal dictionary or sth

only good point about it is the doujin and their artwork
compare to Nikke

Kaveh on action
It’s her best red card
It give 10 powers and 10 notes on first use but give more later on
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
Yea without that one she can’t kill the boss
Who is Sangwoo
Or you have to ask the oldest elder you can find
Can you find it with google
Where do you read the non-canon version
1000 notes is also one shot angle
oh right <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>

Seele and Bonya's stage boss is tough
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
i reroll 1 hour to get it
this is Seele's exodia deck, don't need to cleanse debuff on her but it's hard to get
Bonya is just stacking lot of healing then she start fucking
prior the latter
the latter is for Bonya
for Seele take the buff + debuff circle
the red card can be replaced with the orange  increase x amount of healing 
she wants sth like this
<:sky63:939811583369031750>
i still don't know how to make Kira work
omega trash

yea it sound sick but you can only use it 1 time
<a:Booba:1081435431540903936>
it's trash
don't pick the  consume  card for Seele
for Seele you need to get the 2 orange cards  cleanse debuff on yourself  and  enemies take immediate bleed effect  
if you get red card then pick the  extra damage equal to the amount of HP enemy lost 
lumi is like a social experiment

im literally short on 2% dmg
this make no sense
Dudu's stacks
you know what not make sense
SEA is +2 now
probably the same <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
NA temp stay the same?
Also Russian Vayne death sound
He plays it like 20 times per stream
<@148145559897636865> 
Homework is not real
if i do finale correctly i can already save 10 pts
yea my timing on finale is trash too <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
,… choke
Kaveh is actually him
Hands of god <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
So everyone all playing for 1st
Only the winner get the slot to world
It’s the mid-set of set 9
No one is playing for 2nd
This one is actually go 1st or go home
Mid-set in 2 hours
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
I expect her to sit on my face
<a:hacker:998945514894671912>
studying new items
Once PBE is up i will probably spend all the time in there
Yea iirc Guinsoo got changed too
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Isn’t that kinda crazy
Now we even have a defensive item that work like LW
And overhaul item system
Yea they add a lot compare to last set
It will affect the meta a lot
Like really big
9.5 seem big
No more aura items
Yea they want to make all craftable items become either defensive or offensive
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I think
You can only access to them through portal or augment
But aura items moved into “ support item “ category
Zephyr stay
bro there is still no brazil
they just include captain in to thanks the playerbase
that outcome will happened regardless
whether the captain involve or not won't change the outcome
Kevin's wish were refused by everyone, that scene stand for the fact that everyone united against him
we're not helping anything in killing Kevin
you're misunderstanding that scene tho
Ai-chan connect everyone on earth to deplete Kevin's shield, making him not invincible anymore
it would be
if they didn't include captain's wish in that scene
and whether they include captain's wish in that scene or not won't change the outcome
we're not helping shit in killing Kevin
what happened was Ai-chan connect everyone on earth **and** the wish of captains in her universe to deplete Kevin's shield, making him not invincible anymore
it's not
the one that helped was Ai-chan
<:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
we didn't
Honkai has a lot of stories going on
captain is the protagonist of his story
yea that's how it work
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
can definitely go higher tho
that 1/5 bar is actually crucial
im sorry coach <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
unless
<@370438895965306882>  im sorry i can't, missing 1/5 of HP bar because of no Punny <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
can you charge your phone first

he said he might do a epilouge in the future
i still want to read more of it
but the fake marriage is actually so good
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
like Gintama kind of peak
oh this one is peak in the other way
yea the author is a beast at writing slow romance
✍️ 🔥
oh btw keilo, i just found a peak writing manga
bro that's kinda gay <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
what if they never see each other as siblings
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
is Ruby x Aqua incest?
valks and new items
<@148145559897636865>
he typed this in maincord
what is bro trying to cook
look at the light
probably a Yordle, no?
Briaar and Funny 😭 Bunny 😭
😭
imagine getting sucked by Briar
Naafari is the dog
Darkin probably gonna be changed
aatrox is still there
Shurima, challenger and Darkin
not as hot as Naafari
it's in story
💢
xiao di di
if you keep that attitude
so they shove it into your asshole
and cash out on 6.4
so they can save for 1 year
yea people wish they knew about Trio 1 year ago
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
so the team is still 2 S-rank valks and 1 SP
you still need to pull either HoS or QK
yea for Hare/HN to work
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
are you not gonna pull HTR and HoO's gears if you can't get HFI
tbh i still don't see how Trio is expensive
do not worry, just wait
Booba Luna
how about BL
MY BELLY IS HUGE ,MY BRAIN HAS DELAY, YOU GUESSED IT RIGHT, I'M FROM NA
NA Nirv = EU Agony
@ gresham
EU used to be okay
yea back like 1 or 2 years ago
they used to be not that bad
what even happened to EU honestly
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
storymode server
they're playing in EU
my worst memory of old Nirv is just i T1 my bracket and not making it to T100
for Myriad it's still the same
more competitive in normal brackets yea cause you have a lot to lose
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
EU Nirv = NA Agony
also it's actually crazy that someone genuinely believe Hare with cope gears can work
yea she just use Turg
thots?
it's always EU players
whenever i saw someone give advice about using cope gears that still work in Nirvana
they're still cooking
They’re cooking
You’re the problem
She actually need 1 kind of card only
Cecilia’s exodia is so fucking hard to get
Yea dmg window is tight
So TF won’t happen
No cause you don’t do weapon active into CA
So 1 hit and the run is over
But QK has no interruption resistance
Yea and has to farm the 2nd bar for the CA later on in transition
You can’t use weapon active in 1st wave
Weapon active take too much time
It’s the opener
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
You idiot
That’s not the problem
can't use normal rots
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
nvm i take it back, this boss is horrible to capscore <@370438895965306882> <@82358863155703808>
it was so good
She can ditch her B piece anytime she wants
Cause BKE use Dante TM Ely B
Only BKE can use it
Not worth
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
How did you manage to lose
just take a break <a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
set 4 hall of fame
<@148145559897636865> 
Cecilia takes forever to finish her turn
<@218762069338619906> <@416445660443967491>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Those 3 valks on QUA bosses are horrible to play with
Istg the people that said “ just use FR/HoT/MPE “ on QUA bosses always tilt me off
Brain-dead boss
It’s not bad
someone sent it there
it's in another shitpost server
cause he doesn't sound like one
is this guy a beast or no
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
oh nvm someone just sent it to me
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
where can i read that meal
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
do this irl
anymore
this game won't have any newbie
nothing special
unless the melee has 3 dash-type skill
yea ranged is just straight up better in these type of pvp
picking melee to play battle royale <:ICANT:921403877285306399>
brain-damaged or what
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
call HoF as FK
who in their right mind
seriously tho
like a beast
when i need a break i just pull out a fake one and pretend to smoke
<a:hacker:998945514894671912>
yea whenever i pretend to have a smoke
oh boy i can't wait to open Honkai 3rd
no one is gonna spend their break and be like
relax man
it just open
Prom
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
cringe
HRB, HH, VQ
isn't that less stressful
you just farm and 1v1
lowkey isn't top lane the best lane to play the game
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
i was a top laner too when i was still playing League
name 1 top laner that is not a pedo
what's wrong with top laners and being a pedo tho
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>

<a:mfwshake:1090867981128581132>
and start pulling the real one
nini stop pulling mid character
relax, she is trying her best
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
Im down for them to rerun FGO and Otto in 6.9
Actually yea, PE’s bosses now are probably the easiest
Yea should be

Bring back QUA Coutal
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Yea iirc her patch was 1 Benares and 3 Hepha
The last Maru was on 5.6
Ice receive too many buffs since the last Maru
I have no clue on this one
There isn’t
:choking:
Lol spot a redditor in EN apartment
<:okk:1110244301184696360>
I don’t even remmeber what i did this morning in the office
24 hours gaming is not it
Bro im still dizzy
Oh is he SS0 or SS1
Nvm
More than that, my bad, it’s fucked for you
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
Oh wait, i miscount
100 pulls on ADV and 20 pulls on her next expa
You need 33.6k for SSS HoH
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
like a beast
wonder why she deals fucking no damage
i just do ER with Aladdin MB on QK
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
sometime here and there it's just nostalgia kick in
tbh i don't really mind easy valk, there are still things to be worry of when malding and not just the valk anw
the stack is just RNG out of this world it's not even funny
HB was a shit show
and no RNG stack
Echo is literally just HB with timestop ult
AE was cool yea, but she also waste 10 seconds on field
but not like they don't want to release mechanically hard valk, moreso the problem is that in a game with timer, to increase the valk value then dps window and chance of error need to be reduced to minimum
PC HoS only feel bad because of the weapon
i haven't play Honkai in controller <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
2nd is NS
The hardest Hua is definitely PX
<a:catSmash:1102705048003297321>
You need to smash the button
And she only remotely feel like a pain because half of the input won’t work if you press like a normal human being
The easiest Hua
HoS is hard because she is buggy
Fuck is that
The fuck
Why did i even type her name like that
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

skip cost 1 life
yea if you fail it will ask you to  retry  or  skip 
i just use Teri for the nuke deck <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
kinda annoying
yea <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
only need to play early and late game
you have 5 lives so you can skip all the middle one
then shuffle your cards for full purple + orange cards
here is the trick, try to clear the 3 first stages then skip the middle one until they start giving you Orange card

<a:NopeNope:1045725686834401300>
make no sense
why does EU players in maincord have so much ego then if this is their server
there is no way it's a real server
sound like he needs a therapist and not a 4090
probably 483-484
it's EU
T1 and T2 are S0 S2 QK if im not tripping
@ gresham there is no way this server is real
<@148145559897636865> still 3 digits <:ICANT:921403877285306399>
but that Riku guy from what gresham told it seem like he only blame everything but himself?
like for dumb bosses everyone bitch like it's the 1st time they learn how to speak
it's fine if you bitch about sth actually make sense
smartest maincord user

gj you idiot
went 8th
so he just playing without an augment entire game
it doesn't work if you travel to othet boards
but that augment is bugged rn
the most broken augment for Azir
soju just had a game with Two Healthy
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
they are all game-breaking bugs
Sett bug, Demacia bug, augments bug
8.5 bugs were not as insane as set 9
and not just the  haha, oops  bug
like game-breaking bug
and like tons of bugs
but they still couldn't balance it properly
pretty fun
and like half of the participants are playing Valorant
i just know it's around next week
this mid-set is gonna be a disaster
<:KEWK:816797137617813506>
<@148145559897636865> big bro stream for 24 hours and still 3 digits
he must be in Rei's group
they're baiting
it's a given they're saving up for Sirin
3k left on the same day people can buy it
found this <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
let me recheck it, i could be tripping too <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
also people last year just bought it without checking the country list
cause it's the 1st time
last year the hype was also higher
last year was 3 to 4 days sth
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
What is Seele exodia
Yea my plan is 4 hours on MTG and then start playing BG3 until i pass out
too many amazing games but not enough time <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
it was released 2 days ago and it look amazing
there is also this game called Shadow Gambit: The Cursed Crew
does Fontaine have Hold Up and Object?
sound nut <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>

Gonna pull out an all nighter too to test out some games i haven’t even touch yet
Im free this weekend <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
3* Punny can make a diff too since the titan would drop 2 pts earlier
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
@ gresham with the right affixes it can go up to 781 i think
that's too much dmg for S1
<a:runningwithmora:854107883796693012>
<:monkaW:838690827714166804>
Kiana Beach Party can fix that but lose a lot of dmg
HN in P2 need to do 2 combo to ult
If you meet the dmg threshold
It’s better
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Stardust reaffixes all of his Aladdin to use Kiana beach party
<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
So probably it will stay that way then
At best it’s +2
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>

you still have my paypal right gresham? 200$ pls
Punny actually make this run tolerable
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
<@148145559897636865>
probably can at least ~772-775 tho, will see <a:hacker:998945514894671912>
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
she just sucks
Dudu is just suck
not sure if i can +10 tho
im barack coach, time to increase the score <a:hacker:998945514894671912>
<a:hellawicked:1090866443723223101>
if it were 3* Punny the run would be less mald
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
4* Dudu unfortunately
S2 QK and dupes Aladdin
there was 1 run she is in the middle and she decided to throw the right dude into the corner
both have happened <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
the RNG gather of Dudu doesn't help either <:Deadge:916024193567559710>

probably -3 from cap <:Deadge:916024193567559710>

<:HareGrin:1075816120797368350>
<:ClaraSoCute:1104867416145661993>
it's more like  uhh 
Tericula and funny 😭  Tericunny 😭  QUA Ice 😭  69420 damage per screenshot 😭
but then they stopped midway
like there are potential in the premise
that one feel really unfinished to me
oh it probably won't
<:Susge:838690098802720818>
that one is lit <:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
but Cristin is cute so i forgave it for being cringe
that one is kinda cringe honestly
you idiot
red as in the color of her theme
relax
that is not cooking, you're just using drugs
and there is no Garuda Hua
there is no easter bunny, there is no tooth fairy
this year QUA haven't shown up yet
probably QUA
to compete with HN
she would need at least S2 or SS
if she were to be
i just don't think it's a good idea for Teri to be S-rank bleed dps
for no reason
this event is honestly too fucking long
can she still bleed
still no assemble, this community is so bad
not niche if they spam 2 bosses per patch
you're describing 90% of the valks spawn after 2022
imagine Tericunny is the S-rank Bleed support
the ult have to deal damage
QK can't use MEI
Gresham: <a:soulessClown:866719327322505256>
<:Fishinge:1003783201875054732>
that one was the best i got
i fish for 3 hours yesterday
yea the exodia roll is 2 multiply, 1 refund, 1 damage, 1 max rolled, 2 of dices per turn, 1 hp increase
it's the 7th card, the 8th card is the damage one
<a:susannahpat:1098217110271971428>
if you still gonna play through 6.9
can't overkill
both Seele and Bonya cap will be low as hell
2 multiply, 1 refund and 1 damage card
if you can fish for the 4 exodia cards
yea Teri's cap is way higher
capscore is 1.9m
i need to fish more
highest i've gotten with Teri was 1.2m
once im done im going back to fish for the exodia
Teri is still the best
both sound boring
what is Kira and Cecilia
and Seele is DoT deck
who is broboli
look
it just looking
who the fuck asked  what does looking supposed to mean 
does women irl wear like that nowaday
what's up with only wear 1 stocking btw

i heard it's online in anime now
did Luffy gear 5 break the internet record yet
<a:duckass:1110867174798671944>
not getting bitch
get bitched on maybe
but still no bitch
10 hits deal 100 damage should always be better than 20 hits with 10 damage
she better be

That’s terrible
Only boost dps form
For her support form
I remember SS QK doing nothing
sirin and funny 😭
for 4* punny
that's way too low
i suppose around ~770 with 4* Dudu
what is S2 score
her T version will bring her back
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
she and Mari are the most famous in GC mobile

like 400/500
too long
too strong for no reason, if you hit Heimer on 7 that's like +2 placement
like Silco
yea i think he is a failure of a unit
Just put the lil dude in and it’s 85% top 4, 33% win rate
<@148145559897636865> this Heimer unit is not very balanced

Seem cool
I will probably buy the card game this one is based on
It better be
This one is the same with Dice Event
Probably because players are dumb
Tutorial is just long
The card mechanic is cool
Why do we keep running? <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
The mechanic is fun tho
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
There are like 69 billion tutorial stages
This event is too damn long
Combo + ult = meele
Weapon = ranged
It’s half melee and half ranged
Her dps form
Also Seele is not meele <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>

<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
or else it's a survival game
oh she needs BKE if you start with low HP
support QK?
mob dropped was ideal
i got sub 4 min with support QK today <a:hacker:998945514894671912>
if dps QK then Vill-V
if support QK then Kosma is aight
usually those 4
Mobius 1, Kalpas 1, Su 2/Hua 2
yea it's always 1
Kalpas 1 is just better
you can't reach 1800 stacks
Kalpas 2 fucking blow on QK
that's all
also tell her to stop starting with Kalpas and BR
it's a skill issue
<:jerryshock:1069876641314123798>

emphasize on plural
i just asked CN players, they said Hepha has visual bugs with Echo
only a 1 year therapy session can save him
he is beyond saving
lil bro has fallen too far
excuseC <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
You’re the only one who read that differently
2 of it at the very least
There need to be 5 weeks patch
52 weeks a year for 10 patches
Can’t be help
Start of last patch
so if they replace it it's just gonna be Ice Benares
the boss is supposed to be Freeze Hepha
ofc it is
on what basic you think it's Trio's boss
you guess?
it's Benares instead of Hepha
Abyss is bugged
wait

They have 2 versions, PG12 and 18+
Destiny Child and Last Origin are 18+ rating
Only the extreme one stand out
Yea more than half of Nikke’s characters actually dress normal
Their goverment banned Hentai/Porn/Lewd related works online
Kinda fucked up
I actually missed sMary
Wait until this year Halloween
It’s his christmas gift
Like an idiot
Like when i taught Tet how to stop dancing
Not giving them fish
Helping someone is give them the tool to catch fish
99% the latter
Is extremely disrespectful for me
Using someone else resources without asking
I’m extremely pissed but not like it can change anything
Summons can extend turg but not reproc hunter mark
Yea they can
Just couldn’t reproc Hunter Mark
Yea summons still trigger Mei M and Newt B
Mei M and Newt B work normal
I just checked f2p vids
Summon couldn’t reproc Hunter Mark only
Did the dude even ask anything MA-related
He knew he’s bad
He never ask to be a better player
I still don’t see why you mad
Why does newt B on GD again?
That’s way too new and a casual on top of everything
New account can’t craft G3 into G4
Reptar did the same with Handel
Probably want to get it for G4
Seem like a casual
And i had to show him how to do MA with story stig
Reptar’s account when he was new doesn’t have anything but HoF
That’s like every accounts
Don’t disrespect people’s personal space
Your gameplay in my eyes is about the same with monkey playing HI3
Heki if i were to honest
Did he ask.
So just like you?
Is already sad enough
Just the fact that you level Mei M from 1 to 50
Heki if you’re in someone else account, do not touch their stuffs
What’s wrong with that
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>
Too good
It feel funny and sad at the same time
Someone actually let heki get into their account
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>

If you do, you'd just be making it so that, to me in my fantasies, I am in love with a lesbian as a man and she is in love with me, I have sex with a lesbian as a man, I am married to a lesbian as a man, and I have 2 children together with a lesbian as a man, which I now won't mind and now would enjoy. I just want this thing out of my head.

fucking American authors and their weird fetish
and for some reason they're still torturing Peter now in the comic <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
big publisher only started to pick up busted tittles from oversea once they realised that no one care about fucking Black Wally West or seeing Peter Parker getting cucked
yea NA didn't have any popular manga until 2010
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
does Estonian also have to wait 3-5 years
what about trying to be gay

but that 1/10 can't be found anywhere but Punny
missing 1/10 of HP bar
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409> also yea, i realized after 50 tries that i actually need 3* Punny for 47904
SA in 2023
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
cause her rival is SA
yea it's just QK support
what was it again
that would be the most terrible way to word it
and lil man said it's QK dps role flipped into HoS
someone posted a ref of HoS dps with QK support
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
so probably ~855+
im S2 S2 with 4* dabber
jfc, that's kinda high <:dongerj:981641448057356289>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i remember gresham mentioned that guy is a beast
when QK is in support form
how does it make any sense
also lil man actually said  it's QK dps flipped into HoS 
use HoT or HoF instead
but they're about to
no she doesn't
PE
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
S0 S0 is around 800 i believe
HoD score is not as high as i thought
they can't get past the opener
that's also why casuals can't step into the world of MA <a:hacker:998945514894671912>
yea the HoT one
:feelsclockman:
<:life:1001518241610485781>
Husk opener is probably the most tilted one for me
<a:hacker:998945514894671912>
everything feel easy afterward
if you can get past the opener
yea most of MA runs
took me 15 tries to get it right
i just tried it
timing is tight tho
but basically you need to dodge and CA with QK right after his hand swing
the timing is tight
not fast enough
you idiot
shallow sequence is forced support

Which prove that banning stats were a mistake
And competitive players all pick the safe augments

Almost 10 years since i last saw it
That’s an old school
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I think
Everyone thought she was dead but she activated the resurrection card
And ruined other people characters
Cause he kept breaking his character
Yea i think he did get banned
And refuse to adjust
X came in and sweat with like 6 new players
Like when people were trying to play friendly AmongUs
It’s both, he always has that unhinged vibe when he play group games
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
But i don’t even think they talk to him anymore?
X used to have people like Soda, Esfand, etc… to keep him in check
Could be worse, could have been TF Blade
Now his best friend is probably Train
I think it’s the fact that all the good people around him started to cut him off
And set up an appointment with his therapist
Yea i think X need to take a break from everything at this point
He changed into a gambling addict within like 6 months
And it’s literally just 2 years ago
He used to be very chill offstream, like he used to seperate his streaming personality and real personality completely
he used to be him
<a:sentifly:998950357789057055>
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
no way, it's her, the one that mimi mitsu mentioned
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
jfc twitch front page
he is lacking in baiting aspect
he is trying to meet the deadline with his group
then he can screenshot and <:omegalul:1030461063197626409> with his friends
almost got baited
that is a good one tho
he is trying to bait me
<@309634550273933314>
<:dongerk:1061701790640373861>
<:dongerj:981641448057356289>
you saw something like this irl yet?
finally touching some grass
Cause she was sueing him for not giving her half of his property
I think it’s just a marriage on paper kinda thing
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Oh and his soon to be ex-wife just send h3h3 a DM
With h3h3
There is a debate one i think
I don’t even know which one he is talking about
He is involving with too many drama
No kidding but
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
He might get raided and sentenced
Train haters should call the cops on him
And he was wide awake than ever
Then he went to the bathroom
Like he was being sleepy
Yea i actually saw it
He seem omega high
He went into the restroom and smoke a huge one
And during mid-stream
I watched train the other day for 5 minutes
What even happened to lil man
<:life:1001518241610485781>
Like xQc

<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
That’s kinda high for S0 team
owo math 47888 + 39800 + 31946
Where is the bot
owo 47889 + 39800 + 31946
This week is a high score week
850-870 is my guess
Probably not <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Yea he finally accepted that he is in EU
but im not at home to play it <:sadge:739809778263654491>
this might be a S0 900 angle
485D HoD
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
but he shouldn't sink his career more than it is rn
i don't know what lil man is trying to cook

2B A2 and Madam White will form a beast team  <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

It’s a family bonding episode
just reset until the first wave is dropped ideally
Minmaxing IO in ER is basically rolling for mob starting position
so i was really enjoy DA ER
she is just BBBBB but you need to position yourself after every arrows
yea she was added in 5.4
not much to optimize
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
SnS was fine but she got boring real quick
i had fun using HoF, HoS and DA
now it's just using the correct answer
ER was fun back then cause you need to optimize your runs
you know the reason why everyone think HoF need all 3 Ely sig because most people don't even bother to optimize ER run
HoF didn't need all 3 ely sig
ER back then
boss fight Raven was Bio
Raven is only IMG ingame because they need an IMG valk to introduce the execute mechanic
Raven is Bio
i can't tell if Heki is trying to be dumb or is actually dumb
sound like a beast to me
alright, how does doing HoD on 30 FPS laptop sound<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
yea unironically, people think it's cool to hate on sth that majority like
wait how <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
this suck, can't mald on next HoD, urgent business so i have to fly there soon to meet the client <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
what's up with that
why is it always Heki that talk about malding and minmaxing in WFP
<:life:1001518241610485781>
it's the world that casuals will never get it
<:okk:1110244301184696360>
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
HC is broken the hell
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but there is actually none
i would find a ref with SSS MPE + S0 QK
it's not bad just not idea
if MPE has cdmg affixes then it's not the correct affixes
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
S0 QK can 1 rot the mob?
RL?
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
Just read
Sp form is just inferior it’s crazy
She also fly around the map so can’t be target too
Her dps form has both <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
You picked Kalpas first?
It’s the inferior one
You use the sp form
Relax
So QK is better due to mech killer passive
Both teams can do it
Right now in our server
Around 488-490 when 9S QK can’t 1 rot the mob is where Hare pull off
Temp is too low for Hare to pull off by one rot the mobs
QK is top score
If you’re already wounded, taking another crash is acceptable
Unleash her S2
You know you want to
Just do it gresham
:secretech;
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
He is EU pilled
Not like he will need QK anytime soon anw
Did fragile go for S2 QK?
i yapped like crazy when i got unlucky but in reality i didn't think about it that much, it's like a sudden tantrum for fun
complaining is a also a fun habit if you're doing to your acquaintances <a:hacker:998945514894671912>
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
the time hasn't come
yea cause it's not time yet
QK value is around like 488+
temp dropped to 483 so can't really do anything about it
We kicked the kid <a:catJam:1076171671762894928> United <a:catJam:1076171671762894928>
Gresham is not in town
The pace they’re using rn to increase new valk dps is not big enough for new tier to happen yet
Maybe 1 more year tho
Even tho it’s the capscore
It leave a bad taste on their experience
Even for the top players, it would still feel bad if the capscore is 500 for 9S team
Not gonna happen
Aka is actually a gaming addicted
my man sign up to a fucking Apex tournament then announced 1 month break
<@148145559897636865> 
what are the needed coverage? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
then he add  you can't factor luck in avg calc 
bro trying to be a beast as explaining
when dumb meet dumber
<@148145559897636865>
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
I thought it was a satire too
Verbal abuse
He just want to game
I can bet my left nut that there is no way Aka’s reason for taking a break is due to health or shit like that
That’s why he take 1 month break
New Apex season is probably starting soon
Probably not
Bro is going to jail for online harrassment in KR soloQ
<@516591030326525983> 
my life worth a million lives <:okk:1110244301184696360>
1 more for S2
that's lucky <:okk:1110244301184696360>
gresham is sick of playing family with you idiots
keilo already quit
the fuck are you talking about
it's anything but good news
he should have distanced himself from this server 3 years ago
thinking of stopping xxx
knowing it's gresham, it's probably something like
just got to work <a:cuakhetday:944513685559332884>
i can bet my left nut Apex is having new season soon
<@148145559897636865> 
what's up nerds
He is making it too obvious
It’s a bait
C6R5 Blade
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that's on you
so you can do it twice
yea that's why QK has 2 forms
even when im out, im in <a:hacker:998945514894671912>
sound like you need to make an appointment with your doctor
almost done with Aponia
while im at it
oh i know, but i want to +1 for the achievement
for double Ely start
looking like a reroll 1st door angle
i already cleared this week reward, was trying to grab her stamps for SS1
the fuck is this
dude, i can't do 2.25 with HoS
Teri's fanbase: <a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
ever since 2.0
support her fanbase
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
literally RNG fest on top of RNG game
i don't even know what kind of retard would want to play in Shifting Sand <@148145559897636865> <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Cute and Kongming 😭 Cunning 😭
just wait
around 50 pts
she scores amazing alright
off by like 10 pts
so S2 QK score about the same with SSS MPE
last dude is tough
need proper strat tho
it's possible to clear it naked
My run was 3m30s with dps and 5m30s with sp
Dps form is definitely faster
click on exclamation mark
ranking check is here
<@218762069338619906>
that's pog <:okk:1110244301184696360>
why does QK ER only hold 1 button
wait
how about i clear you ass
:smoge:
so unless there is a miracle
and it's reaching ending of volume 2 soon
yea it have been consistently bottom 3 since launch
<a:aware:965946296236122172>

also Tenmaku Cinema is probably ending soon in ~3 chapters <@148145559897636865>
<a:gaeundizzy:850940878876573736>
i don't even remember wtf is the OG plot anymore

US and Britain too
DnD in Canada is omega big
oh it's definitely not niche

<a:Streaming:1039019999811088414>
time to check Twitch
new DnD game just dropped
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
bro actually just wake up and decided to go 8th
someone just pick 2 fon portal and type me Kayle deafen
Do this irl
then why did you say it?
did you try to do what you said in this pic yet heki?
?
gotta catch them all
The one that summoned 1 lil guy to throw grenade
It’s einstein band
Then start stuttering
I checked unread messages and heki ping the whole server
Why the fuck did heki mass ping last night
It’s because in that rot, you start with QK and GC before using SI so the lead buff of SI is useless until her turn
you do need it
but most of the time
yea depend on rots
MA probably depend
i know for sure she needs sp affixes in abyss tho
i actually have no clue
who
that's 45 atk per stig
the SI in ref has 1511 atk
it's impossible to 760 Aponia with my SI
it clicked
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
maybe not
i think <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
then it's server reset
if you get 4000 token before Monday
it depend on the Sirin event
server reset time
yea with that said, the book will be available to buy on Monday
so it has to be fair
i mean the one that play 600 days is not exactly bring them more profit than the one playing less than it but are already in RL
to make it fair
maybe it count automatically the previous circle
and it's probably Monday
if it's on Monday then only people that have played 600 days+ get the book in SEA
i actually can't tell
will this one open on next week Sunday or the Monday after
last act open only like 25th or sth
oh it won't
what a great design, pogger
there is no point to pull her rank
so if you can't pull at least 2 stig
so day 3 <:EZ:953617687735566356>
if you get 2 stig from the supply then you can
i will need to pull 2 Teri's stig to 4/4 her day 1
yea it's 10 entries per week
nothing change
the fuck
that's still 4 weeks
360/8 = 45
420 - 60 = 360
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it's fucked
4 and a half to be precise
it's 5 weeks
oh wait
53 is like 3 weeks
should be
as in if you don't pull a single stig from her supply, how many mirage entries do we need to 4/4 her
how many entries do we need to 4/4 Sirin
how is that even possible
and 760 Aponia
this 920 BKE is actually tilting me off
for fun
annoying ass animation
that's why it only lost 0.2s
i already did it
for fun
you lost 0.2s
i really dislike the weapon active after QK ult tho
:comboing:
because people will forget to use her combo
add QK to the club too
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
what is the new mobi 1 and 2
lil man play like Tet 3 months ago
pull some bitches in <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:life:1001518241610485781>

<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
get some bitches instead
im capped this week after using HoS
next week

His fps is 1
It’s a meme
Lil guy is up to something
<:okk:1110244301184696360>
Famous last words
Then get Hare
If you don’t stress about Myriad
Which 99% players already do it
Or else it’s just slow opener
S2 QK only matter when you want to get into Myriad
Both options are fine
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>

wonder why i can't 1 rot her P1
i just did 50 runs on Aponia

and 170 pulls for S2 PE
180 pulls for PE gears
yea i tilted to heaven back in 5.5 too
like gresham is in a bad mood then you ask  hey, how much DAMAGE it really took 
oh it's not rude but moreso insensitive
that's rude
😭
the fuck is that
1.4 sp/s is basically asking for another stig set
for the 1% TDM and ele dmg in ER
but no bitch to unlock their base A
what's up
<:okk:1110244301184696360>
<a:hellawicked:989997657747488871>
Broken even
Yea
Now
I need 1k waffers
<a:aothatday:925647030091665438>
I rolled nothing
There is no way im actually stuck with 1464 atk on QK
That’s a lot of Sushang M

<a:hacker:998945514894671912>
time for Nikke
that's enough Honkai for today
isn't the spending maxed at 40k
wait what
her opener that is
for no reason \
she is too fucking slow
but i don't know about S0 QK performance if you aim for Myriad
joking aside, Hare is good at S0
don't you want a new ankle
try it, yo <:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
everyone use S2 QK nowaday
S2 QK
you need to trust me on this one
QK
you know who is not fine at S0?
no way
bro my QK is stuck at 1464 atk
he pulled 2 weeks into the patch or sth
78k or somewhere around that
bro i ran out of waffers
just like your ankle
horrible
in fact i already did it
38 pulls until pity mean high chance you got her in the next 10-20 pulls
if you can afford it
nothing wrong with that
i would just go for S2 QK honestly
you already got QK?
this S2 shit better be worth it
alright got the S2 down
probably should try for S2

Real talk tho
Bro think he is him
<:okk:1110244301184696360>
When he learnt about daylight saving
1 of my friend literally had to go through therapy 10 years ago
Fucking waste of time
Still have no clue why they force NA to do it every year
Daylight saving is dumb
Yeah
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
Hope dude is still doing well, life is tough if you hate Fu Hua
What happened to him, is he still fine?

1st condition to be a maincord chatter
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
What if he is 2021 Rei
Maybe that is not 2023 Rei
Wait
Rei is making it too obvious
It’s a bait
yea load on my nuts
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
and the guy shit talk about Pain Cage
i saw the Kiana guy yesterday in Aether Gazer general chat
<:sadge:739809778263654491>
he ran out of drip
like Rei's group
they take turn to roleplay as retard and talk shit about PGR
so all EU beasts are in the same circle
wait the Kiana guy also talk weird about PGR
then you promote
then you copy it
then you make sure you have same gear
first you find a ref
this one is too good
<@370438895965306882> <@148145559897636865>
:incestge:
if i were to in charge of Genshin story, i would change the twin name to Aqua and Ruby
they should let me write the story
like these guys imagination is on another level
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
the rumor changed into  Honkai writters move to Genshin 
and then when Sumeru went live
it's the same guy directing it ever since chapter 5
i don't even know who start spreading Honkai changed writter
no joke tho but the only EU resident with brain i have met in maincord is fragile
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
what happened with EU
why is it always EU chatter that are retarded
:o7:
wait what
May 20th
that sound way too serious than it should be
wait what
isn't it kinda sad
i know that the girl bridesmaid unfollow her on social media according to loremaster
then i saw the top thread
i just saw X react on the dude
i actually don't know who they're either <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
it was fresh experience tho so all good
i literally woke up in a tent
my experience was also full of sweat <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
so i just ride along and had no clue what the hell i was doing there  <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
but that year my friend group asked me to go with them to fill in the number
yea im also a casual when it come to EDM
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
You haven’t go to EDC before, nini?
People get excited and start doing questionable things
There are lot of rape reports after EDC is over, mostly using drugs to do it
Better go with friends tho
So lot of weed and drugs are used
It’s a 3 full days festival
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Electric daisy carnival, it’s a music festival for EDM
Hearthstone
except Toast during his HS days
never watch anyone in OTV before
i know them because i opened my reddit and it's in the top
better go with friends
that place is just wild
<:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
i went to EDC during my Uni years and woke up knowing i had a 3some the night before without remember anything cause i used too much marijuana
it's just unfortunate
so if she suddenly got hit on she wouldn't be able to say no
the girl seem to used to have social anxiety
all kind of crazy shit happened there
no flame tho but who let your wife go alone to EDC
the girl started to change after her trip to EDC
reading the lore
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
The couple that stream their wedding year ago now broke up with the suspect that the girl cheated

Big bro have been streaming too fucking long this week that all the weird shits all happened to him
<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
SSS HoS = 47888
SSS QK = 47920
9S HN/Hare are with QK, SSS QK is +2 compare to SSS HoS
and when you take down shitter you get 20 mana refund
it's +30 ap compare to normal blue
9S QK = QK GC SI
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
9S QK = 9S HN = 9S Hare
oh it's actually 3 way tie
let me check the previous Jizo
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
it's 9S QK actually
<@148145559897636865> <:monkaW:838690827714166804>
except Hanser had to sing cyberangel for the 69420th time
i don't even remember anything about the concert
should be yea
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
god QK is next week and i have to play with S0 QK
jfc
that's a lot of works
:moronmode:
<@148145559897636865> 
which anime character is the most famous among teenage girl
what does girl use for their pfp
<a:hacker:998945514894671912>
time to paste that to my bio
i guess desperate time need desperate method
Gresham if you want i still accept funding fyi <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
:smoge:
70% of my failed runs were because i miss timing her sp
AE was extremely hard to minmax tbh
it was Assaka, Tank, Parvati
it was lit
you can try to kill AE for faster rot
if you have S1 AE
old Nirv strat back then
that remind me
but she needs a DK that stop timer when she farm sp on field
AE was lit tho
:shecant:
yea no she can't
but enough to gap S0 HTR by 50 pts
definitely not lol
i still need funding for S2 QK
that's also why
breach is fine
sp
so RC just win out
S0 HTR will never have enough sp on the 3rd rot to ult
like the previous AKA
S0 HTR < PV/RC
in some specific bosses/rots
yea it's extremely good
yea there isn't
after using QTE, combo or ult
it's a teamwide buff, 15s iirc
it's who on field
you can see the shield only drop 1 mini bar when it's just up
yea, each bleed stack count as 1 instance of damage
heki don't fucking give advice when you don't know how it work
Do this irl
Time to start dancing
that's not great
oh
that's great
99% playerbase never reach the real capscore
yea dorm can matter when it matter but when people blame everything on lack of dorm then it definitely not the only reason  <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
Cause you need fast rot
QK might not be an improvement over SS+ HoS specifically on HN’s bosses
really lowkey
Lowkey
If you can’t time it then when Griseo lift her hand up
When the middle jelly spawn
like when you break the shield of Big Jelly and when you kill it before the x99 shield is up
in Genshin and Honkai engine it usually happen on targets with big model or intense effect
hitlag is a phenomenon that usually happen to freeze/slow the target when you hit them unintentionally
nice one man
i just asked Shino how to execute the jelly faster and he hit me with  press buttons faster 
but you get cd gated by HoS evade so not sure
SSS HoS should be around 840
SS HoS ofc
836 should be capscore for dupes Aladdin
834 is capscore for Holmes
yea
so bad at the game
i can't manage to pass 830 <:sad:887911300284428309>
back in my Uni days it's normal
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
underground stats
<@148145559897636865>
probably -7 from capscore
im actually so fucking slow man, 829 <:sad:887911300284428309>
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
lowkey
<a:xddinside:1004308940835799060>
probably no
no new dumb emote to spam yet
twitch meta is stale atm
<a:sexdd:1109103829754069014>
for a second i thought it was Seto Kaiba
but not for everyone
fragile is the best among the top so it's slow and frustrating in his eyes obv
you should still pull for QK tbh even if you're in RL when you can afford it
<:HUHsirt:1132119036268904518>
why does he use Project Bunny instead of Punny
like usual
probably only affect Nirvana
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i haven't watched fragile's vid yet
is QK actually feel like HTR at S0 btw?
project and bunny 😭 punny 😭 uooh 😭
at best i will get 1 copy
yea me neither

Cool setup buddy
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
It’s unplayable
I don’t want to stuck with S0 QK
Gresham update is next week
<a:LaplaceBurst2:1047390820216614992>
Is it actually called “climax approaching state”
Project Bunny <a:uooh:964118021574623243> Punny <a:uooh:964118021574623243>
It’s your character
Can’t see anything wrong with it
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
She already harrass people irl and on internet
Heki is suited to play Pos 4
Now that i think about it
But then all Tech company insist on using it
But i still hate to use it
Yea Slack was the pioneer of Discord <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
At least that’s how it was
She can be at below 6k
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Discord at home
They all use Slack for no reason
Bro i hate working with Tech company
Heki want to play it, no?
why? you want to star playing Honkai competitively?
as long as you can get it
that's your source of gold and xp
yea that's pos 4 job <:ok:1088133019455467560>
oh wait is rune still in the game
sticking with carry is pos 5
you go around, pick up rune, harrass all the map
like an idiot
so you won't die
but that will require extreme work from your pos 4
you can play Mirana pos 2
yea but not ideally
Pos 1: hard carry
Pos 2: midlane
Pos 3: offlane (roamer)
Pos 4: Soft support
Pos 5: Hard support
i will make it easier for you to understand about dota positioning
usually
she is pos 4
no she can't
cause people are still playing
he went 8th so fast it doesn't even update yet on his score
big bro just went 2 8th in a row
<@148145559897636865>
Because SP = Sirin Paslana
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
problems?
but i call it battle pass log
log on deez nuts?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh wow, you actually can't <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
paladin = 16 balls, 4/4 + valk = 12 (weapon) + 10*3(stigm) + 32(valk) = 74
god human's ego are so huge despite being so fragile
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
especially in CN novel
genius exist
it doesn't matter
even if she started at 12
i mean
Trio T1
PE
Don’t go full shitpost
Or 70% shitpost
You only go half shitpost
Guys
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
scan the QR
if you i pull it with your fund then it's good value
but you can use Yi, Asol and Poro
Ornn is still the best tho
which is good
you can use multiple legends now
but augment balanced are still horrible
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
comp become balanced again
this patch is good <@148145559897636865>
Good one
But 50 frags are 50 frags
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
These kind of normal spending are just the extra bonus of that patch
6.8 is normal spending
6.1 and 6.4 were both big spending
<:HUH:975882565095399454>
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
i will get them all
can't play the game without their skins <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
9k6 for Kiana's skin
yea it's the correct amount <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
only Hare
Quantum Knight <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
unless i want to swipe
i think im stuck with S0 QK <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
how about you predict when will you get some bitches instead
you got me?
gresham i need 52k more <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
S2 look like a good stop
Yea just like how it’t not hard to beat SSS BKE right?
So who can steal Symphony Benares and Kevin?
Not to steal anyone boss
To keep her boss
She got buffed
PE has 3 bosses
That’s how a competitive game work, when you stay long enough, you go
Like any other valks
Then they just fade out
And why does they need buff in the future?
They’re the only team in this game that does not need any buff
And CN temp
Trio is doing other bosses at this temp
They become like any other valks
And now when the temp is at this high
They managed to do other bosses outside of their bosses because the temp was low
They received buff 10 and 6 patches ago when D was around 460-470
Does not make that valk value suddenly sky rocket
Just because they received a buff
No they didn’t
No she can’t
T1 is either SW or HTR
And Ice Benares is HoH’s boss
There is no frozen Benares
HoT can still do Husk -> so does HoO 
HoR got 2 new bosses -> so how many she has rn?
In the current D
So how relevant was HoT and HoR after receiving all the buffs
When even Trio can’t kill boss in the future
What can be done for them? What can be done for the current dps in the same timeline with them
And i can tell you rn at what D Trio is balanced and it’s not 460
PE was balanced at 460D max
Do you even know at what D PE was balanced at?
2 patches ago
What kind of question is that
+ Blood Homu, forgot about the dude
Ignite Benares, Kevin, Trio Benares, Parvati, HoC, Bull, Flower
Trio is the cheapest and most efficient team in existence
And HTR is a support in other 2 elements
Each one of them is a seperate dps in their own elements
Even ignore the fact that HoO was free
The only one you pull is HFI
And a dps in ice
1 is a support in fire + lightning
1 is free
Wdym by “ at their level of investment “
like 99% of the valks in this game rn
they still have their own bosses
even when they lose all the bosses that are shouldn't be their in the beginning
and Trio can't be buff with new toys in the future is also doesn't matter
it's competitive players that need to pull all the good stuffs
F2P have already use 1 team for 10 bosses
the whole point of the ongoing niche design is that competitive players are forced to pull for new toys
did you actually ask them to lose money for the sake of competitive player? <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Cause i quit dota competitive during that time
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Starting from Mars
I literally don’t know how to use any of the new heroes
Don’t know how hard your teammates need to stall to wait for your ass
When the game reach the 2nd Roshan
Dude is strong tho
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
Beast mode
Rtz picked him a week ago on stream and went 0/4 first 5 mins
Extremely fragile, hard to farm, easy to counter
Even 8k player doesn’t touch him
If you don’t want to get reported
Oh do not pick OD
Deny come later
Practice on last hit first
But
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Cause obv the enemy will try to do the same
You need to pay attention to their HP and try to be efficient at last hitting them while not dying
So you can’t just let your valk auto hitting the creep
Or else you will find yourself in a position to be ganked by their offlane and mid
But you also need to control the position of your creep
The basic of dota is built on last hit and deny
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Like being decent at last hitting yet?
Does heki even know how to farm yet
Better not
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Yea the floor don’t have a ceiling heki
After that you will never meet them anymore
But only for that game
You can still meet smurf
At least in theory
Like, you won’t play with player better than you
Ranked MMR start working when you decided to become a retard
Overall MMR start working when you play with real human
Overall MMR and ranked MMR
There are 2 kind of MMR
It’s based on hidden MMR
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
How to be a good dota 2 player: 
-If we win it’s me carry you noob
-if we lost it’s you fault you retard
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Or else type Bobo team
Just play AM, rush Midas and Manta, farm like a beast and hope you can carry
Especially pos 1 and 2
Not everyone want shard, just because it’s an upgrade item does not mean everyone should buy it
In fact don’t touch it at all
Yea don’t touch glyph if you’re new
It’s you last game
Pos 5 = walking ward
Pos 3 and 4 = off-lane + solo
Pos 1 and 2 = the 2 carries
Pos = position = farm priority
Why are you even trying pos 2 anw
Try practicing Pos 1 tbh
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
2 kills 13 deaths
All the fun one
Also
Fun valk = hard to play
Relax
You’re 2/13 with DR
Yea no shit <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Heki download the wrong dota 2 setting
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
What kind of question is that
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
That’s not bad
Pos 2 and 2/13/10
<:worryIronman:889716922827046982>

<:HandsUp:816800032267304960>
it's Hydra Saturday

ending the game or not maybe?
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
fuck does it mean situational
buying BKB on DR mean you're pushing for 1-2 last combat
game is already over
if you even get to buy BKB on DR
and Skadi, and Satanic
no one get to the point where you buy shard on DR
the Luxury part is actually useless
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
2 monkeys
sure man, you're a beast <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
this game is just impossible to balance once you actually start working on it
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
haven't heard anything about it ever since then
1 of their new employee, Riot Iniko, he used to be a TFT pro before applying to Riot at the end of 8.5, he usually talked on stream during previous set that if he get the chance, he will make this game completely balance
instead of just admit they go the fun route
but the problem is that they keep using dumb excuses on how the game is balanced
going for the fun is probably the right choice
tbh i know it's impossible to balance a game like TFT
and they still don't do anything about it
how Noxus have been strong since the start of set 9
it's actually crazy
Noxus haven't been touched a single time yet
while Kaisa is already trash
Yasuo literally got hit with a nerf
what work last patch -> trash next patch
what didn't work last patch -> giga broken next patch
their philosophy is literally just
yea but then that's the problem
but apparently not the case
like they said at the start of set 9 that they will stop doing balance thrash
some changes are actually retarded
cause i think this set balancing have been horrendous
double the team size but taking turn to work instead of working at the same time
i still think banning stats is just a way of saying  sorry guys, we can't balanced the game even with double the team size 
i see
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
and ask them nicely or meet them in the court
the only answer is just adding new rules to their ToS
cause i don't know how augments still show up in match history but tactics tool stop showing it
they asked very nicely
yea i think so
S-word is against TOS now
did you know yesterday on Kurumx stream, he was opened the google docs containing stats before it got banned then Mort tune in and said it's bannable if he publicly use stats on stream <@148145559897636865>
i miss stats :smoge:

there is really nothing much can do, keep playing, try reading guide
like heavily change it
for fun
Icefrog keep changing how the meta work every 3 months
Dota 2 is definitely not newbie friendly
probably playing with smurf
no it's normal
SW
cause everyone will spend 25 hours a day in it to minmax everything
but mort and ken doesn't like that idea
oh they did think about it
just run and cut his chase
if you're being targeted
do nothing
but standing next to turret in dota 2
heki i don't know which moba you play before
it's called Solo Tactics
new mode
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
got you a better one
not bad
that is definitely horror
your film list look interesting
that's not bad
wow checked almost on everything but incest
the 9 dash line
oh that one i know<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
i don't understand about it either <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yea apparently only people that live in SEA understand how bad it is
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
any context on Barbie being banned in Vietnam?
<@82358863155703808>
let me ping the only vietnamese in here if he know anything
some weird sea territory conflict <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it's due to their conflict with China
1 of the artist in Barbie production team add a map that is banned in Vietnam iirc
it's banned
kinda blow
there is no Barbie in Vietnam
anyone watching Openheimer this weekend?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

bro this patch <@148145559897636865>
My brain just stop working for a second
Yea it’s kinda annoying whenever i need to look back at it
It’s actually fairly useful
It help in predicting the growth/change of <subject>
Why are you mathing
<:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
sound like an 8th
the type that will never try to improve at anything and just live to piss off people
i genuinely hate these type of people <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
 following rotation are all sheep 
 i like to be creative 
why is your <:monkaW:838690827714166804>  look pale
Onk 124
it's live
<@148145559897636865>
but apparently they take turn to work
double the team size
yea and now he is a T-hex
i wonder what comp will be broken <:clueless:973756617109676032>
then buff the shit out of Cassio, Karma, Soraka
halve the mana cost of Taric
this patch is just dumb
also
now it become Think Forever
oh they fixed the interaction of it with rolling for days
from Think Fast to Think Forever
you can get any 4 cost 3*
and have about 40g
if you somehow lv 7 on 3-2
not when combat start
you get free rolls until end of the round
think fast is bugged rn in new patch
<@148145559897636865>
:fricc:
my back will actually broke if i do it irl
do this irl
unless it have actual info going around about Kiana or The 1st one
definitely never
isn't Cez B alone better than all physical supports Genshin ever have
<:dongerj:981641448057356289>
75% damage taken
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
HN SI HoS
just bring the whole squad of Honkai to Genshin and you can save physical side
<a:Booba:1081435431540903936>
yea she has golden ratio body
<a:Booba:1081435431540903936>
the only thing physical have flying around the screen is
so does Geo
yea physical doesn't have a lot of stuffs flying on your screen
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486> reactions?
isn't Geo just physical but piss color instead
what happened to it
the what now
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
so in general scenario, physical always have to compete with 5-10% more resistance on enemies compare to elemental sides
but then in Genshin formula, resistance can go below 0
so all the enemies have extra physical resistance to balance around that
it shred like 40%?
the reaction whatever is it called
i think the design of physical have a core problem
Mika
or QK
physical never get HoS
like in an alternative timeline of Honkai
it's just bad
Real shit
yea avp on each stage is what make stats broken
but broken on 3-2 and 4-2
it's omega bad to take on 2-1
like this for example
cause context matter a lot
yea it's actually really important
i think
like they remove the specific info of augments but the winrate is still there
i think they're still there but not the specific stage of each augment
<@148145559897636865>
:smoge:
stats are gone
so probably a 9
oh i just went 8th
<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
i even struggle to climb the ladder whenever i try to check my house's roof
<:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
yea i would rather stay far from those kind of rooms
im fine with staying in a skyscraper but if you ask me to eat near window for better view then count me out <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
1 of the things in my to-do list is trying out sky diving but i have acrophobia <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
your body at least
so you want to try all the dumb shit when you still can
isn't it kinda a waste, the older you get the less chance you get to black out
my last checkup, doc said i need to stop eating fastfood and drink alcohol like a maniac <:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
but i really need to stop getting hangover
only happened twice a year, all good
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
woke up on the floor of some random hotel
yea i said that to my friends all the time
<@148145559897636865> world most useful dummy
<:worryPopcorn:411066690021883915>
in general
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<@416445660443967491> thots?
more than 5 people trying to play the game
for NA it's kinda sweaty
so S2 HoO might need another mini rot
cause i have just enough damage to reach the 1st checkpoint with SS HoO
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
S2 HoO maybe around 630-650
it's lit
yea i just follow siesta's ref <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
if Husk don't do stupid stuffs
only need to pray on last transition
yea rot is easy too
ofc it is
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
bro HoO is too strong, 700+ easily <@370438895965306882>
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
-600
i forgot to spend resin on twitter
that's like 15 pulls
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Akshan and Jinx's nerf are really huge
when her ult can't be interrupted anymore
it's the same as Samira in set 8
it's actually pretty big
while Kaisa is already struggling to be primary carry
and Yasuo nerf
Lux buff, Aphelios buff, Jerry buff, Urgot buff
you saw the patch rundown yet?
cause next patch will be casino again
yea im turbo playing this patch
that song is lit
im listening to Barbie Dreams and turbo highrolling
Any knowers? <a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
It’s a mecha show right?
Maybe a skin based on the mecha
Yea i think
<:dongerk:1061701790640373861>
But 2022 valk isn’t
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Oh, both will be free honestly, eva collab poster didn’t have HoR at first
What’s up
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:TMNT1:1098101243169214604><:TMNT2:1098101569364443306><:TMNT3:1098101651828654130>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
it's Lux + Azir or Aphelios/Jerry every games
wot
bro Ionia is omega trash now
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
what the fuck
<@148145559897636865>
it's peak degen in challenger but this deafen meta is too fun
yea im actually having fun tbh
she has the recon mechanic
Kaisa just counter Zed/Darius too hard
so reroll comp couldn't wait til stage 5 to outscale Kaisa
<:Shyggers:866898576802054144>
for 20-0
she railed people on 4-1
but when Kaisa was a beast
or after 4-5
until you hit on stage 5
and falling off on stage 4
like reroll comp usually try to stable on stage 3
yea it's Kaisa that single handedly held 4 cost meta together
and Lux/Azir get hard farmed by Zed/Darius/Akshan
Kaisa became trash
oh it became reroll meta cause of the C-patch
it's next week
oh it's just a preview on pbe
yea, surely
so that he can oneshot people with deadeye emblem
dummy get 50 AD
like whole new patch
oh next week is 13.14
next week back to 4 cost meta
i will miss it
this deafen meta is too funny
<:okk:1110244301184696360>
zed 3 on 3-5
i call Zed without any zed and deafen
i just had a game with golden ticket on 2-1, glove sword opener
no one stand a chance to contest your comp
the most busted augment rn is definitely golden ticket and think fast
i like it too when i hit
for no reason
that comp is just too dumb
so it just 2 Taliyah 2 Sett Swain Teemo + J4
but you usually win the game at lv 7
2 Taliyah, 2 Sett, Swain, Teemo, 2 Sion, Ksante
ideally capscore of Taliya Sett is
yea shurima ryze
this also work
like social distancing 2 or ton of stats
double trouble 2 work too but you need omega combat augments for the other 2
but you need trickster glass
you can play it normally too
yea you desperately need Double trouble 3 to play Taliyah Sett
oh double trouble 3 = sell everything on 3-2, roll for Sett + Taliyah
i got you with the tech
2 Kayle + 2 Poppy/Maokai + bow opener = Kayle /deafen
Zed from orb + glove opener = Zed /deafen
Akshan from orb/Jhin 2 + sword/RH opener = Akshan /deafen
Noxus opener = Noxus /deafen
Darius/Kat from orb = Noxus /deafen
<@148145559897636865>
:geniusmode:
beast mode
im flexing in every reroll comps possible
oh im playing flex now
only 1 dude rerolling Zed
no one playing Akshan
im playing disneyland man
:lebronjam:
<@148145559897636865> i just found a banger, robin listen to this shit and went omega 1st
then you somehow make it into an 80s sitcom
it just funny for it to happen
oh you definitely aren't in the wrong
and play it when you say sth stupid
remember to take the audience laugh with you
you should bake a cake and apologize to them
maybe they will forget everything in next episode
kinda lit
this conversation actually feel like an 80s sitcom
not the 80s sitcom
relax tet, it's real life
tell them you're practicing for a stage play
They want to feel special
Cause most people suffer from superiority complex
<:worryIronman:889716922827046982>

<@309634550273933314> <@148145559897636865> <@516591030326525983>
What’s up?
oh wait what <:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
the 1st slash, you can attack her without using charge shot
it's not that
did you use her charge in the 1st slash?
but even then it should be enough
nvm i don't have S0 Kira account
let me test it
Why do you need 2 shots to kill <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
not bad
went 64th out of 64 players
<@148145559897636865>
looking lit
what game is that
still RC for other teams
cause she is a beast
if he buy Bchip and not xtals
yea around that
like a beast
deliver newspaper, milk and clean the pool all summer <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
but i work my ass off for it
i dropped 500$ on MTG during my middle school year <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
lil bro actually has some gambling problem
i don't know in what country a 14 can spend shit ton of money like this
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
Kaisa without Shonjin <:dongerk:1061701790640373861>
Is <:dongerj:981641448057356289>
Yea Liss with Dcap JG Morello
It’s literally Ionia Yasuo + Kaisa but cheaper and better
It’s the combination of backline access from Akshan and big ass aoe from Liss
cause Akshan 2* is better than Aphelios 2* + Urgot 2* + 4 deadeye
or you default into Akshan
you pick the reroll comp that no one contested
yea it's literally the correct way to play this patch
and went first with Taliyah
because i hit double trouble 3
i just sold a Karma 2 on 3-2
the correct way to play TFT is picking what to reroll from scouting
there is actually no way
there is no way man
if a triplet absorbs his siblings in the mother wombs does this mean he is a 2 star baby?
alright keilo, quick quiz
reroll meta
this tourney will be peak degen

yea you can ask heki for it
it's bug abusing
if you're watching old refs
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
at least the food is good
Vietnam is lacking in non-mainstream sports, i don't think they even have an actual campsite across the country <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
speaking of camping, my camping license has expired for 1 year already <:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
:KkonaW:
unless you have a  camping license
usually you're not allowed to camp faraway from them anw
it depend on your camp location, 90% of campsites have proper toilet block and other washing facilities
the only thing you need to do yourself is bonfire
a lot of new gears and gadget everyday
camping now is fun and relaxing than before
there is actually not that many bugs unless you just straight up go camping after a rain
kayaking in Ohio
already sound like a red flag
pretty fun honestly
<:okk:1110244301184696360>
i like camping in group but none of my friends also like it so usually i just host a group and find people near me that also want to do it
can't you just find a group near you?
why does chill is cold but chilly is hot
quick question

5 of those are called God Achievements
too skill issue for it
i have about 20 achievements in HK that i haven't managed to do it
and a 5 hours speed run achievement
that have a meele boss, a ranged boss and a cc boss at the same time
like there is an achievement require to 100% a temple
it's just normal hardcore achievement but the problem is in boss designs
i literally broke 1 of my controller last year
the most fucked up game to hunt for achievement is actually Hollow Knight
72 hours doing nothing is a good example i guess
i played for almost 200 hours and only manage to get to 60%
talk about 100% Ori
heki is not even spend more than 15 minutes in Honkai
there is no way that gonna happened lmao
because
and the hack n slash spin off called Honaki Impact 3rd

Big bro literally just being himself and that is enough for his viewers
the one that actually doesn't have a streaming personality is Soju
it's actually funny and educational tbh
oh cause his chat keep asking  why the notepad old man  so he just play along with it
yea setsuko is committing omega hard into his onstream personality
while at the same time my dude flame everyone onstream for playing bad
like when Robin got day 2 in regional qualifier, he was the 1st to reach out to robin and told him  it's just unlucky day, don't let it affect you 
he is super humble offstream
basically just like xQc
he pretend to mald, pretend to read chat and stuffs
it's just how he is
stream until death

Yea
Like Shurima Legacy
Or they can make it start shooting projectile
Deadeye probably yea
Since it will have 50 base AD
Maybe its avg will go up next patch

but challenger players will always take it
this augment avg is so fucking low
but seriously tho
shiny
look lit yea
unless you have WW hero augment
Kaisa is the only carry in challenger

that look terrible
also my dummy just ambush their backline
yea which is equal to silver augment
does this one even cookable
<@148145559897636865> what the actual fuck
but before he realized, he already save up enough money for his parents and live the rest of life just playing TFT <:okk:1110244301184696360>

I think im a beast compare to the overall
I don’t look down on myself
I think the 1st step to become a beast is to admit that you’re bad at the game honestly
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
You put in extra effort to overcome her bugs
Half of HoS’s problems are coming from her bugs
But not the “ evade spear Hua “
She is definitely the easiest Hua
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I guess it’s to protect their fragile ego
Idk why most people try to act like they’re a beast
They’re just showing people why they’re hardstuck casual
<:ICANT:921403877285306399> see
It just happened
They didn’t bugfix it
The gap is just bigger than it supposed to be
JK will still kill HB
Oh i mean that really won’t change anything
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
The same people who complain about powercreep
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
No we’re not
Or lower
Like at best the 1%
The heavy powercreep only apply to people that compete at the very top
While sitting in A3
People overstimate the powercreep way too much
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
That’s pog
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Cassiopeia
Why doea Cassio both Noxus and Shuriman?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Is Sona Demacian or Ionian?
Wait so
They'll only see one. <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
My dance has forty-two forms.
I must make it count.
I have but one life to give for Ionia.
This land will be their graveyard! :irelia:
Let them come! <:gayge:1017439025742753802>
with super tank Poppy 4*
you have 10 carries in that comp
but when that comp hit 9
i think Kayle without going 9 is balanced
it's the comp
but making it to 9 with reroll comp is hard af so i guess it balanced out
for no reason
this Kayle reroll comp cap is so high
Thoughts on fighting Ionians on their home soil? <:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747> :singsmic:
question
Showmaker is actually a natural born entertainer
that's a lot of public
oh wait it's not Ksante <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
why does tet's name have ksante
you're 2 weeks old
is he a beast
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
They just want to play the most recent comp they see ShawnTFT play
Not like they’re gonna pivot
I don’t even know how legends is actually good for casual players tbh
It’s lit
So they will remove legends by the end of set 9
Every legends will get their turn and become trash 1 patch later
By the end of the set
So probably Dragon King next
But now Ezreal is trash
Yea it’s only feel bad before cause you just get run over by Ezreal
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I think Dragon King
You can’t miss shit
Legends just don’t
And hero augments actually have a chance to miss
When they couldn’t even do it with hero augments
Like they’re actually balancing around legend augments
No joke
Because of legends
This set is actually just ruined
<:dongerj:981641448057356289>
For 53g
The one where you can sell 4 cost valk
But Dishsoap use the yordle bug
When facing Sett abuser
Even dishsoap has to bug abusing too
Got 20-0
While playing 6 Ionia
Yesterday Robin roll Zzrot on TG
Yea it still is
now remover/neeko cause Sett to keep triggering it
Void also clear it
yea Freljord somehow clear Ionia bonus
how about you guys actually start doing your job first
a Rioter literally make a tweet 1 hour after soju went mental boom about how  Western pros don't think outside of the box like Chinese pros 
you know the best part is?
in soju's stream
10 games in a row
when the dude bug abusing
like is banning a player actually that hard
it actually amazing how incompetent Riot is
you kill everyone but Sett
oh you can't kill Sett
overtime kill Sett
she just clear whole board
oh cause you can still be killed by Ionia/Challenger Belvussy
still in Challenger ladder
94 games, 90% top 4, 70% winrate
someone abuse Sett's healing bug to Challenger
and their summer vacation
just like Riot game
might still be a beast
then again i don't know how is she performing in RL
won't tell new players to even pull for S0 HTR
lowkey
like i lowkey
S0 HTR won't cut it anymore
consider you can only damage it from her physical damage
yea i think it would take you a lot of effort to kill Pig with HoR
So he can screenshot it and laugh with the gang

other countries have different kind of laws or straight up ban it

In China there is a law implemented that anything available in the cash shop through RNG must also be able to be purchased with currency that can be earned in game and players must know how long until they will earn that item in the worst case scenario

she is meant to be Hare but Psy
her weather was summoned weather since V1
it has always been that since V1
489 <:ok:1088133019455467560>
might be 450
or lower
on the current dist probably 480-500
they share the same mechanic
but Mech boss
her weather is literally just Hare's weather
her weather is summoned weather
she does
how much the buff actually make the diff between 9S Supports vs S0 Hare
you will realized it when you use triple supports on Aponia
nah it's at high dist
so no more copium dps
it's fine, we have QK on that soon <:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

just have the model of a 13
yea she is a war veteran
they have legal cunny <:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
in fact i don't even think big boobs or big ass are the major in Nikke <:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>

<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
Ignite Fu Hua is guarantee to have 3 bosses belong to her on live <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
it's just another unique multiplier
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
because somehow each part is another multiplier
and Ignite in the future
stuff like Bleed, Summoned
do you know why the difference is that massive in these type of niche weathers
<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
her own boss is Summoned Weather Sentinel Prime
just because triple supports have to play without buff
the difference between S0 Hare and 9S triple supports are too fucking high
no it's S0, i can bet my left nut for it
same case with HN vs other dps
only Hare and QK benefit from both parts
TP can only benefit from the 1st part
Summoned weather buff have 2 parts
epi are you testing my patience for you ?
is the fact that QK the only one outside of Hare that actually benefit from the buff not obvious enough ?
<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
and triple supports play the game without Abyss's buff
TP is not even better than triple supports
2nd best option
time to do 1 run on Aponia and sleep
<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
just in time for Fontaine
there are riots in France rn
<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
have some of this <:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
it complete that comp
that's also why Ezreal augments are broken rn
so you need like 8 items
the core of that team is being able to itemize Azir, Lux and Nasus
but Azir and Lux can use everything as long as it's AP
it's just a good item to slam
but even then i don't think Shiv is also necessary
it's Shiv and Gunblade
oh absolutely not
items does not really matter as long as they can get you to 3*
for Katarina + Darius, you only need them at 3*
you only need LW
yea for like Tristana
yea cause Ekko has no trait to boost AP
trying to improve your early game by slamming acceptable items
even if it's not the best
for now you should start to slam early items
cause i slam items like a beast
i got a 3rd with Tristana reroll <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Ezreal is just broken
i don't think you need TF or Lee Sin for reroll
oh actually
yea being able to see other lines take practice
thought on fighting Ionians on their home soil ? <:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
Azir and Lux are just the most stable but forcing it can't really get you top 4 everytime
Jerry : 2-1 Piltover
Aphelios : Ionia open with Guinsoo + DB + combat augments
Darius + Katarina reroll : good Noxus opener
Taliyah + Sett reroll : double trouble/two healthy
Sorcerer : need emblem

thanks god TFT have the best chat experience
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
like if my chat experience is bad, even a good streamer can't save my mood
i can't watch a stream without opening twitch chat
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
they also need to have a good chat and good emotes
tbh im not the type that like a stream because of the streamer alone <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i don't think they do <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
emotes are like a part of twitch's charm
unless 7tv also move to Kick
oh probably never
<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
Kick
wait, i know the best replacement

most people i met in Vietnam doesn't know about Discord
maybe Facebook is hidden broken

like this instead <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
oh it's definitely heki
and this one is HI3-Rei
what if there are 3 different Rei tho
like Rei is incharge of Mihobo's games
what if his gang are all doing it but different games
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
maybe part-time ?
you know Rei intentionally saying dumb shit so he can screenshot our reactions and laugh together with his gang
that one was too obvious
but he is a beast at it
you should be a beast at baiting
don't make it too obvious Rei
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
paypal me 200$ so i can pull another Zaychik set to find out gresham
maybe with full atk affixes it could go higher
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
even with SSS Echo probably cap will still be 700-720
yea it's lower than i expected it to be
need more atk on HTR for 680+
maybe -10
alright, probably near to capscore
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
on twitch ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
what does it look like
and you put tank items on Naysus
best item is Shiv > Gunblade > everything
Guinsoo is bait on Azir
<@148145559897636865> it clicked
what the, summer skin is tmr and not today
mainly Azir
so now only Ionia and Azir/Lux is viable
they overnerfed Jerry and tune down Aphelios for fun
oh it definitely is yeah
better dps output without losing anything if you can do it smoothly
so doing it won't harm you in any ways
but her combo has time stop
just sp and extra damage
i need to do Echo's combo faster after ult <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
my laptop went blue screen while i was doing it during my trip

if you play at max setting yea, Symphony Benares has the most intense effects and layers of them
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
you can't even control the RNG aspect of Symphony Benares, you just pray it go well
Ice Benares is still better than Ignite Benares and Symphony Benares <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
right at the start
or else the crab wouldn't spawn with a big jump
i mean yea that's the point of mobs
<a:BronyaJump:480122156542328834>
the real boss
you do no fucking damage to the crab
even with SSS Echo
is impossible to do in 489D
lmao that run of fragile
what is NA's temp ?
Game is relaxing <:okk:1110244301184696360>
only 1 person need to buy it
yea they have buddy client for it
you can also ask your friends or acquaintances to play with you, they don't need to buy it
yea with randos <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

Portals ?
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
but my gut telling me that HTR is better
yea instead of HTR
i will do it on Sunday too
i haven't tried RC yet
i will improve the rot during Sunday
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
capscore is probably 650
im sticking with triple supports for now
kinda annoying
different teams require different timing and rots
depend on team
still HoH
im not acting
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
it look like this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>

Genshin Impact ?
they don't even know they're dumb
they're beyond saving
it's not even fun making fun of idiots in there anymore
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
that's also maincord
<:life:1001518241610485781>
even a retard can tell the new toy will be so much better
Lightning SP and Bio ignite dps
maincord still won't cook for the next 2 patches
i just realized
fuck
when the difference is clear
can't really cook
they just transfer data from live server to beta
beta dist = RL dist on live server when they open beta
<a:aworryWatchesRain:902283502572150835>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

agree?
it is made based on 2 best country in the world, France and England
surely Fontaine will be lit tho
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
sometime i wish i could think Genshin as a fun game, life would be so much better cause my standard already reach rock bottom
the 2 mfs never face each other once
how the fuck is this illegal

SS Kira tho <:okk:1110244301184696360>

don't even have sp to ult on first rot
alright SS Echo it is <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>

Oh i think people want to play stillwater now
this shit is too bm
Riot Mort (3/3) But this also means do NOT expect any B-patches over the course of the patch. 🙅‍♂️❌🛠️ We want to see that natural meta shift as well. 🔄🌍💡 Plus there is Riot Summer Break. ☀️🌴😎 So enjoy the patch, and we’ll continue to prep more changes for 13.14 and beyond. 🎉✨🚀 Thanks all! 🙌💖
these guys are too fast
oh i miss the name of it
at least this patch is good for farming tuber
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
cause all 12 Samira were out of the pool
but instead of Samira, the orb had 4 gold
and had to pick up the orb
but he roll all 50g, hit nothing
so he want to roll for 1 Samira before picking it up
but a player had big neeko
so at 4-2, 6 out 8 player pick Samira augments
but hero augment was on 4-2
people go 7 and roll for Samira
it was Samira meta
during set 8 Regional qualifier
oh that remind me
time to DM mort
so the game is just doomed
you have to hold units to maintain your position
so like even if you highroll
there will be fucking Kaisa 3, Yasuo 3, Urgot 3, Aphelios 3
so at 4-5
no one will be able to do that
if the highroll dude doesn't roll and hold Kaisa/Lux/Azir/Yasuo
that's kind of a dilemma
game end at 8
oh cause you can't go 9
you go 9 and roll for 3* 5 cost
i know how to counter 3* 4 cost
it clicked
i think for legend augments 2-1 should be good, 3-1 mediorce and 4-2 straight up 8th
i think their direction on legend augments are wrong <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
right ?
they deliver B-patch tmr
surely
yea sound good <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
anything but self repair
or Shrink
oh you don't play Heimer on your board unless you can afford to pick Mechano Swarm + Goldinator
this patch is wild
i even saw Jerry 3* went 8th
you play for 2nd
or else someone hit Kaisa 3 and it's over
you actually need to hold Kaisa
this is so fucked up
while players need to play buggy game
they having fun in PBE
8.5 for fun patch was for the devs
who hit more win the game
actually jackpot
this is not TFT
<@148145559897636865>
talk about adding QoL
i don't even know how they manage to let Genshin run normally
yea Genshin literally run by black magic
 oh boy, i can't wait for the next cycle, it's gonna be lit 
you don't look at Genshin's Abyss schedule and be like
Echo is as cracked as an SP can get
literally the combination of RC and HB
who ask for your subjective opinion again ? <a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
probably, can't remember the name
kinda fun
and you can only use trial valks
yea the it's the one with ER UI
and stop blaming it on everything but yourself
at least have the gut to admit you want to quit
just give up
it's you
it's not the patch
when you find a patch boring
i will tell you a secret
the fuck you mean boring
this patch is literally the same with any patch
fucking betting your point on Casino patch
nice
Freljord Cup will be play on this patch
oh i just check the schedule
is Pig 3 even do anything
i don't know why lil bro turn on his PC, queue up a game, picking Draven to go for pig 3
banning stats just seem like a way of saying  we can't balanced legends so we have to hide it 
now that the game become like this
this is just sad
yea look like it <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
can't remember exactly
i only saw the meme
me neither <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Cupcake <:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
glad to see that they make a game from it
i love Cait from the original animation
it's like worse Draven
love that champ
Aphelios has always been the coolest
<:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
the more players try to force it the worse it get
it's like a reroll  comp actually
cause only 2 can hit
if there are 3+ players go for it
oh i actually think Targon Aphelios also lowkey wasn't that good
Draven, Asol, Caitlyn, Ezreal
but now this whole patch is a problem
Jerry alone wasn't even that broken, highkey
last patch the only problem was Piltover
the ability to force the broken augments is legit dumb
Legend is just a mistake anw
<:5Head:816797515571396638>
we keep portals but remove legends
i have a great idea tho, this might help this patch
even if they nerf Draven, Asol will be the next in line
yea Asol is also broken
RNG actually out of control
if not get a top 4 and dip
then you roll for 3* 4 cost
you can stable and hope the others that contest you die
if you hit all of them on 4-2
how fast did you hit your carry 2*
the next problem is that
then the cherry on top, you pray you hit your carry on 4-2
components RNG
board upgrade RNG
SoW RNG
it's actually out of control
this patch have too many RNG layers
but for Tome and good stuffs you need Pris SoW
yea you can get big neeko with gold SoW
from killing units
on stage 3 you can get a Tome for fun
also do you know that Pris Spoil of Wars is the wet dream
is not how you want a 2-1 augment to be
buffing a gold augment from 20% to 25%
but
im not exactly a beast at doing math
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
augment diversity achieved
you need to actually try your best to login and not log out after 5 minutes
Genshin Abyss and Genshin Star Rail are really competitive tho
casino online here i come
to gamble
it's time

“ augment diversity “

Maincord users aren’t real either

<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Her weapon buff only last like 10 seconds
Does this count as reusing her weapon active
She wasn’t supposed to name Kira
It’s her original name iirc before they change it to Kira
<:okk:1110244301184696360>
I allow it
You guys can use it too
Now you guy know
mb <:okk:1110244301184696360>
im talking with others so i use her old name here
only SEA year 1 player know
it's a SEA only name
does Echo use her weapon active automatically ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
you'd rather focus on 4* the current generation
like at all
next generation of elf does not matter
any kind soul want to fund my SS Echo ?
:diesofgwen: inc
<a:aothatday:925647030091665438>
thanks god
Tet bark at anyone with male genital
:smoge:
not in real gameplay
cause im a beast at doing tutorial
that's also why HFI in Tutorial ran out of buff
Timer tutorial remove all time stop effect
in tutorial timer is absolute
but i want to do triple supports instead
if i were planning to use HoH i would probably sit to
yea probably need to buy a x15 card
can only get 25 rn
for 2s
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
missing about 50 frags
30 pulls, 4 dupes
there is no normal rot
if you aim for Myriad
problem is that
you will never feel lack of sp if you do normal rots
CN Myriad use it
5 atk + 1 spcr
if she need it
probably SS only
and my HoH is S0
because i want to try triple supports instead for Myriad
im not using HoH this patch
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
any knower ?
is S Echo better than SSS RC
but still 0 bitch
Lowroll go next
If you highroll you top 4
That’s why it’s casino
Just click Draven’s augment
You don’t think
And nerf all combat
Oh cause they triple buff all 3
You must be sick in the head to play anything but Draven
Yea challenge players already caught up with meta
Who <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Not gonna ruin my MMR in a no cashout casino
Time to get on my smurf
Hitting 3* 4 cost every games
This patch is definitely fun for casual tho
Yea defintiely a lot of effort to turn a balanced patch into a casino
He said they put a lot of effort into this patch
Riot Iniko was so fucking confident last night on his stream
This patch is made for Train and xQc
So all of his playstyle and experience he build up until now are trash
He wasn’t a low HP player
Cause his game sense don’t let him play like Gold
This is what people do in low elo
Cause this is not TFT
Every good players are struggling
Did you see robin’s score ? <@148145559897636865>
Bro
You just hope you hit before them
Yea there is no counterplay for that neither
<:clueless:1009089400174559294>
It’s a worse Turg on everyone else
No one can use it except Echo
it was a fun year using RC <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
the current Shigure Kira stigma was called Echo back then
yea it was her old name back when SEA was still 1 year old
it's 5 atk + 1 spcr
<:PecoSalute:651230026406166560>
good bye RC
alright done
aim for your closet 3* 4 cost
and roll for full upgrade board
go 8 at 4-1
pick all Draven's augments
you don't roll a single time before lv 8
actually casino
nvm this patch fucking blow
what the actual fuck
Riot Summer Break
But this also means do NOT expect any B-patches over the course of the patch. We want to see that natural meta shift as well. Plus there is Riot Summer Break.  So enjoy the patch, and we’ll continue to prep more changes for 13.14 and beyond.  Thanks all!
it's Draven 24/7

Aphelios when he saw J4 holding EW + Vow + Radiant Warmorg

cause HN ult trap HoS in the animation, only 1 out of 20 or 30 runs HoS will do transition immediately
that's also why rolling for good opener is a tragedy on this boss
but when Osu's UI show up, everything stay the same
basically how it work is that if she escape weaken phase when you just press ult, she will still wake up from it
she still stay in that phase until HN's ult is over
as long as you press ult before the weaken phase go away
yea for like 0.2s
and on 2nd rot of P2, use chain instead of spear when you switch back to HoS
stay on spear and do basic
don't do chain to explode the red clone
im a beast at slamming shiv and hit TF at lv 7
yea it was during oxforce meta
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
thought on fighting Ionians on their home soil ? <:hmmge:1015313814624931951>
<:Shyggers:866898576802054144>
Ahri 2 out of my ass
Irelia 3 for free
this game was too highroll tbf
that's not bad
top 2
and call it a board
go 9 if possible for Sej
probably this
not that bad tho
yea it fucking suck
im about to cook a crazy board
i got Ionia creast
so it can't be vow
oh i just got a cloak
unless im a beast no way it can go smoothly
im playing Ionia into Aphelios
my items are fucked
i think it's still a bot 4 tho
<@148145559897636865>
look at the dummy
Maybe they could do 2 SSS bosses and 2 SS bosses
That’s a great idea
No way
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
increase all bosses HP by 20%
we need a balance patch, agree ?
yea the damage in new valks are slowly increasing
unrealistic but fun to watch <:okk:1110244301184696360>
<@148145559897636865>
But if the meta is solved she can climb steadily
She will get dizzy if she is trying to cook
Emily is a degen challenger
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
So he had to ask other beast players
And he demoted to diamond
So he asked emily to coach him
Yea during set 6 he was hardstuck at Master
What a great man :o7:
He is doing a lot for TFT community even though 3 sets ago he was still plat
Yea got a great storyline out of it
4 Lp diff
But he clutch a Kaisa 3 and a another top 2 just in time
Robin almost ran it down 4 hours ago
Dishsoap was promised that if he doesn’t win, he will do a feet cam
It’s the end of boxboxbootcamp
Actually manage to do it
He was aiming for Dishsoap’s feet cam
Did you watch robin’s previsous game ? <@148145559897636865>
So 1 locket equal 1750 effective HP
Bastion get double armor and MR on first 10 seconds
Yea it’s the interaction with Bastion
Beyond useless
It’s useless now
<@148145559897636865>
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
and called  me Aphelios 
i just got 1 Maokai 1 Poppy
it's TF
i just realized, the problem is not Bastion or Targon
<@148145559897636865>
im down to remove TF out of the game
it clicked
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
that's a requirement to become A-atrox main
i don't know if Bastion is the problem tho instead of Targon and triple locket
press button faster
only 1 way
but the weaken last for about 25-30 seconds
after you destroy the clone, she enter weaken phase
second ult is too slow
and slow roll on 8 for all 3*
i just play Ionia that game
you still go 7 at 3-6
no need to force reroll or anything
oh you just play it normally
so i can 3* all the 4 cost
on condition that i can live to make it to stage 5
March + Golden ticket
my combo is also broken too
yea pretty much
shit like Built diff, double trouble
in Pris lobby
cause you can get the good stuffs
that's also why people like Poro
cause you basically lose 3 augments for free
it's bad gg
and stage 3 + 4 pris augments of TF are also bad
you pray really hard that in stage 2 you can get a good radiant item
cause Pris Pandora is not good, it's like Living Forge
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
triple Pris while using TF = GG
only me make it there
there were 6 TF users
<@148145559897636865>
busted
yea it give Yasuo 2 lives
:bedgeofnight:
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
if you play Ionia
radiant EoN is busted
those 2 put in more work than morello
and radiant EoN if i play Ionia
i want radiant guinsoo the most tbh on Jerry/Aphelios/Azir
:shieldge:
since this set every tanks have shield
Guaradbreaker in general is broken too
if Jerry doesn't need to have healing
like rn Guardbreaker is omega broken
Gunblade
yea but building IE just to make use of the crit stat is even more of a waste when you have better items that work better on her
Hoj is fine too
GB is okay too
anything work
QSS/IE/Guardbreaker/GS
i want to have Guinsoo Runann +1
usually if i play Jerry
oh you don't
they just don't care
so you troll their games or not doesn't matter
gold and plat players are all casual
i mean when you think about it
TFT doesn't have banned system or scan system for bad behavior
:smoge:
oh they don't care about TFT
do that like 3-4 games in a row
queue and then log out
oh i just run it down after playing with frenn
sound like a plan
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i just create a smurf for stuff like that
gaining LP is lit tho
so i pick infinite locket and vow
yea it's Graveyard
as long as you hit Aphelios
if there is 3 Targon players in the lobby, im pretty confidence all 3 can go 1 2 3
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
the 1st guy won because he had better augments than me
1 Aphelios = game over
as long as you hit Aphelios
yea it's actually turbo broken
can't hit Aphelios
roll too slow
the 5th guy
original and creative
top 1 and 2 has sick board, agree ?
<@148145559897636865>
<:okk:1110244301184696360>
Beast player
He is in central
Omega frontline
Lv 8 you just play another tank
Then you play another deadeye, Akshan or Urgot
The comp is just Aphelios Shen Taric Kassasin Maokai/Poppy/Ksante + Soraka
BiS Aphelios in that team is Guinsoo DB LW
Omega frontline
Then 3 Targon + 4 Bastion
+ BiS on Aphelios
You pick TF and go 3 lockets
Yea it’s a new meta comp
<@309634550273933314> <@148145559897636865>
<@148145559897636865> you saw these 2 games ?
Sword + probably conductors
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
20% effective
That sound really big tho <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
But maybe it is because how strong Jerry 1 is
Aphelios rn is already unstable on lv 7 at 1*
Not sure how big the nerf is tho
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Aphelios also got touched too
Kaisa + Yasuo too
But Azir + Lux instead
So next patch will also be casino
And nothing on AP side
They nerf a lot on AD side
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Can’t reset her zap on kill can potentially make her dps drop like 30-50%
It’s actually looking pretty big
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Not trying to see Belveth getting killed by Jerry 1 from the other side of the map
Not this patch
I will try Belveth next patch tho
sound good <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
in casual mode he just cook too hard
stop cooking for about 1 week to climb ladder
yea this is just his casual mode, when regional is close he will start to play seriously
that's why he is the big bro of TFT <:FeelsStrongMan:816797263811575819>
he actually want to keep playing
like even when he seem like he is about to tilt his mind out of his chair
yea he actually love TFT
Big bro looking at those packs and be like  if it's good deal then it mean im still F2P 
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Ionia spat is better than Guinsoo
i think BiS is BT Guinsoo Titan
but she need to ramp guinsoo up
think it's good
big bro is cooking too hard
summon the Hydra ? <:Wokege:859195243030904860>
he send a  LMAO 
with gifts + long distance
wait emily went 8th
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
Bastion Belveth is kinda cool
that Bastion board was kinda cool tho
oh shit he is back <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
it's 8th
nvm
2-1 Piltover
big bro finally getting a win
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
4.7 avg
:addicted2rolling:
and now he addict to it
his vacation was grinding Valorant, Cookie is just a game his friend asked him to play with
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
he only play it 1 month so far iirc
yea he swipe like 10k at least
yea it's probably in the same category with lottery
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i think rereplay only managed to get 80k from the 150k 1st prize
but if i invest on it now and win worlds later, i can make 74k profit <:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
<:hmmge:1015313814624931951>
:diesofteemo:
should i get Teemo or no
Project and Bunny <a:uooh:964118021574623243>  Punny <a:uooh:964118021574623243>
but Punny tho
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
based on my calc, if both nini and gresham paypal me 500 each i can get SS 4/4 QK and 4* Punny
fucking refuse free money
and they blocked me
yea i offer someone in WFP a while ago 5k to send the ss of them saying they get to 90 twice in a row
even when Chinese whale give out 10k bucks as the prize
but no one ever have a picture of it
like everyone keep saying they get to 90 in Genshin
most people saying that definitely don't
instead of all the useless thing in 6.0
so they add a better option to 6.8
eventually you want 4* all the current gen
i mean 54 elf frags is definitely better than nothing
wait why <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
it have elf frags, already 10 times better
it's a better version you mean
yea 6.0 fucking blow
it's just 6.0 spending
my board is not cap at all
they should have increase the cap of my board
they increase the amount now but you can only get 54 as f2p
it was always 50 yea
infinite
cause if your carry stuck on Eternal Winter, you lose infinite HP
if there is Eternal Winter then QSS is an actual option
yea you actually need to scout after augment pick
Azir 2 <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
this set champion designs just favor Eternal Winter too much
don't think it's possible, remove the Frozen part then the item can't be called Ornn item anymore
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
oh also do you know that Jerry's zap also trigger eternal winter stack
yea your carry can't play the game until the holder die
<a:diesofcringe:972420698654003210>
and he also has a warmorg
bro istg that item is so cringe
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
yea and he just hit eternal winter
:o7:
it's pd
thots ?
went 1st on both
<@148145559897636865> i just got both Gift from the fallen + Long distance pal 2 games in a row
They do encourage him to do youtube vids and streaming more often
Now that he is not the lead dev anymore
Yea he does

Tet is a writing up a storm
<a:aothatday:925647030091665438>
With 3k HP
I saw it once and the dude Jerry had 400 AD
Triple gold = someone can hit Ton of stats, gift from the fallen, matyr
Pris lobby are more okay than Gold lobby
Also i think that
And no way to ensure you get the good stuffs
It’s way too RNG
Imagine your Pris being Visage and Randuin on stage 4
Gurantee bot 4 if you press Living Forge
Oh that shit is an instant reroll
But you’re already gambling when you  press Queue button
Yea on the surface it look balanced
Virulent + Sniper
I won a game once with Jerry 1
That shit is the most tilting thing alongside Sniper Focus
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
No
Hidden <:clueless:1009089400174559294>
Virulent is the most broken one on Jerry
Don’t think anyone have made it yet but on Jerry it’s Virulent and The attack speed
:riotgame:
it's Riot games
dw next patch they will fuck it up
the game quality rn is so bad
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
HP is fake
don't buy a single unit
you just do it like this through stage 2
the trick is to trap Vi on the right corner
even if you have Jerry 1
45 stacks T-hex = giga 1st
you still win as long as you cash out the 45 stacks T-hex
even if you play the game at 20 HP
just open all of stage 2
your HP does not matter
you sac all of your HP till 3-5
just Jerry
2-1 Piltover : instant 1st
Sniper Focus : instant 1st
Eternal Winter : instant 1st
Gift from the fallen : instant 2nd
Ton of stats : guarantee top 4
Matyr : guarantee top 4 
On a roll : guarantee top 3 
March of Progress : giga 1st
there is no skill
even on challenger
that's why the game qualtiy rn is bad
but all the augments and ornn items are not
comp is actually balanced
the meta rn is peak casino
you hit or you miss
it's all casino
yea you shouldn't scout tbh
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
she doesn't have discount banner
Seele better not feel like a fucking burden at S0

oh snap i forgot
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
Reading is lit
Starting mana is also useless cause she reset her ability on kill
And AP doesn’t do much on her
Cause she get infinite AD from gunner
Not base stats
Jerry prefer amp
They’re all actually useless on her
:ratge:
But the playerbase call her Jerry
It’s Zeri
Only 3 are bad is actually pretty good
cause Jerry can’t use it
Triforce is also kinda bad
I think most are ok
For Ornn item except Randuin and Visage
Giga clear Abyss with EW on Shenhe
Oh i was answering aster’s question about Shenhe
Death defiance is good on her, or Eternal Winter
Then casino on lv 7
Casino on 2-1
This patch is peak casino
Sniper Focus : giga 1st
Enternal Winter : giga 1st
Trickster glass : high chance top 4
Rn tho, 6 out of 8 use Ornn and play Casino on 2-1
Cause there wasn’t a way to reliably hit Ornn Anvil and even then there was only Kaisa be troubled by it
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
High attack speed carry = Doom 
Caster like Lux = lose her ult if she is frozen
It’s because all the carries rn can be interrupted
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
still no sign of nerfing Eternal Winter on PBE
The most terrible part is that
Can’t play the game unless you build QSS
Vow + Eternal Winter J4
You know what is the peak cringe combo
<:dongerj:981641448057356289>
Vow J4 = sit on your carry for 5 seconds
Too broken for fun
Vow J4/Shen/Sej
But Vow is too broken now
So you want Visage and Warmorg
It actually barely give any HP at all <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
The only Bruiser you want to play on your board is Sej and Sion
Oh it is because Bruiser suck now
So he just has 3 seconds for free dps
He can keep autoing in Zhonya
azir is like TF
It’s because of the interaction
Deathfire is BiS Lux, zhonya is also BiS Azir
:yoink:
if it's on the internet it's always safe to steal it
No, 4* Dudu is she turn into Super Dudu, wield Abyss Flower and 1 shot Otto
Yea Dudu is not a real elf until 4*
And wait for the next next generation
4* kiana, dudu and ely is the way

Tbh the next generation of elf
Ice on deez nuts ?
You’re thinking about big spending

It is born to direct people to Stake

yea i bought it after i realized it wasn't graphic cards
the others are too high
probably no <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
the lowest it have been was 850
it's below average

yea figure then soda, the rest is whichever you like

oh buy Soda too

The answer is simple, buy all of them
which one will increase most is the answer
probably both
just not as much as figure
sword will probably go up too

<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
And definitely not sword
But Fu Hua’s relevance good is either sword, tea or figure anw
Maybe it’s not tea
One second thought
lil bro
no one gonna drink soda when weather is cold
but Tea is definitely going up
winter so probably hard to fish <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
fish's price might also go up too
but buy out tea first
price always change, the goods on the news just have biggest price change
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
so probably Fu Hua's figure this time
it's definitely not sword
God Kiana, HoV’s beta name
Playing in story mode server reduce your achivement by 95%

Unless this is fragile’s 2nd personality
Probably addicted to drug tho
Is he a beast or addicted to drug
Who is this “ the best GK player “ ?
cause it will go back to normal when the news disappear
so you buy wood this time
Wood's price went down last cycle
then you check for which one that the price debuff will run out next
so food will be overflow
you buy Kallen Fantasy and not tomatoes, cause it's a bountiful harvest
like if the hints and news look like this
just buy and sell according to the hints <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
but this time info is also vague
i need to buy sth else <:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
Wood and Emerald this time <@309634550273933314> <:okk:1110244301184696360>
and probably not the only one
somone is lazy at Mihoyo EN
i bought Wotan and Kallen Fantasy this time
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
by 23 coins
her figure price still go up
yea got scammed
you have always been a cunny enjoyer
<a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
Yea TF is good for starter
Poro and Ornn is for playing flex
TF is more safe
But if you want to be a degen
So Poro just take advantage of it the most
Cause there are so many augments below 4.0
That’s why Poro is being used the most rn
That’s pretty much it
Augment isn’t
Comp is balanced
This Jerry Urgot lottery is not it man
you need to reroll on round 4
if you wait til last day then don't do it
think twice before do stupid things
least : 4 keys * 60 = 240 xtals
average : 48 keys * 60 = 2880 xtals

I actually love the fake marriage trope tbh, it’s simple so the author need to find their own way to make in entertaining
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

What is the other one
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

I might actually be Gold if they ban stats
But the stats are good so when i try them it’s actually good
A lot of augments i think they fucking blow
There is actually
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
It’s the avg when you build it through out the game instead of the final avg
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>

:lowkeymad:
what will his name be
So you don’t have to play shitters on your board
If you have 2 Shurima spat
I think 7 Shurima is good
Which contribute nothing
You have too many shitters and the traits are used to buff those shitters
Yea the problem with Vertical in set 9 is that
Gwen, Kaisa, Aphelios
you just play 3 Shurima + frontline + another carry
Azir is a flex comp
Oh cause Azir is not the only carry in Azir comp
All need guinsoo
But the 3 most stable comps are Trist reroll, Jerry gunner and Aphelios
Or you need to cook
I think without Guinsoo you can’t play the game unless you play Azir and highroll
Only work as a item holder
But Akshan fucking blow
Yea it work on Akshan
That’s why TF is good
Guinsoo is like the only item that matter
Still need Guinsoo
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Jerry and Aphelios have 4 hexes range
Damage increase based on Hex
But i think Ornn legend problem is that if it’s Silver you might be in a bad spot
Avg 2.0 atm i i think
Like Sniper Focus
Yea some of it are instant top 4
Oh the 3 best legends are TF, Ornn and Poro <@148145559897636865>
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

Or else you lose infinite HP before going 8
To stabilize on stage 4
Any of them

March, Jewled 3, Cursed Crown
handpicked augments
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
3* everything
by that interval you will be level 8 at like 5-1 with 200 gold
so it will be 2 + x, x is your level before every PvP round
you get the bonus xp of your level
and the xp gain went up
you get inital 10 xp
yea it's insanely OP now
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
cause 70% of those will avg like 3.7-4.0 on live
do you know that right now all of challenger players prefer full Pris lobby

you ?
that's black
not just 1 or 2
like a big group of Nazi

also my friend just told me he was driving his family to Disney World yesterday and apparently there were Nazi harrassing everyone standing there ?
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
like there is a lot of FPS online games out there but all of them choose COD
still don't know why it turn that bad
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
it's a den of racist, sexist and probably pedo too
it would be better to find who isn't racist
have you guys play COD online yet ?
nini that's normal <:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
<@148145559897636865>  wildest take of the West
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
but the condition to trigger are still not 100% guarantee so they can't fix it yet
so with 3 Demacia, you can get 3 radiant items
then if you put in Demacia the Raidant item will show up on another valk instead
the radiant item will stay on the champ permanently and won't change
like Demacia bug, when you take out Demacia, put it back and take out again  at high ping
there are still some unknown bugs that they couldn't find the trigger yet
so in the end this new policy literally change nothing
yea but i mean even if tactic.tool get taken down, they will just open a private discord server or something and make a paid website instead <:ddx:1011889803144478761>
double the size, double the bugs
balance is still a disaster
the only thing that change in set 9 is the amount of dumb augments
even with 2x the team size compare to set 8
:xddshruge:
:shrugxdd:
what is it again
:shrugdd:
but their team builder UI are a fucking disaster tho
like ingame tactic.tool ?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
until he ran it down
they handle the stats better now than ever that's why during set 8, setsuko could stable at ~1900 LP
keep telling people on his stream that pro players are too dependent on stats while it's the opposite
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
but i still think Mortdog's vision is so fucking weird, if he actually believe stats are fake then he is the biggest egomaniac i ever met
yea it's Riot games <:ddx:1011889803144478761>
and now they said  fuck you guys, try adapting 
tactic.tool literally push the competitive scene moving faster
<:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
average placement
which is a dumb attempt
unless they will also ban avp too
why are they banning win rate only is the biggest question
the fuck
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
<@148145559897636865>
i see, no cooking attempt ? <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
oh you still can't play yet ? <:ok:1088133019455467560>
8 is omega hard if the portal doesn't give gold
so the meta is probably roll on 6 and 7
like in stage 3, when you lose, you can lose 6-0 straight whole stage
cause there are some unkillable comps and annoying af champs
i die before 4-7
usually when i test out some comps
probably because i don't know how to play strongest board yet
i feel like the game tempo is somehow kinda fast now
also for some reason
but this Viego unit is kinda blow
like just straight up melee attack enemies to dead
im trying to figure how to make dude work
but Viego is so fucking shit rn
it's Viego
Do this irl
<:smoothbrain:1114520186280751175>

But pokemon doesn’t have guns and rockets
<:worrySniperAngry:920552131642142741>
it's time for Portal <:ok:1088133019455467560>
yea when get you in, try to do the tech
trying to find which line is the best <:ok:1088133019455467560>
i can log in immediately
yea my account is normal now
i couldn't find match earlier, have to do it
when you end task it, it will reopen and you can play normally
the client is bugged now
when you get in, open Task manager and end task the client
oh btw, it's actually a client bug <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:GIGACHAD:1082007473663266856>

Vlad is definitely the best legend

im in coach
it's my account
lowkey doable
<@148145559897636865>
Yea seem like it
So it come down to who hit early and who don’t
Cause there is no item RNG anymore with TF
Will just snowball and win the game
Then who highroll their rolldown
If TF is the safest line
Like
The way this set work, too many stupid shit will happen in challenger lobby
Set 9 is gonna be turbo stupid until 9.5
I feel like
I miss hero augments
Lowkey tho
queue is about 10 seconds to 2 min
<@148145559897636865>  my PBE acc is in, we can gaming now <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
asking the real question
we gaming ?
Which is the 1st requirement to play the game
Also it  pretty much guarantee you Guinsoo on your carry
So guarantee Pandora’s item on 2-1 is a huge deal
All the carries in set 9 need specific items to online
TF is the best legend to climb
Once set 9 go live
Im pretty sure
<@148145559897636865> in 2 hours from now, if you can log in PBE, you might be able to get in
<@148145559897636865>

<@148145559897636865> queue is still bugged
they reprint him from 6.5 and Urgot was a beast in 6.5
i don't even know why Urgot feel so bad to play
they should give you 4 gold for putting him on board
Yasuo feel like a 0.5 cost
Urgot and Yasuo
there are currently 2 fucking useless 4 cost rn too <:ok:1088133019455467560>
give or take 1-2 pulls
yea probably can with monthly but iirc they give exactly 60 pulls in the period between 2 S-rank <:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
in PGR i think you can't even pull for weapon if you pull every S-rank valk
isn't PGR and HI the same

lil bro actually just log in PBE to pick stillwater
who even does that on PBE
it's the no augment portal
in PBE
also a fucker just pick Stillwater
they better tune down all these shit next patch
and Kayle is a 1 cost, Galio is a 2 cost
it's a free 10 streak
do you know that if you hit Kayle 2 and Galio 2 on stage 2
Beyblade Garen
Juggernaut
Galio
T-hex
Baron
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
this PBE is actually tilting me by how unbalanced it is
not anymore
and it was a great change
yea it used to be this except set 8
isn't Guinsoo just straight up better than Shojin now
bro why the fuck did they revert Shojin
they add too many stupid shit so i won't get my hope up <:ok:1088133019455467560>
the most important thing is still how balanced it will be on launch or at least 1st month
but
so far the idea of portals is decent
1 more week til set 9
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

just hit tho
yea isn't craftable
renekton yea
Dcap ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
if you have brawler spat, go 8, play 8 brawler + Asol 
if you don't, stay 7, play 6 brawler + Asol ( Morgana work too ), roll for Jax 3 Riven 3
or else 8 brawler + Asol
6 brawler if no brawler spat
just whatever you hit
QSS Guinsoo BT/GB/GS
sound like good jax items yea
Laser work too
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:Handshakege:912215230573060138>
cause i held hand 7th 8th with them
they wouldn't touch it
i force Yuumi so fucking much that when people see me in lobby
during the period of Yuumi reroll in set 8
you need to send the message that you'd rather go 8th than pivot
and go next game
if not just hold hand 7th 8th
and hope it will scare away all the idiots
pick and call it
you need to be the fastest in the lobby
yea so like most of the time
Then just pick Yasuo carry and roll with it
Isn’t that more 8th
And you hit some 5.0 avg
What if you reroll your hero augment
Think about it the other way
But don’t worry about contesting
Just try not to force it
You just pick it and type Yasuo in chat
And you have good item setup
Like if you see Yasuo augment first
Unless you’re forcing it
Oh tbh you shouldn’t
The more you bitch the better you get
Keep bitching tho
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

yea those items are 8th tho
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
position look fine yea
when it should be the last thing you learn
it's actually turbo cringe when a lot of  challenger  guide teach everyone to play flex
the amount of effort you need to put into the game is 10 times more than usual
im 100% sure 90% of challengers can't even play flex
like playing flex is actually turbo hard
yea it's hard to play flex
unfortunately no, most of the time you try to not even run AP carry

My account is bust too
All got stuck
Yea someone in robin’s server created 20 accounts
Try asking your friends tho
Creating new acc on the same computer won’t work
I just put Shiv on Asol or Vex
It depend on item economy, if i have to slam LW then no Morgana
And either TF or Asol + Jhin
Meta is still slamming shiv
I just finished my decay games

8.5 rn is unplayable
Exit and try again

lil bro is trying to test my patience
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
it's 100% a 1st
but with some other conditions
oh set 9 is definitely have a lot of exodia augments
they add way too many dumb augments
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
changing the meta up and down because of 2 augments is actually wild to me
but tbh, just disable those augments
they're probably trying to balance highend shopping and level up
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
and can't even level to 8 at 4-2
lv 7 50 gold even with that augment
even if you highroll a 7 streak, i don't even think it's worth to level 7 on 3-5
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
out of everything, this one will affect meta the most
yea i don't know what is the meaning behind this change
it's so fucking expensive now to level to 6 on 3-2
it's in the patch notes i  ping you earlier
i don't even know if you should level 6 on 3-2 or not
but the exp change is actually crucial
start playing the game at 20 HP
so you can only get it after stage 3 carousel
it also after 7 player combats
this augment is actually 1st or 8th
this set will have a lot of funny clips
<@148145559897636865>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
yea big bro of TFT
like avg 18 hours stream per day
and he stream infinite at the start of the set
he is both entertaining for casual viewers and good at the game for competitive players
Big bro is back to streaming while robin is away, good timing <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>

they can't afford it
too cool for PBE <:okk:1110244301184696360>

They have like 20 servers <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
In 1 server of CN
200k player pre-order it
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
That comp need too many things line up to online
No sweat  <:ok:1088133019455467560>
It’s so fucking 8th that even axiom arc can’t save it
If you play Lulu and after wolves you have 3 items + a component
Instead of having to play testing it and go 8th 5 times to learn it the hard way
You can learn how item count impact the comp or missing any item can impact it
Like for Lulu reroll
It’s probably have biased but for niche build you still can get the idea of when to play it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
So all the games can be extract from client
I think Riot public the data or sth
Yea we do
It will generate better results instead of just general avg
Need to sign for 5$ per month iirc
you can include items count and other options
It’s the advanced explorer of tactic.tool
You need to hit Belvussy
But it’s like old laser
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
EU players when they retain Nirvana for the first time be like : “ Piece of cake, don’t even need to kill boss “
Hearing this from EU player is actually wild

like Kaisa
everyone will just force it
but if there is such a comp
that augment need to have a broken lv 7 board to be busted
if you can survive until 5-5 then probably can go 8
if you manage to 20 winstreak
yea you will be stuck at lv 7 until 5-5
probably the same
don't know about set 9 tho
it's guarantee bot 4 in set 8
oh that one
double the size, double the effort
surely they will balance it out
<:okk:1110244301184696360>
yea probably need 7 Demacia tho
pretty cool <:ok:1088133019455467560>
also Lux is fucking strong for fun
pretty balanced
9 demacia
but 11 HP while staying lv 5 mean he is playing with iron
actually pretty good
<@148145559897636865>
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
wait 30 mins for a 7th
i went 7th tho
yea i just finished 1 game
lil bro actually wait 100 minutes
last set i have to wait 20 mins for a game
it happened when they narrow the servers for TFT iirc
Boxbox and Annie's biography ?
wait what the heck is that <:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
ingame
40 mins queue
you know what's more fun ?
PBE is up <@148145559897636865> <a:pepenarutorun:1081435087901556827>
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
but weird part is that he is 2nd
i just send a guy with Ekko carry to 2nd
they also buff the shit out of some weird augments
<:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
8.5 is too fun
sound lit
gonna spend weekend to play set 8 <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
so worst case scenario, it will be delayed til Monday
also i think even mort doesn't know when will TFT PBE is back <@148145559897636865>
if it's balance that is
but maybe
hard to tell <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
will be omega scary
thanks god there is no legend that guarantee last stand for you
last stand will be omega scary this set tho
it's a cool augment
i like it
oh that
prep as in ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yea there isn't really any point to play set 8 anymore
robin won't get up until PBE is up
:xddshruge:
2 more weeks
also i just realised
TFT chat on normal day
Stream <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878> Why <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878> Are <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878> You <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>  Not <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>  Playing <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878> Set 9 <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
but i can't see any potential reroll comp in set 9 yet
also i might be tripping
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
i will miss Kaisa reroll
and not double team size = double the bugs
so it's better be balanced on launch day
they double their team size for set 9<:ok:1088133019455467560>
and not just pure luck
to make sure Worlds's games are all fair to a certain extent
they had to disable Level Up and High End Shopping
during world of set 7
yea it's a problem with exodia combinations
that is another story
but when you have Aa-trox 2* with Gwen 2*
like Gwen is a decent carry
the combo between them and 4 cost that is
yea they're a little too strong rn
when you shouldn't
cause there is augment that can let you actually get them
yea but 5 cost being too strong also raise new high problem
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
guarantee top 4
anyone who hit Level Up or High End
but there is problem about that too
5 cost in set 9 seem actually strong tho
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
and Riot won't pour anymore into PBE server
yea even if there is a solution, it will probably cost money
i remember it used to be an icon 8 years ago
seeing LCS fall is still kinda sad
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yea did Mr.Beast sign to any team yet ?
Probably not worth
I need to play Freljord
<:okk:1110244301184696360>
Hope PBE is gonna get back soon
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
3 more games and im done with this set
is so bad
this for fun patch
lmao
Time to force 8 SG Urgot

<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
Not real lobby
Yea you can almost fast 9 all the time rn
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
<:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
Already not looking too good
For a trait that only need 1 emblem
Yea too much Hp
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
Shit was turbo strong in set 4
2 adepts : 1 second
3 adepts : 2 seconds
4 adepts : 3.5 seconds
Adept is a trait that at the start of combat, slow all enemies by 80% for x second depend on how many adepts are active
This is just Adept Frotline like set 4
They better hotfix this shit asap
While Demacia get radiant redemption
Gain 15% atk speed
And the passive is not even good
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
No
While Freljord and Demacia just railing everyone
Isn’t that kinda sad Zaun barely get stronger
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
Demacia get a radiant item
Freljord get shiv morgana full board
Zaun get a random passive for 1 champ
These national traits are already unbalanced wtf man
The other go 8th
7 people play Freljord
<@148145559897636865> PBE rn is too cringe
You people ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
from 4.34 to 3.34
like Jewled Lotus can avg really high with the right setup
but does not mean it will stay 4.5 with some exodia combinations
like sure the augments all avg 4.5
that will be less fun that just playing normally without legends
and everyone spam the shit out of it
what if on live patch there will be a broken one
legends do seem sus
also now that i think about it
it's not a real lobby
PBE is so meaningless after 3 days of playing
and also not everyone like to play PBE for fun
<@148145559897636865>  PBE update around 1 PM PST
new nikke is summer Mary
Rapi is a skin tho
probably after Rosanna
<a:aworryhehelollmaoLick:526758057292726282>
<@309634550273933314>
im so fucking used to valks with skins
but this set color will be hard to get used to
who even make this trait
this shit will avg 3.0
also if set 9 is out rn
save up 200 gold for next game
going 8th at 4-2 <:dongerj:981641448057356289>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
yea no sweat, you will eventually get there once set 9 start
have to take Thomas or Draven
if you want to farm tuber tho
Ornn is 1 of the best
like im pretty sure if you want to climb steadily
with econ start
mean you up an item
what happened if the component count of that game are odd number
small forge, gain component anvil and **8** gold
mean you can sack til 3-5
latent forge, gain ornn item anvil after 7 players combat
it's omega sus
but these one
prismatic Ornn augments are fine
especially highroll augment
some augments seem sus tho
except Ornn that is
all augments are actually around 4.4-4.5 avg
yea i just take a look at all legend augments, they're okay
have to update again
no
let me see
around that
in 12 hours probably
also i haven't seen what legends can even do
from what i see so far
yea it will be a disaster once it go live
<a:worryswipe:897045291256127530>
<@148145559897636865>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
Probably 200 pulls on dorm supply
300 pulls for 4/4
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
It will punish good players again
But this set look like
Im not gonna say anything too soon
so it's up to Mort
it's also a summon trait too
<:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
of T-game
the T-hex yea
or even next week of PBE
and i can bet my nuts it will be turbo strong on live
shit is turbo weak now
<:dongerj:981641448057356289>
heimer
Vex is decent
Jhin is broken
Pyke is broken
and the valks you have to play is not even weak
then you have a default fon on your board
cause Fon is basically a prismatic right
there have never been a set with summoned entity and they were balanced
in normal set Rilfwalker will always be omega broken
cause you can't aim for it
it's hero augment that make Rilfwalker look like shit
rn it's broken
it's either shit or broken
yea
there is no balance for summon trait
it's either shit or broken
i hate summon trait
uhh
<:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
T-hex for T-game
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that sound broken
im at work so can't focus on the stream 100%
probably miss that part of the stream
what is legends btw
Well Fed is offered on 3-2 and well fed+ is offered on 4-2
like Well Fed and Well Fed+
2-1/3-2/4-2
oh it's for different stage
and you sit at 80 gold at 2-6
full open in stage 2 with that one
oh that one is busted
not sure
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i think number wise rolling at 7 with 200 gold is better than rollin at 8 with 100 gold
oh if you roll for a 3* 4 cost
you just die next round
yea but it does not even matter
your cap is 7
wtf did even he pick
it's omega 8th
going 8th in playtest
actually addicted to rolling augment
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
only count if you press D
it does not count natural shop refresh
oh i got it
yea idk why it's so low
all good
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
nvm
it's 16 now
oh wait
next game ?
so when the fuck is he gonna jack pot
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
it's natural roll
yea it's 7 now
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
am i tripping
wait what
that is omega bait then, what
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
is natural roll
oh wait that jack pot
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
idk either
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
it's playtest anw, better having fun
<:dongerj:981641448057356289>
<@148145559897636865>  looking lit
oh they're playtesting it real time
He were all cool during all of it
Yea all versions of Aphelios
Aphelios is the coolest champion in TFT
Moonman is also back
Oh wow all the valks without skin
Addicted to rolling finally paid off
<:Gladge:876532158544642109>
1 tuber out of 50 games
Playing for the omega winout
At 4-2
Let you transfer the gold from last game to your new game
They should have make a transfer prismatic too
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
What’s weird about mod sperm
That shit is so fucking bad
Yea headge fund
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
With the cost of 20-30 HP
Compare to windfall
Imagine your prismatic is 5 extra gold
Is definitely not a prismatic
That augment
<@148145559897636865>
It’s the optimal way of playing TFT for him
Dw playing flex will always be the goal of Mortdog
<:NoelleWOW_Erizebett:827983811240394772>
It’s better than set 1
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Democracy <:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
<a:pepenarutorun:1081435087901556827>
Then tmr we dive into PBE
Then see some vods from robin
Im watching the stream rn
Not all
Miss, going 8th, DM mortdog
Win the game
Roll it down, hit everything
Full open into lv 7 50 gold at 3-4
And half of stage 3
So people never play stage 2
There were like 3 econ traits
Set 7 was the peak of boring
Only when you consider for fun carousel into the table
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
70% chance you will hate TFT
If you were to go through set 7
There were a lot of broken shit back then that it was fun
But it’s fun tho
Set 1 is the most unbalancef fiesta of all set
“ gold, shiny, broken “ :dumbge:
Best item in the game
Set 9 is about to be crazy
<@148145559897636865>
and you will climb infinite
just do opposite of what she did <:ok:1088133019455467560>
yea i don't get it neither <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
So the balance turn out to be horrible
Yea that’s why they lack a lot of manpower during set 7
Completely, the start of new set mean they’re on their way to make new set +2
Set 10 is almost done iirc
They’re currently already have to design for set 10 and 11
They have lot of things to work with too
Probably think it will be too much color
You just zone out and forgot about it
It happened at challenger too
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
Hero augment is just so dumb
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
There is no way your strongest board can make Alistar augment appear
If it’s 223 or 233 on 3-2
Cause that mean you miss Jhin or Asol augment
3 cost augment is doomed most of the time too
It’s turbo hard tho
For Jhin line you have to play normally and pivot into Jhin
and you put all tank items on Alistar if you have that augment
the carry one yea
Rilfwalker in general
im pretty sure Alistar hero augment is the best you want when playing Jhin
yea Alistar is broken
<:dongerj:981641448057356289>
And 20k when new set lauch
His stream avg 10k on normal day
Yea soju is the xQc of TFT
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
LCS on their way to become the 1st e-circus
Or their own staffs
Stuff like sub in Tyler1 or Mr Beast
Yea it mean they can go full 4fun mode when it not matter anymore
<@148145559897636865> <:ICANT:921403877285306399>
Kinda lit
It’s proof that there are more budget for the scene now
1st time ever
But this time it’s a stream reveal
Then make a youtube vid about new set
They usually spoil like 40% of new set during worlds
Cause this is the 1st reveal stream
It will be lifted right when stream end
Then he will do vods review of him playtesting set 9
Robin will play some set 8 games before stream reveal
<:dongerj:981641448057356289>
The most broken one is Radiant Titans
All AD items are broken
Except Zzrot + Gargoyle
And most tank items are also not good
The boost is not worth a prismatic
Dcap is not good
At 3-2 and 4-2 it just situational
At 2-1 best radiant items i think are Zzrot, shiv, gargoyle
Oh i think you just determine by situation
Infiniteam TF need Arch or Dcap
You don’t have base AP
The blue outline mean temporary items
Oh it’s binary airdrop
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
Kanavan T and wedding skin
<@82358863155703808>

Actually im not sure about SSS MPE vs S0 Hare on SK

Need S2 Hare to win it
SSS MPE still win
Does NA open Abyss yet ?

Did any of you guys watch the new Little Mermaid yet
But who is Black Seele tho
Technically the act of pointing out sth as racist prove that you also view it that way <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>

Almost have game 7

Lowkey he could have won

<@148145559897636865> lmao, apparently the EU player that have Jax 3 + Riven 3 in last game picked the wrong WW augment, he picked Well Fed+ instead of Big Data cause he thought it was Big Data
she looks really cool tho <:Deadge:916024193567559710>

Don't know if you still keeping up with Tenmaku Cinema or not but this week chapter is what make Bakuman, Act Age so charming : the passion in each panels, expressions, the creative in finding way to make your idea come true, it's all what make this special genre become special 
Blue box : pretty neat chapter, it's not coincidence that they happen to be at the same place, they really want to see each other that's why miracle happened 
Akane : Kaichi is really a great character, based on previous chapter the correct approach should be trying to please the judges instead of the audience but it mean going against his resolve when he quit his old job so he just ignore it and keep walking down the path he choose
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
time to read this week Blue Box
yea probably nervous
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
-How do you feel about winning ? Pretty good.
-Do you have any goal in next tournament ? Not really
also the interview was as awkward as it could have been
<a:Y_PepeClap:792820714704470027>
 i don't think im good, i think im just luckly and everyone got mortdogged 
setsuko first interview 2 years ago was like
they actually got told beforehand on discord

TFT aside
<:HandsUp:816800032267304960>
<:HandsUp:816800032267304960>
time for hydra
he lost all momentum on 1st game
yea
Biggest sacrifice
To win worlds
Yea he resist the urge of putting titans on TF
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
God of TFT
Actually nut
Epic battle
NA vs CN
Wait rereplay is winning out
His spot is not enough for 3rd
Setsuko is trying to force a 3rd
It’s Last Stand viego with hourglass
Might go 1st
Binteum
Really lowkey tho
Lowkey
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
Yea they always win when it matter
It’s Obliterate time
Flancy win
It’s doomed
2 Morde 2
like fast 9
Flancy might outcap him if no one grieve his streak tho
4 UG in before carousel mean he aim for 10/10 at 3-5
oh nvm he only want to get 3 heist
1st recipe
4 heist too
spell spat into lotus
his spot is good too
rereplay is playing for 1st tho
cause it proc on shiv too
it's good on TF
<:dongerj:981641448057356289>
yea big TF = big damage
his wet dream
rereplay is making titans TF again
oh boy
It’s actually the logical play to save the game
Kinda sad
But most of the time it’s bot 4 tho
Or 2 stars 4 cost at 6
Cause there is that 1% chance that Neeko will get you 2 stars 5 cost at 7
But you actually can’t
Your instinct tell you to neeko the 3 cost to sell it
That is moreso a disaster
But if you get big neeko
If you got drop a 3 cost
Small Neeko is salvagable
Can’t make 30 at 2-6!
Can’t make 20 at 2-3
Can’t make 10 at 2-2
Like
That 3 gold will actually haunt you for the rest of the game
You lost 3 gold to make econ
Open Neeko = FF
Or carousel
Opener ?
We climbing <a:cuakhetday:944513685559332884>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
From out of his ass
He will actually force the 1st game 7
6
Yea the only scenario
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Forcing game 7
But 1st the game after
Setsuko placing below 3rd next game
You know what could happen
only setsuko need to play for 3rd
basically it
bot 4 people need to make sure the top 4 don't win
he need at least 3rd next game
12
7 + 5
or at least 4 current people don't win next game
8 people at 18+
then game 6 will happen
setsuko going 1st
next game
if
oh only 4
5 people at checkmate
it's actually gaming
if Tex ff here
oh
4 people at checkmate
flancy + tex
yea
flancy might get 3rd
no no
or itemize 2 Mord 2
his wincon is urgot 3
yea it's highennd shopping
and only 3 people in checkmate spot
oh it actually look like the standing will be fucked
shimapen is actually 1st
going 1st 3 times in a row
he still has slim chance
yea he also won't
Current checkmate : YBY1, rereplay
Tex need 2nd
Flancy need 3rd
Shimapen need 1st
bringing it to game 11
2 deadlast people going 1st 2 games in a row
yea but imagine tho
or 6 even
4 people in checkmate
next game will have at least
probably jerk to it even
he going to sleep dreaming about titans TF
he just really like it
the play here is actually trying to grief Flancy
is a recipe for 5th
this spot
uhh
you put it on Viego
spell spat is omega good tho
yea it's either gadgeteen or spell spat
yikes
is kinda
and wise spending
oxdd spat is actually not good unless you have another 1
it's actually not a 1st
mort it's too obvious
all 5 games are hero augment on 2-1
wait wtf
yea tension is getting higher
next game will have a lot of pressure
that champ is just busted
for fun
deal lot of damage
even without item
also 8 duelist TF
Vayne 2 won't cut it
cause eventually also want to itemize TF
oh Annie is the best one
for Fiora
it's oxdd
nvm
he is dead
last stand
yea
Flancy look like winning out tho
to pressure the lobby
rereplay need to place 5th
yea im back
might be a 5th
for fun
he has too many 1*
it's actually bad for him
lowkey
<:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
Fornite ?
Fiora carry
QSS is her BiS iirc
Yea she has an idol contract with an agency
Teasing it is fine
Against the rules in contract
She just can’t show full of her face
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
She didn’t, she has goggles on
Kinda cute
Yea it’s Hanser
<:woggerbronya:998945520452128858>
But probably they will let it slight
Yea it give bad vibe to the viewers
Uh oh
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Wait what does that mean
Are you fucking stupid ?
sorry that’s too mean
are you retarded ?
Dude is a beast
And probably not even his fault tho
Yea this one is actually messed up
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
My mission is done, you can ask neko
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
The fuck
It’s actually really good
It’s still AP + starting mana
If you can’t fit Morgana in
Yea just shiv asol
Best flex unit in the game
Asol
You can fit a lot of stuffs
Fon is really good for Jhin comp
Bot 4 recipe
Bot 4 bells are ringing
Wait what
What is his items opener
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
TF will easily shred it
You have Blizt + Renek + Vi/Riven as your frontline
With scoped weapon
Cause laser frontline is not tanky
It’s actually more problem@
I have to go outside for 1 hour, tell me if Setsuko winning world next game or not
So scoped Morde into Ekko mean he miss everything
He target from the angle he is attacking
It’s easy to miss
Or else you definitely need titans QSS
With scoped weapon
Yea it does
could have been dead in 4-1
could be worse
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
dead before carousel
no way
tilting
he is about to have to spend next 20 minutes
i don't even think setsuko can make it to stage 5
his items were calling for it
it's actually a time knife game
it's doomed
5 Anima with 2 tank items on Riven
highroll when it matter
Flancy pull out the Chinese special
he is actually a beast
if he can place higher than 6th
bot 4 bells are ringing
hero augment into medium egg
lmao
while others have to play with Alistar
people can get Kaisa/Vayne carry augment on 2-1
cringest shit ever
it could also be 333
in set 8
it can also be 233
1st game and it's already fucked
1st game and it's 223 hero augment on 2-1
omfg
<:Wokege:859195243030904860>
imagine if you can choose it
it's portals on starting carousel
only a picture tho
i think mort just show the real portals of set 9
they did
worlds is starting
<@148145559897636865> it's time
that look like dude he is having sth in his ass
what
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
lil bro is just cooking
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
and not his skill level
like the dude that think he is being held back by gears
human can be stupid to the point it's feel unreal
except Decanee
Dark and Light is only good in PvP
Harpe is Dark
Veigas is Blue
attribute update
Harpe is lower than Cindy
Cindy is trasah <:ok:1088133019455467560>
Sol is a pure red mage buffer
Callisto is way better for general usage
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Lime T and Ley T are the best tank and healer
to get their job change version
when you unlock Titanic Growth then farm Ley and Lime to Chaser 20
use Amy as  your healer in the mean time
Callisto
so for starter it's always Veigas
but she should not be in select ticket yet
excel at both aoe and single target
Gany is best red mage currently
Veigas just does better at AoE
but Arme is single target
no he doesn't
he is mage
best starter mage
Veigas first
After Hel
They only added Chinese faction a month ago
She is 12 months away
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
mecha cunny
on June 27th
correct <:ok:1088133019455467560>
Chinese Kiana is 13 months away
yea but GLB is just out for like 4 days
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
and all of them are broken as hell
they're releasing like 6 Chinese characters in a row
Chinese Kiana is kinda cool <:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
no bitch ?
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>

:peeposhake:
better start shaking
almost a tragedy
<a:LETSFUCKINGGO:1012872161763008602>
it's still a reverse sweep, let's go
fucking scare the shit out of me
oh thanks god
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
why does it suddenly so close, i just answered a phone call for 2 minutes
wait wtf
what's wrong <:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
the den of degens
the devs of Azur Lane
it's from Yongshi anw
i like this game character design above all <:ddx:1011889803144478761>
dealing enough damage and you enter a state where you're free to damage
yea this game unique mechanic is the fever state <:ok:1088133019455467560>
they only add in new mechanic
can't really change that much for hack n slash genre
im pretty sure all hack n slash gacha are DMC + Bayonetta knockoff
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
i could hear her talk all day
Vill-V's VA voice is so sweet
yea it's AG
Vill-V in another game <:DK:840944972383780874>
:dumbge:
Lmao
That shit is just busted for fun
Have like 20 units on board
Time and a Half into Infiniteam crest into Level Up
There is also a infiniteam wet dream
Both your game and your mental
It’s just doomed
But when in your lobby have exodia augments combo
Yea i still think it’s fun to play
Axiom Arc + Golden Ticket ? Cancer
Gadgeteen crest ? It’s a guarantee 2nd
Infiniteam Crest ? Instant 3rd
It’s too dumb
Yea for both kind of players, set 8 is not fun anymore
<:life:1001518241610485781>
3 more days and still no leak
They gatekeep set 9 this time too strict
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Im a beast
If im not getting top 4 it’s Mort’s fault tho
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
Everything is your fault unless you get into accident
I just hate when people whale then complain about not being able to T1 due to time or other excuses
Jerking off a lil bit
They just want to bing chilling
But some whale just doesn’t want to compete in some certain games
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Dude is nowhere near bad
He is a leader of a guild in FF14, i once  doing a raid with him
Not that the guy is bad or anything, he just doesn’t have the competitive blood boiling for this game
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
And he is in AG3
Cause i know a chinese whale in SEA whale harder than Akayuki
Yea definitely
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
:gusman:
Im certain that there is 50% chance NA have at least 10 people whale harder than Styx
Heki wtf is this <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
There is 0 chance that a situation where RC + SSB is better than JK + SSB
I won’t trust those dps test blindly
BR out of the race
still no jaxdd and oxdd
after this there is dieofkaisa, dieofannie, etc...
the start of it all
this one
let me get the emote
it's dieofyasuo
:smoge:
so Riot start looking into it
and CN love it
yea the cutscene from little chibi making more money
this world is a good kickstart
Riot is sending more budget into TFT aparment
TFT will take off from here
CN players always win when it matter
Flancy might win out tho
this is the 1st world where final lobby have all regions
new blood make it more fun than last one
this worlds is fun tho
this guy is too good
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
he won't make mistake easily unless he purposely do it
but problem is that he is too good
setsuko playstyle is actually not good for climbing tho
he is in final lobby
yea unless some dumb shit happen
setsuko playstyle is always taking risk when possible
or 1st
Shiny might get you to 2nd
if you're guarantee 4th
it's a win more augment
try to cook so hard
with 4 rolls unused
but he picked Viego carry
he could have rolled for any Asol augment
then Blue buff into Viego carry augment
dude slam locket + phony
this JukeYou guy is in Mickey Mouse mode
omfg <@148145559897636865>
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<@148145559897636865> you watching robin's stream rn ?
yea still
which does not matter at all
or happen at game 6th
before checkmate never happen
oh this is the 1st time they go with 11 games
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
either checkmate or highest standing after 6 games
6 games total
same as this but with way less game
yea but it could also end fast
not so much for players tho
it's good for audiences
so it could end after like 4 games
first to get 18+ points and a 1st win the cup
but they play checkmate format
up to 11 games
yea they're all playing at the highest level of TFT <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
NA is beasting
<@148145559897636865>
They’re cooking sth extraordinary
It’s maincord
getting punished for being good at the game ?
imagine getting 7 components after wolves
i bitch about it all the time too
all chally players keep bitching about it
we actually get way less components after wolves
isn't that kinda sad ?
and some spent 50 gold for Radiant Chalice
some people got Radiant EoN with 1 gold
the treasure dragon
it's actually not balance
so players keep getting tilted out of it
they messed it up during early set 8
so the amount of components in PVE got reduced
you get to spend gold and roll for components/items/radiant item
there was a mechanic called Treasure Dragons
they fixed it this way due to a dumb mechanic they thought of in set 7
it have always been like that or even better before
start playing the game at 3-2
reading manga in stage 2
econ opener also fit my playstyle the most
econ opener is too good
i never play it
and he got all components back at krugs or wolves
into windfall
setsuko got 3 components + 12 gold
while not getting punished for it
why does setsuko up 20 gold compare to others
it's actually bs to get econ opener in 5 items opener <@148145559897636865>
it's up to you and your friends <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
any game more and they might die from stress
but it's the best for player condition
yea 12 games in total is not enough to determine who is the best player
yea tmr
8 best player go to final lobby
each day players play 6 games
they rotate lobby every 2 games
Flancy is in lobby 4
can't expect nothing less from Rank 1 and 2 of CN <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Flancy is actually just a beast
SI HoS GC
not SnS in MA
still triple supports
those are really high scores
nvm
okay probabaly Trio
who are they even scared of btw
yea i always slam DB, no thought needed
DB is best AD item atm
without scoped it's probably Titans IE Hoj
with scoped i think it's DB RH Hoj
blind take it's bad
only if i know what line im aiming for tho
jaxdd or Belveth
yea it's my favorite augment
to me highroll mean board str
oh i see
like Lulu reroll
most of the time you can lose to some stupid shit
3* 4 cost this set feel normal
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
unless there is a DB on him
i think Jhin 3 is dog
that Samira board is the most highroll board i have seen in tournament
compare to Mordekaiser or Ezreal
which doesn't contribute to board str that hard
like, spellinger's board level 8 is either Ekko or Syndra
while Jhin and Laser board cap way harder at lv 8 with 5 cost hero augment
but problem is that Spellinger's board cap is not hard at level 8
he look strong
there is no counterplay to that
and there is a Hourglass Morde 2
5 cost hero agument
this lobby is just doomed
yea getting 6th from his spot is already a miracle
there is actually no way to counterplay Morder 2
i think Morde 2 is the best unit late game
Lulu's player wet dream
shit like Growth Spurt, Golden Ticket, Axiom Arc
it just omega bad to play against
but when people hit exodia augment
that comp is just dog
that shit is actually turbo tilted me
get Empowered Reserve
or Lulu reroll
while having Gnar 3 and Sona 3
for fun
gadgeteen player suddenly get They see me rolling
yea it punish good player way too much
laser player get Morde
5 cost hero augment make his spot become worse
with infinite stall
unless you're level 9
yea scaling in this set is not that great
but if you get to choose it's always raw AP + GS
sometime you have to slam Guinsoo
the dps output from getting raw AP and amp is better than AS scaling
yea it's not good enough
TF BiS is Shiv Rabadon GS
oh you never slam Guinsoo
specific 4 cost at that
you have to hit too many 4 cost
yea spellslingers is actually not good at world if you try to force it
big bro get a Neeko 2 out of his ass
let's go NA
worlds is up <@148145559897636865>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
I want to play for fun on PBE
That’s why i have to play it now
And im already about to explode

I still have to play decay games
May 30th
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
finally PGR can use this meme <:ddx:1011889803144478761>
Move the convo to there for a moment
It was a guess
Only SnS is 3S
My GC is SS1 and HoS is SS2
9S probably can score 500+
418
Your mom
It’s Kiana Kaslana geniuses

“ should i level and upgrade the meta support for ER purpose, i kinda doubt she will be useful “

it's interesting to say the least
<@148145559897636865> lmao you should check out the comment under this post
<a:pepenarutorun:1081435087901556827>
it's Rosanna
who ?
wait so that Sakura's skin is real
no way
she is next
<@309634550273933314>
how about you replace that attitude <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
yea isn't that how you supposed to say it
isn't it just sea
wait who pronounce it like that ?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
but they're on hak's bad terms now
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
yea glove is actually worst component
with DB IE
they fixed the bug and now somehow Samira is broken
IE work too
yea glove rn is just terrible if not LW
or items on Asol later
the tear can be redemption, vows, hoj
for example if you have bow glove tear, you would definitely want to slam LW if your open lean toward AD line
you need to think about item economy too
LW/Spark is fine
but Shiv on TF is way better
she is good in Laser and maybe Infiniteam
but in some comps you don't want to force her in it
Shiv Morg is good
oh i won't do that
no pizza to bite
i need all the luck possible for set 9
<:ZenkiboLaugh:1107877926235553844>
<@309634550273933314>
but probably require 10x more attempts
less terrible
probably gonna retain anw so won't be bother that much
terrible
i just tried Aponia with triple supports
it's fucked <:ok:1088133019455467560>
she and Mari has all the good skins
just not scoring
Europa is still top tier in PvP and some endgame pve contents
until Lime T show up
yea her imprint make her become meta for a while
but still rocking
drop to optional pick now
as in the meta ?
they just added Sol in
new angel in World 14
cause they're starting to add hero relevant to current world
Echo is probably next
unlikely
lil bro is still hunting
but Kyle is still not playable
fucking broken at it

mental strength, decison making, meta read are all needed
yea that's why it's proof that you're a beast
not when you're pushing for rank 1
forcing comp only work when you're trying to climb in normal elo <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
she is tunneling too hard
emily is facing 1 of the worst thing could happen when climbing
tough luck
unless you purposely running it down

<a:pepenarutorun:1081435087901556827>
Beast from the West
The T1 Myriad contender
And none of them are fragile
But i know that cn gameplay discussion you have 10 EU Nirvana sharing their wisdom
Idk what gameplay channel look like
I see they’re actively trying to ~~grieve~~ help people in maincotd
Dw the new generation is coming
What a beast
Still better than all of EU myriad
Fragile also had health issue and have to play the game with 1 hand
And inukai it’s probably because he couldn’t stand you idiots
Nini said it’s health issue with Kithi
“ Play Honkai now and change your life “ <:OsirisPlus1:1106419405262430248>
Playing Honkai to get better
It’s all kithi
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>

Like this ?
there is no benefit from doing that
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
why would they make it Bio
just like the egg in TFT
that boss have too many effects and those effect bleed FPS like crazy

<:ok:1088133019455467560>

on condition that Robin doesn't asked others to gatekeep her
yea if she keep playing she will get it
<@148145559897636865>  Blue box : this week chapter is what i like most about Blue Box, no need for many words, no need for intense emotions, just take it slow and realizing your feeling  <:ok:1088133019455467560>

bro is up to something
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
but can't blame them
wouldn't be that high for her if they accepted health insurance
she already have enough stress from work alone
my sister is a widow and others aren't living near LA <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
no more intese swiping for a while
so i will probably cover 50% of the cost for her
but the cost is pretty high, my sister is currently have to be absence from work to take care of my niece <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
Doc said that 3 months late and she might have actually killed herself for real <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
yea my niece is in the doctor care for now, she needs to take a break from school and activities for a while so she is living in the treatment center of LA atm
it's actually healthy to think of sex as a way to relieve your stress, no string attached <a:pepenarutorun:1081435087901556827>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
if the owner or receptionist is up to your taste then a quiet gym mean free sex
oh right, since he left here i thought sth actually happen to him instead of tired of seeing you dumbo
did sth happen
who ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
like HoS

But if it’s good then alright
I actually have so many things to ask
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Do you think the 3rd person will also take a bite if you put those boxes in front of their door
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Always try it first
Is that an European tradition ?
I don’t understand how to get that many crystals to pull like the simulation
She is stronger than GD because of her stig
If you don’t have 4/4 Kira obv GD is still better
Edge of Night ?
the v2 change make her affixes less cancer <a:pepenarutorun:1081435087901556827>

pros are practicing inhouse
this time of the year is the best time to climb tho
if someone trying to gatekeep you

yea it's actually cool, he is treating life like a manga
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
the winner get to draw it
he even host a contest for it 3 months ago
this 2nd series
dude only draw Kaguya cause he wasn't big enough
yea he won't draw anymore
become big enough through Kaguya so now he can enjoy the life he want
2 series a week mean 2 days
Aka actually finish his draft in 1 day
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
no need to draw anymore, only need to make the draft and early sketch so he can balance it out between worktime and gaming time
<a:alert:960403776991264798>
instead of cosplaying Love is War
you have 4 characters show up and 3 of them already need to meet therapy
but the characters are not likeable like Kaguya or Prez
his gag is still there, same gag moments with Kaguya so i think it's okay  <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<@148145559897636865>
yea it's out
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
they're just hero and heorine
even weirder when you know that they're not the protagonist
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
new story have a jerk and a girl with M personality
instead of 2 smart and awkward teenagers falling in love
there is a new version of Kaguya
oh Aka is working on 2 series at the time
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
a god literally talking with Aqua and Ruby
it's already super natural
or at least he know they died because of him
if anything Hikaru get hard on when he kill people
yea but there isn't any sign he is into making out
got a twin
then again he had sex with Ai 2 years later
and he may or maynot gaslight her into doing it
even weirder when you know that  Hikaru lost the virgin card during his middle school to a 30 yo woman
i would lose my mind
also istg if the dad turn out to have some super power to gather  talent  of other actors <a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
the female actor died because of Aqua
you know that because Aqua stopped Akane from finishing the dad back then
should have let Akane ended the dad <a:pepenarutorun:1081435087901556827>
or readers are actually idiots
so unless Aka think readers are all idiots
yea cause Aka tried so hard to make it clear <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
cause Aka made it clear like 10 times
everyone should already know about that trait
but unless Aka think readers are all idiots
he is just trying to act like a jerk so that when he stabbed the dad he wouldn't hesistate <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
5 cost Lee Sin, his ult knockback the enemy, if the enemy is on the edge, the next ult will kick them out of the field
5 cost Yasuo, if it's 1 vs 1, Yasuo ult will executed the enemy
no matter who it is
but Teemo will always win 1 vs 1
5 cost Teemo, you need to spend 5 health to buy
there was also some interesting 5 cost in previous set
it was 50 cost
his mana was too low
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
yea cause he will kill 2 of your tank
and put on your board
you will most likely never buy him
if you hit Silco at 7
but he was weak af at 7 <:ok:1088133019455467560>
cause more CC champs
in 6.5 it was strong
5 cost
a more fucking annoying oxdd
basically let them live for 3 seconds more
and his skill give the lowest health champ a stat boost
he has a passive that create 2 spot in front of him that give 30 starting mana
and that champ was a menace to the meta
it was during 6.5
<:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
Silco from Arcane
do you know they also put Silco in TFT
K'santa or sth
the black dude
i heard that there will be new champ in set 9
but CN just have 100 Akayuki and 100 Kyoshiro each server
the quality of the top are all the same with CN
yea it's just like Honkai
except NA
but the final winners are split equally between all region <:ok:1088133019455467560>
they have the most players in final day
surprisingly CN is not dominate it
so they actually go to world and compete for pride only
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
TFT regional in CN also have twice the prize of Worlds championship
if you're a foreigner then you need to be Challenger
for TFT it's GM+
and require you to be D1+ to be invited
and the Super Server only open when the pros are in a break
so other servers were born to reduce the stress of it
CN main server is called Ionia server and that server have the daily login of 20 million
it's to divide player into their right skill level or their internet provider
until the set is at least look acceptable
but they asked the playtester to keep it secret as long as possible
it's not NDA
<a:pepenarutorun:1081435087901556827>
CN have 20 League's server
i don't think KR have it, it's CN privilege
Main server, super server, dalao server
like they also have 3 TFT servers in CN
so they always have everything setup immediately
CN have their own server and their own management
oh yea CN bros are already playtesting it
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
you can play previous set
do you know that in CN server
reddit will repost it
but CN bros will post on NGA first
usually reddit yea
May 23rd
oh wtf that Aether game is out in 3 days

if you're hot everything is forgivable
<a:Booba:1081435431540903936>
but there is 0% chance this game will ever be able to publish in China
CN playerbase really love this game <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
there is a leaderboard
oh it's for their pride
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
then back to horny
sometime they hit players with sad events
it's the typical afk game, login -> daily -> jack off -> log out
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
imagine opening your crush's coffin and found out her head is gone
Snow White serectly love Lilith and Red Hood taught Rapuzel about lewd things
that event is kinda cute tho <:peepositfishing:1109291486102691840>
they executed Exia
also the scene when Yulha squad first show up <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
playing lot of games 2 months ago cause i was trying out new things , kidna drop half of them atm<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
<:OkaygeBusiness:900551897251979317>
my bad <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
they keep mentioning events with threesome subtext
also Blanc and Noir convo are too horny
from the tutorial <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i can't, im in Asia <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>

<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I think there are some players who test it out but not sure if they ever share it
They don’t public it, only mentioned it when people asked for that info
Or else it will tilt people if Clone sivir roll Morello Bluebuff
Yea clone run lucky gloves system too
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
90% the time, clone Fiddle BiS is Shojin
Can’t be worse than Infiniteam Fiddle
And they put champion in those
It divided into tank, bruiser, ad, ap category
So Lucky Gloves Lee Sin roll IE GS
And Lee Sin was bruiser
Cause she was put in tank category
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
During the first patch
Do you know Morgana lucky gloves will roll Warmorg Sunfire
No one in their right mind would do that
Mort intend for her to be frontline unit
It was because during PBE
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Yea she has highest health among 3 cost for no good reason
Shred and sunder
CC 2 units
Yea Morgana is too broken
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Yea it’s like trying to capscore in Honkai beta
They’re all players who couldn’t climb anymore so they start messing in PBE
The quality of players are just bad
No point in going into PBE to test out new patch
Oh i mean PBE for set 9
I usually play PBE inhouse if robin or soju aren’t streaming during PBE
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
You can join some TFT servers and play inhouse
Yea it does
<:peepositfishing:1109291486102691840>
I will probably alter between PBE and smurf during for fun patch tho
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
Fuck is that
<:peepositfishing:1109291486102691840>
Oh you mean in Honkai
Slave ?
pressing D and F is fun

<a:scammerdance:834178162199101532>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
CN bros are slow man
Still no set 9 leak
That is not a reason <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:whip:1024122299034632272>
The fuck is that weakass score
Yea i got it too, pretty neat <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
I can’t do Kallen until tmr
it's called dorm supply
there is
it better be
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
i don't even want to know where did HoT come from
You guys are all bot
Keilo realized there is no need for a bot like that
yea they're all good QoL
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
and we got another 3 weeks patch
into Riot getting hacked
there was a 1 month patch
oh it's due to winter break
<@148145559897636865>
let me see if i can find it
so when combat start, hecarim run into the back and explode, you got free stats or gold
and hecarim was count as an ally back then
there is an admin  when your allies die, you get gold/AP/mana/HP 
oh yea it's because due to an old feature
also Ekko counter the shit out of Garen if you position for it
and he is a good flex frontline
yea lot of comps want him
yea oxdd Ekko + warmorg sunfire/redemption = 10 years to kill
cause you're down 1 item for oxdd on Ekko
oxdd spat usually good but i don't think it's good in spat carousel
mascot spat on Pyke 3 or Rammus 3 = unkillable
but you need to turbo highroll
oh mascot spat is also kinda good
the good aren't craftable
spat this set is so bad
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
except infiniteam and Fon
realistically you can't even make anything good with spat
like spat opener into infiniteam emblem
isn't that the most free top 2 of all time
<@148145559897636865> spat opener and 2 infiniteam top 2
enjoying Honkai
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
actually the start of something new
this relationship is too good
just saw this, new stage <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
it's just wafer + AL
only have 1000 tokens
you can't buy out that shop btw
should be the ult build
i was messing around with ult build and still get 5 mins run
signet change look like a good buff for her
<@370438895965306882> if you use HN now in ER she is way faster than last patch <:ok:1088133019455467560>
No <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
No 4K yet
<@309634550273933314>
should be able to
as long as you have around 30 pulls
yea it's this week
the 2nd occasion where you turn on HoS QTE
kinda cool
new setup for -0 Kallen
yea there actually is
yet
cause we are not playing Genshin
no Ice Para
5 different Husk
Lightning Para/Hitcount
Type Para/Hitcount
Ice Hitcount
or wait like 30 seconds for another solution to show up
need Kira to bypass it
enter invulnerable state
yea same with Abyss Flower
Ice Weather Husk
there is new Husk
what if keilo is a joke tho <:ok:1088133019455467560>
only Ice Husk
but there is no normal Husk in beta
and currently only she can
Kira can damage them in that state
for example if the boss is in transition phase it will enter invulnerable state
direct HP loss in this case mean bypass mechanic
both Abyss Flower + Ice Husk have that gimmick btw
only Kira has that gimmick
you need to deal direct HP loss damage
during their transition
on Kira exclusive boss just put Turg on her
it's retainable with RC
she is definitely too strong but as long as you have 4/4 JK + Ely elf
you can definitely skip her gear btw
so they make a RC that have HB gimmick
RC is too cool
can't skip a valk this strong
not going for dupe
ofc no
HoS 2.0 + QUA Herrscher is coming
still not worth going for dupe
better Turg
MEI is a great set
She use Aladdin/Holmes TB Paga M
She didn’t use Aladdin MB in Big Jelly
HoS need sp affixes on MEI TMB for Big Jelly
MA strat
They add exclusive in so that you can’t use 2 set of MEI TMB at the same time
No it’s different effect that give shieldbreak
Even in a competitive subreddit, the one who actually try to compete are also 10% of it
Yea 90% of those rant posts are skill issue too
<:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
Highskill ceiling, diverse meta, great champion designs, fun community
That’s why you play TFT instead of this shit game
GC and HoS will both use MEI TMB
Or else
So that you can’t stack it
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
It’s useless
So yes
750 token for something that won’t improve your account is useless
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Missing 10 frags
Alright, will probably have SS GC by Sunday

sound like those are sick jokes to you
12 years old and already on the way of being a gymbro
the start of something new
unironically, youngster talk like that nowaday
old enough to know their life suck but not old enough to have common sense
probably a kid
you still swap back to GC after SnS ult
triple supports don't need dps rot
if you stay on SnS after charge + ult then it's just plain wrong
triple supports are about rotating
there is also no SnS dps rot but she is still stronger than S2 BKE

Duelist kinda blow without spat tho
The 2 other comps were Ezreal reroll + Duelist
Only 18/20 are TF + Laser game
I still play other comps once in a while
i can't see any other angles except TF and Laser
im actually a beast at being degen <:worryWicked:920970765623525377>

they need to be together
Honkai next 3 patches will need some fund
might be a skip for me too <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yea it's 20 to 26 bucks <:ok:1088133019455467560>

1 more to go
1 rabbit down
your mom
but i won't stop anyone from pulling due to interest
because her value is so fucking low<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
don't think too much while playing game
just pull
just do 5 pulls
yea no harm in doing it
probably gonna need that SS <:ok:1088133019455467560>
60 is way below avg but i need some luck on pulling GC instead
60
not bad
20 pulls for 4/4 <:ok:1088133019455467560>
valk without sig weapon equal trash
no one care tbh <:ok:1088133019455467560>
it's normal in Vietnamese <:ok:1088133019455467560>
i already bought CN outfit
will probably need 30 pulls for SS
look broken
same effect with HoR weapon
need to be ranked PE
PE S0 is not in the race
not SI
tripple supports are GC HoS SnS btw
MPE ? extremely 
Tripple supports ? Braindead
i will decide later when i fight Kallen ig
Kallen
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
is her SS broken or not
do i need SS GC 1st week
close to nothing
Hare has 69 of it
BKE only have 1 big hit to mald for
problem is that
BKE also doesn't have it
no crit rate is not a bad thing
in Nirvana
Hare is extremely tilted to play
yea and he is not happy a single ounce about it
future Myriad container
bro no one gonna roll for Hare
11 cards left now
i had 31 cards in the beginning
oh it's 20 pulls <:ok:1088133019455467560>
or 20
but in reality only cost 10 pulls
i spent 60 pulls too
<:ok:1088133019455467560>

soonest will be around this week, latest will be end of next week
And the units you play in Built Diff are usually contested as fuck units
Or else it’s meaningless
Yea it need to be offered on 2-1 to play it
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
I still can’t play it tho
Built diff is a cool augment
Kinda cool
Start playing the game with 16 Hp
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
You can get to 50 in stage 2
Fon opener is actually circus
Cause he has BiS TF + Neeko
And start stomping everyone
couldn’t get shiv and got it from big egg
A dude playing TF
In 1 of my games
Big egg is the worst lmao
Out of fucking nowhere a Rammus 2 with Sunfire, warmorg appear
Also some stupid shit can happen with small Neeko carousel
Make them poor for no reason
But egg or anvil carousel punish that kind of player
And still make 10 after carousel
Lv 5 at 2-3
You would want to push it more on stage 2
Like if you’re on a winstreak
It’s too for fun and punished streak player
<:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
So cool
Hero augment + glitch carousel
In term of fucking around
Yea set 8 have reach the lowest of low
They have more people, more resources to work with when they start working on set 9
Cause it’s the set made from new TFT team
Set 9 actually have high expectation
Best set of all time
Dw you will get there in set 9
If you can’t then it’s 100% bot 4
You need to see the actual line the game is giving
Yea in some games, the game will just refuse to go along with your gameplan
And mental exhausting
Maintining your LP from 1400+ is too hard
Then i ran it all down the next day
Most of my T10 were also that i got to T10 in luckdy day
Yea it’s the entertain way
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Emily’s mental is ads break or tuber
A single 8th = four 1st in a row to make up for it
You’re playing for 5th and 6th first
Like most of the time, when you’re 1400-1500
She doesn’t have the skill to not go 8th when she is in high LP
Seriously tho, she will never reach T1 in NA
Robin take a 1 week break from TFT <a:aware:965946296236122172>
They’re hitting paper down there

It force people to exile position
Asol is omega busted
Too many AP items = put Asol in
It depend on your item
Or 8 brawler + Morgana/Asol
Yea 6 brawler 4 laser
It’s team buff
And it’s crazy good
Yea that one
Big Data is definitely the best augment for jax
But with Big Data yea
Definitely no
Cause it was Jax that carry him to his first challenger
Boxbox has a hard on for Jaxx during set 6
Yea it was due to set 6 and 8 itemization
Probably sth like QSS Guinsoo GS
You need more damage to get pass frontline
It’s QSS + 2 damage items
RFC is definitely wrong now
Then he went 8th
He got dropped a jax and immediately said “ it’s a 1st “
The rank 1 player of CN yesterday have rod tear chain opener
Also do you know that Chinese player love jaxdd
But definitely more playable now
Yea it’s not good enough for jax 2 to free top 4
jaxdd buff

the lil bro is Maokai's seed
Maokai, Kindred, Aa-trox, Caitlyn, Ashe, Akali
it's 6 skins
what part of this look like Elysia <@516591030326525983> <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
And which one get the most vote will be the final product
They will showcase 3 concept art of Modernia’s free skin soon
Basically pyramid skin of Honkai
Also it will have new voice, standing pose, shooting pose
<:Prayge:905887778821242890>
Hoping it use gem
<@309634550273933314> they said it’s gacha skin
Someone is already making sexdd
TFT community abuse the shit out of this emote
It’s an emote
TFT chat in general
But for other comps it’s harder to cap the board
Laser is super easy to go 9 too since you only need Mord + Fiddle
Or get top 2
The hard part is always how to cap your board and win the game
Yea it’s easy to go 9
That is usually how you play Laser
Most of the time i tried to stablize at 7 and 8 with Laser to save HP so that i can occasionally lose but still enough to go 9
As long as you can make it to neutral
Even 0 gold at 9 is fine
Ideally you go 9 as soon as possible unless you’re healthy
think how to stable without that 5 cost first
you shouldn't hope to get them at level 8
ideally when playing comp that need a specific 5 cost
or TF
but if i happen to have too many AP items playing Laser then i will put it on Asol instead
i usually won't
yea it's a noob bait
especially 7
unless im omega highrolling, i roll the fuck down on both 6 and 7
oh fast 8 is fake unless you start playing the game with 20 HP
but Mort philosophy think otherwise
and you should be reward for it
yea it's an actually high skill expression showcase
like they basically make sure Bill gates board won't exist again after set 4
oh they have been putting down that comp since set 5
basically fast 9 and put all 5 cost onto your board
yea all 5 cost
they're trying way too hard to get rid of Bill gates board
<a:cuakhetday:939810174070321202>
but you need They see me rolling
except Nunu
this set 5 cost is not cool at all
i just hope the 5 cost will be cool again
i actually have none yet
it better not have some stupid mechanic
we will some info leak during this week <:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
and wait for set 9 PBE
it's end of season now, all the pros are taking a break
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
1k2 LP Chally
but below that is questionable tho
yea the quality of top ladder is the same across all server
The gap keep getting wider with HFI ranked tho
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Not that bad actually cause HFI use normal team
Like SS vs S0
She has 2 bosses and now it become 1
Btw i think SpA lost Aka to HFI <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
French and correct is not mean to be together
me too
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
It will still be better than HN + SI due to how strong the shield is nowaday
You actually do, on some specific bosses you use HN + GC
6.7
Gonna be a set of all time
2 weeks until set 9 PBE
All good on her
LW, Guard breaker, HoJ
A lot of the time
puting any other glove items on her or picking Jeweled make her weaker
IE alone is fine as long as it stop at just IE crit rate
<@148145559897636865> the IE bug on Samira only affected her if you have more crit rate on her
i always ping you guys <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
check the ping again dumbo
good luck to everyone
side stage this time is the physical bio one

Yea look like it, decay only happen with Masters +
So having instant AS on whole board is lit
Cause if hero augments are 2 cost you want Boxing Lesson and 4 cost you want Big Data
The best one for Laser is usually Combat start your team gain 25% AS
Yea that’s how it work, your unit need to be alive and on your board to start getting it
And by that time it’s not worth anymore
Yea but it’s only for Blitz, WW won’t get that until much later
The best scaling every 5 seconds is the healing one
Yea never unless it’s the only one
You want to have instant stats on your WW
The scaling every 5 seconds is the worst one
Starting AD/AS/HP or at 66% HP get AD/HP
Probably never unless im forced to take or slam Admin crest
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
it's for your own good
careful on what you spend heki <:ok:1088133019455467560>

DA
you have 3 answers on it
this time it's the right clock <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
so still can do the dragon breath trick
last cycle she cheat it out due to low temp
HoT struggle to do good here
stuff like trying to get Trio from dorm supply
4k went into wrong banner tho
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
on 1st week
i think 1 of them swipe like 10k
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it's cookie run kingdom, the gacha one i think
yea for some reasons all TFT pros are playing it now
swiping for 3D characters is still better than swiping for a cookie
oh he just messing around

<:ok:1088133019455467560>
Oh yea if you have it before picking augment then it’s the wrong augment for sure
sometime you have to ignore it
UG is not always the play all the time
UG was a bait there
just sack stage 2 and pick up supers + mascot
yea if you pick stack on stacks <:ok:1088133019455467560>
not mine
if i can't hit WW on 7 it's mortdog's fault
im actually a beast at playing Laser now
to tunnel into Laser
Blitz or Ashe
Blanc and Noir both playable
<@309634550273933314> oh fuck it's double banner
go for it
sound like an 8th
UG into Jhin
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
there are some turbo broken 1 cost hero augment
it won't matter that much
maybe if you go for 4 heist
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
oh it actually matter
depend on your items tho
yea sound better
it's 8th
oh
you're playing a reroll comp, no ? <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
mascot + supers
and you reroll mascot
RFC + BT + GS/IE
this set is just doom
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
if you build IE or have Jewled Lotus augment with Samira, she gets weaker
this one and the IE on Samira
btw do you know that there were 2 bugs happened in this tourney that almost cost them slot to day 3 <@148145559897636865>
<@309634550273933314> <:evil:1049317760984940574>
while Sureshot need Samira 2*
all other comps stable super hard with their carry at 1*
Sivir 2* > Samira 1*
and even if you hit 1 Samira
it's just shit
without 3 cost carry holder
this sureshot line is not it
2 of his 8th are coming from Sureshot
out of the race
bro robin went 888
<:Exit:1042800026537177178>

<@370438895965306882> timestop while clearing Ice RPC transition <:ok:1088133019455467560>
He actually thought he was good at the game <:pepe2:368744338445828106>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
1% odd + hitting that chosen odd
like chosen Kayle on 5
it's also fun for special moments
but chosen is still a good mechanic
the set wasn't balanced tho
good for both side
or being a degen
it actually encourage players to learn the game
yea, 1 of the best mechanic
so fucking stupid
dragons, hero augments
i just hope no more stupid mechanic <:ok:1088133019455467560>
and they won't do anything stupid with it
yea look like only portals
no more stupid mechanic
set 9 actually will be lit tho <:ok:1088133019455467560>
so NA regional today will have to play on LAN
also tournament realm is fucking bugged rn <:COCKBedge:939253294994436176>
and they buff that shit in 8.5
players had been non-stop bitching about oxdd during set 8
:oxdd:
for fun
actually buff the fucking trait
they change from attack speed to armor + mr
yea they did
it called Shade, Shade units after every 5 attacks enter stealth for 0.25 second
there used to be a trait that is also as toxic as it
:oxdd:
Alistar 1* tank MF 3* ult
best trait in TFT history tho
those 2 comps have oxdd in it
when people start playing Jhin and TF
i have not seen Lulu doing well these past 2 days
that comp get cucked so hard by oxdd
i think it's just that everyone are still figuring out this patch <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
if you go for wrong items on carousel
you're just fucked
if you don't know exactly your item drop during neutral
so that's 2 tears, 2 rods, 2 swords, 2 belts
so itemize for that comp will look like this 
Lulu : Blue buff - Gunblade - GS
Pantheon : Spark - Sunfire - HP item
it need to be Spark
also that Lulu comp is the only comp that can't work well with Shiv
and you also need to hit all 3*
you need too many specific items
it's an omega highroll comp
and we both think Lulu comp is overrated
i actually have a talk with robin and other challengers yesterday
you will still lose to some stupid shit
this patch units are balance so even if you hit your board
WLWLW is fine as long as i manage to save HP
yea i also don't feel like playing the game at 60 HP anymore unless i really need to
winstreaking in general getting harder too
the better you're, the better the lobby also become
unless im highroll
noper
with laser ?
isn't that kinda crazy
your game become so much easier with just 1 item at 2-1
it's literally just a cum
if i have Shiv in 2-1
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
cause of Shojin + RH
they removed it
it used to work during set 4
item prior in this comp is just Shiv > WW items > Sunfire
just shiv Morgana
also if you need LW
without titan it's mid tho
yea it's good to pair with titan
Runaan Hurricane
pick 3 out of it
you want Titan QSS EoN RH on WW
oh that's wis
what items you usually itemize toward WW
<:EZ:953617687735566356>
1 WW on 7 and it's lit
easy to play
my favorite comp rn is laser <:ok:1088133019455467560>
or gadgeteen crest
Gnar is not stable enough in challenger anymore so unless i got Gnar before 3-2, i never consider it
oh you still play the hacker version
you bleed out too much at 6 if you can't hit Gnar
i think Gnar is a highroll comp yea <:ok:1088133019455467560>
Laser is just too busted
and i flex between Laser or TF
it's either bow, chain or tear
im actually clicked with this patch tho <:EZ:953617687735566356>
Bunch of core dust

but it must be broken
yea i can't figure out why that comp is broken either  <:ok:1088133019455467560>
not even need a good spot for it
he knows exactly at which spot he could force Lulu
the current rank 1 of NA is a Lulu lover
yea the higher elo you are, the better people at abusing unfair combo
i just get tilted from out of nowhere
or Battle Mage 5 Yasuo
something as dumb as Axiom arc Lulu
there are like some combo that will tilt players to heaven when playing against
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
but these augments and hero augments man
units balance are fine
but there is something wrong about augment balance
this patch look balance at first
people will fucking explode if it's all time
only on bridge
Honkai also have that
yea idk why neither

you mean Trio <:ok:1088133019455467560>
and for some reasons, her damage instances are like 999 hit
she needs at least 95% of her hit to crit
instead of malding for AF to crit
BKE 2.0
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
she feel shit to play
on top of all of that
and on her own weather, even S0 struggling with CN current temp
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
which is kinda messed up
she needs rank to do what she supposed to do
for most people

what is NA dist ?
so i pick Luna right ? <:ok:1088133019455467560>

I think every sets i have 4-5 games like that
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Yea TFT micro skills only useful on 1v1 and at the top of the ladder
Or any other MOBAs
In valo, league you need to learn the game + dealing with braindamaged human
Yea cause at the end of the day, you’re learning how to improve yourself
Iirc
If you’re masters above
Yea you got little legend
Leblanc or Kaisa <:ok:1088133019455467560>
Unless you get scaling HP Admin with Big Data
Jaxdd is a top 4 comp and get out
4.5 avg <:ok:1088133019455467560>
Cause oxdd counter lulu so hard
Or even Jhin players
Don’t you just 8th if there are more than 2 Spell players in the lobby
That lulu comp is just weird
Unless it’s my win cons
Like 1 in 200 games, usually i never try to do that
the best way to describe Xayah is that she is Samira + Jhin + 50% attack speed  <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but set 8 is terrible too
they all in on set 8
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
yea but they gave up on it
her traits were perfect too
that's why it's wrong
there was nothing wrong about her
like perfect AD carry design
that was her issue
a flawless champion
she either broken or half broken
the unit that can't be balanced
there were also Xayah
but the mechanic behind it was a nightmare
cause Dragons design are cool
yea it look fun for viewers that's for sure
no one even play it anymore
i remember after regional
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
the set was so bad
instead of x1
but their traits count as x3
Dragon units take up 2 slots instead of 1
there were 7 dragons
Dragon theme
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
it's just playing casino
during Worlds players didn't even happy winning game
and the set turn into the worst possible thing ever
so they gave up midway
last set was balanced nightmare for the devs
tilt players way too hard
and last set
tbh this set <:ok:1088133019455467560>
she was close to hitting rank 10 in main season but got bot 4 like 8 games in a row
she is just tilted
then Hero augments come force
nothing could be worse than Dragons
people used to think
no eyebrows stream soon <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
sure man, you're a beast
relax, all the pinoys are cunny enjoyer
rank 1 in TFT is so fucking hard especially when pros are practicing for regional  <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
only when the sun rises from the west that emily could get rank 1  <:ok:1088133019455467560>
he just ran it down
he already hit rank 1
that's for Emily hitting rank 1

1 of the degen trying to be flex
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
I want my degen comp back
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
It’s 4.06
Yea that’s why i don’t know how the comp avg is so high
And you hit 2 Jhin on your 7 rolldown
No hero augment before 4-2
Yea i think the correct way to play Jhin is that
Put in shit like Samira and Belveth then your hero augments get screwed over
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
It need to be Jhin
There are no item holders for Jhin at 4-1
Cause while playing it i realized 1 thing
Like 3 out of 20 games
To setup the board for it before 4-2
But you need to be a beast
4 cost hero are alright too
While having BiS on Jhin + Viego
Almost went 6th
I just had a Jhin game with Burning Spirit Annie
If you get hero augment, unless it’s a threat one, it’s unclickable
<@148145559897636865> it clicked, this Jhin comp idea scenario is no hero augment

any of you guys live in LA ? <@370438895965306882> <@416445660443967491> <@385655541248163840> <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>

My first gacha was during my middle school and bought my first MTG pack
I actually can’t play gacha unless it’s a serious one with real competitive content
Jesus
:buddha:
I play Honkai between TFT’s games to calm down
Just need strong mental
No need to swipe
Best gacha ever created
Teamfight Tactics
The gacha im playing rn only cost my mental health
and you replace Rammus with either Ekko or Morgana
or at least Pyke
yea it need mascot on both Rammus and Pyke
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
spatula
like 3 of it
that comp need a lot of spats tho
hoping for a miracle
roll the fuck down for full 2* and go 7
if you lost too much HP
it depend on the tempo too tho
and slowroll for full 3 star
lv 6 on 3-2
you open stage 2
any tear ?
oh it's Vex reroll time
in Jhin comp you will probably want Ox emblem or renegade emblem
cause Pyke is good and Vex is good
oh i actually think riftwalker emblem is bad
figuring out this Jhin comp will probably take 500 LP from me
im a degen too <:ok:1088133019455467560>
no comps avg below 4.0
this patch stats look good
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
hope it's in time for regional and world
the true balance patch
they're getting there tho
that cloak opener was the play
there was a time Viego was so strong
Oxdd, renegade and heart
3 strong traits
he is a 4 cost with 3 traits
yea buffing him was way too dangerous
so rn it's good
and they buffed Viego for fun
other comps got nerfed
oh it's just that Jhin didn't get touch in the patch
Zac will become a quickdraw
if you put the spat on Kaisa for example
it take the job of riftwalker unit
yea that's why i think Jhin rn is a good comp
you never drop Pyke
oh that guy is playing it wrong
cause that mean you don't know what going wrong
can't become a better player if you're not complaining
i do that all the time
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
rolling on 7 will usually get you that champ back
saving HP is more important
don't be afraid to itemize units that will be in your final board
yea usually
if you miss your 1st rolldown on 7
even Belveth work too
ashe, jaxdd, camille
and itemization is easy too
the comp is actually straightforward to play
then go 8
hit a WW
roll the fuck down
until you make it to 7
and adding morgana, rammus, sivir, more brawler along the way
it's just Ashe - Renek - Yasuo - Blitz as your early
actually broken and braindead
oh laser ww is broken
there is no early game or mid game for this weird comp
im trying to figure out this Jhin comp
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
cooking an 8th
playing from the past
how about Annie
:jaxdd:
if you have brawler spat it's 6 brawler 4 laser
6 brawler + Morgana/Asol
char already went to jail
<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
if you back pulling
it's 70-80%
after the debut
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Are you gonna become a Punisher or keep railing the stars gresham
But alright
That’s so random
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
487 ?
What is NA current dist
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
stats never lie
but once good players figure out the correct way to use stats
there was a time it was like that tho so it's not entirely wrong
cause it make players rely on stats
he also said before that he think tactic.tool is bad for the game
 Adapting 
he also has the habit of using some exceptional game, those that can only happen 1 out of 100 games for his philosophy about playing TFT
like his idea of playing TFT is that  you take what you want to take  <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
he also thought Cleansing Safeguard Lee Sin was balanced
tbh with all the respect, Mort is kinda delusional
Zhonya, Manazane and some other broken Radiant items
the only item that can rival Shiv are Ornn items and radiant items pretty much
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
balanced ?
because dude didn't have shiv
went 7th
and someone with Neeko 2, 3 items
i just saw a game where a TF 1 with Shiv go fast 9
and you don't have to build LW on your carry
if you play AD then Shiv on Morgana and you have a global LW with CC
if you play AP then Shiv is on TF, best item in the game
just because Morgana exist
im actually convinced Shiv is the best item this set <@148145559897636865>
any other AP items are just mile better
Hoj is also meh on MF tbh, it's like 1 rank better than JG
it's the interaction between JG and Hoj that make it worth
except Yasuo carry
yea Hoj is meh on any other carries
or BT double Titan
but BiS is fake, Titan BT JG work too
BiS Yasuo carry is Hoj, JG and QSS
Hoj is the best
Hoj/BT/Gunblade, at least 1 of them need to be on Yasuo
and he keep dying for fun
i limit test 1 game without healing item
you extremely need healing tho
i test it and it still feel good
yea the Wind of Wanderer
but strong enough to get you free top 2 if you hit
not strong enough to get you free top 2 without Yasuo 3
oh Yasuo carry is still viable btw
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
buffing Kayle was way too scary
it should have been Fiora and Vayne buff
if they want to improve duelist line
i genuinely think she was too strong for an UG unit
yea i think it's deserved
like bug that can grieve your placement instead of gaining it
unfortunate
currently only have bad bugs
no bug can escape my sight
im a master at being degen
yea i was there when it happened
as in ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<@370438895965306882>
it's the same case with Griseo's cross
yes
so duelist back to normal
the moment they found it, they fixed it too now <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
so now 8 duelists suddenly gain 12% more dps due to frame advantage
but they fixed it with this patch
with 30 fps their dps drop like 5% compare to the intention
before atk speed hero got affected by fps
it's due the bug fixed they delivered in this patch
<@148145559897636865> found the reason why 6/8 duelist suddenly become too good
this week is fucked again, score are all too high for no reason <:shruge:1079371164159311982>

shit is cursed
he didn't try to scare people, he tries to disturb your reading sense
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
his works are supposed be  the fuck is that 
i don't think Junji Ito's works are supposed to be scary either
from the old set
but this one is old
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it was posted on competitive subreddit before
something like this ?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
the UI is just a mess
yea TFT mobile is painful to play
<a:Tfire:1090234271739957298>
and im here pressing D and F
maybe everyone is busy riding the stars
that's actually a rare sight
<a:aworryOnFire:862940123430518814>
oh wait it's the skatingdentge
dentge
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
im a degen
yea Ekko is broken too but he is too flex for my playstyle
20 games and Morgana was on my board 13 games
but now everyone have her in their boards
yea it used to be like that in Chally
it's basically LW
yea if you put Shiv on Morgana
for no reason
this Morgana unit is too broken
actually nut
Shiv is still useful
no matter what you play
and put it on Morgana
the tech is just slam Shiv
Shiv is still the best item
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
coolest 4 cost
yea i miss TF too
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
cause he met me on 5-1 and 5-5
yea his mental just went boom tho
mental went boom
into radiant RFC
he reforge his radiant DB
oh i just realised the Kayle carry dude
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
thanks to me
all the AD players went bot 4 tho
it's Neeko/TF casino and maybe if you highroll Infiniteam
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
i think Kaisa comp lowkey dead
im actually a beast tho, already a 2nd
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
thoughts ?
on 6-1
Belveth 1, Asol 1
yea im playing this game like a beast
his Kayle 3 with radiant DB got 1 shot
oh i just sent this guy to 8th first
it's lit
1 asol 1 belveth
40 gold rolldown
im going 8th <:ok:1088133019455467560>
yea this is the for fun one
or this is an 8th
i need Asol + Belveth asap
yea the carry one
im playing 6 defender poppy 3 <:ok:1088133019455467560>
asmorath's stream ? <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
whose stream is it <:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
what stream is that
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
the most fucked up content
you're using it on QUA contents
FR is way too hard to master and on top of that
you can count those with just 10 fingers
the people that can use FR as main dps is way too few anw <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
like a decent highroll spot
it should still be okay, just need a good spot for it
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
when a 3* 5 cost need a buff
isn't this kinda sad
3 gadgeteen buff mean you can save more HP early
next patch does look like back to TF/Neeko meta
and they have not figure out how to buff him
i still don't know how Aatrox has been trash since beginning of 8.5 til now
still trash unit
buffing Aatrox damage for fun and only the first cast <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
actually reverse fon
you're playing poppy and lulu
but in early game
it's decent when the 3 you play are good units
5 is busted, 3 is kinda dog
back to jaxdd meta
Kayle is an UG unit
is scary
but Kayle and Jax buff
yea 3 gadgeteen does need a buff
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
patch note is here <@148145559897636865> <:ok:1088133019455467560>
they spent all the budget on the MOBA spin off
<a:worrySwingSadge:981759583779446866>
it's just sad
TFT was so undervalued at Riot
indie company
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
usually they post it when the intern wake up
it should be tmr yea if nothing go wrong
they haven't posted official patch note yet
fucking menace
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
the most fuck up combo i have seen last patch also was Pyke 3* with Mascot + Ox emblem
:oxdd:
and throw in 10 ox units
the most toxic thing was playing syndra
last patch when oxdd still haven't changed
they probably thought it's cool to have a trait that can tank MF ult
best trait ever
yea oxdd
there were like 5 units that can do the same
the interaction between GA and traveling skill was way too toxic in set 5
here is the interaction that got GA to be removed
a less toxic version of GA
so they change it to EoN
but GA was too OP
like Edge of Night used to be Guardian Angel
usually they don't, only if they change the whole item completely
yea no rush, those things will eventually hammer into your brain <:ok:1088133019455467560>
not just perfect units
pick up good units on the rolldown
Master level is like when you can put together an acceptable board after rolldown
around diamond
still below master
you still playing ? down to stream 1 game ?
sound like most of my games <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
for fun
she is just broken
even with Shiv/Last Whisper, you still want to play Morgana as a flex unit
yea always
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
isn't that a problem
Blizt 2 is like 10 times tankier than Aatrox 2
fucking garbage champ <:ok:1088133019455467560>
not Aatrox tho
just threat units
if you ever feel like don't know what to put in
4 SG Neeko is mid
Neeko is only good with 6 SG or 4 spell
Kaisa Rell Nilah Ekko
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
you play Morgana 2
yea i already solved the question on how to top 4
and play Rammus, Morgana on your board
you go 4 SG only
if you play it with Kaisa
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
3 cost
and get all the stacks back
cause you can get 4 UG in stage 3 or after stage 2 carousel
1 of the way to play UG in challenger is to save HP on stage 2
saving HP
smurf on those kids
free LP <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
Probably visual bug
Weird
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
In lolchess
You got the screenshot from that game ?
Weird
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Did You see it in a game or from an old vid ?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
current set only have those 4 types
You can pick 1 out of 5 items
The augment called Radiant Relics
3 heist minimum
Only from primastic augment or underground cashout
Radiant items
not Hashinshin enough
:jaxdd:
is he finally a dragon now
yea she is actually peak braindead in Kosma, probably only need to manage the stacks, get enough stack to 2 rots Kosma
Shino did 5 runs with MPE and change to HN
And im 100% sure HN win btw
This abyss is a battle between MPE and HN
poor soul <:life:1001518241610485781>
oh wait it's t
<a:uooh:964118021574623243> ?
your mom
slamming JG/IE is just omega grief
glove is just dead
tear can be shiv, shojin, archangel, vow, redemption 
belt can be sunfire, warmorg, redemption
glove is omega for fun now
it's tear > belt > glove
oh wait you mean that kind of carousel
bow
keep chasing the sun
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
i think you can still learn even if you're a 1 trick pony, there are still many things to improve until Challenger <:ok:1088133019455467560>
degen patch is actually fun if you're the degen one <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
or 1-2
if someone contest me we hold hand 7-8
if i see bow + tear on 2-1, i type Kaisa and deafen
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
degen patch like this is actually my kind of patch
im for fun now too, already reach Top 10 a week ago
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
it's okay, LP is temporary, knowledge is forever
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
like AP board or anima squad board
you only take it on 3-2/4-2 if you're playing some units that have tons of trait for fun
SG, gadgeteen, laser, anima
and try to get as many broken options as possible
yea usually you take it on 2-1
that will lead to only 1 tailored and 3 random
if you have 6 Duelist on your board that mean you only have 6 traits at best right ?
you need as many traits as possible for tome
oh did you know you need to tailor the amount of traits on your board first ?
yea, try it<:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
it's free for all
they change it now, just sign it up and you get PBE account
oh, just sign up for 1
everyone will just messing around to get used with champion name, abilities, trait
no ranked = no motivation
yea no one taking it seriously in PBE too
they cashing out on set 9
trust
set 9 will be best set of all time <:ok:1088133019455467560>
on holidy break it's 1 month
yea every 2 weeks, if there are some issue then it's 3 weeks
the real for fun patch
yea last patch
they will balance it out more and make more variety in set 9
during 13.11 but it's just a preview for Set 9 theme <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
you need to play normal during 13.9 and 13.10
should be in 2 days
Gnar player get They see me rolling and Kaisa player get Empowered
also it's just fucked when hero augment are 5 cost
omega 8th for fun
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
then next round i face Gnar 3
got 2 guinsoo and dclaw
this is my 3rd heist cashout
but generally you need to play it safe cause trying to go for omega 1st in this meta without Kaisa/Gnar is risky as hell
yea if you highroll enough and out-tempo them you can secure 1st or 2nd from them <:ok:1088133019455467560>
kinda fucked up
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
always keep in mind you're playing for 3rd and 4th at the beginning cause 1st and 2nd are Gadgeteen + Kaisa
cause the meta rn is center around saving as much HP as possible
i roll the fuck down to upgrade them
like if i have 2 pairs on 3-2
but it's not the correct either, once you hit GM, you will have to base your roll on lobby tempo and board strength
but it change after like Plat or Diamond, everyone start to be more greedy
yea it change depend on tier, at Gold and below, people just donkey roll for 3* Renekton on 2-5 for fun <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
cause i lost 60 HP for 20 gold
and then went 6th
i think in challenger, 30% of my UG opener, i got forced to cash out on 2nd heist
cause the lobby tempo is too fast
sometime you just can't get to 3rd heist
but it depend on the tempo lobby
you want to up 2-3 items or 1 randiant item
usually 3rd cash out
pretty balance
nvm it's a 2nd, 1st is underground cash out <:ok:1088133019455467560>
im about to get a 1st with jaxdd
best game ever created <:ok:1088133019455467560>
even your mom ?
how about TFT <:ok:1088133019455467560>
What a beast
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
But still smashing Dove at night
Last TI i watch him playing, he was getting smashed instead
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
Winning any TI yet ?
Does Rtz still playing ? <:ok:1088133019455467560>
Imagine gambling in Fall Guys when you can gambling in TFT instead
You earned it lil bro

Holiday break in JP

Waiting for Blanc and Noir <:ok:1088133019455467560>

oh well
why tf it end up like this <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Infinity is also decent on Kaisa if you're missing 3rd item after Shiv + Gunblade
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
basically if you hit Hourglass or Manazane, it's a free +1 placement
Hourglass on Kaisa/MF/TF is instant take 
Manazane on MF/Neeko is instant take
Randuin is only good on Janna
Eternal Winter is alright on Mech Garen
Visage/Gold collector/Cleaver are trash
Infinity Force/Death Defiance are decent pick if you miss
Rocket grab to cheese out some wins
<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
they haven't nerf hourglass yet
im actually concerning about Orn item anvil
yea it should be during krugs and stage 3,4 carousel
can't wait for more RNG
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
also probably next set theme too
for fun patch new mechanic
<@148145559897636865>

Only in 13.11 portals will be added to ranked game
oh it's omega busted cause you can put it on LB
peak skill expression
so on 2-1, you just click it and win the game
this many lines avg below 4.00 shouldn't be legal
i just take a look at the stats
yea i think there is no way this patch is balance <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:FeelsSadMan:816800787137036360>
She failed to protect her friend and got protected instead so the guilt is getting her, she had to kill that friend too since they got corrupted while protecting Dorothy

<@309634550273933314> <:FeelsSadMan:816800787137036360>
if you need survival then it's always Centi
only for bossing anw
she is alright with Dorothy
<@148145559897636865> pretty balance <:ok:1088133019455467560>
don't think 3 is available ever since we cross 450D
bossing
on bosses with more than 2 body parts, Dorothy just dominated it
too fucking strong <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<@309634550273933314>
Keep playing and eventually you will know when to go 9
It’s a problem that can only be solved by experience
How big of a spike your 9 is and how big of a spike with units that haven’t 2* yet on your current board
Lobby tempo, current econ, the outcome of next few rounds
It depend on a lot of factors tho
Abou 30-40% of my games
In the DM <:ok:1088133019455467560>

Chapter 105 iirc
Yea the only other one i can think of that give me that impression was only Act Age
Actually good writing skill
Interesting fact, the first popularity poll of Frieren, the number 1 is Himmel <:ok:1088133019455467560>
Even just by chapter 1 you can already tell it’s a good manga
Yea that one is lit

there are still no TFT emotes
jaxdd and oxdd
xdd is S-tier tho
don't know why this emote suddenly become meta
the quality is kinda low
last whale cycle, 1 HoS rank up equal 1-2 points
HoS only need to have her ult crit on boss is enough
as long as you already know how to play HoS and familiar with pressing buttons
worst part is that i don't think HN rots on every bosses have any technical hard parts <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Have to make it worth
But ideally all of them at the same time
3 = 2 > 1
remind me about it later tonight
it's english ver yea but it's at home atm

That can’t be right
Did they take you to the 1st floor to meet a dude or you got stopped at the reception
fun fact for Overzone map, if you havent' done 1-1, there will be 10-20 mass produced Nikke wandering around, if you already did 1-3, there will only be Pinne left and later down the story, only 4 of the Pilgrim will be left <a:cuakhetday:939810174070321202>

<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
Also Ruby saying “ i understand mom better than everyone “ have no groundwork for it, or at least the author never show how much she understand Ai. Just because you’re a relative doesn’t always mean you understand a person. People all have their secrets after all

<a:aware:965946296236122172>
shit champ + shit effect
or even 6.5
in set 8 there were hero augments avg 6.0
like im not even capping
it's actually a lot better than set 8
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
but that will never be the case
i think it's fun when everything somehow actually balanced
hero augment is just a doom idea
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
the other one go 8th
2 Kaisa, 1 Jax
so you have lobby that like, 3 people play Supers
yea there was a time when the only viable comps are reroll
basically a trait for reroll only
and 3% extra for every 3* on your board
18% base
it's just damage boost
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
if you can go for GP 3* then it's good
and you roll for Yasuo, Fiora, Malphite, Leesin 3*
4 duelist and 3 supers on 6
you want 3 supers
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
yea that augment is actually so fucking cool
actually nut
watch this keilo
actually nut
oh let me show you this one
Rell + Yasuo just win out when they hit
2 cost hero augment is actually a disaster
but those comps half of the time won't make it to top 4
like sure, you can play lot of comps
there are too many lines that avg below 4.0
actual no way
there is no way this patch is balance
now that i think about it
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
3* 3 cost beat 3* 5 cost
isn't that kinda cool ?
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>

it make everything after become awkward
shouldn't have painted her that way in chapter 1
<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
Kevin in chapter 1 basically want to kill her on sight
they tone it down way too hard compare to what Kevin describe about her in chapter 1
she wanted to make herself into the villian and let the FC kill her <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
Dorothy is everything that Elysia should have been with all the hints of ER chapter 1
twisted, racist, manipulative <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>

can you watch stream rn, i think a stream is enough, there is not much to take note, i just do full auto and it work <@309634550273933314> <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
bullet per frame is important the most for her
she is MG
it's due to her gun
<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
if your phone is not cracked
30 fps Modernia is half dps of 60 fps Modernia
it's moreso fps different
i will try to see if full auto work or not
i think it's the same dps on mobile and PC but my ref will be using PC client so don't know if it work or not  <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
have you try PC client yet tet

good luck <:ok:1088133019455467560>
just hide then keep dpsing after
it's bombing
basically if you see his mouth start blinking red lights
boss deal more damage when lil bros are still on field
kill all the lil bros too
and Liter + Helm can make sure your team will survive
just get used to hide the boss bombing
cycle between Mod and Helm
yea sound good, no need to use Scarlet burst if you need to feel safe
Scarlet is just strong <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
always Scarlet
make sure to hide into the cover when the boss start bombing
no need healer

in gameplay channel, there are normal players try to teach beast player how to play the game
in lore channel, there are people that struggling to read try to teach others how to read
where is that massive ego coming from anw
i still can't get it<:shruge:1079371164159311982>

yea that one
pull Sumeru valk and can't even level it pass 20
did they do anything for new players dilemma yet ?
resources piling up is a huge deal
better just buy an account
tbh if i learn anything playing Genshin and Honkai is that, if you're not day 1 player<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
i would buy an account too if i ever play PGR, the lack of resources is the one can easily kill competitive vibe
<:limesip:906025798404821062>
AAA into BBB or AAA into B, B ,B ,B
and how you use it depend on the units combo
think of it like A, B and C buttons
describe this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
still in CBT, but look promising
try dealing more damage ? <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
someone in my guild just posted it
look promising
did you guys see the new RPG Perfect New World ? <:limesip:906025798404821062>

i just remember i haven't finished FE:Engage yet
like, if you ask me what is fun in turn base, fun should be the equals number of meaningful decisions divided by time
it's just doom to me
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
due to how their animations work
it does have x2 speed, but it felt like nothing change
- No balance between speed and strategy -> long-ass animations 
- Using the same answer on every moves -> basically hit x with y skill because it deal more damage 
- No meaningful decision to make -> Stuff like turn steal or sacrifice turn to save units
tbh HSR have none of the charming point of turn based genre <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
good fucking luck
but when you're trying to do story
it's cool when you only see it in youtube or short vids
long-ass ultimate also doesn't help
but that's like 90% content tho <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
only in story
you can't use auto when doing story
what kind of turn based prohibit player to turn on auto
HSR is already a failure to me no matter the context
then they proceed to do nothing
Genshin used to look fresh on its launch
<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
look like another Jenshin
ZZZ on the other hand
HSR have Honkai in it name, they will make more than 4 costumes per year this time
like way too big
Genshin is just too big atm
HSR literally haven't out yet and is already top all the charts <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
but Genshin ? Bleh <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
it's not even their first game, in Honkai they make sure an anni look like what anni supposed to be
<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
that is supposed to be in the music bundle
instead, we got a pair of wings
ingame item i mean
even a cake in Genshin 1st anni with  Thank you for 1 year  could have solved all the problem
why the fuck all the surprises have to be about music <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
we're gamer
but jfc
like, i get it, it's expensive to hire the bands and make good music
 Guys, you won't believe it but i got a surprise for us, we're going to listen to Opera 
Genshin out here be like
probably go around naked <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
really generous <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
but 4 is the best they can give
with how big the game is
Genshin should have like 20 costumes per year
and once in a while they give you a carrot and be like  here you go, we still care about you guys  <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
they know how to do the minimum while getting the max from it
if you look at it from outsider standpoint, Mihoyo is just a genius in making money
the revenue also skyrocket with that strat so <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
and 2 cycles after the debut
cause Abyss alone is definitely not enough with just 3 cycles per patch
it's a just place to showcase valk power
the direction of MA is kinda obvious from Mihoyo standpoint
<a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
99% playerbase don't know how dogshit it is to use HoT on Kosma
also using anything on Kosma that is not HC is just torture
get all rewards and forget about it till next week
or you do the bare minimum
either you do it seriously
it's a side quest
in MA there is never such thing as budget option tho
try using anything on Hepha that is not HoH = no point in doing it <:ok:1088133019455467560>
every single boss after 5.5 is just that
we already have 10 of those
it's PE or die
when SSS Otto first show up
no one will think that way anymore
by the time the 2nd bleed dps show up
you only feel like the Big Jelly is hard because HN is the first bleed dps
it have been that way since 5.5 tho <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
they already achieve what they want with MA
so no point in adding another SSS boss
even Mihoyo don't take it seriously
MA rn is also only act as a way to show off a valk power
better just delete it
if a side quest become a burden
it's just a side quest
yea, even now in CN, no one treat MA as serious mode anw <:ok:1088133019455467560>
MA is like side quest
no one care about MA tho <:ok:1088133019455467560>
even in physical weather, 9S Trio can still sit on Myriad
if you're in Nirv, 6S/9S Trio dominate everything
if you're in RL, S0 Trio dominate everything
no i actually mean that every single boss are Trio's boss <:ok:1088133019455467560>
but every bosses are basically Trio bosses now anw except Shield Kallen
but she doesn't have boss designed for her outside of Trio
she is strong without Trio
i actually can't tell what the fuck that phrase supposed to mean
Trio replace PE on bosses that Trio can't even top score
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
cooking section is up
<a:cuakhetday:939810174070321202>
<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
for absolute no reason
Aponia rot is extremely tight on timing and debuff
on every single boss that belong to her
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
not really
she had a good run <:ok:1088133019455467560>
Raven won't cut it anymore
now temp is so much higher
even at 470D, HoF S0 barely manage to 1 rot tank last cycle
that won't be the case in current Nirv
HTR alone give better buff and rot than Aslaug + weak point
yea Raven just slow down the run too much
wait 1 more day, only whale runs right now <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
Korath
yea the above one
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
can probably go up to 750
looking like affixes issue
stuck at 744
they all use HTR + CN
i actually can't find any refs using Raven tho <a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
with HTR and CN
is fire tank still tanky tho
hella tanky too
Jizo will be tanky 1 last time tho
Benares <a:modcheck:870823155344756746>

Oh wait
Go with HoT FR GD
What is this week MA
Depend on rot
But also not always the case
Performance wise about the same, generally i prefer Turg on non-IMG bosses and Handel on IMG bosses
With HFI just got 20% extra fire dmg
Img Tree shouldn’t be too bad this time for S0 Trio
BKE should also be fun, first time we use HTR on her
<a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
Wish i could be that good at the game
Kyoshiro’s rot is actually beast mode
Unless you’re a beast <:ok:1088133019455467560>
Neeko will randomly deal 10k per combat
You can itemize Neeko in case you lack damage
6 SG are just busted
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Items are fake on Kaisa too, only need Shiv + frontline
Lv 8 board with Kaisa 2* is better than Lv 7 board with Kaisa 3*
Kaisa 3* is a bait
The key to force Kaisa is that
Actually a degen
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Cause seeing Kaisa 2 on 3-2 can tilt you to heaven
This patch is fine but you need strong mental
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
7th is already a win
so that game was so 8th
the entire lobby playing AP and they all hit TF + Neeko on 7
i spent 80G for Kaisa 2

Maincord is cooking
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
Then you find refs to see the tech
Keep polishing your runs until you think it’s good enough
If you still make mistake using normal rots then there is no point in searching for refs
Refs are good but you need to know what you’re doing first
Keep question after every runs if there were any mistakes
Before you compete with other players, you need to compete with yourself first <:ok:1088133019455467560>
You know sth is wrong <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
When 9S Trio can step in Type Husk Myriad in CN main server
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>

9S Trio are literally sneak in every Myriad leaderboard
They’re not even just bruteforcing
Save 1 year and cash out
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
I would tell myself in 5.5 to save

PC client is also struggling
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
There are still a lot of bugs and unpolished things
Don’t think so
The game will probably need at least 6 more months to polish tho
Yea there is no voice yet
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
HoS 2.0 - 90% 
DK for HoS - 10%
The chance that it exist is like 10%
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
It could be anything, a vessel for her or something she forges in the next chapter
DK for HoS
There is actually a chance that it exist
Even if the chance is so slim
the latter part
But it’s there tho
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
Nice copium
671 with S0 Trio, that’s broken <:pepe2:368744338445828106>

I need a Seele account if anyone want to do it for me
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>

<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>

<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
There is actually a lack of Hare’s vids on bilibili
time to reach EX <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
even challenger players struggle with it
till this day strongest board is still the hardest thing to learn
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
in each breakpoint of the game
outside of that and you will have to learn strongest board
yea those are straight forward comp, pretty much new player friendly
took a while to fix it <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
kinda affect my gameplay
there was a time i was too depend on it tho
i  learn the meta way faster using the site, stats don't lie <:KyaruNerd:608064143773139000>
but getting used to it and it's a wrap
was a bit slow when i start using it <:ok:1088133019455467560>
i don't even know if tactic tool have app or not, i just open the site when im in game
for stats, tactic tool is better
i only use it for load dice odds
now combo are mostly fake
but they change how JG IE work
item combo used to be the case in previous set <:ok:1088133019455467560>
combo is fake
you don't
using this give you a better view on which items are good and which are decent
when you're familiar with the game and comp you can try using tactic.tool
it's more about item economy than BiS
when you can make GS +1
like, AD carry also want Deathblade but the item need 2 swords
yea cause Dcap take up 2 rods
same go with IE
it's only worth if you need to kill the glove
like, Dcap is just straight up better than JG
you need 165% AP/165 AD on AP/AD units for JG/IE to give the same value with pure AP/AD items
it sound good but it's terrible
oh JG/IE is a bait most of the time
the other 2 can be any AD item combinations
they only need Last Whisper
it's the same with Samira or AD carry
the item literally determine your placement
if you already have Shiv the rest don't matter
it's just Shiv + 2
you still build Shiv on Kaisa
even if you already have Spark
Shiv on Kaisa is like mandatory <:ok:1088133019455467560>
for no reason
yea, people are also obsessed with Guinsoo Kaisa in Challenger <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
1st and 2nd were Kaisa 3 and Kaisa 2
my last game were Laser too
not full degen yet <:ok:1088133019455467560>
8/20 Kaisa
this patch so far is the most balanced set 8 and 8.5 ever been
Regional will be held in May 13-14 and using 13.8
mecha cup is on day 3 and 4
yea it's all set after today and tmr
13.9 to 13.11
it's for fun patch time
when 13.9 hit
this is the last serious patch tho
June 14th
chill
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
she is about to be white as fuck <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
6.7 : Kira
6.8 : AT
6.9 : WS
7.0 : Farmable Hua
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
they already have 2 bait worthy S-rank after Kira anw
replacing RC or baiting people with another niche dps
more like, what is the best course of action that bring them more revenue
Bastet is not even good
they can replace RC easily
i never think that <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
RC and GD are basically staying in meta way too long for Honkai 2023 standard
like 80% ice 20% lightning
could still be tho <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
Sherlock Holmes is back
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
unless it's maincord
i want Mickey in Fontaine <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
just add Biscuit to Genshin <:ok:1088133019455467560>
a youkai in Japanese folklore
isn't she a Nekomama something <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
feel bad for her <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
but Eula get the most hate from community due to her story
when you think about it, a lot of characters in Genshin are also W H <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
it's eyecandy for me
i like Eula tho, but only because of her appearance
but no one will like Eula because she is still W H <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Mihobo now is focus on side characters so eventually people will like Susannah and Hare, Kira also <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
but Eula is just W H <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
when in Honkai it's a character driven story
Susannah and Hare's problem are due to not enough built up
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
and Liyue already went through 2 calamity events
even the Qixing don't show up all of them yet
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
but in Genshin, 1 of the 7 strongest in Mondstadt didn't show up when Dvalin went on a rampage
there is a difference in the fundamental of Genshin and Honkai, in Honkai you can add  W H <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>  and get away with bubble universes
relax a little bit
that's kinda dark
how about your mom
this patch is literally the last patch gresham would have 9S team to contest T1
ofc he does <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
but they only able to retain due to luck
i mean sometime you can find people use non 4/4 valk in Nirv <:ok:1088133019455467560>
im sure no one with a brain use non 4/4 valk in Nirv <:ok:1088133019455467560>
full S0 with Dudu
i can do a quick one right now with my friend account <:ok:1088133019455467560>
NA probably 630 tho
full S0 can still 680 in SEA, stop crying Neko <:ok:1088133019455467560>
too little info tho, barely have anything to speculate on why Nani want to kill her own grandson  <:shruge:1079371164159311982>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
the fuck are you pinging on Saturday
<a:alert:960403776991264798>  ?
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
im actually a Kaisa degen
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
dude went 6th
actually a degen
secured a 4th while griefing the chosen one <:ok:1088133019455467560>
im omega grieve 1 guy in the lobby, forcing Kaisa when dude has Kaisa 2 on 3-1 <@148145559897636865> <:ok:1088133019455467560>
and attack speed is not needed on Gnar
other augments are better cause they can buff or sustain Pyke/Annie as such
cause you only buff Gnar, LB and Shen
it's actually turbo bad <:ok:1088133019455467560>
tier is cost
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
the rest don't matter, you slam items for tempo
most important items for duelist is Locket on Nilah and Last Whisper on Vayne
depend on your items but you always want 8 duelist, secure a top 4 and dip
is she funny too ? <a:uooh:964118021574623243>
B1 sub dps, looking like she deals a lot of damage, she used support gears  <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i still don't have Drake for the next raid <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
better pray to get Pepper or Rapunzel then <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
just slap Asol on every boards
Asol is a great flex
her play rate is 0.71 and her avg placement is 4.60, that's omega sad <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
enough to sustain
she works well with 4/4/4
yea she does <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
for level 10 skills, prior is still :
-Modernia skill 1 and 3
-Liter skill 1 and 3
-Scarlet skill 1
-Drake skill 1
70% she just die
she is still unstable without scoped weapon
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
then for now you can focus on upgrading all nikkes that will be used in EX first 
there are 5 bosses but you only need 2 teams 
Liter - Centi - Modernia - Scarlet - flex ( dps if need damage, Helm/Pepper/Rapunzel if need heal )
Liter - Guilty - Drake - Sugar - flex ( same as above )
Guilty can stay with low investment
Sugar can stop at 1/7/7
Centi can stop after skill 1 to level 7
The rest you can upgrade to full 7 and start working on 10
just put in Asol/Morgana if you lack backline units or Rammus if you lack frontline
like, if you're +1 and you don't know what to put
yea this is a new player's problem, you will get used to it eventually, great flex units are usually just Rammus/Asol/Morgana, Belveth is kinda a bad spot now <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
is it clear chapter 16 ?
for now, don't, do you remember the requirement to unlock EX ?
3 dpses Pilgrim and you only need 2 of them
it will depend on your choice, since you already have Modernia + Scarlet, i would say Harran lose her purpose
plat can't go back to gold and so on
every new tiers you can't demote back to the previous one
she needs omega investment
she is a hypercarry
stay away from Alice for now
Guilty only need 4/4/4
Centi doesn't need more than this, you can ignore Centi for the rest of the game
basically after reaching level 7 on all imporant skills, you can start working on other nikkes to prepare for EX level
due to all traits need vertical of 6/8
cursed crown in set 6 was like omega 8th
yea cursed crown is like omega busted cause this set have threat units
what about Drake <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Start working on others to lv 7 too, Centi skill 1 also want level 7
Unironically, Kaisa 2* > anything right now <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
You can fit everything you want
If your gameplan is Kaisa
Btw Crused Crown is also omega busted
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
Across all levels
But when you take cursed crown you need to make sure your board is at least stable
It depend on your gameplan
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
imagine wasting your resources when you can just pull it <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
just pull SS3 HoT
SSS LE is overrated
they use Beet B <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
can't use linked valk on same MA boss
god HN damage look balanced without SI
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
this guy is onto something
with scuffed supports back then
it also have 10% fire damage, kinda big if your HoF is S0
yea i get that feeling too, failed a lot of runs just by that alone  <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
watching a ref -> can't copy it -> shit bosses/valks/refs -> money issue
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
yea i just mean it's kinda hard to normal players to actually do it, but i guess it apply to almost every refs
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
it's airbone, ignite and consecutive attacks from teammates
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
i was gonna say skill issue but i guess it's actually hard for normal players with her QTE back then
the run is hard capped by cd
there is barely anything to fix also
i just do a quick run on Kevin, it's so much easier than last time but yea, on last rot you will feel the lack of damage without all S2 across the team <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
this is something else
it's not scum move, it's using game feature <:pepeevil:1081435942398742528>
you can pull 9S Trio and sit in Nirv until the temp go up to 550 <:ok:1088133019455467560>
having to play Lucian + TF on your board is omega grief
unless you have 2 spats
also im actually certain 7 infiniteam is a bait
put the spat on Garen and hope you can make it to 9
usually you only play it with infiniteam spat and only play 5
yea infiniteam is impossible to play if your goal is  hitting Ezreal on 8 
My sword is your shield is beyond broken <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<@148145559897636865>

yea it's Liberalio
Liberalio is 100% rehab tho
we already have her banner, thanks god <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
at least that's what they said
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
you can pick between 2 skins, her preview on stream using the battle armor
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>

so they give 3* Rei
it's 1 free and 3 more Rei
oh wait

<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
they give 3 Rei in anni

For fun
It’s avg 3.8 rn in Challenger
That one is a 100% pick
<@148145559897636865> btw if you happen to see the Yasuo carry augment
or else it's a pray
you hit gadgeteen heart/emblem/crest you win
yea the comp is straightforward
even without omnivamp
sending Gnar to backline is too good
you still want hackers on Gnar
tank items on Annis are extremely crucial btw
AD items on Gnar, AP items on LB/Nunu, tank items on Annie
AP and AD
you play both
RC living 10 patches are kinda long in Mihoyo new dictionary
logically 6.7 should be SP Ice Meele dps but knowing Mihoyo it's gonna be RC replacement <:ok:1088133019455467560>
it's mostly just Abyss players now <:ok:1088133019455467560>
:mihoyo:
i even forced Rino to watch my gameplay back then or else i will call him at 3 in the morning
im a beast at asking question <:ok:1088133019455467560>
that's why you're not a chad
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
but the 1 time you manage to keep hitting it's busted
80% the time that augment fucking blow tho
yea pandora box is kinda a gambling augment <:ok:1088133019455467560>
Garen is so busted for no reason
yea that's the highest cap SG board <:ok:1088133019455467560>

<:susannahD:1095901201586995210>
after like 100 hundred games
it can only be solved by keep playing
yea, and you also need to tailor your board for hero augments <:ok:1088133019455467560>
most of the time just play by your instinct tho
if you ever happen to not know which augments to pick
when you get to Master, you can start checking on stats <:ok:1088133019455467560>
and steadily climbing
but my favorite streamer playstyle is getting a 4th
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
i always start the game with 60 HP

Always itemize Kaisa first on both situations
If you find Syndra then replace Nilah/Neeko with Syndra
-Have SG emblem : 6-8 SG, SG emblem on MF 
-Don’t have SG emblem : 4 SG, frontline Garen + Rell + Ekko + Nilah, backline Kaisa MF Neeko Asol
There are 2 ways to play that team
If you don’t have SG emblem then it’s always Kaisa

<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
just like the hit game Jenshin Impact ?
no oxdd <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
but back in set 8, Kaisa was the coolest
yea Lucian is the new cool kid now
holding hand 5th, 7th and 8th
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
and suddenly after 3-5, 2 people contested it
no one contesting
there was 1 game back in set 8, i got Kaisa 2 on 2-5
<:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
cause Kaisa animation is fucking cool
since set 8 also
that's actually everywhere
4 tiles stun for fun
Garen is best tank in the game rn
but you want to have Garen on your board
Kaisa reroll is still good
and you win the game
you put SG emblem on MF
just vertical SG
this one is also beyond busted
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
balanced
and still 3.78
new patch
that trait is a menace
yea then but it's because of gadgeteen
LB goes back to the trash bin
yea hackers are beyond shit now in 13.8
i couldn't care less about any gamemode but ranked
yea the thrill is not there <:ok:1088133019455467560>
also Garen is kinda OP but not the point of too OP
it's all good
except for 8 SG being busted as hell
new patch is kinda lit <:ok:1088133019455467560>
that's me too

so not kicking the bucket anytime soon
but JST TM + Cez B can provide better results with malding
Marg TB + PPM and JST TM + Cez B are roughly the same iirc <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>

Marg is fine, just not full Marg, but usually JST provide better result <:ok:1088133019455467560>

Instead of scuffed af one

Reduce so much time on waiting
Like 45 cards in total for all the cheap one
At least all the cheap one
I always swipe for SP cards on release
I already commited to SP Kira and 190 pulls on AT
Definitely not me <:ok:1088133019455467560>
wasted 1 myriad cycle
should have commited since Bleed HoS
that's it
you lack damage
next patch schedule look like 2 steps from hell
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
The bio mech mobs one
Oh 1 bloodlust weather too

1 Bleed and 1 QUA
Either DXY or Kallen will be the representative for shieldbreak one
Jizo will probably not showing up
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Isn’t that omega bait
At SS+
They actually give Hare shit tons of coverage
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
But Type SK is looking like belong to SS+ Hare
And maybe S2 too
SSS MPE probably still win over S0 Hare tho
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
It’s just fucked lmao
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
It’s horse, flute and axe
It’s not even all 3 horses
My fucking god
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
Hare might actually steal it now
Now it’s 3 mobs before SK
Type SK got changed
It’s fucking over
Other than that it’s kinda a free run
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
So 6 out of 10 runs you will lift the 2 big guys on air
The 2 big dudes are lighter than the middle one
Also probably mob positions too
Or else reset
It’s lit
If you can put in elf ultimate before HoF 2nd ult
HoF only need to mald the elf sp
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
Should have added some stamps
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
that's all
Trio are strong
i mean they don't need to shill them
i admit Trio is strong but hoping they will still be meta when HoO ADV show up is kinda a  wish upon the stars  situation <:ok:1088133019455467560>
then it's S2 HFI > SS HoO > SS HFI
HFI alone solo the entrie dps threshold needed
there is no point in ranking HoO without that ADV
ofc not
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
then SSS HFI
then SS HFI
if right now you're at S0 HFI S2 HoO SS HTR then you would want S2 HFI first
why the fuck do you think about ranking up HoO now
Cleansing safeguard
you will need the Lee Sin augment for it<:OkaygeBusiness:900551897251979317>
but this one can still happen, not OP anymore but once in a while it can still happen : 
so 2 fucking Lee Sin just keep shielding to the end of time
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
so the other Lee Sin cleanse the mana locked away
but that augment give him the cleanse ability on his shield
when Lee Sin uses his abilities, he get mana locked
yea it's not a thing anymore, it was due to a bug
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
This one was the highlight of set 8
Oh keilo, watch this one
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
Next set will be best set of all time
This set is just a disaster of bugs and balancing
Not backrow target anymore
Should be the closet target now
Yea they fix it
Should be like 4 hours
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Zoomer reaction when they hear about FT and BB

Fragile is playing with 1 hand and he still beat all EU Myriad

Also last year DK was in 5.7 2nd half
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
Hare doesn’t need her competitors to have DK
I still think Hare will end up just like Aponia, lot of her bosses show up but no one use her on those bosses <:ok:1088133019455467560>
No one is cooking anything <:life:1001518241610485781>
Like there is nothing even change from last year
This schedule is exact like last year
Why do you guys keep overthinking anw
Ofc we won’t
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
If you skip both then you start praying
It’s basically jusy pick 1 or 2
HN is definitely a good investment if you decide to skip Hare
6S or 9S specifically
The only long term investment are Trio
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
<a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
don't think they will add a rope as new weapon or new stig

so im F2P now
i already did that in 5.0
and die in 6.6
playing 9S team for whole patch
Winstreaking is only worth if you manage to push a 10 streak
While the one who open and lose streaking can get perfect items and win out
Yea winstreaking most of the time punish you more than rewarding, you won’t be able to get the usable items on your carry and even if you get lucky you bleed out to a 4th
Kinda sad
There is no reward in doing that
90% of my games i don’t either
If you’re contested your HP will be too low before you hit Lucian 3
But the risk is also too high
Lucian is nut <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
then start learning
abuse the broken shit to Master at least
yea i don't think there is anything to learn below Masters either
tmr is new patch
gotta abuse hackers while you can
oh shit actually climbing <:ok:1088133019455467560>
ER was new back then
and it was 5.3
i almost throw up after 3 hours of malding on reptar's account back then
no you just spent so much time with it you become sick of it <:ok:1088133019455467560>
and then reptar got PE in 5.5 and he only used 10 minutes for ER
yea i remember i spent 4 hours on reptar's account to help him clear 130D with VB2 <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
oh right, i don't even remember anything about old ER point system <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
if they bring back old ER, HFI and HoO would still stomp it
ER back then was only hard for new players because the shill was so fucking bad and you have limited valks in pool
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
is there any difference between 140D and 2.75x ?
my bad <:ok:1088133019455467560>
ER rn even idiot can see the shills
if you're not a tryhard in ER you won't realize it
back then they let players have the illusion of choices
no there is a difference between  not trying to hide it  and  ER back then was more fun 
but the shill rn is the same as back then
they just don't try to hide it
since the start of ER
it have always been like that
you're understimating how big an elf damage could be
her damage is cracked
i only like bocchi's bocchers

Battle of century is coming
I already spot 2 SS2 HoH in my bracket
where it matter
it work in summoned weather
it doesn't matter if it work in ER or not
you're not getting it
as long as it's work in summoned weather
who care about ER tho <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
the summoned weather is literally the answer

yea i think best triple supports can get in Hepha is around 47.200
it's non existent <:ok:1088133019455467560>
imagine using HoT and your score still barely reach 520
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
it's actually what people without HoH have to go through on SSS Hepha

new physical elf should be in half a year from now
but if you can cope then i won't roll Dudu anymore unless from spending events
decent one
still an upgrade
but 3* Dudu is still an upgrade
if you want to replicate a ref using Dudu 4* then you can't
her buff is still huge
only if your aim is capscore

<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
like the other day someone in maincord trying so hard to justify why he still stuck in RL
everyone still think you need correct valks to retain Nirv
i still find it weird that even after Nirv change
gotta use what you can and hope it's enough
yea i don't think even back then all Nirv retainers have the correct answers for every cycles either <:ok:1088133019455467560>

is RL actually harder than Nirvana
why does it's always RL players that care most about meta anw
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
so those 2 imo are the least punished one <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
my friend use Purana + Zhenyi TB PPM on Aponia and managed to retain all Nirvana Husk also
or Ai-chan
the least punished one was Aponia <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
why stop at that
dude already has 3/4 HN
actually natural born comedian
the fuck <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
almost same score as HN <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
sound like a jerk
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
what did he do for both of that to happen ?
he seem like he doesn't know anything
is this dude even playing the game anymore ?
HN at SSS is actually so fucking strong man
yea i guess for a SP dps, her dps potential at SSS make people think it's the new standard <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
where is the money in doing that
actually delusional
people expect S0 Hare to outscore both SSS BKE and SSS MPE
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
one hell of a ride
holy fuck
and MPE before Griseo
she is IMG dps
PE is load of built-in crit rate because she is not physical dps
it's the norm for physical dps anw <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
nah
which is not even Hare's bosses to begin with
talking about how Hare lose to MPE on Shield Kallen and Type SK
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
what is better ? HoF S3 lead or CN SSS lead ?
can only find out next time HoF boss show up
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
basically even when the Herrscher mode end, overheating will not occur immediately, so taking advantage of that, adding another SEQ 3 follow with 2nd blackhole provide the best dps output
Nirvana bracket in general still have 2-3 spots for copers
it's just Myriad <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>

no heki you still don't <:ok:1088133019455467560>
second after Aladdin TB Paga M
maybe in 6.6 MEI TMB will be new BIS for MA Big Jelly

one hell of a boss
S0 Trio last time i checked on 6.5 Kevin feel way better than the 6.4 one
*6.5
yea and 20% fire damage buff in 6.6 make her S0 even better
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
at least HFI is alright at S0, it's the other 2 that need rank up
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
she is designed to be broken at S2
S0 Hare i mean
pulling Hare won't even guarantee you Myriad in 6.6
except for Summoned weather
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
While im sitting only on Scarlet
I watch some of the top players pov and they switch between Nikke like a beast
I also have skill issue too <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Nuh uh
Should be on new chapters released
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Take your time
Can only rely on maincord and their F2P strat
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Cause he has 4/4 valk on release
Do you guys also know that someone told fragile that he is not “ relevant to newbies “ anymore
He is right
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
the beast of maincord score lower than heki
<a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
@ gresham still 8 hours until Abyss close
that's broken
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
you only need 4 pulls and a dream
neko also pull dupe Aladdin ?
the most expensive SP patch
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
im about that much too
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
Damage report soldier ? <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
<a:aworryGaming:945537650146824242>
Yea i will go with HN and GC as my phys team all the way to 6.8/6.9
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
While HN has 5
Hare unique weather is only 1
Just skip Hare <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
If you have extra M or B after pulling 4/4 HN then all in on dupe Aladdin is not a bad strat
Just got unlucky
Lowkey was the right play
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Look like aka’s pulls
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
You mean the tech
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
nerf some and buff some
they did <:ok:1088133019455467560>
but they overtune all the broken shit
there are so many comps you can play
this patch is actually fun if not for hacker interaction
because her range is 4 tiles
she will target Jhin that is 4 tiles away
so if Leblanc ride it
but rn it's just closet backrow target
it was supposed to be the closet target to the one that ride the horse
also doesn't help that Pyke can stun half the map <:ok:1088133019455467560>
also hacker units get 40% omnivamp, the one ride the horse get 10% more
the one that ride on the horse
hacker units will target the closet backrow target
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
hacker interaction
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
this clip is the summary of this patch
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
so hope it turn out well
next patch in 19th will fixed most of the dumb shit
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
cause my nerves are about to burst
yea, im almost reach enlightment
current patch is the best patch in TFT history
just play TFT keilo <:ok:1088133019455467560>
not with that attitude
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
how about you learn how the world work <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
maybe can even +100
that bracket seem slack
trust
you can get better score wtih MPE lead <:ok:1088133019455467560>
which give zero damage boost
heki did 5 runs with zero crit and think it's cap at lower score than MPE lead <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
5 runs <:ICANT:921403877285306399>
the middle one spawn last
the left and right blobs spawn first
because it's spawn order <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
this is definitely better than SI's lead
why does heki use MPE lead
oh right i forgot to ask<:ok:1088133019455467560>
what did you use to get that 802 cherry ?
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
Dr MEI of Nikke
joking aside it's because they have Cecil on their side <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
cause the leader of Inherit carry their asses <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
wtf <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
once in a while
oh it's a limited time event
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
the cutoff is probably gonna be 810+ then
@ gresham SEA T100 is already 806 <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
no but it give Mordernia +30% dps <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
try playing Nikke on PC/laptop
if you still get stuck
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Helm is actually the 3rd best healer
Mary is mediorce
Emma is pvp healer, she need to be attacked to heal
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
You will need Harran in that map
Oh it’s the sniper map
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Not enough dps ?
What kind of stuck we are talking about ?
What is the BP requirement and your BP ?
Just play TFT
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
What kind of question is that
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
korath literally told people HN is a bait 3 days before 6.5
all the gaslighters in SEA now have 4/4 HN with small ranked or SS
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
you do 24 ER runs in 2 days ?
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
T100 will probably be 800
no regret
yea SEA went all in on HN
but PE will keep both Otto and HoD
trio will still come close on it tho
PE take back her bosses in 6.6
lil bro stop tripping
tripping lil bro ?
the fuck are you saying
even Hare has 1 special passive to steal IO weather
i still can't believe maincord are hoping IO will be back on meta in 2023 <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Shiro a while ago he went on a rant about how bad BKE is tho so maybe he will do rage pulls   <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
a prom is an event held once a year to remind you that you're still a virgin
these 2 gaslighters
but we will see
all i know is that shino and fragile are saying they will skip her
two ?
don't pull a JDR
i will have to stop your right there chief
Hare is literally Aponia 2.0
such an obivous bait dude <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>

i will ask Hieu Le if he want to do it
<@370438895965306882> seem like no one bother to do S0 Hare in beta anymore <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
so the leakers will have to lay low for a little bit, usually this happen because they're uploading new beta batch
they just DMCA the leakers again
also
<:clueless:973756617109676032>

yea, i always think Cosmic is a good weapon to max, the increase is not much but it will help you when you messed up the rot <:ok:1088133019455467560>
look like you need a lot of Torus <:ok:1088133019455467560>
better to screenshot your inventory rn
if that's the case it's always Torus <:ok:1088133019455467560>
like without it your account can't progress or some such
how badly do you need Torus ?
about HN <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
but i really hope it could be the 2nd Bakuman because it's the only tittle after Bakuman give off that feeling
yea i won't doubt on that, Tenmaku Cinema will be even more niche than Akane if it keep the academic feeling like chapter 1 but i hope it can follow Bakuman's footstep, the serious vibe mix with some shonen panels give a fresh experience for readers even when they're not that interest in the running theme  <:ok:1088133019455467560>

oh, it's not, i have used this name for almost 15 years <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
where do i watch the OP ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it will make no sense if it's not Akane, Shiranui already decided to give up on the role so 
yea i will wait for 1-3 chapters when this situation get sorted out but Akane will smurf on these kids for sure <:ok:1088133019455467560>

<@370438895965306882>
it's just 寂灭毕舍遮 for the Big Jelly boy but it will get mixed up a lot with other bosses due to the lack of samples
they will always mess things up
it's 2023 Disney
lmao
but i doubt it
if they make it true to the book
Secret Invasion look decent
think it's cozy or warm even
that's like 26° Celsius
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
should have just pulled the trigger
every patches are bait
it's the fact that each patch they use this same sentence <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>

everyone making fun of Gresham and his 4 alts pulling HC on release
probably Vill-V hate train
they're starting to cook sth
the chefs have gathered
Honkai they're not learning shit
genshin trial valks
it used to be way worse
yea but they learn
got 2 layers punished
but Genshin transfer usually think trial valks = <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i bet if new players just use their own valks it will definitely better than trial valks
worse than A-rank
no i mean as in the valks stats are all trash
QTE ? the hell is that
combo ? i can't, i just can't
and new player usually don't even know what the hell they're doing
kinda have a point tho, honkai trial valks are all trash
cooking section is going on
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
do you think you should leave a dps weapon at lv 50 ?
do you actually have to ask twice ?
if only she show up sooner <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>

<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
ain't no way <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
until i see it
i also refuse to believe a S0 valk can beat SS+ BKE
like MPE
yea but farming T2 is not a bad options
so maybe Hare will end up broken af
i misjudge HN's power when she is 2nd valk of new gen
now that i think about it, i have high hope for Hare <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>

<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
yea but then they shit on people for not having skills
instead of improving own skills
they just want to have a  good player  badge
i don't think these kind of players care about capscore <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
this guy trying so hard to sound smart
S <:omegalul:1030461063197626409> U L L I N K
cause dude didn't shut up last time QUA Tona show up
he has SS HC iirc
these zoomers trying so fucking hard to sound like boomer
it does not fucking matter
125sp ult <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
i don't want them to know i can't capscore with rank up valk
i always hide my account yea
i remember he keep showing his SSS collection in honkai help
yea i know this guys too, this is the guy that can't stop show off how rich he is <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
someone is attempt to cook again
it's about HN <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
across all rank
i help people to improve their fashion sense, some people look good with a rope on their neck but they didn't know it <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
but im sure 50% the time he mocks people tho
yea he is like 1 of the most active in honkai help i have seen that give real advices but the way he words make people think he is mocking them
fragile is also helpful in maincord until someone trying to sound smart <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
i have to open my folder to calm down <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
cause rn that valk is the 2nd stupid valk after Trio <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
oh i just mean when you answer their questions, don't use your situation to answer them, for example, if someone asked if they should pull HN or not, then you should reply with  how is your account looking  and not  she is shit outside of bleed 
you're doing great <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
when i visit my Griseo's folder
i have zero respect to anything when im pissed
that's the neat part
i don't care if you hate them or not, if someone ask genuine question, you answer with genuine attitude, if they try to be smart you can do your things <:ok:1088133019455467560>
im kinda pissed but it's not my business so i ignore it
griefing new players
you're trying way too hard in honkai help
just stay casual heki
don't try so hard
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
i don't thing you know what you're saying heki
then she will also struggle the same way BKE is rn
if S0 Hare damage only match SS0 BKE
S0 Hare match BKE at which rank
the problem is that
i mean it doesn't matter if ranked BKE die in high D or not
she only has 1
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
then  S0 Hare need to compete with ranked HN and ranked BKE
if 8S/9S HN can match 9S BKE
also isn't it kinda fucked up for Hare ?
in MA it's actual timestop
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
so we have another MPE but with actual timestop on dps phase
but she is SP and the power remain the same as S-rank
she should have been S-rank dps
like
isn't that kinda broken ?
but she is actually T2
she should have been T3 or 4 outside of her niche
Nyx are forced to use HB not gonna make it any better tho but still <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
match 9S BKE, beat Nyx on QUA, probably tie with FR
she is way stronger than she should be
her scores outside of bleed are actually better than i think it should be tho
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
feel this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>

Twin Tower ?
what is TT ?
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
when the proper support show up they take back their normal bosses
that's like the same as every dps
i mean she only take back her bosses tho
if she can't one shot the core GC will finish it
solve her damage problem
PE having a support with core executed is actually nice
when you have 4/4 overload gear
strongest single target carry at endgame
she will take back HoD and Otto with 6.6
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
there is actually a lot of demand for Alice rate up
Keep messing up sp farming for fun
<:Rinoooo:558188634247921664>
My fucking god, im so bad at the game
i mean you're using MPE in QUA stages so expect to do less damage than usual <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
it's normal, if you do a lot of rots it will eventually run out of sp
or any ranged
when the 2 big dudes show up use MPE to clear the stacks
that's why if you use HoS to deplete the stacks she will die
and HoS invicible can't last longer than that during her combo
no it's cause the DoT is 5 instances of damage per second
the final 2 QUA mobs i mean
once the barrier is down, the orbs dissapear
the boss put up 2 orbs to deal DoT damage
you only die because you don't clear it in time
then you shouldn't die tho
the 30 stacks barrier
no, the stacks
you just need to clear the stacks
i can probably get 650+ with HN if im a beast <:pepe2:368744338445828106>
bro the sp on HN is too fucking tight on this boss
np, someone trying to read Kaiji is a good news to me <:ok:1088133019455467560>
from P2 onward it's all on mangadex
only P1 have this issue
then switch to the other site for the rest of P1<:ok:1088133019455467560>
oh my bad, you can read chapter 1 to 38 in here
then the 2nd group show up and you can picture the rest <:ok:1088133019455467560>
the community did donate to them but they said it's not enough
the 1st group finished P1 and promised to keep translating Kaiji but then they ask for donations or else they won't do it anymore
yea this was during a conflict between 2 groups
there is only 1 site that still have it
oh if you want to read P1
so he is putting all his heart to give Kaiji a proper ending
yea Fukumoto said this will be his last work
4-5-6 is a chain arc but 4 is 94 chapters, 5 is 200 chapters, 6 is currently ongoing with 150 chapters
P3 is 131 sth
P2 is around 134 chapters iirc <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
each arc end is 1 season end
it divided into multiple arcs
probably gonna took me a week tho, im starting from P2 so that is around 600 chapters til the lastest one <:ok:1088133019455467560>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
the main dish is all about the battles
yea dw it's not a major thing
<:Gladge:876532158544642109>
and even better, he does not become a better human being, he is still pathetic as he was in chapter 1 but he tries his best to not dirty his heart 
like, the protag is not a godlike human from the beginning, he made mistakes, got betrayed, got sentenced but he keep struggling to get out of it, it's so charming when you can get behind it
yea that honestly not wrong but imo it is way more intense than Jojo ever be <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
i have never read any other works about gambling as charming as Fukumoto's work tho
Kaiji are a great works, but you probably need to like the theme of it, gambling
what a disaster <:ok:1088133019455467560>
my sister is a fan of romance isekai so she recommend me shit tons of it and 99% of it turn to trash
as long as it's not gonna become edgy im pretty much okay with all the Japanese novel about medieval period <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
i will try giving it another read when im done rereading Kaiji
i stop at when the bully got executed by dancing to death with flaming shoes
my sister bought the book and recommend it to me but haven't got into it yet, only read the first few chapters
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
is it about a noble girl that got bullied and got help from the ghost of a dead noble ?

Ranged FT <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
including buying the card
if you only want SS IO then you only need to buy 6.8 + 6.9 Paladin BP
S- when 1 vs 100
she is S when 1 vs 1
boss or mobs
yea Marian is the 2nd strongest pve Nikke <:ok:1088133019455467560>
Helm/Poli/Rupee or another dps is good too
the +1 can be any buffer
Liter - Guility - Drake - Sugar +1
you want to run full shotgun on Worm if possible
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
out of all 3 i pick Quency instead
Sin is a decent pvp pick
best Shotgun B2
crazy good actually
Guilty is good yea
relationship tierlist <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
April 27th iirc
hoping Dorothy or Crown in next batch
im waiting for the next batch leak to see if there is any Nikke that i want <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
yea you can reset those SR eventually if you have any 2* SSR
just take it slow
20 slots, 5 slots per tower
beyond that you have to use gem
yea they give you enough slots for all 4 tower
Raid + PvP
they won't, i have to open up more slot using gem now <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
but the Worm is more of shotgun boss
Harran is still good on the 3rd and 5th boss
once you get to EX there will be 5 bosses rotate everyday
even in EX
once you get to build Drake + Sugar stronger it become easy tho
yea it's 1 of the annoying boss <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
not you
if they upgrade the ignite mechanic on that boss
maybe
so a pass
but it need HTR
there should also be a HoT run too
but i like to use HoF <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
you only need avo TM on SPA, HoF rank does not matter, you can also replace HoF with LE
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Trio also take wolf from IO and SPA
it's HN boss
what a week <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
it's MPE - Trio and HoF
fun week though
even with HTR
HoT feel so bad to play with this temp
still HoH anw
<:bruhmogus:985005977667510382>
probably 10 to 20

so i have more hope on it
this new tittle give off the serious vibe but light comedy of Bakuman and Hikaru no Go
can't go wrong with that one on Jump
just go with the ecchi + comedy route
yea Shokugeki is an average work, it's the author 1st long serialization so the author want to play it safe <:ok:1088133019455467560>
this is actually his 2nd work, the 1st was Shokugeki no Soma, a food manga, it's a ecchi comedy tittle tho so im looking forward to the new one more

depend on my mood
i will change between GC and HN
i will also use GC dps in 6.6 alongside with HN with you epi, dw  <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
unless you know the tech
like, the only place left that is competitive is Myriad Board, which you shouldn't aim for it
GC dps is enough for Nirvana
i can guarantee you 1 thing
you skip both HN and Hare
a 1500$ one ? <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
are you trying to tilt me or sth ?
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
use GC dps through 6.6
just do as i said fucking idiot
if you're F2P
it's just does not matter who you pull
then pulling Hare is good, sure, but so does pulling for HN
you don't have BKE or TP
if, if, if, if
10 foca, 10 sp expa
TP DK HoS
that's a weird team
there is no 7TR on sight
she will be a better Aponia
who care if she is better than S0 BKE
it stay the same
so buff or nerf won't change her value at all
she is a summoned dps with only 1 unique weather and a mech physical dps that may or may not better than ranked BKE at S0
it won't change
same as before
last attempt to watch maincord cooking

so that people can't even use HoR
bettet yet, make her Bio
ice actually only lack Ice Meele dps
so like
but only her
RC is also meele
or her normal AA
only her charge is meele
cause i actualyl can't think of any niche that ice haven't cover left
if Shigure Kira is ice dps, my bet is that she is gonna be a Meele Ice dps <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
so she is SP
but they can't make her S-rank due to Hare and her patch after Trio
HN could have been an S-rank Bleed dps
rather than SP
you will see more niche shit than ever
they have cracked the code for next gen dps
they actually won't <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
CN value will be good once new Hua hit
<:echok:977515701961117706>
most normal Ely simp
7TR and SoE are DK, pulling them reward you with +10 atk, not just the weapon alone
if you keep pulling after that it's just a troll investment
for dps, you need to pull on relase or at worst 2 patches late
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
why are you aiming for a QUA dps that will be outclass in 3 patches ?

i don't know if im missing any critical info but my HN is not doing any damage in 2.75
that is about SS2 to SSS BKE score
previous cycle Myriad cutoff was 728
if her damage output match SS0 BKE
but on theory she should be fine
there is no Bleed HoS in beta
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
they're handle info they shouldn't care about
these guys are beyond saving anw
beyong saving
about who ? Heki ?
the vibe it give off remind me of Hikaru no Go and Bakuman with the Female Protag look like Kei Yonagi in Act Age, the references are also base on the real pillar of Modern Cinema, Mr.Akira Kurosawa  
<@148145559897636865> WSJ new weekly manga, the theme is  Movies/Cinema , first chapter pacing are nice and the execution is great, art is great like usual and no ecchi scene in chapter 1 so probably gonna be a serious one unlike Shokugeki no Soma :

Want to stream, i can check a quick one with your best run to see if there is anything to improve ?
If it crit less then it mean out of 10-20 tries, 1 try will go through
Try seeing if it crit less or anything
And somehow it work
I usually do that with BKE
Maybe the dmg will come through
Do 10 more runs and start praying <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Good luck <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>

finally finish my work, time to read Akane <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
5% crit dmg is actually big unless SSS TP belong to SSS MPE case
but yea if you want to increase some damage then the emblem is your last bet
that actually make no sense btw unless TP is not 100% meele
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
i think eli is just tilted off the earth that he can't see shit <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>

soon Nihilister will join Noah and Isabel <:FeelsSadMan:816800787137036360>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
the other 4 are strong no matter context
in pve Noah and Isabel are the mid one
even Noah is cracked in PvP
currently yea
<:Sadkek:1082116103817404516>
the other one is Rapi
3 of my Pilgrim mod and 2 of them was Isabel
could be worse

1 of AKA's attack marked as  not ranged nor meele  iirc
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
is she belong to AKA case
i don't see anyone using Beet M with her
is TP not meele ?
yea 3S MPE want full atk
and he went  HN ? 
i have used HN and GC too much that earlier i talked with Shino i said can you do faster animation with HN <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
if your dps is not HN then 99% of the time you'd want to use this one
this one, actually important for physical dps
it's from 1 of the trial
switch to the Cdmg
the cdmg one or the Nirvana one ?
which emblem are you using ?
idk how TP work
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
also is there any specific reason why you use HoS combo after ult ?
transition also slow
wasted like 3 points
your opener is also the slow one
rotation can be faster
what is your setup ?

Wtf

The whatver school that have Nine in it

Whether that scenes have voice or not
It’s basically RNG
Ocassionally they do
Yea event usually not have voices <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
Basically this
Griseo QTE -> Ult -> HoS ult -> Carole QTE -> Full charge -> Ult -> Swap to HoS -> Bonk until her ult wear out -> Farm sp with combo -> Griseo QTE
You don’t need one, just rotate until the boss die
<:worryFeet:887143086046720071>
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
That atk is A-rank HN
bigger player pool -> more slackers
so if i have to guess, it's due to avg score of whole Nirvana and SEA have too many slack players
or even more than NA
i don't think SEA have any less beast than NA
yea it's just so random
always have been
high damage, chain combo attack
HoS is actually a hard boss

weapon are not made for only 1 valk
cause we're playing Genshin Impact 3rd
RC best weapon now is HN's sig
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
yea it fell off
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
civil war is real
EU mocking EU
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
mind you
he is actually a beast Nirvana player
but im pretty sure it shouldn't
i didn't pay attention
did S0 PE actually lost to SSS MPE last Physical Otto ?
he is actually up to something
dude is cooking <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
what is the context <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
tip from beast player
too many dumb WHAT
wait the WHAT is not there anymore<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
search WHAT
it's on page 16
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
actually hilarious
if the weather is not physical then there is a chance a random HFI will show up in the bracket in CN server <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
cause they have to compete with Trio in mind
new gen valks are also busted for fun
it's just we're heading into future
i don't think they did SnS dirty, she was strong af for absolute no reason for previous gen  <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
not with that attitude
616 with S2 HoS
oh this one is better nini
i found this one 
HFI on Bleed Vill-V
i found a sick one tho
let me search for it
but no one in SEA Myriad use SnS or even BKE
that's a great question nini, i want to know it too
if you have 4/4 SnS
triple supports can score around SS2 BKE score on Jizo
i didn't ask Frann who that is but his discord name is JDR, NA Myriad if Frann didn't lie to me
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
everyone do it nowaday yo
don't think of it as cheating, it's a feature
you might get -0 on Maru
if you uncap FPS with ranked HoT
relax bud
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
who did Ash choose, Serena or Dawn
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
okay but i really want to know who is the mother of new Pokemon protag
what about trying to be the very best ?
and most of the time i don't even use HoH
it's only good if you want to push some MA score on some weeks
or solely TDM, TDT
it depend if AT stig having crit rate/crit dmg buff or not
and pretend i never got it in the 1st place
if i were able to do what i said, i'd salvage the extra B
most of the time tho i'd never advise anyone to try for dupe SP gears
not HoS using it
it's the stig that make it worth
but not dupe Aladdin MB
HoS might die
that's the neat part
having extra M or B
i'd say it's actually worth a try if you were in a situation like me
so using it actually buff HN even further
cause the M, B and 2 pc effect buff whole team and can stack
it's SOLELY for HN
it's extra bleed damage, unique multiplier that only HN can take advantage of it
the upgrade of Aladdin MB over Holmes is noticeable
but 1500$ is another story
it's actually that good
430 pulls for dupe Aladdin
it's 2800
yikes
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
missing a fucking 0
owo math 15 * 8088
im dumb
oh wait <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
barely 500 pulls
1500 = 15 * 100 = 15 * 8088 = 120000+ crystals
ain't no way someone take a loan to play gacha
wait what
and it would tilt me even harder
worst case scenario could be that it roll into T or B
and it roll into M piece
cause it's the only Aladdin stig i got
it's actually went pretty well <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
thanks god it still go well
the extra B sitting in the inventory itch me
i actually just can't help it<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
yea that is actually a max ranked valk
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
this is what painful look like
could be way worse
it's fine, could be worse <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
what's wrong ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it's Master
Need to wait 1 more week for the skin
<a:DAM:995214446601453589>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Only have to burden it for 6 months
If Wuthering Waves is lit maybe i can finally give up on Honkai
Already use up all of my saving crystals
Im F2P now too
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
Cause Hare will take it over
6.6 will probably have 1 cycle for her tho
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
IO is dead nini, she is just dead
<:clueless:1030024390190055445>
Surely i can still make Myriad with SS3 BKE
Surely SEA Myriad can’t recover in time to pull Hare anw
We die lit
Nah i won’t, i will stick with HN or GC dps through 6.6
:holup:
I keep getting double weapons in 10 pulls for fun <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Thanks god it’s M piece
I got like 10 copies of her weapon before getting the uprate stig
<:wot:998941267041996862>
I manage to push to 811
Aladdin MB upgrade over Holmes is noticeable wow <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Hitting that SS rank up
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Probably doable
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
Owo math 2800 * 4 + 9600
But getting HoH skin + 40 pulls might be tight
GC’s gears are basically free so it does not matter
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
40 frags
How many pulls will you have to put in ?
<:worryFeet:887143086046720071>
<@370438895965306882> <@416445660443967491> i gave in and pull dupe Aladdin M, took 60 <a:aware:965946296236122172>
<a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
lowkey kinda fast
only took 2 weeks
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
gottem
but you make it look like S2
cause now you can't demote off Master anymore
yea Casual = Master below
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
just like Honkai Impact
but horrible for competitive
i think it's cool for casual
<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
this Leblanc Tactics is not it
im about to explode
<:COCKBedge:939253294994436176>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
tell them their mom need it to walk
what is PB ?
actually praying for crit
dark times
i still remember when i had to use RC on fire bosses
it's called Reverist Calico
they already did
<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
i go with full crit dmg IO
maybe your S0 IO
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
so im asking Gresham + 1 more
fragile and shiro already said no but Rino said maybe
yea im running full atk but don't know if sp/s is needed, i just ask around
check their UID tag
most likely new player
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
<@370438895965306882> does HN need sp/s or sprdc ?
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
what happened with 1 patch valk
entire SEA pull HN
I will read the arc again later, might have a change of heart <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
I’d say Akane, the theme “ Lie “ fit with the current situation of Akane more than Ruby and if the movie become a hit with Akane as Ai, the father will start to make his move on Akane
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
I just think that i can’t cry unless i get physically hurt
Yea i haven’t cried from movies, novels, songs or anything similar yet
I do want to know what kind of stories will be able to make me cry
There is hardly anything for them to cook now
They’re not cooking
<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
2 sources of info
there are so many xdd
<:BatChest:1087075069139898528>

<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
this patch is not it
bro im actually cooking an 8th
can't even play Samira even though she is broken af
hacker bug is still there
it's lit
yea the patch is out
idk why Mihoyo is cooking but im cooking an 8th rn
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

<:clueless:1030024390190055445>
we die lit
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
no bitch out
i will stick with HN throughout 6.6
he is cooking sth
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
do this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
the only QUA dps we have rn is HC anw
capscore using FR is like the hardest thing to do
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
FR is so hard to play
problem with FR is that
or you don't have any QUA
she is alright if you don't want to play anything else
HN is just not a good QUA dps
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
this guy make HC look like SN
bro wtf are these scores on HC
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
there is no fragile in honkai help
fragile is there
at least in maincord
where heki and Callmerei are constantly giving wrong info
it's better than honkai help
<:nooooo:971478297185759272>
it's just out of nowhere
surely it's Scarlet
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
how about he spread his ass out instead
stop, dont Genshinize it
dude is like a leecher
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
the fuck is Tectone doing here ?
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i mean Nero in Nikke
Nero <:life:1001518241610485781>
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
what's the catch with that S2 IO huh
someone call you out buddy <@148145559897636865>
cause they can't stop talking about it
i just know they're an EU Nirvana
for an EU player
so much ego
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
isn't Nero a tyrant ?
And i inherit bad genes on both side
Yea im half Viet half Canadian <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
I don’t think the dude know English, have to communicate with him using Vietnamese
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
I just DM this guy and ask what he is he cooking 
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Cheaper price and kinda fast
I tried it last patch and it was pretty good
Reptar also swipe through a Mihoyo employee
Can’t you just purchase through a middle-man ?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I will get that 500 crys in 6.6
Do something about that stupid warning
Bro pls
that's like 0.5 valk different
i thought you have 3* Dudu
wtf
So more dps yes
But reduce CD
More buff ? No
Try downloading more damage
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
Only if it’s the trigger
Trying to gaslight me into skipping
Fucking liar
Shino also went for her
There are a lot more people pull for HN than i thought
<:clueless:1030024390190055445>
Surely i will hit
Remember to do coop and buy out the shop <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Time to ask Mihoyo what’s the formula
So the formula come out wrong
It mean the author only put in sample size up until 420D
The formula is probably wrong if that’s the case
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
The 53.9 is Nirv
RL is harder <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
And fhem’s ref were way faster than it should be in RL
It was back when KR RL and SEA Nirv had about the same temp
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Im only speaking from my experience so i could be wrong and maincord might be right tho
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Waiting for keilo to get me a tldr
I didn’t either
i'd rather kill myself than living while being this dumb
<@148145559897636865> <@416445660443967491>
465D RL = 465D Nirvana
im actually choking
lmao
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
Can’t copy homework from NA ig <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
Disney trying their best to kill Star War even further
even quitting
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
what is NA Nirv temp ?
Nero <:life:1001518241610485781>
they always leave 1-2 characters back each event
probably for rerun
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
B3 Elysion
let me find it
the girl on the left
D
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Any spinners ?
idk <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
normal enemies, live Lovers and Hermit <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
do you have APHO 2 monster location spawn map ? <@416445660443967491> <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
yea the latest Archon is Raiden
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
100% Raiden
they want to have cute/handsome characters with decent story around them
because the mass don't care about what that character capable of
they could have make Alhaitham heal the boss and his banner would still have high revenue
because people still pull for her cause they like her character
even in Genshin lowest income patch, the Dehya patch, it's still mile ahead of any other games want to be <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
most people only join the doompost Dehya ship for fun
they're the master of pleasing the mass
they made a dogshit kit but peolpe still pull for Dehya
and they succeed in doing it, wdym by posting this ? <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
only 1-2% want actual hard contents
but in reality, among the people think like that
also people playing Genshin tend to think  This game is too easy, i need something more difficult 
they're not going the niche route anymore
Genshin build their system to please the mass
you're competing with Genshin if you don't make an exact copy of Genshin <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
i just like reading in general
im not an  anime guy  either, my hobby is reading so even if the original is movie, animation, etc... i would prefer something to read instead
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
i don't watch anime so idk about it but i heard the design in anime is cooler
but i think that's about it for that manga
maybe a little hype when the teacher dude is on-screen
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
dw, it won't change
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Shiranui is like Harrison Ford while Akane is Robert De Niro
really, thank you <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
mediorce acting but on-screen charisma
she couldn't show the charisma that Shiranui has
i feel like the latest chapter show the weakness of Mengo's art
Teri simp when they see her bending her hip every scene :  <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>  is that new Teri suit 
unlike her counterpart in Kaguya
we all know she will win in the end
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
/jk
me when smashing chick
im so glad the Herrscher of 2022 is a cool valk and have long lifespan <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
better than Herrscher of The Year
good enough
1 year lifespan
she fullfil her purpose
she will always missing <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>  damage
at this point S0 PE is the same with S0 BKE
even with damage buff after transition phase
she doesn't have the damage to push the HP bar to executed threshold
cause half of the Heki will sleep
maybe 11th tho
if you're in a lobby with 19 Heki that have 13/13 Trio and you use 13/13 PE, you are 20th
got Biscuit from Standard Pull
<@309634550273933314>  <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
it's legit impossible
she just can't compete on Tree and Bull
it just doesn't matter how many upgrade PE have or will have
the only thing that PE can pierce in Physical Otto is my mental
and Type SK finally have an actual SP
no she enable PE to do Physical Otto
so it make thing easier
but she is IMG
not exactly an upgrade
SnS ?
compare to who ?
yea it's called Hare
isn't that kinda depressing ?
yea idk in which situation you have to choose between BKE and DA
what about SSS SnS
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
i'd ride along with you but her gameplay doesn't excite me
idk if i want to pull for Hare chief <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
owo math (30 * 280) + (280 * 160 )
it will ask you nicely to lock it
if it's your 1st copy
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
What’s on 6.7 ?
Currently yea
Holmes it is then
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I have an extra B for HoS so do i want to gamble on 1/4 odds for another Aladdin M ? <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
Start with the trigger
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Listen man, i think only Nirvana+ player should talk about meta
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
<a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
enough to do sth about it <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
do i want to gamble for an M piece ? <@370438895965306882>
i just realized i have a spare Aladdin B <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
idiots will comeback
wait until V2
not a single chance
there is not enough of it
i need more gambling manga translated
:Smoge:
then if you're free you can +2 or +3 or +5 to that Nirvana D
at which D that RL needed to match with Nirvana 420D
cool, i will give you a specific case too <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
so how much is the diffrence between RL and Nirvana
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
try downloading more damage then
can i download more fps ? <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
yea i think even SS2 could already do it
mine is SSS so i didn't need to aim for weakspot
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
even when HoF score lower i still prefer using her
not even Raven
i have never use bow dps on tank so not my field <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
what are you using ?
useless ego and pride won't get you anywhere
is to admit that you're bad
the first step to become a good player
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
but their score are always minus 100 to what it should be
people want to think  I can retain Nirvana anytime but i don't have the correct valk to do it 
that's for Myriad to worry about
even with sub optimal answer
what you need is the tenacity to aim for capscore
you don't need the correct answer for each boss
wtf are you even on rn
just use GC dps in 6.6
plus stunning art
the world that the author of Act Age see was unique
but imo it just couldn't
Oshi no Ko was trying to be Act Age
it's like Akane Banashi +
like so fucking good
act age was so good
cause the author health keep getting worse
my biggest regret rn is that i might never be able to see World Trigger ending
will the first episode cover all 12 chapters ?
even have a huge ass banner in the middle of Akihabara
they keep putting Ai in the PR poster
it's still hillarious that
and using real bibble during all the fights
but the world the author create is cool
kinda basic
god-made weapon going against 7 Demon Lords
can be a bit  gore 
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
oh btw <@148145559897636865>, this one is a good read too, using real bibble 
Fire CC is Dehya
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
for Ice maybe that can add Shiver
add new status
yea that could work
bring Scarlet to Honkai
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
unfortunately
we're not playing Genshin
so there won't be Freeze dps or Para dps
after the rework and the SP that were born to solve it
they can't touch Freeze or Para anymore
i have said it before but
W H <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
niche ice dps or a better RC
so Kira only have 2 options
JK is shieldbreak + hitcount
SSS JK deplete shield in 2 seconds
that's RC + JK
ice doesn't really have any niche spot left
meaning max pri Cosmic will save you more time
cause the more casual you are, the more you mess up
i still think Cosmic is good to upgrade even for normal players
you could use your face as a catalyst
i got 3/3 Collodi <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
It’s her S2, her S1 reduce the CD of S2
Only upgrade her skill 1 when you have spare mats
Centi too
Helm can stay at all 4
Then Liter skill 1 and 3 to 7
Your pior should be 4/4/4 all team members and then Modernia skill 1 and 3 to lv 7
For Liter it’s all of them <:wot:998941267041996862>
Her heal is global lifesteal for each
You only need to use Helm burst if you think your team is dying
That’s way below avg
What the
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Go with 1 B1, 1 B2 and 3 B3
She is the B3 healer
You have Helm or Pepper ?
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
It took me 80
Damage report ?
Any healer is fine
Rapunzel is just easy mode but you don’t need her
Once in a while they reduce the BP req for all chapters
wait fot the next campaign adjustment
Nihilister boss fight is hard
Even endgame players haven’t started the grind yet
Dw
If you have Shui MB
Unironically promote even
Same goes for Hare
In her weather she is just that strong
Yea A-rank should be enough for RL
It’s compensation <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
So i will have to do probably around 30-40 pulls on her expa
GC look like she want SS0 at least
It does matter for me cause i want the outfit <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
But that 10 pulls won’t count toward spending
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
10 login cards and 10 free pulls
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
owo math 1 + 1
yea it's called calculator
3 patches investment
lowkey they're shifting gear
slowly
raid stuff is different
this is for general pve
you need to do 80 pulls for Lite Da Wei card
750 = 100 + 650 = 100 + ( 90 * 8 )
depend on what you want
M I H <:omegalul:1030461063197626409> Y <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
yea they can't
so you need to buy 410 more
1390 token
where is the bot <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
owo 1170 + 120 + 100
1800 ?
no need to pull useless stuff
cool
so probably need 20 pulls from her expa
GC avg is about 40
so i need to do 50 pulls for CN outfit
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
500 = 100 + 400 = 100 + ( 90 * 5 )
it's better than her default
i don't even know if i can get CN skin without pulling useless stuff again
1
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
that's all
she is SnS but IMG
that's why they only give her 1 unique weather as an insurance
she is meant to be BKE replacement for Myriad
not anytime soon
for the free WE event, you will only have 1600 token, can't buy out the shop so be careful <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
dumbo <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
obviously
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
she might get 1 boss during 6.6
IO value now is low
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Heki ?
compete with who ?
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Monthly is broken
Monthly > anything
that's unncessary
why the fuck do you want BP over Monthly
forgot the name
and IO signature
probably Aslaug
and it will cost less than 10k to get it
it will be hard to get CN outfit in 6.6, there is only 1 thing i want in 6.6
6.0
obviously there will be spending event
does it even matter
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
you have too many wasted data, delete it and redownload
but i can't tell too soon
HN is somewhere between GC and S0 Hare
here is my guess for Kallen and DXY :
- Kallen : SSS Hare > SSS MPE > SSS SnS = SSS GC > ... > S0 Hare 

-DXY : SSS Hare > SSS BKE > SSS SnS > SSS GC = S0 Hare
Kallen T1 is probably gonna be SSS Hare tho
Grey Cunny <a:uooh:964118021574623243>
if it's DXY and Kallen, use GC dps
just put MEI stig on HoS
and you will still not lose trophies during Hare's weather
pulling HN will net you 300 trophies in 6.5 and maybe 100-200 trophies in 6.6
until 6.9
HN + GC is enough to survive both 6.5  + 6.6 and every cycles after that
money wise, you will not want to pull on Hare
here is the kick in tho
obviously
2nd best
Hare is 2nd best for Type SK too btw
they toned down her damage to some degree
just not a QUA dps
she is normal
and that's like 5 people across all Myriad board
only if you know how to play
FR and Nyx
-HN coverage : 
+Every bleed ( Vill-V, Bio horse, Whale, HoS, Mega Mob ) 
+3rd option in QUA
+4th option in normal physical

-Hare coverage : 
+Every bio/normal physical weather ( HoS, Jizo, DXY, Kallen ) 
+1 Blood cycle
+1 summoned cycle
only that
yea, just because HN is cheaper
in normal weather she will barely beat ranked BKE if she can even do it
Hare is strong but not as strong as i thought she would be
unique multiplier is too strong
it's the exact same with HN vs others in Bleed
that is as normal as it could be
9S BKE score around S0 Hare score
yea there is
in RL it doesn't matter
in Nirvana
probably the 4th or 5th best option
HN scores decently in Abyss's Aponia so that's not bad
to keep using SI
you will put MEI stig on HoS
yea if you stick with HN and skip Hare
but then again it's a game so as long as they have fun
their score are always minus 100 from what it should be
the problem with normal player is that
you don't need to 4/4 everything for Nirvana
Korath is talking about Nirvana
he is the only Myriad player that doesn't uncap FPS during Benares
i will probably just get +100 on Hare weather and give up on Myriad
summon another valk
<:BatChest:1087075069139898528>
wow that's so cool
so far i don't feel like playing her
i will probably skip Hare tho
only for HN alone
no
not as i do
do as i said
i only advise you guys to skip
im already S0
but S0 should be enough
only if i fail to get Myriad
and not RL pleb
heki your confidence make me think you're Shinofey
76
a little above average
80 pulls <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Cause you’re a racist so you learn it to know the slurs ?

even more
we will have one

CN revenue peak with AE
it's only colorful if you choose to believe it that way
and the score with that SSS AKA is S2 HoT score
that boss top score was HoT
2 years ago
it does not
so your point make no sense in the beginning
that is also not +100
if you use that whale shit in CN 2 years ago
that make no sense
that is still +100
if you use SSS AKA right now in NA/SEA/EU RL
that clip was using the most whale shit ever
fun strat was never allowed promotion
so people can use AKA on ice bosses anytime they want
SEA, NA, EU don't have 20 people that play the game in the same bracket everytime
im not trying to disrespect or anything but the only difference CN RL have is that CN have actualy player that play the game
you're acting like maincord
still use FT in Physical mech
people still use AKA in ice bosses
actual fun start still allow clear now as long as you know what you're doing
that's like saying  i want to be dumb but i also want to be smart 
RL is RL
even in CN RL
it haven't change a single bit
you can use any fun strat you want in RL
that is RL
<:KyaruThumbsUp:902604520125771857>
but i will give you a thumb up
i don't think anyone look at it
what pic
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
and if it's in RL then you can basically use anything
only work in RL anw
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
or i have to pull on her expa
can we S0 HN this week
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i will go with HN first and see if i want SSS HoS or not
HoS ADV is up right away ?
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
6.5 in 16 hours
3 stacks are important cause without it the evasion won't have bonus missiles
HTR weapon -> SEQ 4 -> Combo to get 3rd stack -> Transform -> Auto attack until 1st barrier wear out -> Evasion + combo and finish with ult when the 2nd barrier reach red bar
<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
kinda bored with Nyx anw
i will probably use HN for the rest of 6.5
for most people it will be either BKE/SnS or MPE anw
just 2 version
Bleed Whale is Susanah's boss yea
yea she still is
week 1 and 3 are piss easy
the one in 5.6 or 5.7
Bronie origin and Tericula's trace
+1 from Ai-chan event
there were 1 new captain event and 2 rerun
if you play this far then you're fine with it since 1.0
the game have been all about friendship power since the beginning
there are lot of things that can be done better in the story
im not against shitting on the story, im against weird excuses <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
but then it will be unfair for them
i mean yea they can put down all the stupid messages
and this is the game where every bubble can be connected
it's the mass that keep thinking Captainverse are non-canon when FR and Captain are being that can travel through bubble
in their own universe
every story are canon
canon or non-canon is also the weird part
they can just put down all the stupid messages
i guess half of it is
so is it the game fault ?
during 6.2 event, the game especially tell you to input a message to inspire others that you think will fit with the situation
is the CG all there is for a character
but blaming it on   captain make it cringe  and  they didn't make Kevin a CG  for what reason ?
you can be all negative you want
but why let it affect your view on something when they have never promise or show any sign of it in the beginning
sure it's fine to have it
 hope  and  expectation  is like the 2 things i can never understand
and not even the story
it's weird to me because it's you guys that make your impression become worse
especially when Ferryman start showing up
Captainverse have been hinting about main story and other story since dawn of time
that is weird take again
Ai-chan already told captain about the existence of other universe and that he will someday meet everyone again in a different form
in 6.2 final convo of captain and Ai-chan
there already is
i guess in general it's moreso you guys just hate the idea of self insert
is the weirdest take for me
so blaming it as  captain make Kevin's death become worse 
and so does everyone on Earth
you guys talk as if captains do any damage to Kevin
Lowkey
This schedule lowkey look fun

 Dude, you're in EU 
then the HC dude pull the ultimate card
shit heat up from there <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
but then another EU dude show up and said  HC is just bad, you're delusional 
the first few arguments were solid cause it's about the lack of Weapon so the HC dude was probably playing with bad players
someone said  HC is not even a bad valk, i play her without weapon + M piece and still rocking in RL  then the EU dude barge in and start the cooking section
if you were there when that convo happen, you would actually burst out laughing, it's a gold mine of shit takes <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>

<a:hifumihello:908580827103911977>
It’s so fun
These guys actually don’t know how hard it is to play MPE and FR on QUA bosses
That’s like 5 people across GLB Myriad
“ Anyone that know how to play FR “
Backreading it is even better lmao
This is so fucking fun man
Battle of the idiots
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Cause he was playing MPE too much
I even remember in 5.9, Shino almost took a break after week 4
My stomach really hurt from laughing
If a player that bad can even get pass 2000 trophies
Fucking clown server
Lmao that guy is 3000 trophies on EU
Definitely not include that guy
“ Anyone that can play MPE “ <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
These guys don’t know how much Shino complain using MPE on QUA bosses
Lmao this is just too fun
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
That’s broken
HN come in clutch to shut down HC bosses

I have never met a single MPE that can beat HC score

Just because they’re a Nirvana player in a non-competent server
Why does people feel the need to shit on others for enjoying the game
I actually don’t get it
<:yep:873281634542157826>

While uncap FPS
A whale in SEA has been saying that “ it’s a feature “ since like 2 years ago
I mean you just need to think of it as a feature
If you use Turg you need to pray really hard while uncap FPS
Tank have fucked up hitbox
Jst Cez is much better
that's me when i try to find my 2nd Avo M
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
the one you don't have
dw at least your face is funny looking
when they're already struggling to balance the meta
cause they have to think about Hero augments
this set is just so fucking toxic
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
balance at its peak
same shit, different champ
everyone will gambling for Samira
yea and next patch nothing will change
so instead of casino for TF like right now, next patch people will do the same but for Samira
basically, current meta revolve around 2 units : TF and MF, AP dominant patch in short and people have been complaining about it a lot cause it's just a casino to see who can get TF 2* first. So next patch they nerf TF and buff AD line to heaven, every single champs you put in AD board they buff all of it
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
oh i mean in TFT, i don't play League anymore
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
stop balancing dumb shit

But i don’t know if i like ( heavy spoiler ) the supernatural aspect being hinting too much recently, the reincarnation part is alright but the recent chapters hinting too much about super power and shit 
Yea Oshi no Ko is kinda pog too
With the reveal of Kaichi and Hikaru went <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165> on 1st day
I genuinely believe the author will let Akane eating  dust this time
Akane meet Hikaru again but this time she is Hikaru Arakawa
next week chapter will be <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>  again too

<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>

none of it matter for Issho
it also add so much depth to Issho too. Wealth, age, appearance
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
and then the reveal kick in he is the 2nd disciple of Issho

With 481D you 100% need S2 HFI to 1 rot P1
awkward damage
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
yea and without rank up HoC will have like 1/10 of HP bar after every rot on both phase
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>

popularity chart

<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
what is NA temp ?
like, anything less than 76 stacks and Kosma will recover QUA shield so you can't 1 rot it <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
to be able to 1 rot it
you also need to hit a lot with HoT
it's so fucking bad
like im pretty sure, 90% people settle with -5 on Kosma for HoT
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
while 9S HoT has to mald their lives out of it
effortlessly too
she tie with HoT on MA Kosma thanks to CN
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
and she will be cracked for Hua in the future
it's enough for now
i also have fun during 6.2 6.3 with 4/4 CN so
kinda long
for that investment to grow fruit
you will have to wait 1 whole year
it's just that
nah, i still think it's a good investment
she is waiting for her dps
CN value isn't really that great recently either
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
who even has full S0 Trio nowaday <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
i was thinking about ranked HoO and ranked HTR
as in full S0
im actually certain my mind in that convo didn't think about S0 Trio
rot change with every little damage output change
S0 Trio might beat SS0 DA but it won't neccesary be true that they can beat SS2 DA
SS0 DA to SS2 DA is a huge boost
i mean we're talking about SS2 DA, no ?
SS0 maybe
i doubt S0 Trio can win against SS2 DA tho <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
no more EU dist
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
478D now
SEA is back to the game
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
is that why people always say aim for the stars ?
Any star rail enjoyers ?
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
and then Ai ask  what is pregnant ? 
can you even imagine Ayaka's reaction when after the other siblings left and then 1 month later Mutsumi got pregnant
good enough
at least with the timeskip, there will be at least 10 SOL chapters before it back to combat theme
<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
yea when they get to combat arc i just like
their chemistry are just too good
but tbh, for Yozakura, what i like most are Taiyo and Mutsumi shared moments <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
but using the kid instead
i think the author will do a flashback about those 5 years later
like not even waiting
the couple smash as soon as other left the house
even better, the kid are 4 years 6 months old
yea, anything you want to cook ? <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
so does Akane
Blue Box next week chapter will be <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
on the other hand
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
let the author cook
or maybe we're not seeing the full picture yes
moreso tearjerking if you ask me
this one is kinda tame
but it need time for them to actually start trying
Ichinose is just a trigger
i mean the family problem root is deeper than that
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
once there is a distance, they refuse to communicate
my cousin said that he has been living and working in Japan for 3 years and he never say  Hi  to any of his neighbour
it's a Japanese thing
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
unless ?
at least it won't be as stupid as maincord
start cooking Tet
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
time to cook
<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
This <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
you know what also rock solid ?
i actually do a <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>  irl 15 minutes ago
i won't say anything cause it's actually sick
have fun, the new chapter is actually sick <a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Akane's chapter this week is sick
lol
Without her HTR in fire is as good as dead
CN i mean
Her sp regen is broken
make sure to use HoS ult first before using SnS tho <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
BKE is only a real valk with SS0
How about you enjoy offing yourself
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>

Heki is practicing the pulling strat
Mine already reach HCM
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<@82358863155703808> it’s coming
This is the only boss you can play like you’re in MA
That’s harsh
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Any spinners ?
The free for all boss
Next is Melee HoC
Aim for the stars
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
be careful to not become fps scum
as long as you only uncap FPS on Benares it's alright
you will get addicted
but don't abuse it <:pepe2:368744338445828106>
1) Window + R 
2) Type  Regedit  
3) HKEY Current user -> Software -> Mihoyo -> Honkai Impact 3rd 
4) Look for the file with this line of numbers 
5) Change 120 to whatever you want
what a shit boss
uncap fps on this boss
it's actually feel so much better
lol
i joined the dark side
alright thats' enough Honkai for today
this is the 1st boss that actually make you feel like uncap fps is the only way
and i already spot 90 people in Myriad uncap their fps
the only way for me to break 770 is uncap fps, rotation is already fixed for S0 HFI
have you play this shit boss yet ?
it's inevitable gresham
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
this boss bleed frame as if it's the only thing it can do
time for 772
it's time to upcap FPS
i give up
alright
Your face joke
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
this wallpaper is banger <:coolguy:1052958038883041352>

Sakura achieved
<a:LETSFUCKINGGO:1012872161763008602>
but the problem is that most people only learn it after skipping SnS debut supply
unironically right tho
and now there is like 10.000 noise in streamer's chat
7tv just add emote sound in their feature
lmao nini
frame bleed too much during transition phase
but i will have to uncap FPS for that score
nvm capscore is 772<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Fixed bar and fixed CD
This boss is just boring
For my setup i mean
But definitely not more than 770
Don’t know what the capscore is
I do 3 run and already got 760
Nothing much to do on Benares
I will tryhard on Meele HoC
This boss is boring
Kid playground
No one take Nirvana serious anymore
The only competitive place left for GLB and SEA is Myriad ranking
Nirv is a joke
Unless it’s KR or CN
Even in SEA
Nirv is a joke
That’s why you think NA is packed
Your account just lack everything
NA is ghost town
But still has hands
Not in the beast player zone yet
Frann has hands
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
HN was so obviously strong
Maybe this is the result of 1 whole patch that they couldn’t doompost
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
But now these guys are trying to cook sth
Yea usually it’s doompost and doompost
I haven’t seen this many cooking attempts in the past
6.6 beta is actually a gold mine
“ i doubt they will repeat the pattern that net them more revenue “

not what im gonna do
it's what i advise you guys to do
at this point i don't even know what is he trying to cook
this guy have been trying to cook something for more than 24 hours
we're cooking chef
and people actually trying to make sense out of it
someone asked why does a hacker T1 MA Tona with SK
check CN discussion
lmao keilo
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
does the term  summoned dps  actually that hard to understand
maincord have been cooking a lot

greatest question of the day
we're back to the game <:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
but now they're back
HN was so strong during 6.5 no one dare to doompost her
god i forgot how fun maincord is
<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
QUA boss is just QUA boss
there is no such thing as QUA boss specifically for an element
these guys talking as if they actually understand how Honkai work
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
<a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
but good luck finding S0 BKE in Nirvana
S0 vs S0, she win BKE anytime of the day
Hare right now is the same with Aponia case
she will still rocking QUA bosses until 6.9
no one even come close to Vill-V score
we do have 7TR info alongside with APonia
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
Vill-V is still rocking
without them the triple supports is such a joke
like, unless you're a beast at looking into future, you won't have 4/4 SnS and 4/4 JK on release
due to bad timing
and most people have to skip the dps on both teams
there is only 2 teams that have triple supports
but it leave a bad impression
i won't say it's wrong or anything
Support Impact 3rd <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
Hare is not important not because she is physical but because you have to play her at S0
dude is right for wrong reason
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
<:clueless:1057578631058169926>
competition need fairness
surely everyone will use S0 BKE to compete on Jizo and S0 MPE to compete on Kallen
so positive

when Prome is not even better than SI
if the value is tie to her dps then it's already better than using Prome
that's actually enough
in general
i don't read
what does she gain from extra bleed stacks btw ?
but SI is kinda important, no ?
HN can still use AT
maybe not HoS tho
no shieldbreak
im actually sure you can't
can you even run HN on Aponia
sound like someone need correction 💢 💢 💢
Do they believe everyone will use S0 BKE to compete ?
If they pull Hare they can steal BKE’s bosses
Why does people actually think
I still don’t understand it
Dude already reject the existence of BKE, TP and SnS

Most of the hate coming from the fact that their favorite games make less money than a “ female jiggling their asses “ game
So this situation is just that someone outside of the circle found it and want to use it to fuel hate toward Nikke
The artist actively post their work + AI work on twitter and occasionally updating the progress with AI
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
Nikke is still 1 of the most hate gacha in the industry
That’s some baseless rumor
The artist have been open about it since AI wasn’t a trend
They didn’t
Cause the AI is still incomplete
But there were still some shading and light problem so the main artist put it on hold for now
The promotion art during new year of Helm, Julia and Sugar were made by the AI
Their main artist train an AI to help with their art
at least Dorothy and Crown are gacha i guess <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>

that is not even close to Nirv numbers
it take him 5 tries at best per team
that fun you're thinking about is the same as when AG3 player can clear RL
you're as new as newborn baby
even for 9S
there is no fun in Nirvana
you can't
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
to have fun
he purposely demoting  to RL
he is a Nirv player
best way to play the game is to demote to RL
playing the game
Why are you doing round 6th
not with that attitude
for fun
i don't like reading webtoon that much cause their page size are thousand miles long

<:evil:1049317760984940574>
i remember i like Bakuman so much that when i heard it got licensed to the US, i work my ass of that summer even when it's my senior year in HS
yea it's due to the policy with the publisher of the manga, if you want to read it mangadex have it full iirc
oh i have all 20 physical volumes of it
time to reread Bakuman <:FeelsStrongMan:816797263811575819>
their struggles, their effort, how they handle relationship, all the major and minor events in their life show how much they have grown
yea i understand it too, i enjoy seeing the character maturing instead of being perfect human
<:FeelsStrongMan:816797263811575819>
the world they see, the effort they put in, it almost brought me to tear just from reading those 2 tittles
that's why when i read Bakuman and Punpun they left a stronger impression on me
<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
i enjoy both stuff like Slam Dunk and Kuroko Basket
my favorite genre is actually sport manga, both the serious one and the shonen one
yea Baby Steps is lit
some Isekai works i have read, the author didn't even bother to do any research on what they write
but Isekai fucking take the cake
like, i can compromise with a lot of  shonen  stuffs like sport manga in general <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
no depth, no effort, no soul
they're all trash
like maybe once in a while a good tittle will pop off but 99.99% the time
Isekai is so fucking bad but they keep writing more of it <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
cause they  introduce me to new genre of manga
yea these top 3 are unbeatable for me even if there will be better one in the future
sorry bud <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
1. Oyasumi Punpun
2. Bakuman 
3.Monster
yea that one is in my T10 all time favorites
what a great manga
this one remind me of Bakuman
but it have potential
only 3 chapters in tho so you can wait for a while before reading it
this one is a good title
<@148145559897636865> 
<a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
but mine is still nowhere to be found
they will call you if you put your real phone number in it

bro there is still no jaxdd
it doesn't put QUA valks on advantage
i still think Whale is a bad design
<:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
they just put QUA layer and label it as QUA boss
its design are meant for neutral
whale is not even a QUA boss to begin with
she only look cracked due to Bleed weather unique multiplier
not even QUA whale
Nothing more nothing less
Her purpose is only to top score Bleed weather
To begin with she is just doing okay as physical dps
She stole noting that have QUA in the weather name
but not in Nirv
she can probably do pretty well in RL
<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
she is not a QUA dps
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>

I still don’t have Drake
Actually cracked pull
Liter and Drake
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
Oh wtf
Let me see
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
bad players can get 3000+ trophies
that's why Nirv rn is a joke except for CN and KR <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
it happen like fairly often in SEA back in the day
Pretty accurate surface info  <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
less player damage, less items before Asol ( the final PVE round where you can get components, after that every PVE round will be full item ), the carry of that trait is a cracked carry that can execute units
but they actively change every mechanic in the game to make sure that trait being the most broken shit ever
the idea behind it is that you should be reward if you take the risk playing it
there is rn a trait that work like this  If you win you get x stacks, if you lose you get y stacks  and every 10 stacks you get access to a vault with extra rewards ( gold, components, items, special items, etc... )
it look that way but in reality it only add more unnecessary RNG into the game while still not fix the consistency of item drop
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
and 5.5 were a 2.5/10
like 5.0 were a 0.5/10 set
but because 5.0 were the worst set of all time
and it's not even because 5.5 were good
the only exception was 5.5
yea so far all of the midset are terrible in term of  changing 
<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
but their way of making midset is horrible
that's why midset is a good idea
that is the ideal way to play TFT but with a set being the same and people figuring out all the OP shits it will become boring for both players and viewers
ideally the skill part of TFT most of the time come from  adaptation 
midset is also good for competitive player too
is what going on in TFT Chally atm
it's so fucking fun when you got punished for being good at the game
midset is not really a problem, problems are more on their mindset tbh <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
I can already tell this midset will be a disaster for competitive community
TFT 8.5 is tmr for SEA <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>

<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
I don’t think heki should be allowed to play in general
Cause his weaken state barely enough for 1 rot of HoH
Ideally you want to deplete his shield with JK combo
Yea she can
Yea but with WoU power, boss wouldn’t even need to move and risking to face the gang
The Boss wish he could have WoU
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
WoU is literally can kill you without you even knowing his location or him knowing you
Also it’s almost impossible for the manga to continue to move forward without reverse powercreep
Rohan is like the coolest non Jojo

<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
you have to do 3 SEQ 4 of AE to make it happen
it's not even remotely possible to fill AKA ignite bar without CN
even if you have Sirin
SPA couldn't even fill ignite bar of AKA
literally every fire dps does
SpA also got bodied by ignite
she is not even close to HoF dps territory
SpA barely hold onto her own weather
HoF make Fire look like a good element
HoF got bodied by who <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
what is NA Myriad cutoff on Wolf ?
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
we still don't know how temp work but my guess is that it's determined by the avg score across each division
it will be back to normal in 2-3 cycles
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
it actually happened quite often
for Nirv it's about the same
it's only in RL
Go for SSS
You need to aim higher
bosses that don't suck at high dist are those that don't have HP to begin with
all bosses suck at high dist
be a racist but still stop using wog ?
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>

<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
<:WHOLETHIMCOOK:1084875928934567976>
That is about S0 IO + S0 HTR and 3* Kiana

SEA T100 cutoff were 655

No way it work with our temp
I saw that one too but when i watch it
Temp don’t match so it will be hell to adjust
Fucking hitlag man
Bro HoO on wolf is so fucking tilting
can't find any that match our temp
S0 IO - SS HTR - PV can score ~720 - 730 <a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
sp funneling is too crucial for IO
yea PV is better
the increase in xtals are so bad you can ignore it

Pull yourself together nini
476D and 720 with SSS HoO, SS0 HTR
<:DK:840944972383780874>
I will stick with HoO for this cycle, look more fun than IO
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
Highest i have seen in SEA is 684
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
SS HoO can do close to 700
what is S0 IO score on wolf
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
your mom
like 20% ?
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
could have been 3* Kiana
he spent on S2 Mei instead of elf so it's expected
4/4 Kiana : 70 * 280 + 92 * 280 = 19.600 + 25.760 = 45.360
4/4 Mei : 38 * 280 = 10.920
S2 Mei : 50 * 280 = 14.000
Total : 45.360 + 10.920 + 14.000 = 70.280

what is NA Myriad cutoff ?
just in time for wolf
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>

<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
The what
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
there is a new player just joined our guild so i need to help him catching up
me too nini, i went in less than 30 minutes and forgot to improve the score last minute <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
but you only need to know the gist
it won't always happen like in the clip tho
you need to learn the trick to do it, let me pull the vid
2 if you do it forward
1 if you do it backward
fight start -> switch to HTR -> weapon -> dash forward -> transform ( using elf as soon as the HP bar show up )
basically if you do weapon into transform, time slow will be exhausted
you need to end time slow from weapon active before transform
basically you can get 1 lucky run out of like every 5-10 tries
but it's rng
just a trick to get more damage after barrel
shino told me how to get 820+ but i forgot
lmao i forgot to do another run

The author after finishing his previous work, a romcom, want to write battle manga next but due to request from his fan, the editor that work with him ask him to write another romcom and being really persistent with it. In the end the author have to agree with him. Nagima started off as an ecchi romcom about school life but after 100 chapters where  he reach “ the point of can’t be axed “ the manga turn into a battle theme one with serious fight to death
Make me remember of Nagima and the story behind it
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>

:KkonaW:
but you're still not pass American test
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
not bad
QTE in -> weapon -> ult -> dip
they will just make HoS 2.0 be exactly like JK
basically HoS 2.0 will just be HoS with some extra buffs and zero gameplay
then there is no replacement
unless S0 Teri can replace SSS HoS
if i don't spend all the money during that i will get SSS HoS or else just 4/4 HN and dip <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
i want to get SSS HoS too but we will see, currently planning to do a quick visit to Japan hot spring for some relax nights during April
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
if i can even manage to save 1-2k every patch it's already a win
yea you go way below average

everyone and their moms having fun with this boss
SEA T100 currently is 785
cause all not slacking with HoT don't chill in RL

It’s Rakugo time
No more playtime
Yea it’s another tournament arc but it’s different compare to last time, last time was a PR event for amateur but this time it’s a selection between all the disciples in Arakawa school so Akane will have to face those strong Rakugoka in her generation
yea, next event the judge is Master Ikken Arakawa and Hikaru was taken in under his invitation, so even if she hold no grudge against Akane she will still have to beat Akane for her master , i also don't like the change of Kaisei but could be that before he only think Akane of a cute pet so i will hold off on disliking it too much and wait for the author to unfold more about him 
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
why does she look like a sex doll
so the gap will also be cancer too
this boss is also cooldown gated
yea should be around that <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
to see how does your bracket look
do your run first and ask again tmr
not even S2 HoO
there is less than 30% chance you can retain with HoO
i won't upgrade it
anything below that is kinda fuck in these kind of bosses
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
you forgot to ask if heki has 7TR and rank HoT or not
gresham, you forget important question
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
if you can't i will find another one
this one have high rank HoT tho

<@148145559897636865> i really looking forward to new Arc of Akane cause it's hinted a rematch between Akane and Hikaru , also the fact that Akane realized that it's not Kaisei that got way better in 1 year but it's Akane that got better to the point she now can see the gap between them clearly  <:pojj:1067071660081020938>

the best server
consider you're in EU
PV probably won't be that bad
just use HoO dps tho
last Lightning RPC, dist was 450
no one know
great question
Raven's bow was also kinda important yea
except for MA purpose
SnS need her weapon so fucking bad
it's stigmata that can be called budget
like, it's a must to have a valk weapon
i can't remember a valk that doesn't need their weapon except for HoS since 2020
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
and there are so many things around
life is too short
can't really blame new generation for getting bored too quickly
Himeko only become a character after her death
that is not wrong tho
and then complain that they dont' have enough man powers to fix every bugs in TFT
yea i still don't know why they feel the need to do it
basically they can't let the patch note being empty
change for the sake of changing
cause they didn't let you use your skill to solve anything
those one have been in the blacklist of competitive community for a long time
and components shower on Asol
1 orb on krugs
they reintroduced the worst feature
<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
it might not look like that
it just that from other POVs
i mean im still proud that i can reach T10 every set
so they can reset their mental
basically for TFT, after Regional, all the pros quit until midset
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
can't play TFT 6 hours a day
kinda scummy but yea
i always abuse this period every set
it's actually cause all the pro quit after Regional
also PBE don't have ranked so i can't play seriously
i just play cause i like to play
already reach T10 Chally
oh im already finished my goal
they just ruined the whole fucking set within 1 patch
3/22
this set is tilting me to the roof
the only thing that i will try is uninstall TFT
same energy

Womansplaining ?
What do you call when a woman “ mansplaining “ a man

Already out
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Top scoring MA Jizo = strongest physical dps
<@148145559897636865> maincord is rocking with predictions <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
That’s weird
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
First ult need to use it sooner
You wasted too much time on mobs
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
2 hours till Ichinose
Or 1 vs 1
Tesla M for mobbing but Mei M is generally better for boss
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
There are few wasted movements and some non-crit hits but at best it will be 600-650
I don’t think your setup is meant to score 650+
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I can’t see it happen
Why do you want to get 650+ ?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

You can figure how to get some bitches first

Let him cook
You mean
<:wot:998941267041996862>
When dude could just say “ she is not if you have MPE “
Yesterday someone asked “ Is Susanah needed “ and a random dude wrote a whole ass essay explain about her coverage
Speaking of maincord
can i dm you this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
i can give you another touch of malice <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
i only run it for fun so affixes are not meant for HTR dps <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
SS0 HTR 1402 atk ( 3x sp/s + 3x spr )
SS3 JK 1504 atk
SSS RC 1491 atk ( 3 atk lines + 3 spr )
I actually don’t know <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
2 <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Type weather buff is so bad yea
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
That will depend on temp, Bleed HoS have more leeway cause she is not Type HoS
You need to crit everything to deplete the shield
It’s not even SnS’s fault, it’s moreso S0 PE problem on this boss
She is coming
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Physical bosses in general are just reset until they die
This time it’s all on you, can’t really give out any advices other than “ keep resetting until they die faster “
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Only on expensive reroll
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
You can still retain on Wolf with HoT dps but yea, likely can’t make it to +100
With Kiana 3-4* she can 1 rot each phase of RPC on 498D
Yea still does
Except for Bleed Vill-V look like it’s all good
You need to crit every single thing
Physical and shieldbreak are also a bad combination
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
Save the hard part for last day
So was messing around with HTR dps
I just don’t like this boss
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
I will probably take anything that higher than 600 then
What is the capscore for S0 PE in NA ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Mine is S2
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
But that’s all to it, i will just do 1 run with PE tmr and call it
Can definitely 520+ with full atk affixes
I got 478 with HTR dps
I think 500 would make it to T100 in SEA
<:wot:998941267041996862>
The score rn hit all time low for Myriad
It’s tmr
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
TFT is tilting the shit out of me
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
it's just sad
both HoS and AE QTE were so bad for their gameplay
for spear combo
you can -0 with HoS QTE on
if you have S2 PE that is
i only use it on MA HoV
<:wot:998941267041996862>
heki pls don't advise people to turn on HoS QTE unless you know what you're talking about
That’s broken
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Good luck
can't really lack sp if you rotate like that <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that can't be right <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
What are the affixes on HoS
You lack sp while doing all 3 combo ?
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Like what do you do on her before starting normal rot with Griseo
What do you do on HoS ?
Like 600-650 probably
Basically bruteforcing it
There is no trick for it
Just rotate normal rot
You have 12/12 team
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Good at 2*
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>

<a:aworryGaming:945537650146824242>
4000 xtals saved
Kinda a relieve that Susanah is still a beast at S0
Unless it’s Aladdin MB then it does not matter if it’s Swords or Holmes on HoS
Literally 0 diff between SSwords vs Holmes
You’d be surprised by how little other physical stig set can buff Susanah compare to 35% TDM
that's it for now, all the upcoming characters and NPCs <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
only Sakura is gacha
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
Rosana but she will probably be NPC too
like Ade
but she will be NPC tho <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
just look at Soda
she is next

yea <a:aware:965946296236122172>
shit take forever to get 1 copy
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
or buying them through Union Raid
cause so far they're only niche Nikke
only whales care about them
that shit took forever
that's like throwing money out of window
ain't no way the 2nd Pilgrim is Rehab Nikke
hope they change it
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
Nihilister is Rehab nikke

and HoS not even using Aladdin
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
lmao, S0 Susanah score 700 on 492D
you can only use Kevin on certain stages
can't do anything

Nihislister is coming
She is coming
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

evade this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
i used to do Hepha with HoT on reptar's account for him and it's kinda evade hell <:peepoSitGamer:984923819619795034>
and their score keep getting worse each time they forget to do it
there are small details in MA refs that Abyss focused player will always miss it
what a cool name
it's Final Form Destiny
with FFD
yea still
but you look at their SSS MA score and you be like  interesting <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>  
like you know someone can do really well in Abyss
it's the same case i talked with you before
and you have to mald on SSS HoT for perfect execution
S0 HoH compare to SSS HoT is such a massive gap
like SSS Hepha for example
SSS bosses answer also have way bigger gap than SS bosses
Kosma + BKE : HC <a:modcheck:870823155344756746> 
IMG Bull + BKE : Trio <a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
current MA is more about  valks check <a:modcheck:870823155344756746>  
i think that part of SS MA fun was the fact that you can't always use easiest team on X boss everytime they show up
yea it's definitely not the best way possible to handle  upgrading MA 
i still don't care about MA even if it's SS or SSS, i only enjoy Abyss but i understand both side of players, those that prefer SS MA and those that prefer SSS MA
there were 2 paths for them to pick, they just pick the SSS route, i don't know if it's for better worse but yearly revenue of Honkai is still in T10 of CN
for like 20% more stats on boss
yea i also think they could just buff 2S MA
they're obviously don't have plan for new gears or new stuff yes so they want to keep the end game at EX-zone
yea but it will come with the feeling of  repetitive 
and after 3 years we have to reach this point
new valk need to be stronger than old valk in damage output even by little
i still think it's inevitable that MA become the way it is now
you will gain more crystals that way instead of spouting worthless non-competitive shit
bro just get a job
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
the hilarious part is that those people are not even good in Abyss
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
whale for that crystals you miss every weeks
when there is nothing in this game is irrelevant if you decided to get a job instead of playing it all day
when people talk about MA value on valk and average players be like  MA is irrelevant 
it have always been never a good thing
and ask for a part time
when you can go to nearest Starbuck
spending 15 hours on Abyss gain you 100 extra crystals compare to RL
that is also same case with Abyss tho <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
if the valk after her is Ignite dps then she will also be skippable
obviously she is still a beast on her own weather but most veterans already have MPE and SnS/BKE built
imo i still don't think Susanah worth gearing
5.8
yea last Jizo was on Griseo debut patch
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
so does 50D nini
last Jizo was 449D and 9S BKE score like ~800 sth with SI
it's 500D
yea <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
596 on Jizo is actually kinda high, what
i will send him a rope real quick
if i know which fucker at Mihoyo design HoR trial
ignore everything when you use normal team
and you also not supposed to care about it either
yes, but that is only for 1 element team <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
don't wait for shield or anything, just rotate normally
for 1 element team you just ignore everything and play normally
you don't do that either
you deal more damage when the shield is down as long as you break the shield correctly
that's completely false
who told you this ?
i will try to see if i can 750+ tmr
im at 737, HFI is 1470 sth <:Sadge:838690139991048202>

<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
will probably give it another go tmr

i doubt nini even do her abyss yet
Heki, DP is also an MA valk
That setup can score -2 80% the time
That is not even a troll setup
That is 2019 score
That is so low i don’t know if i should think of that as an achievement
The fun you’re thinking and the fun that actual MA players think is different
EU Nirv should use RL standard
While NA have like 3-4, SEA have 4-4.5, EU have 1-2
On avg each KR Nirv lobby have like 7-8 beasts competing each other
KR is like the only server that have it outside of CN
What we need is bigger playerbase for the quality of each lobby to go back to old days
im not a SS MA player
why ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
make Abyss great again
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
time to merge SEA, NA and EU
we simply just don't have enough players
i don't think we will ever reach a point where T10 in lobby will be difficult to get
i laugh so fucking much when some EU player show his 3000 trophies as if it mean anything in EU
you can get ~80th in EU Myriad with 0/4 CN during 6.2 and 6.3
EU myriad is like kindergarten lmao

Akane actually went from <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>  to <a:aware:965946296236122172>
also what i like most about Karaku arc is that when Issho asked Akane  Can the (current) you be able to say his performance was good  and Akane stumble for a moment, she realized that even if it's her dad, she couldn't lie about it <a:aware:965946296236122172>
hope next week Akane bring back something good <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
so overall it's good
at least Yumeka now serve great purpose for the main couple to keep moving forward and the NPC got off-screen'd <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
W H <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
yea when Yumeka and the NPC dude start butting in the manga i was like
at least when the author let the characters solve the problem they all solve it in mature way and not dragging out
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
but that's probably what normal teenager act
i still think recent arcs of Blue Box make readers feel frustrated to read as a whole too
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
Taiki beating NPC dude
yea Blue Box this week feel more mature on solving the problem than Akane
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
Kaisei just want to make money
yea, Issho is a good antagonist because he has ambition and purpose
what about friendly competitive
yea i don't think it's necessary for Akane to have someone that look like is ready to break her neck <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<a:dkshake:877694929298657411>
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
Kaisei went full villian and he looks like he is ready to kill everyone that step in his way 
i am bother more by Akane this week
you will have high chance to retain with this boss
just use HoO team on it
not as awful as what happened to The Ichinose
Trials and errors
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
You need HoO to score 51 points to the shield
But for the shield to be lightning
And HoO will be 20 points
In a normal trio rot HFI damage will be 80 points
The shield have 100 points
Think it like this
That won’t work
but you need to figure it out on your own
it's not mald or anything
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
my score keep getting higher the more i adjust so im nowhere close to capscore
im clueless af rn
it's nirv temp
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
can definitely go higher but i don't know how
and my score suck
im innovating rn
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
i can't even find a ref i can use
don't think so
basically open with HTR -> combo -> HoO -> combo -> Elf -> HTR -> HFI
or you will have to adjust the rot
cause HFI damage is alwayas higher yea, so you need SS HoO for this boss
like, in 5 seconds, whichever damage type is highest he will change the shield to that type
you need to deal actual damage
but if HoO missing some atk then the shield will become fire again
cause you want to break the shield while it's lightning
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
you need to adjust the rotation to your stats
There is no RNG
Nothing <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
this boss is stupid
ain't no way
bro
that aside, where is his rewards <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
SpA was practically useless without SS anw, on Nirv at least
her circumstance is different with SpA
she will never comeback <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
no team score close to Trio on Kevin
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
that's impossible
they also nerf her TF now so it will be up in the air for now
only MA Jizo
Jizo ?
on physical weather she is just your average dps
which is her boss to begin with
she get back Bleed HoS
more like she can't
she doesn't steal any non-bleed boss
unless i somehow really like her suit
and maybe she can steal Bleed Whale from Susanah at high rank which i also won't go for
Seele will steal HC's bosses which i don't have HC to begin with
it's actually won't make a diff
most likely yea
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
my 6.5 depend on you
you still have my paypal ?
just pull 4/4 SS Susanah and take that easy placement
especially on the first 2 weeks
next easy Myriad will be Susanah
if you want easy Myriad always go for stuffs that people skip
that's just how thing is
except QUA whale where the boss is a sandbag i don't think anyone come close to HC on Abyss either
Some ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Not you
Cause im a beast, i will just bald on Susanah’s bosses <:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
Yea it’s just depend on your friend, i will go for DK too
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
How about i bleed you instead
Maybe 1-2 QUA bosses will show up too
Mostly bleed
1 is long run investment the other is quick and safe investment
Both options are fine to me
Just depend yea
DK help more in long run but if they don’t plan on pulling Susanah then MPE bow will getting more benefit next patch
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Already 3/3 stig ?
What is the rank on MPE ?
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
Mech Ranged dps
Will probably gonna be sth niche af tho
Probably
:essaying:
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
So an SP coming with her on same patch will be the dumbest thing possible
But the problem is that im 80% certain Hua will be ignite dps
Alvitr
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
So only Hua and Seele for now
Logically speaking Teri should appear in 6.6 but they will probably want to save the model for APHO 3
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
I’ll be heading to 6.5 with Gresham and Nini’s fund
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
Like 2100-2200
More than 2000
Avg 1700 per week without events and story <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Yea <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
Physical Otto is lowkey also a hard boss in Nirv
It’s Tona
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
Hard QUA bosses are Starscream and Kosma
Normal one is Crab
Easy one is Whale
The harder the bosses, the easier it is to retain <:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
So you have more chance to retain
Because most people will give up fighting him
Kevin is actually the boss to you want to go to Nirv
Yea that’s fine <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
How do you do that irl tho
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Swear on these nuts
<a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
PE is only a physical dps with SSS
she was what now ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:wot:998941267041996862>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
that is still up in the air, wait till next chapter
that's not bad
Symphony Kevin 478D <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
temp went down by 2 <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
based on the flashback in chapter 14 i think it's Kakeru's timeline where he didn't know what to do anymore so he commit group suicide with entire family but had a change of heart last minute when seeing Tsubasa dying <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
Minako might fucking sent the kid to heaven and burn the house in her timeline
in which each member of the family fuck up the situation to the point of no turning back
so i guess there were 7 timelines
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
she also said that the existence of the house does not make sense 
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
maybe she sent him to hell
it's like if you don't meet your current boyfriend you would be dating someone else <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
but because he didn't like Minako this timeline or even meet her so he like the current one
any askers ? <a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
because he didn't meet Minako on this timeline <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
wtf, what happened last timeline <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
I heard 1 of the crimes in her file was “ intended to harm black people “
By the time she was released i just dip
Also because she was caught doing some fuck up shit by the police here and went to jail for 3 years
<:DK:840944972383780874>
She thought i was actually a racist
And she even invited me to join from all of my racist jokes
A girl i used to be friend with is a member of KKK
Racist is bad, and bad is for black only
So she will still end up kinda crack in RL and our temp
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
But it’s for Nirvana temp, 495D
SS0 needed ofc
Fun fact : HTR dps score really well on Physical Otto
it mean Honkai is coming to Genshin soon
oh shit imagine they play canon in D in Fontaine
surely Kafka playing Canon in D mean something with Honkai 3rd <:clueless:973756617109676032>
ask your neighbour
it's like the world most beautiful melody
canon in D is literally used everywhere especially in important events
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

I prefer the kys one
Their battlesuit name is UA and HTF
As long as im alive i won’t allow 4 letters battlesuit name
You’re using HoFI instead of HFI
I don’t need to watch to know what’s wrong
Just do what the ref does but add another combo after using RC ult
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
This is so wrong on so many level

they're all Pilgrim yea

datamined info
Dorothy is Pilgrim yea but she is also B3, B3 AR
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
i just mean as the next Pilgrim
oh not that
she will be after Nihilister, either her or Crown
the 4th of Pioneer <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
Nayuta is after Nihilister
but they come later
Nayuta is B2, Crown is B1
Nihilister is B3 RL
it's rigged
80 pulls no Power
what the fuck man <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
you
only need another patch
kinda close
<:whip:1024122299034632272>
also why the fuck is your RC still SS
probably can score around 60 to 70 points
break this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
oh that's reptar, he is cosplaying me, i haven't done MA yet
150k is possible but will need Kazuha <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
what is your team ?

you can call the latter a killing joke
heki only make 2 jokes in entire life, the day heki was born and the day heki die
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
it's not even a question, just an order to do it
i like the absolute confidence in his words <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
<@148145559897636865> i found Kith's clone account

<a:aware:965946296236122172>
and look like they won't upload it
not yet
always learn to read
this is why reading skill is important guys <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
But 95% of players waste time using AE
Everyone can learn how to fast combo and fast ult AE in like 10 minutes
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
What if your prof call you
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
They call you and wish you a good day
He said the N-word without a black friend
He crossed the line once and now he went crazy
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
This guy straight up throwing away his streaming career
This one is definitely real
I love honkai a lot, it’s extremely fun and F2P friendly for #loreplayer like me and I never once felt any excessive anxiety and never gave in to FOMO and the spending event gives me massive amount of incentive to save up crystals for a big patch
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
it clicked
don't take it seriously
it's just an imo opinion
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
imo tho
tough question but yea if i have Kiana elf i'd definitely value HoF rank up
probably valk rank up
<:HUGERS:838692780171198464>
skip the next physical elf and stick with Dudu
as in
i won't even consider picking Dudu now unless you're 100% certain to go all the way to 4* tho
not even just decent
Kiana gather is actually giga broken
especially if you have Kiana + Ely
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Dudu value now is also low
<a:pugSit:1057825395145183262>
<:terimad:1066677583548260363>
so making Para dps will mess up 1/8 of the game
there are already bosses and rotations that revolve around Paralyze status
that won't work in Honkai
did you see them do this tho ? <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
which they already have the best candidate for
but they definitely can pull off Ignite dps
so they can't really do Para or Freeze dps
yea they're more like CC status while Ignite + Bleed are DoT
cause Bleed and Ignite work the same now
yea im like 80% certain it will be that way
even when she is playing with 1.45x multiplier she will have to compete directly with Trio
with 1 or 2 new ignite weathers
Ignite dps just mean she will be T1 on AKA and Benares
i mean i doubt she will be broken tho
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
they did it and now her new suit will come
i mean it doesn't really matter, they need an excuse for her new suit <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
and 6.6 will be adult Teri aka HoS 2.0
if she come with G4 Fire then 6.7
with G4 Fire
it's most likely gonna be 6.6 or 6.7 tho <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
or we can keep CN
would they go wild and release a new Ignite SP along with her ?
if Hua is ignite dps
real talk tho
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i used 2 on HoF and now 2 on HFI
i would put this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>  on MPE
MPE is not dead

the only point i care about is point blank
or the trigger
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
How about this factor <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
it's a desync problem between HTR and current lightning team so just delay HTR combo in mech form a lil bit and it's back to normal
im guessing you're talking about GD and HTR so it's actually due to TS being exhausted <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
1 more +100 for Nirvana <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>

out of all 50.000 characters in Genshin

im a believer now <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>

which i guess is 1 thing in Heki's wishlist ?
it's like pointing a glock at your head
yea i don't think any sane one that didn't start League back in 2009 would want to start League now <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
you are forced to study stats and using the most broken comp
but for climbing and winning purpose then it's the same state
like, more comps to play
the current one is way better than the previous set
but for high elo it's always fucking horrible no matter what, meta comp and weird RNG <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
joking aside the set is fun at low elo
horrible <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
LP gain went down the drain<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>

early artifacts are also scuffed one too
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
she is broken with C6R5
she doesn't need to be fixed
Dehya will be broken with Fontaine's theme
we will soon have elemental field Abyss
dw that's Fontaine's Abyss
ocean and rain work too
her best team rn is Dehya + water
actually Pyro ceiling
World Record <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
i quit some games too but i still stick around cause sometime people feel like to inform me new changes now and then and ask me to calc sth for them, they're all nice people so i just do it
no need to feel bad aster

woah, she punch Raiden in 10 seconds <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
reptar was legit couldn't do well on MA before
i think it's skill issue, reptar was 1 of them too <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
if you're serious about 1 thing then it's normal to have serious emotions toward it
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
i was like  how can you come to Nirvana with that level ? 
it's the same as me before when i saw people in RL coming to Nirvana with new change
nah it's fine
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
yea it's way different with 2s MA but there are still people who can't do well on SSS MA despite liking Abyss too
circle of life <:life:1001518241610485781>
old people go, new people come
some new players will enjoy SSS MA, it's inevitable
<:life:1001518241610485781>
people come and go
it's life
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
Look at the bigger picture
That’s minimal detail
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
Dehya look broken
The water
Pair with the best hydro applicator in the game
Dehya is broken <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
66.6% of your attempts is hitting that reset button
But he only has 3 openers and 2 of it fuck up your run so
It’s fun when Homu and the homies don’t troll
So you don’t troll her gather with HTR
But you still need to pay attetion to her position
It’s not that bad with Kiana
Reset the run
If their position got fucked or your elf trolled
When homie and bomber spawn
If he slide or fart -> lose 10-15 points
For opener
T and B piece have atk stats <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Only leave M piece at 1
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
like, even when S0 PE can't oneshot  the mob at the start she still cheat a lot of time compare to other options
and they're playing without x1.5 damage multi
because other options need high rank to make it work
but generally speaking it's always PE's boss
answer this question then it depend on temp and rank <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
the name is kinda wicked tho
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
Final Form Destiny, the new img gloves
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
can't wait to see what will they put on HoS 2.0
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
in a game where time is everything the idea of off-field applicator kinda fuck everything up
Mei needs to be able to pull out enough damage herself too to justify that 5 seconds on field
yea that's the same problem with JK vs HB <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
but when damage is not a problem anymore it just feel bad
it's justify to do that on Mei when Kiana is still S0
yea Mei's stig is not buffing Kiana enough and even then she still take too long on field to apply all the buffs <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
it's not final yet
yea they're still asking top players to test it iirc <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
Mei will just be an SP on that team
yea look like it
true <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
at least that what i see in beta vids
if you wait for the shield to break then Kevin will have a 10 seconds to dps without putting on another shield
im rank scamming
i have ranks tho, no need to <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
SEA <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
so it's around 200 points worth
on Nirvana temp you will have to wait for 3-4 shields <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
just need to use HTR to fill the ice bar first so it break later and HoT/HoF can do the job
timer appear and you just need to wait if you're not using Trio
i think atm no one know cause they didn't mention it in patch note, but Chinese player said that now you don't have to break the shield anymore
but i already saw 9S run using Raikiri
still no actual detail on it yet cause Chinese players are still figuring it out
i think they're changing so that mono element team can score a little bit better <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
how his shield work
and HoO look like she will end up with Raikiri on Kevin after 6.5
but they're also changing Kevin in 6.5 beta
she will probably still have to run her sig on Kevin and Symphony Benares
yea she run that setup on both IMG Bull and Flower <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
it's kinda fuck up for me <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
QTE -> Raikiri -> Ult
yea cause she waste time doing her thing while HFI alone is enough to solo damage at higher rank
it kinda ruin the impression on me so im still debating
oh i actually plan to 6S the team but if HFI has rank then i will have to put Turg/Aslaug/Ai-chan on HoO <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
so im trying to see if it's possible
shino gaslight me that cap is 740-742
739 <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
other 2 are SS
HFI is at S0 atm
i have IO but i just like Trio more
oh im using Trio
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
i resent you my paypal, you can send me anytime before Abyss close
because i genuinely want to ask who the fuck keep farting and sliding
rn i wish i could talk to Homu
i mean they all are but at least i can shit on them <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i need to keep all the idiots around so that i can shit on them when im doing Abyss and MA
for me 1 person block = 1 less to relieve my stress on them <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
yea im gonna slide into your bed tonight alright
thoughts ?
homu just slide 5 runs in a row
not you guys
im the one that should be blowing up here
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
guys calm down
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
especially Gresham and nini's money
i like spending money <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
it's Flower, Jizo and HoV
i need to keep my mental for MA this week <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
if i can't get more than 739 im out
i will do another 2 hours
sound like a plan <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
it's not appropriate
heki chill with the death threats
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
1 HP AGAIN
MOTHERFUCKER
last week you don't need HoS to T100
that is last week MA
if Homu slide one more time im gonna fucking kill myself
You 100% open with HTR
She is always the starter
You don’t
Just not the sp to use ult
You can still get smooth rotation without her weapon
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
It’s broken for uni and researcher
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<a:Explode:1025665382599630848> ? This yippe
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
Look like you’re ready for Prom night Tet
That’s 66k Bchips
SS HoT ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Use IO
Not that great
All 3 options share the same value
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
i invest 5 more atk on HFI and she can one shot Homie now
<@148145559897636865> my experience last night <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
yea cause this time everyone missing <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> atk/buff for the last Homie
but he doesn't want to kill himself
<@370438895965306882> <@385655541248163840>   Shino told me that cap score for S0 HFI/S2 HTR/SS0 HoO/4* Kiana is around 740-742 <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
Makima without the coat <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<@309634550273933314> finish all event missions to take the coat off Makima
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
Won’t let those Homie spawn out as fast as possible
They stop the timer way too much
I found the reason why Trio feel weak on this boss <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
But dude actually have full S2
And you think you have skill issue
Someone with full S Trio score 5-6 pts higher than you
You will see rank scamming a lot in Myriad too
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
Hepha = too much rank scam 
FGO = a menace
My least favorite MA boss is probably Hepha and FGO
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
MA week it is
This is the type of boss that you don’t want to mald for it
I know the answer for Homu
It clicked
<:feelsevilman:763645613823885324>
Starting today
Don’t let it be someone else dream, it can be you too
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
This event time gated is making me losing my mind <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Donkey Kong ?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
The avg for pulling card is 60-70
SSS HoO = Card + 300 frags 
Card : Free 
First 100 pulls : 100 frags 
200 pulls after : 80 frags 
=> Nini got 4 cards in 300 pulls, avg 75 pulls per card
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
You had to go full 300 for SSS Mei ?
3/4 PE in 1 multi <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I got one like that during PE’s pull
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
B
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
whale in the chat <:aware:1079349576449916991>
damn i kinda like using solo HFI, her ultimate is beautiful <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
cause Homu interrupt your action
on Homu it's that close
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
<@781539392039682058> this is what buff window on HFI look like for her solo team
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
do you know how hard it is to be a mod in big servers ?
they work night and day
the mod in WFP are all hard workers
yea they caught up with the trend
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
i baited keilo into responding to it and we both got warned
oh we don't
<:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
Until Removed <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
just restricted from sending link, images and gifs
i got into too many stuffs in maincord that now im grey forever <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
you guys should be like nini, if you grind ER like a true F2P you can get all you want <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
search link from keilo
it's the A1 reddit post
they are at the end of Week 6 now
2 more weeks
0.25 sec field time
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
but rot wise you always want GD
PV = Cerulean holder + Zhenyi is good
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
not Raven and AE anymore
SPA has CN and HTR, IO has HTR and GD
cause we have 2023 supports here now
lowkey it's not that bad <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
the easy one
extremely yea, every rank up matter in Nirv
nice cap, i saw your 776 last cycle <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
1D higher than SEA
479 <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
what <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
HoF it is then
you guys will sign up for a wild ride if you want to use solo HFI
HFI was killed by bomber in P2 when i use weapon + combo <@370438895965306882>  <@385655541248163840> <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
you need to do it as fast as possible
yes, the demo do it slowly
because in trial if you take your time and do it slowly her buffs always run out <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
time to bring out CN and HTR
yea it's mob bosses in general <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
this boss consistency on Trio is nut, literally 0 consistency <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
why don't you run this then <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
guys, be better, pull a Dehya mean you're building future for 100 kids <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
they just use all 5.0 revenue to open a school and name it Flamescion
yea but it's a solo project from them
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
6480 primos
best part is that all the donators donate from 64.8/648/6480 RMB to the project
dw they will reopen soon for another project <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
the project is already closed due to enough money from them
they donated 770.000$ to a school funding project
it's Genshin community in China yea
guys, a character is not just about numbers, do you know that Dehya trailer motivate peopole to be better ? <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
Ballon Escort is easily worst one <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
with her dumb commissions
Genshin make me feel like im working at a retail because i really want to beat up Ella Musk <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
so i spent 5 hours to get that 780 last minute
yesterday i was sitting at 778 at i saw Marble sitting above my head with 779
yea in Honkai it's more about challenging yourself <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
Ignite dps
i can already imagine what kind of suit new Hua will be
the best we have rn that can be considered hard is HoO
but now
Honkai was harder for sure during the Hua battlesuit era <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
sorry
not you
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
 bro, who asked for that ? 
i was like
yea when jstern came to me and asked me to check his plunging combo on Hu Tao <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
and no one care also
literally no one asked
but the problem is that those knowledge 90% the time don't matter <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
Genshin is harder if you include frame cutting and animation cancel
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
to optimize her combo
yea i spent like 2 months on Hu Tao
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
relax
bro you press the same amount with Genshin players
tons of buttons to press
i saw Honkai players gaslight Genshin players about how Honkai is hard
also i still don't get how Honkai can be considered hard to begin with, we're not in NS or PX or HF period anymore
the casual players are the one that can manage to demote to A1
you guys are actually above the average
trust me, even though i make fun of Tet most of the time
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
i have to go back and forth between workplace and home
that's some interesting place you're going back and forth to
you have to make it to A3 at least
if they get stuck in A1
also im pretty sure there is no way it's more crystals too
<:wot:998941267041996862>
Kindergarten ?
A1 is the beginning of what ?
remove the plug ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
they still make Soda
yea even when they have a good story and good groundwork for characters
yea i mean like how everyone impression on Nikke is that  you play for fanservice  
i just replied with  damn straight  <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
even if it's a negative comparison it still generate awareness toward worldwide
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
the biggest name rn in the world
tbh is it not a good thing for the game to be compared with Jenshin Impact ?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
haven't looked into others yet
cause you want to combo Evasion > Ult > Evasion
for Seele you want to prior Red > Crit > Evade damage > Ult damage
i think the prior is Red > Crit > Initial SP > Crit dmg/Atk/AA dmg
yea initial SP is cracked for boss fight <:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
completely not inspiring by other games of Mihoyo
unique lore
great gameplay
Star Rail is a unique game
yea that's kinda an insult
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
cause maybe atk > crit dmg with his red affix
yea that's what make it hard to compare
20% damage increase
from 10% to 50% crit chance
but crit is a must
i haven't done the math yet
maybe not crit dmg tho
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
crit + crit dmg > everything
decent investment
Makima can be used to cheese the Train and Power is solid dps for C team <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
<:hmmokay:1079360158595031071>
A team have to use on the final boss
it's my C team
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
<@309634550273933314> Power looking good
<:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>
that's kinda nut
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
theoretically yea
:hookge:
<a:hacker:998945514894671912>
<:HandsUp:816800032267304960>
it's a little small
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Anyway, Dudu is better if you don’t have Kiana
She just does what AE job was last cycle
In P2 you need to double group, HTR won’t change that
Lack elf as in ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
But they’re close
Can’t say for sure
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
But top score is between Trio and IO
Use your strongest team
I have been in this place before <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Yea <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:MiharaBoobaPat:1065951799363780718>
<:FEET_Sign:1039906915653800026>
you can have this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
last time i search i remember S0 Trio won but could be that i didn't look far enough <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
next will be Homu <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
get them <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:worryFeet:887143086046720071>
Let me check
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Also iirc in chapter 1
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
The new dad is also someone in the family or at least they know him before amnesia
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Kid in JP usually call every male adult as uncle
It might not be his sister
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
<a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
<@309634550273933314>
beat them
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
HTR is the executor
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
It’s not the sp pack balding i promise you, on Homu anything is true except the sp pack
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
That’s a terrible score
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
2 ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
ask <@82358863155703808>
even SS0 HoO barely make the cut playing perfectly
T100 cutoff is 743 <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
The what now ? :alert:
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
at least you can have a full glock
these mfs in SEA all uncapped their FPS to gain placement on Myriad <a:chemchetmemay:939810172958801981>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
maybe can still secure a 10th
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
your mental
yea just give me your card info and i will do it for you <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
they're cheap
just buy all the card bundles
wdym you literally can't <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
her ult damage still matter on Nirvana
just get it
joking aside it's not bad
that's broken, only if her ult deal damage
i don't remember SS0 Mei do anything for her solo team
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
in the police files
dw at least the glock will be under your name
pull first and think about the consequence later
why don't you do it then
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
there is no reason to not pull S2 HoO tho
so is she actually bad or the community is pulling a Kokomi again ?
<:lethimcook:1066061592644558929>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
no, QUA Starscream
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
this transition phase is actually way easier than Starscream transition
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
SEA is 476
where is the SSS HoO coming from miss F2P <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
your temp should be lower
no <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
you free to stream ?
i can watch it for a bit to see where did you miss some sp <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but that's for S2 HoO run
only turn on lightning when you lack a bit damage
yea no lightning
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<@309634550273933314>
oh btw DK buff are left left right
yea np <a:hoshinocozy:803928465144676382>
i will look more into it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
except you
no one does that
btw Tet, i can't find ref of S2 HoO with HTR Turg
you actually need to, it's to damage the core <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
my 778 one she barely get to 125
the run above was a slow one
yea, her sp will be extremely tight if you do it fast
if it's the balls then you need to parry with HFI and you need to dodge too yea
or the balls ?
parry the meteor ?
and he did all the setup for me too
idk neither, i just told my friend  Hey, can you get a good PC setup so that i can play game smoothly  <:wot:998941267041996862>
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
my laptop can't even play Honkai over 120 fps
potato run so only example for you <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<@385655541248163840> 
this laptop man
bro why does it take 30 minutes to finish uploading the vid <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
i only bring my old laptop with me
im on my laptop so uploading is slow
hold on <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
thought it were HoO weapon
oh then it does not matter yea
wait, whose weapon is that ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
you still don't have the weapon  ?
wait what
DOG ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
no reason not to
lemme try <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
HoO dps ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:ChloeComfy:737032043115839500>
it feel comfy
i will probably stick with this setup
S0 Kiana SS0 Mei SS0 HTR 4* Kiana
still S0 yea
time to find refs for Tet
more than 780 you will need to uncap FPS and can probably get around 784
cap is probably 780
<a:catJam:1076171671762894928>
The rhythm is better
Weapon first evade second
Bro relax, it’s not gonna turn into 5*
Yea like lil bro sitting through to see which 4* he get in Genshin is literally retard to me
Who the fuck are you looking for in all of the 3*
Bro just hit the skip button
The pulling stream is actually unbearable for me
Basically log in, pull on viewer account and start Just Chatting stream
Even big streamers in CN, they have to communicate with their community only thanks to sharing account from viewers
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Honkai’s stream you either have to focus on reading the story or malding Abyss and ignore all your viewers
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
The streamer doing dumb shit while giving life advice to viewers or sharing their experience
Yea, Genshin is better in that regard, Genshin stream most of the time is Just Chatting stream
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Honkai’s players won’t understand why did the streamer reset the run
I think problem is also that
Marisa already profit half the value of his account from his community
So it’s a smart strat to always be the 1st one to pull or do dumb shit
Yea if you manage to build up a community all investment coming back to you
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
How much they whale
Who is that
<:woggerswhale:653576160231424040>
Nini bet millions on Super Bowl
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Being heki is already horrible
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
She just need 19 more pulls
Tet got 1 copy in 1 pull
Poor soul, still believe in HoH investment
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
You can ask gresham to look for first
Im outside rn, i will look for it after i get home in 2-3 hours
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
It just sound like they’re ready to play the 2 people game
It’s not to the point of insulting
It’s passive aggressive
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
No other servers have the :alert: one
I need to rejoin KQM
:blowge:
do they think to themselves that  god, im so good at cheating, what a beast 
i don't get it either
like the time he keep roasting a dude from EU until the dude ran away from the convo
yea i know that fragile is extremely petty when competition is involved <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
and some EU players have the most biggest ego i ever met <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
it's still amaze me how bad competition in EU is
<:wot:998941267041996862>
dude couldn't clear side stage
it's not forget to snipe
oh
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
it's EU Nirv
About the rope ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
You can T100 Myriad with 0/4 CN before Trio
That server have close to 0 competition
Probably just EU server problem
Fragile is <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760> to quitting again
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
What’s wrong ?
MCU is just the new Law and Order, slowly you realize every good actors of this generation will participate in those movies at least once
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
Why does Hollywood directors never respect the source material
Yea it will sell or at least get around JL level but it’s just so fucking sad
Rip Flash Points
The movie look super mid too <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
I just saw The Flash movie trailer and why does Erze Miller is still in there <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
What is the normal one
What is the emote name
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
:dalao:
<a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
then what happened to my share of crystals ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
each round get 1 time discount
yea just the gear
Tet pov : <:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
yea just do the discount first
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
both are kinda important for HoO
any goal in particular ? like what are you saving crystals for ?
i want to get into 6.5 beta to test Susanah out too <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Gresham, you didn't participate in writing guide ?<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yea damage window on Trio is too chill <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
i will try to improve it again on Sunday
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
but it's only Friday
i think so, haven't seen anyone use SS HoO alone yet <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
bleed like 3 pts from there
my P1 is still not good
or maybe it's 775 <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i got frame freeze on execution animation of HTR
yea cap is 770  <:echyay:963509978340130908>
capscore for S0 HFI SS HoO SS HTR 4* Kiana is around 765 - 770 i think <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
because you guys are fake gay
cause it's a gay server
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Are there amateur-trans or semipro-trans
the cinematic will just be a goodbye to part 1
depend, the former is more likely, Kevin send off can't be fit in 1 cinematic and they already did it
oh, heki and aster are too young to know that song <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
How could i make a man out of you <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:Gladge:876532158544642109>
with my body condition it will be Christmas miracle if i can make it pass 60

i can't really get horny over pixels and 2.5D arts
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i have actually not horny a single time either even with all the nsfw arts eli posted
heki is a joke
heki doesn't make joke
<:Gladge:876532158544642109>

<@309634550273933314>  remember to do coop in Nikke <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
On her infographic it was written as Sushana iirc
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
There is 1 free skin
:critge:
Still haven’t received it
Im more concerning about my HoF figure <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
His most important one has always been MEI tho
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
It was touching when he talk with MEI <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<@385655541248163840>  Kevin send off last moment <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Nini i thought you go F2P
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Both
No 3280 bundle
3x 980, 3x 1980
Yea
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
After the whole Kiana and Ai-chan there were still 3 more battles before Kevin disappear
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
For whatever reason
People think Captains beat Kevin
That’s the problem tho
I thought so too until dude went everywhere and reply with stuffs he don’t know about
Even spreading misinfo
As long as it’s generate interactions within the community, they will do anything
I won’t say everything that dude said is invalid but that dude is the same as Affinity and Zeno
Dude is a joke of a human
And it’s not SEA, it was Taiwan
Dude was saying SEA income were the lowest 2 months ago
That guy is a joke tho
Then proceed to spread misinfo further
The only people that are angry are people that can’t play the chapter and only read text from it
Story went normally
It’s normal to feel like that if you only read my text
What Ai-chan did is prepare the equal state for the battle
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
The send off were the baseball battle between Kiana and Kevin
Kevin send off also doesn’t have anything to do with CN or captains too
If you ignore the captain part it’s still the same
That process happen through : 
-the story cast
-people on earth 
-captains in other bubbles
The same thing will still happen
They did not do anything
What they did was turning off the invincible state of him
The fight of Trio vs Kevin still happen after that
He didn’t get defeated by the power of captain
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
He did not tho
He was in unbeatable state before this happen
It was to reduce the power of Kevin, turn him into beatable state
Ai-chan tell Kiana to use the Authority of Finality to wake up people from the dream, and during that she also let Kiana see all the “ tweets “ that we wrote in 6.2
People were spreading some of the most misinfo of the century 6 hours ago
It’s retard in Twitter trying to lit the fire
<:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
If not the all strat fail and you just bruteforce through it
You need Kiana to deplete the bar within 1 weapon + 1 combo + 3 AAs
There is no alternative gear on Kiana
For MA Benares
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
wdym how do we have refs
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
just search CN refs <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
chapter 35 OST
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yea it does, it count as 300
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Mei know that it won't be forever
and it take some time to get it done
yea but this one is definitely only Kiana can do it
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
that who she is tho
if it's something others can do it Kiana will also do it
because only Kiana can do it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
probably having something to do to maintain the balance
it's definitely not her choice
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Mei is still waiting for Kiana to comeback
they still keep contact with her
no
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
she just can't comeback yet
she can still moving around and watch video that Bronya and Mei sent to her
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
she is not
<:gayge:1017439025742753802>
scissorge with Rita
back to her daily life
they already spoiled the whole ending
she is 100% not sealed
Kiana will only get stuck in other dimension or somewhere on the moon
only Kevin
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
heki gaslighting again
nice copium
but rn her S0 to S2 damage can't keep up anymore
her playstyle were design around  skipping mechanic 
this will actually happen more from now on, PE losing her advantage on her bosses <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
without Cez B on SnS, S0 PE advantage on Physical Otto is gone if she can't one shot the mobs
<@295285226446520320> ref for showcasege 
S0 PE at 486D score ~532+, she can't no longer one shot the mob without Cez B : 
9S HoR at 495D score 432 : 
:buffge:
and with rank up, HFI can solo the damage alone, Mei just need to buff
Mei's damage in Trio is literally like 25% at best at S0
yea, temp in CN went way too high and SnS can't no longer abuse Cez B so 9S HoR score a little bit better than S0 PE and about the same with S2 PE
Kiana without 3pc = trash
cause you want Turg TB Paga M on Mei
or at least S2 HFI
you don't use Trio on Otto unless 6S
heki speak english
IMG Tree -> HoO/Trio
Blood Homu -> Trio > IO
Ice Hov -> HoR
Symphony -> Trio > normal team
Otto -> PE > MPE > HoR > 9S Trio ( Paga M on Mei ) > 6S Trio 
Lightning RPC -> HoT > HoO 
Lightning wolf -> IO > HoO = SpA ( maybe ? )
Ranged Kalpas -> SW > HoH > HTR > Triple ice supports
still yea
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
DA is dead in you guys case
No reason not to do so
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Or 15
Yea i remember so
<a:hoshinocozy:803928465144676382>
That’s why i use my F2P fund for SS HoO and SS HTR
That’s why their S0 get beaten by S2 HoO
Too perfect
Like extremely fixed
Their rotation are fixed
I think Trio weakness lay on the fact that
Her ult
It’s due to 2 execution in her team
No other glory is better than the glory of surpassing the you of yesterday
I will post some ref for you in <#1069296932863877230>  and try to mimic it
Just do your best
S0 HoO < S0 Trio < S2 HoO < SS HoO < S2 HFI Trio < 6S Trio < 9S Trio
I got somewhat estimation on HoO vs Trio for IMG bosses
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
No retain
HTR 3/4 <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Yea should be
SS HoO should be better than S0 HFI
Everyone and their mom have HoO so like it’s elfs, HTR and skills that will determine it
What is Heki line up even look like for this boss
These bosses ? <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
lowkey im F2P+ too
<:DK:840944972383780874>
F2P gang rise up
It’s 20 * 2 + 20 * 2 + 50 = 130
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
You still need it for SSS, no ?
BP yes, topup event you have to wait til after V3
How about you explore this OW <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<a:awoo:1077997256403325089>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
SEA won't have EXPA select ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but it's not to the point of  wtf man 
yea i think it look too generic too tho
i think the MMC look like a clown but the FMC look fine <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i like the FMC <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
that cause you only familiar with casual sex
care about this instead <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
me too <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that badly need it
so like, it's good that Klein stay relevant for 1 valk
HoO also doesn't need it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
only for HoT
if you ignore the crit part
i mean, physical is the best element <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Seele is Physical
Yea they know
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Aponia and IO deal so much damage now
Her buff is massive on Lightning team
Yea
Kiana is the lightning elf
Next elf is physical keilo
The error is usually 2-3 pulls for big stuffs like stamps and elf frags
Yea pretty much
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
:spyge:
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
4 pulls for 1 frag
Oh wait 4 i mean
5
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I just remember reptar use Vietnamese and the stig were C T H
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Oh Kiana T <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
What is Kiana C ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>

Lv 32
I saw a Genshin player with S0 13/13 Trio and Paladin BP <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
It certainly work
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
PX
Use your best valk
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
in Honkai you pull valks 2 years ago then you also need to pull the trigger too
you can pull characters 2 years ago and it's still good investment
now that i think about it, Genshin is kinda nice
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
you just need to save
technically speaking C6 Hu Tao and C6 Eula is also F2P friendly
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
<:SarenPanic:665360850667831326>
almost choke midway when i pulled on Eula's banner
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
my C6 Hu Tao was also 6 Hu Tao in a row and i lost all 50/50 for Eula after
then yea it's just not pulling enough, not super lucky
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
little amount of 5* mean  she doesn't play the game and just get on to pull occasionally
yea it's just not pulling enough
maybe she pull on the trigger too
it can't track from the beginning
Mihoyo delete pulling data every 6 months
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
so does she have cons or weapons on the one she like ?
you can tell if someone is lying or not just by looking at their account
you have everything since launch
if you never lost 50/50
Mihoyo give you enoguh pull for a 5* every patch
does she have all the 5* since launch
ok i will just ask this right here
so you think you never lost 50/50
yea the one that said  i never lost 50/50  is just not pulling enough
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
that really don't narrow it down
the what now <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i take in all kind of cadets, as long as they graduated and get to lv 80 it's fine
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
heki griefing all new players

<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
you mean because Abyss is design for children to play ?
nini asking questions like a TC <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
IO
Eula enjoyers would have her at C6 by now <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Eula should be SS <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
nini the only thing heki will ever offrate is a glock from Mihoyo
enough stats to beat GPN
and knowing your crystals management skill i can say with 100% certainty that you won't be able to roll for HoS 2.0
okay as in  Will i be fine to mald  then yea probably but if you can get your hand on 3 pc SS then i would still get it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
for PVE you are free to use Makima on anywhere, she is decent
for PVP she is good for 3rd team
what ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Just finish the side stage with 2900 pts
Heki don’t be dumb
yea you keep hitting the reset button until you hit the jackpot
but so far i want to play them like a team
no, still S0 for now, might change my decision later on
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i already burn them on Kiana yesterday
just play circle gaming
with HoF yea <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
then maybe 746-747
i tried to see if it's possible to score higher than 745 with F2P setup but it's practically impossible unless you uncap FPS
S2 HoF cap is only 750
yea that one is definitely rank HFI <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
4* Kiana included
capscore is 745
for S0 HFI SS HoO SS HTR
probably S2
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
with F2P crystals ?
what are you rolling for <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Should be instantly
Like 1 day before both supplies end
And 5 cards on week 4’
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
5 cards from finishing chapter 35
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>

<@309634550273933314> <@148145559897636865>
time to sleep, i will check out the update at work <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
yea another 3
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
<@309634550273933314> <@148145559897636865> new loading screen
yea i like it too, especially seeing the solo ult animation <:echok:977515701961117706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
her kicking Benares out of the circle is fun ?  <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i tried HFI solo run and her buff window is so tight wtf <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
like the lizard can fly across the map and it still won't matter
Trio is so chill compare to HoF or HFI solo run on the lizard
<a:KleeREEE:845044618662903868>
time for what ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<@309634550273933314> <:whip:1024122299034632272>
i want to rewatch The A-team
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
why the fuck did you ask SEA player
on maint rn, 5 more hours
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
maybe can cut down the evade too
i do full string with Mei on 3rd rot, weapon - evade - combo
it's alright, you don't need meta team to clear early to mid chapters <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
3 pilgrim, kinda nut
<:echok:977515701961117706>
the most meta team rn is Liter Centi Scarlet Mordernia Rapunzel/Pepper
only second to ScARLET
yea, Mordernia with 60 FPS is a beast
she look like a solid support for raiding
but Makima will have her own use <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
nobody is gonna beat that
she can block 1 instance of damage teamwide every 4 seconds when max her skill 1
she is the most broken B2
nobody is gonna outdo Centi
RIP F2P
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
you're lazy
seem like 3 weeks banner <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Trio was fun on this boss but rot is too fixed so not many things to figure
I will do 1 run with HoF tmr <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
I know that S2 HoF SS HTR capscore is ~750
What is S1 HoF cap score do you know ? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Like 10 or 20
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
i will get 745 and sleep till tmr
you can cut down Mei's field time here and there but that's about it <a:hoshinocozy:803928465144676382>
you can't really improve this team rot
this team is just too fixed
cause you need to turn off QTE on HTR for higher cap
<a:hoshinocozy:803928465144676382>
now wait for 6.5
F2P setup complete
Power look like budget Laplace
Makima is B2 20s, Power is B3
Makima look good, Power look average
Makima's animation <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<@309634550273933314> <@148145559897636865>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
didn't they already announce ?
wdym ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
She actually feel like her sp bar will be drain anytime for this boss
<:YEP:816798774181363732>
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
Shameless also said last patch that he will stop at S0
Yea it’s shameless mindset
Almost 0 RNG too
9S Trio is like the most worth investment
Im in a meeting rn <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
It does matter a bit in Benares but for Bull and Tree i think it’s miniscule
If you want to score higher
She is surprisingly lack sp
Yea
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
6S is guarantee
That is if i want to attempt 9S
So im stick around S0 Kiana + SS Mei for the rest of the game
It will end up less fun
I want to 6S Trio but it will mean Mei need to go Raikiri + Turg
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
Only on 2nd rot
No combo
Weapon - Evasion - Ult
Don’t use it
740 is if you can cut down Mei’s combo on 2nd rot
It just that you’re playing normally
Oh you’re not doing anything wrong
But if i can cut down 1 Mei’s combo then 740 is possible
Im not entirely sure on that
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Stuck at 730 atm
Im missing some atk to get there
Capscore for S0 HFI S0 HoO SS HTR 4* Kiana is around 740-745 i think
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>  wtf
:Mathge:
W H <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
40 from Paladin, each
8 stamps in total
Card valk = 10 stamps
Yea
Some Old completed manga do be free to read 100%
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Only for first 3 and latest 6
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Yea definitely an emotional ride
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Yea, Ichinose so far is pretty chill compare to Takopii
his previous work was literally about kid in elementary getting bullied and trying to commit suicide <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
yea Tarzan's work is always look lightheart but getting fuck up the more you read
you go for SSS Mei ?
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
i love that stage because i can go make ramen, comeback and the physical valk is still hitting the elemental one
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
you know the way of Ruby
if ult build then yea it's fucked <a:hoshinocozy:803928465144676382>
ult build ?
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Gresham is typing up a storm
<:pausechamp:946796463114027069>
i just like the black part
i think if you want full prize it will be 18 streams with a total of 25 hours
30 minutes of telling Heki and maincord to off themselves to relieve some stress
and i realize that my stream will be 2 hours of reset Abyss
i was planning to participate in the streaming event <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
if you were a real simp Rosa would have been playable Tet
because it's the least logical choice
like im 100% certain it's Bio Fire
it's definitely Bio Fire
soon
HoF won't die anytime soon
6.4 or 6.5 might have Fire Mech
lowkey
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i will having fun with trio first
cause no way my trio can compete with my HoF anw
i will use HoF on last day
i was confused for a sec there
oh no 4/4 CN
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
D2 time
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
off in day off or off yourself ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
But the core is still Kiana having SS0+
6S Trio should also be able to pull it out
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
maybe
no info yet
Heki and crystal management <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>

if you keep asking it will the bot call 911 for you
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
ask it to generate a polite way to say kys
20 each yea
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
i got a G5 Fire right here for you <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
isn't that omega sad
reptar account consistently +100 on HoH weather with triple ice supports because people can't go beyond S0 or having 3* Ely
why did JK have to be Psy too again ?
but
yea HoH being Psy is reasonable
HoH is so fucking useful man
it's still dumb to this day
Meele HoC, you use her with dps HoS
kinda fun
she  did see one use last patch
how about i make use of my stungun on you <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
but it's either gonna be a menace or just small upgrade which will be iffy to consider
i mean i don't doubt HoS 2.0 is coming soon
once a dps option show up people realize how crack physical support is
Susanah rn is the prime example of it
do you see how hard physical dominate weathers once they have an option to compete on that weathers/bosses
because they can't think of anything to make her better than SnS
SI is just cracked
is SnS and Paga have bad numbers ? No
same case with SnS and SI
HoS is HTR of physical
and HoS is not the AE of physical
like it's so fucking hard to powercreep crack support
if you have 4/4 JK that is
to make sure that Turg become useless if Bastet is present
they need to adjust RC and JK buff number
do you see how hard it is to powercreep HB ?
and SS HoS is one of the cracked rank up and her SSS is the broken one
she is not gonna compete with S0 HoS by the time she show up
it's about competing with rank HoS
it's not about  what will HoS replacement gonna have 
you guys still don't get it
it will be a tough one consider HoS rank up is cracked as well
but HoS on the other hand
so her powercreep is easy and obvious
AE was CH of physical
it's not as obvious as AE and HTR
HoS replacement is what gonna be iffy
how about you check to make sure <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
if you top up before in 6.2 then you only need Card + 2 Paladin + 1 stamp
if you buy the card = 100 frags
2 Paladin = 80 frags
8 stamps = 80 frags 
Total : 260 frags, enough for SS
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
yea they need to add more G3 stuffs instead of useless shit
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
unless you can afford another Aladdin MB i don't think Homles will be powercreep anytime soon <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
if you don't have Holmes yet then i will also wait for 6.5 BP info
FHD obv <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
you're American, it have 70% chance to be Burger
spreading misinfo <a:KyaruSMH:665062713076088848>
that's why everyone prefarm her stacks in transition if HFI can solo damage
those are not timestop
if you parry it she will have 2 sequences connect after that
not the connect SEQ after
only the parry is timestop
HoO combo and ult have team buffs for HFI
as in why do the rot HTR -> HFI -> HoO -> HFI ?
wdym ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
nuh uh
HoF is still a beast <:evil:1049317760984940574>
Yea i think across all D, even CN players agree that below 9S or 6S Trio, HoF win if she is 2 rank up ahead
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Both work
Or you can go to gun store and buy a glock to pull
The 1 card, 3 cards, 5 cards bundle
If you want to have sth to pull then buy all card bundles that don’t have crystals with it
Around that

<:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
6.5 is still skippable, she is strong but 100% certain she won't be that strong on live <:bejj:1067071810853679194>
get rid of Aladdin M stacking and she will probably balance
probably due to Aladdin tho <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
stealing bosses here and there
this menace on the other hand <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
HoT couldn't steal other bosses, just really close to them
oh yea PE and 7T was kinda cracked too, but not to the point of this one
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
last one were SnS
it have been a long time since a broken V1 tho
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<@370438895965306882> <@385655541248163840>  she beat 9S BKE on Bleed HoS, she is not rivaling shit, she surpass BKE : 
poor soul <:life:1001518241610485781>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>

i almost punch my monitor when it get to 5
85 92 and 95
2 times out of 3 copies of Kiana
lol i saw that number
792 is impossible without 1500+ atk HTR <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
760 it is
enough of this Bull <:bejj:1067071810853679194>
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
i fucking use the crit dmg badge
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
ping me if you still have trouble Tet, back to the Bull
yea just need to figure out the transition, i can imagine it but nothing better than a showcase ref
yea, i just watch it to see if PV can solo the orbs but she can't
he cleared the orb with Eden QTE
do the transition like this and tell me if you manage to clear all the orbs
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
what does your gear look like again ?
i like the part where you dance with the orbs
there is a lot going on in the clip
wow
this bull timer is too tight for no reason
sure, i need to take a break too
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
motherfucker, i have been using wrong DK buff the past 1 hour
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Abyss Jizo is there in beta too
oh nini's favorite boss is in beta
i don't feel anything special toward the design, i just think the theme is overused but that is about it
the what <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
she smoke both HC and HoT

no point in testing that V1
yea
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
3 Aladdin M
soon her team too
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
not really
Himeko T, Thales M, Lee B
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
and you only need to do it 1
you only need to aim for 1 thing
heki
it's whatever
i don't even pay attention to the Osu interface
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
lol i actually think it look good, im not talking about the Osu interface, i mean her actual animation while doing it
yea, im not a fan of all pink and white but animation in combat is cool for me
i actually sold when i see her animation in combat <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
so i will gear this one
design aside i actually like her attack and ult animation
im couting on nini for my 4/4 Susanah and SSS day 1
me too gresham <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
im still trying to figure how tf did Nero get 794 without SS<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
oh <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
S0 HFI and S2 HoO can score up to 800 ? <:senthink:995298360317706300>
found it
<@385655541248163840> 
yea it's too specific
i will try looking for one <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
but should still doable
oh yea sp issue too on HTR
it's probaby that he doesn't know how to rotate properly yet
shouldn't be a problem, what does his team look like ?
can you record it ?
around 700 ?
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
I will probably search Youtube then
<a:aronathink:804142666345742369>
My friend asked if i want to play it
Have anyone played it yet
Is Overcooked fun ? <:KusaThink:1028025492923756646>
Surely
<:life:1001518241610485781>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
Then mfs add in “ Won’t SSS day 1 “
Won’t SSS anymore
Shameless said yesterday too
I think they all decided to do 1 last ride
Good for him <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Ain’t no way ?
Rn she is too strong anw, nerfs is a must <a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
Yea <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Cause i don’t plan on SSS day 1 either
I just hope her SS is enough for gaming
SSS day 1 is welcome too
Gresham you got me with 4/4 Susanah right ?
328 pulls 9 cards
Do you know how much it cost Shameless ?
Cause without S2 evasion won’t be up on 2nd combo
Basically Ult - SEQ 4 - Weapon - SEQ 4 - Combo
Damage is overflow anw so don’t think too much
And then combo
For S0 after weapon you need to do another SEQ 4
<a:aronathink:804142666345742369>
I think it’s just QTE -Weapon -Evasion -combo - Ult - SEQ 4 - weapon - evasion - combo
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Yea should be
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Cosplaying dead people
Yea, heki is asking about buying a glock, no ?
Around 500$ if you buy it legally or 300$ from black market
<:dongerk:1061701790640373861>
Rita when she look at Heki
<:dongerk:1061701790640373861>
<:dongerj:981641448057356289>
Elysia when she see my Excalibur
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Even at S0
Their damage rn are too fucking high for our temp
Still insane damage but you actually get to play Mei too
Yea i think S0 Kiana is a fun spot
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
So Kiana might stay at S0 or S2
Full SS0 and Mei will have to use Raikishi + Aslaug
Cause this might sound like im high but i actually want to use Mei stig on Trio team too
Im only debating on Kiana
Mei will definitely SS by next week
Kiana ?
Can you handle this instead ? <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Honkai lore is the highest prior in my list
Relax i won’t mix up Honkai lore
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
She is in APHO, she is a vtuber with Stan - the Honkai cat that Dudu picked up
reset ? in Genshin ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
she is good at tying the noose heki
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
her dmg will come in Part 2 make her a 5*
dw this is just Dehya Part 1
i pronounce her as Nino <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
and yes it will be affected by impair <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
her damage count as bleed damage, not that her damage turn into bleed
wtf <:whip:1024122299034632272>
did someone say gun ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Hot Nuts ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Ha Noi ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
but overall they just don't care
they think it's too white yea, could have been better, they prefer the Officer Uniform
so you're actually looking at an unbeatable valk without the exact same niche or just shit ton of damage
and on her weather she is playing with extra *1.45 for all her damage
yea 9S i can see it
an S-rank that  all her damage count as Bleed damage 
they need to release an exact S-rank version of her
Hare also can't steal her bosses
she is actually a physical dps
yea i don't think she can steal QUA bosses from Vill-V
so Seele will have to compete with a valk that have extra 1.45 multiplier
the 2nd part of this weather mean that only Susanah can take advantage of it
it's like everyone walking with foot and she is surfing
she is dpsing with another multiplier for her
cause she has another multiplier
yea
if anything Seele will steal HC's bosses instead
i actually don't see Seele stealing her bosses tho
for V1 ofc
overall i think she is a good physical dps that won't compete with QUA Seele
only the Mega Mob will feel bad without her
Bleed HoS = BKE/SNS/TP
Bleed Whale = MPE
Bleed Mega Mob = MPE
the Mega Mob
it's actually not that bad without her except her actual shill boss
she is a bleed dps
yea she is not a QUA dps
during 5.x period, they gave out tons of BKE stamps that you just 3S her without knowing anything
you can literally just buy BP and end up with SSS BKE
no, BKE is also just as cheap as SP valk nowaday
i can't think of any replacement for Aladdin atm
on HoS not on Susanah
<@385655541248163840> your BKE killer is here unironically
this SP valk is busted
she also stole MA Tona
ain't no way
does Aladdin not coming from Middle East ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
isn't Aladdin a cool dude
wait what's wrong with her stig being Aladdin ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
make AF nuke look like throwing rock
this SP valk
ain't no way ?
she beats 9S BKE on MA Jizo
actually no way
there is no way
Damn so epi become a beast and heki still struggle to tie the noose
That’s a lot of cum <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Should look better without the coat
The coat is kinda unnecessary
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Is epi a beast or what <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<a:Explode:1025665382599630848> ?
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
If the coat stay in combat it will cover her ass
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
The coat look kinda unnecessary tho
<@309634550273933314> <@148145559897636865>
As long as you have replacement on her weather which will be Bleed HoS, Bleed QUA Whale, Bleed Mega Mob
In honesty she is 100% skippable
Just need shit ton of hitcount
And the Mega Mob also not QUA type
The QUA whale bleed weather don’t need SS
It’s not as bad as i thought it would be
Although you can probably skip if you have built MPE yea
Holmes probably a good replacement
Susanah signature
It can’t crit in the beginning
Her damage is bleed damage
SSwords won’t work this time
Worst part is that
That’s the optimized setup
Griseo run Cez TB Aladdin M
HoS will run Aladdin MB
It’s actually Aladdin now
So only she benefit from the 2nd part
All of her damage are bleed damage
Yes
So she has another multiplier on top of everyone
Because as of now she is the only one that can take advantage of this Abyss buff
She will be competing with 9S BKE instead
She is bleed dps
She is not a QUA dps
But she won’t dead on release
I hate to break your bubble chief
they manage to create a valk that look like will compete with QUA Herrscher but she is not
isn't it kinda amazing tho ?
waiting for QUA boss test
look more like Bleed dps
she doesn't look like QUA dps tho
joking aside this will probably getting nerf next 2 weeks
highest damage test atm
<a:hoshinocozy:803928465144676382>
also best setup for these bosses require 3 Aladdin M
Susanah vs Bleed HoS RL 460D :

is it that hard to understand 10 - 12 < 0
WFP is killing me
bro
throw hands ?
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
if it's S0 he is a beast
probably S2 tho
no SS Kiana or Mei
is Nero a beast or what <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
do this irl <a:AichanWhale:496118854406373376>
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
no queen of England
no tooth fairy
no easter bunny
no 5 EXPA cards yet in SEA
uh oh
it's just young Kiana
this elf is not normally
and the shop last 8 weeks
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
the event last 7 weeks
6.4 is still 7 weeks
wait
tough one
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
4* Kiana can make that happen tho
no it's probably still you
<:wot:998941267041996862>
so will our 6.5 be 6 weeks instead of 5 weeks
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
wait someone said our 6.4 only last 6 weeks
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
that's 20 pts diff
S2 Mei can
S0 Mei can't 1 rot Bull in Nirvana
massive
S2
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
cause i will be dead set on using Trio every neutral weathers
so i can use her on wolf
Mei is kinda fun tho, i will probably try for her dps rank up <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
i will try it again on Sunday <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
yea i think this boss is moreso fps check on the last execution <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
it's a fps check
if my fps get better then i will be at around 775-780
im at 771 and SS Mei is ~780-785
so far i think for Abyss Bull, it's still a tie between Mei and Trio <:senthink:995298360317706300>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>

Capscore for S0 Mei/Kiana and SS HTR is 792 from CN ref but you need near perfect atk for HTR
This one is actually so tight <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
wonder what is the cap for S0 Kiana and S0 Mei <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
not arc city ? <:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
does she like this tho ? <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
Power i mean
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
nothing to jiggle because it's all padded
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>  tmr is probably Makima then
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
Google classroom ?
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
yes
Pizza hut collab
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
i don't even know if i can make it to T50
this TFT patch is also killing my mental
but with strategy instead of affixing
it's autochess
Hei just react to the poll
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
wait Hei is still alive
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
SP QUA dps
9. I like the game but here is my opinion <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789> 
i think people call it gay
i need it in the server to react message with it
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
it's too hard for old people
this opener
bro
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
all the lore enjoyers are pissing off so much
SP
B rank > double S rank
this one refer to latest lore when Susanah clear all monsters faster than Sushang and Rita
 The famous B > 2S valkyrie make an entrance, that's why she is the SB valkyire 
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
lmao
2 steps from hell
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
Who even use cp for copy paste
:huhh:
Year of QUA to compete with year of IMG
Seele is QUA Herrscher
Her lifespan is not even gonna be long
Worst part is that
I don’t know about Holmes but my mental is bleeding rn
SS is Snow Sniper
Tet
Without SS it will be hell for MPE
Cause she is forced to use SI tho
Really ?
Can’t even use Nyx
Bleed weather but QUA boss
Uhh
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
Now this one
First was HTR box
This is so dissapointing because Mihoyo actually cross the line
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
So she is just normal Susanah
They were talking about canon event in main timeline
But this one is just breaking the rule
so that she can be SP
Also why they went all the way to make new Ai-chan
That’s why Raven was A-rank
Carole and FCs can be SP because they don’t belong to current timeline
Main timeline character can’t be SP
They just break the rule to get more money on dead patch
It’s SP Susanah
It’s not that it’s Susanah
<@370438895965306882> <@385655541248163840> you guys saw that shit ?
47.680
Will try again this MA bull once i got home
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
Already match cap score of HTR dps when im having turtle hands
Damage is still insane tho
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
you need to mecha HTR before getting stack or else it won't turn into enhanced buff
btw this Trio opener on MA Bull is kinda hard for people that are slow like me <:pepe2:368744338445828106>
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
lol i actually doubt that, you will have a hard time to play around para meter with HoO
the non-fun boss is Sushang <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i mean except for Type Husk, i think Lightning Husks are fun boss
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
they just created Aponia for fun
so with the revival of HoT they are bound to appear again
i don't think that's true either, all the Husks were originally HoT and DJ bosses
she solves no problem
i mean i still think Aponia is a bad S-rank <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
they need to spawn Type Para Husk again soon or people will forget she exist
it even get worse for her
and now with the introducing of HoO
cause she is not the most efficient pick for all those bosses <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
5 bosses that should belong to Aponia, no one use her
and no one even use Aponia on it
i mean you literally can't make an S-rank anymore meta than  have 2 bosses 
lot of things to buy soon, Zelda DLC and stuffs
i hope i can take a short break in 6.5 <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
the others were probably avg
only elf pulls went horrible <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
mine weren't that bad <:echok:977515701961117706>
<:wot:998941267041996862>
or else it will be 18 seconds run
the only reason why it took her 55 seconds is because she can't timestop all creep waves
if you think about it
Can’t predict too far in the future <a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
If Mihoyo feel like they need to be generous
She could still be tho
If she is not in 7.0 then she won’t
For 2 S-rank back to back
5-10 foca cards
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
If 6.6 is not Hare then the schedule will probably look like this 
6.5 - Susanah 
6.6 - Teri 
6.7 - Timido 
6.8 - Hua + G4 Fire + compensation cards 
6.9 - QUA Seele
That’s it
But better, faster and longer
She will do exact same thing with Senti
<:DK:840944972383780874>
2 years later
2 years ago Senti killed CH
Bio + Fire <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Because that is the most niche thing right now
Yea it’s definitely Bio Fire
Next 4-5 patches can’t have elemental dps
If it’s not Hare then it can only be Teri
6.6 is debatable tho
6.5 will probably be a skip <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
I don’t rememeber exact numbers
Is it <a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
Another 10 foca cards will be there when new story is up
Herrscher’s cards always distributed on Saturday
The 5 expa will be on Saturday
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
Not your afaik
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
Enough to retain Nirvana in CN server
Not as bad as you guys think
Normal team score decent on symphony weather
MA only
Dps - SP - HTR/JK
Don’t need to force 3 elements that is not trio
For symphony weather just use the normal team
It doesn’t
You can do this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
Valk revalk should be 1 hour before it
Beta is in 5 hours
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
Wonder what does it look like in Nirvana
Mei’s damage look good in MA Bull at S0 <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>

That is like all of her rank up tho
<:KusaNoted:1035628096554024972>
160 pulls = S2 Kiana SS0 Mei 
250 pulls = SS0 Kiana SS0 Mei
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
Oh wait i miscount, it’s 250 pulls
I need another 160 pulls if i want to get 6S Trio <:KusaNoted:1035628096554024972>

what about delusion, coach
dumbo
beside that everything else is mediorce
not really but i can't think of anything eles worth getting, S2 HoF will still might get him +100 on occasional Mech Fire and Benares
compete with HFI on Benares
best bet should just be S2 HoF + dorm buff <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
probably coming with Seele too
next in line is physical elf
yea
tough call

i will still get S2 HoO regardless, im not gonna play a disabled valk
for what <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
so in the end it's still avg crystal count
this is the supposed avg
S0 4/4 HFI : 160 * 280 = 44.800
S2 4/4 HoO : ( 39 + 50 ) * 280 = 24.920
3* Kiana : 140 * 150 = 21.000
Total : 44.800 + 24.920 + 21.000 = 90.720
i go hard pity on every copies of elf yea
so it's average out
Elf got fucked tho
relax lil bro

2 multies <a:huh:1069628118366695475>

<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
this is what Nirvana should look like
CN bracket
this team is a beast <:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
Mei ult into Kiana QTE -> Combo 1 -> HTR combo
<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>

Bull is still trio's boss eli <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
HoR also score pretty well yea
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
if they can manage to kill WoW when the community is literally trying to save it nothing is impossible
this company man<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, United Kingdom, Georgia, Turkey, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan
Japan also get price changed, they haven't announced yet <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
how is that even possible
keep diving lower
this company
600% increased <a:pepeclap:939810173147553834>
lmao HS increase price for some specific countries, these are 5 countries that announced price change first
-1 if 3 frames faster
that's -2 from 9S BKE
nvm they're beasts
is she a beast or not
i will look for HoT score on Jizo tho
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
can't be
it's time to settle the score between HoT and BKE
because
that's not bad
does 6.4 have her boss yet ?
im 22/50 SS3 iirc <:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
4 weeks til SSS JK
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
nice try
what if you do 1 oopsie and do 1 pull on the trigger
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
it's 477D next cycle
temp went +2
bro
i go with more dorm buffs
or just buy more dorm buffs
increase the chance of getting AE
yea maybe
yea, reduce dmg taken
and impair source 2 years ago
yea CH is only good because she was the MA valk
only KMB has physical buff on the image you posted
CH doesn't have dorm buff, she is useless
what is other options ?
heki your fragile is either a rope or a glock
<:life:1001518241610485781>
heki slowly turning into Marisa
and fragile shit on him
the one that tried to tell fragile that he doesn't know what he was talking about
im not supposed to do that ?
but keep pretending that he knows what he is talking about
don't even play the game
that Khai guy is actual clown
i only tell them that after i shit on them
relax im not telling people to kill themself that usually
Maincord mod when they realized they're talking with human instead of NPCs  i will need you to stop your action from causing drama. This is final warning 
so like Honkai Official ?
she couldn't tell from all the furry porn in your browser ?
tell her you won't let her down
<:wot:998941267041996862>
Mouse are inside the house and rat are outside
What about rat ?
<:xdd:1022782509316059176>
the US goverment want to fund your college
what happened to our fund
gresham wtf
<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
<:xdd:1022782509316059176>
twitch chat spamming it like crazy
yea but that's what make it meta
to be an Ace in pro scene you need actual talent that is like 1 in 100 <:echok:977515701961117706>
what make one stand out can't be being 200 cm tall or running 40 yards in 4.2
you can find people on par with you by a huge amount in pro scene
yea genetic only matter on highschool, college level
yea but that is genetic, there are talents that you're blessed with
xddwalk
i realized talent exist when our Ace throw a 82mph fastball when he only practice baseball for 1 year  <:mfw:840549220406263859>
i do when i were in my HS baseball club
you need actual talent tho
i don't think hours and effort is enough for T1 Osu <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
irl gun ?
these xdd emotes are hella funny <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
twitch chat never fail to make me laugh
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
fun but not worth
so does life
what the fuck
Gresham stop spending our fund on D2
not to be the very best ?
<a:worrySwingSadge:981759583779446866>
i did expect Celtics to lose but it still sad
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
i just got -500$
also
<:wot:998941267041996862>
the purpose of Trio is to overtake neutral bosses
all of them can
yea she can
i need you to forward me 88k gresham
within 200 pulls
you will need like 4 copies to SSS her i think ?
yea
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
just like normal expa without essence
you're fucked
if you can't get 1 copy on 70
exactly 70
on avg
70
send me the fund later
you can send me the fund, i will record my gacha for you 8 hours before you get into the game
yea with mouse
peak gameplay
smooth
that is the one you guys are having rn
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
he said he would take care of that
i already transfered your part to gresham including his part too
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>

Your pet will also have higher chance to die or disappear in the dorm compare to just leave it to your family
As far as i know in Toronto, 0
Literally 0
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
7 Genshin, that’s like 7 Deadly Sins
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
That’s like 1 hour of daily contents
What if 7 Genshin tho, in the future
No full model for Makima and Power on beta yet
We will find out soon <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
And next week is Chainsaw Man collaboration
Nikke Pc launch <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
Heki just do this irl <:terikms:659698680344870922>
waiting for gresham to send me that one
that's my new year's resolution
that rabbit is definitely not jamming
<a:catjam:870348154422329345>
2 valks that look like they're a beast
that starter supply bait the shit out of new players tho
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
2 more days
<:Hildead:1050593965046501437>
you and the rope ?
nini stop coping
promotion to A-rank
it's prepared for this moment
yea probably, she got motivated by Sushang in the story
yea cause rn she is B-rank
yea cause the game EOS in 6.5
this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
worse come to worst i will still getting them to 6S <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
but planning to buy irl stuffs soon so have to be careful this time, timing is awkward <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
i mean i can <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
but those 2 buff Kiana too much
kinda depressing tho <a:aware:965946296236122172>
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
S2 HFI SS0 HoO SS0 HTR sound good ?
yea S2 is a good stopping point for HFI
damn HFI rank up is just like PE, you will keep wanting to pull <:pepe2:368744338445828106>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
yea depend on how they distribute each patch
it can be 6.9 or 7.0
kinda close tho
yea should be <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
CNY next year is around 7.3
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
not CNY
6.9 is the patch after Herrscher patch
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
except for HoO S2
oh wtf, HFI and HoO rank up doesn't even unlock anything, just extra damage and damage
i know for sure that 50% of CN playerbase play the game because of Kiana alone
if 6.5 contents can't raise their curiosity
CN will probably lose around 20% too
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
yea i can guarantee SS0 arcoss the board, 9S is possible too but i would like to save as much as possible, planning to redecorate the apartment soon
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
i can guarantee 6S Trio tho but does 6S Trio as broken as 9S Gresham ? <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
fucking run it down irl
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
they turn the impossible possible
he was so sure Eagle would have won so he double down after 1st quarter
lol my friend lost 2k yesterday on Eagle
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
but 3 injuries
lol no im a fan of the celtics, i just like betting for the stake of watching it <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i hope Celtics can win again tonight or else my fund will be in danger <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
gresham wtf, what did you do to our fund
oh wtf
<@370438895965306882> you got me coach ?
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Better than get kicked out of class
<:wot:998941267041996862>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Just trial and error it
Or you can still do 1 combo and farm sp later on in transition phase
Probably, you will need to apply purple combo after JK ult
Yea cat qte off
Extra sp for P2
You can also do 2 JK combo before ult too
Use this opener
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
What is your opener ?
Generally Cez B is always better tho
Depend
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
If you can’t break the shield in P2 then just go full damage
Do you ignore the shield in P2 or have enough damage to break it ?
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
Update is in 4 days
Oh i just realized
ER will feel like a chore if you keep using the same valk
so you can use anyone you want
that's why you build all of them <:echok:977515701961117706>
if you use the thorn you will end up like that most of the time
it's normal
what a beast
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
this boss is still made of paper even at 493D
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>  ?

just watch the rot to cut down the part where you dance with HoV
<:whip:1024122299034632272>
<@309634550273933314>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
definitely can go higher
i dodge either way to generate sp for RC
my bad <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
never pay attention to HoV
i don't know
is it ? <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
0
that one is unknown, will need to test it yourself <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
JK shieldbreak is on her stig and SS0
Paga on HB yea
most account won't even be able to 1 rot P2 without full ice setup

<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
no one will sleep with you for rerolling gacha
at least working a 95 you might be able to get laid after work
Nikke's gameplay is lit, trust me <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
for Makima and Power
just play Nikke keilo <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
how about touching this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
the Ling character is actually on AE's level with the poem, theme and music
i know 1 thing that their character design team are on the same level with Mihoyo one
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
gameplay coming from the 90s of turn based genre
the saving point of HSR is literally the  Honkai  in its name and cute characters
but god, looking at HSR, i can't help but thinking they will go with that directions for all of their games from now on
well Genshin is still banking so i guess Mihoyo pick the right direction
Layla should have been <@704867526877904908>  ? <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
and can't really do anything about it
they released 6 beast characters
they still figuring shit out in 1.x
can't really blame them tho
<:wot:998941267041996862>
almost as good as 4* electro
the Electro ceiling is really good at dealing damage
Genshin is getting good at releasing new characters
it's just the pride that they're chasing for
T1 and 100 doesn't even have different rewards
and the best part is that
in Uma Musume for the T100 players you need 10k a month at least
and competitive gacha just do it more often
in general gacha game is meant to take money from you
they specifically try to make BKE alive
i don't know any sane person look at BKE after SA release and think  man, she is dying soon 
i can tell you rn out of all the competitive gacha, Honkai powercreep is already on the lower end of the rope
that's like saying trio will also get powercrept eventually
when did they do that ?
reptar promoted with triple supports on HoV
you can run tripple supports on everything and still retain in all Nirvana's weathers
then you can retain on this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
Im planning to replace some furniture so can’t overspend
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Does 6S trio as crack as 9S ? <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Nini you got me with 2k for 9S trio ?
Cause you’re a dudu simp
<:evil:1049317760984940574>

Beneath the sky nothing stand for freedom more than America flag
Eagle is cracked this season too
14-24 <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
that is 5M credit
yea they cost a lot but coop event will re-open soon
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
this game is still 3 months old only
but not anytime soon
probably if they stick to the alphabets
not when Nihilister is this close <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
eventually i get you will need it but not now
not worth buying slots
no, just replace them if you need other SSR
<:wot:998941267041996862>
should have went with the glock instead
fairsky
it's farisky
no it's not <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
i already sent your fund to gresham, he didn't transfer to you yet ? <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
buy them then <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
what kind of American not watch Superbowl <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
even back then Yanfei best team is literally running Beidou
abuse the reactions
i mean yea if you use Yanfei for Dendro then she is cracked, it have always been her strongest team in term of most efficient way of using Yanfei
Genshin Abyss is a joke
doesn't matter what you use for Abyss
literally blind
you're blind
if you think Yanfei is AoE and Hu Tao is single target
0 consistent
her damage and rotations are literally the worst in this game
i was the one doing math for Yanfei Mains back then
nice cope
you can play C0 Hu Tao with your feet and she still deal more damage than C6 Yanfei
Use her like how you use othet elfs
Their CD are the same
Heki your account are full of 2* elfs
time to sleep
i just finished my 30 hours of TFT <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
it's all in the past tho
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
the latter sound like me
it's never too late to start over <:bronyahug:998941262377918574>

<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
watch this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
like Mobius
and reptar is sitting on 2600 trophies
im in reptar account and HoS is useless here except for MA Kallen
it's not wrong
really lowkey tho
ok lowkey
affection boost mats
sleep on physical contents = HoS useless
that's what people in maincord have been saying yea
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
CSM first, doggo later
they changed the schedule
no doggo event
<@309634550273933314>
normal mold don't
only faction mold <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
most likely <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:Gladge:876532158544642109>
can't even get their hand on Prime BKE
it's so fucked for new player if they start after 5.3
great schedule
new account after 5.3 all have problem with physical contents
and hope it can retain
i will just PE it
no Paga and no SSS SnS too <:Gladge:876532158544642109>
he doesn't have built SpA
it's fucked, reptar account have no way to do Bleed HoS <:bejj:1067071810853679194>
No, only Pilgrim units are broken <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

Yea it will be new faction, the company name like in the series
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
Because there is no timestop so the bar regen faster during ult animation
It’s actually smart lmao
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Klein extra TDM will be useful when you're forced to use HoT in MA with PV GD/FR
no matter small or full rot
it let you ult every rot in Ignite Benares
S2 HoF > S0 HFI ( Trio + standard )
HoF only win in ignite benares at S2 vs S0 HFI
and reptar doesn't have a mech dps beside HoR
i spot 5 T50 in reptar HoS's bracket <a:huh:1069628118366695475>
And in 6.4 HoF default rank is gonna be S1 at least or S2
Like how HoT default rank is SS0
Rank up only matter when everyone also have it on their hands
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
Yea should be
This cycle in SEA, myriad T100 cutoff was 750 iirc
And you also need to be a beast
If you’re aiming for Myriad then the answer is yes, you can aim for Myriad with just S0, but for consistent attempt you will need 4* elf and more cards on your hands to use

If you get hit in Honkai Abyss and you keep playing i don’t think we’re in the same wave lenght
Because mistakes will eventually happen
If Kosma P2 have 100 HP bars people will also call him hard
They make it hard by prolong it
Like, the movements and stuffs are not even hard
Imagine SSS BKE P1 last 5 times longer than it should
That’s what it mean to prolong shit
Old hack n slash design
I hate that design btw
So mistakes happen
Yea i don’t even think it’s 10 minutes straight of hard moment, they just prolong the fight to the point people have to focus for 10 minutes

Trio and Kiana
IO score close at S0 tho
Trio win at every rank
Trio
<:DK:840944972383780874>

HoT and HoF in their own team can still do Kevin in Nirvana
look like it
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>

Dudu just want to look good in officer outfit
VG ain't even a valk lore wise
we will get Mech Ranged Dudu in 6.6 <:mfw:840549220406263859>
cause after this will be physical fest again
6.4 is the patch you want to spend on with no regret
like if you want to go for one last ride with Honkai
i think 6S team is also fine
that team is literally the peak of strong
my money is still on 9S Trio
if now even Fire Tank show up
im not even joking
it's still close at S0 tho
<:mfw:840549220406263859>

<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
He is actually chill in gameplay help when people don’t want to prove they can score same with him if they have his setup
But if you be like, “ This boss is so hard, i can’t even get xxx pts with my setup “ then you’re ready to get on his ride
Like, if you ask fragile a question genuinely in gameplay help, most of the time he answer normally and give you good insight on your mistake
The mindset “ i would kms for being bad at the game “
Fragile is actually a nice person that lack social skill, he just share the same mindset with Aka

If i sit in a McDonald in Toronto my mental would be destroyed

also in 2022
they rerun HFI on week 7 mean they treat it as new patch
technically 6.4 is also only 6 weeks <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
6.4 is 7 weeks so story might start from week 4

Oh i think DA transition is way easier than HoS
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>

So the existence of Singularis was meaningless <a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
They have been actively turning Masters into a chilling place for players that don’t want to breakthrough
Masters is kid playground
So does everything in Masters
No flame
If you’re disabled yea
Singularis was never an option
Ever since Manifold was introduced
Literally no one care about Singularis
That’s fine
The boss refuse to stand in 1 place
I know why HoF couldn’t score
Alright
why is it so small what the

my pity got fucked so i have to start at 90
<a:huh:1069628118366695475>
S0 4/4 HFI : 160 * 280 = 44.800
S2 4/4 HoO : ( 39 + 50 ) * 280 = 24.920
3* Kiana : 140 * 150 = 21.000
Total : 44.800 + 24.920 + 21.000 = 90.720
i see <a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
if you're using Handel
iirc 1 sp reduction and full atk
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>

at S0 4/4  she is just a 2nd elf
if you're staying at S0

oh that is just SEA RL
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>

and it's on the trigger
1
with 1k in paypal too
should be
stop talking like a f2p nini
3* elf buddy
that will result you in the same score with 4/4 HoH and 2* Elf Ely
normally if you're not gaming then skipping HoH = 3-4* Ely Elf + triple supports
it's the same principle with skipping HoH
if you don't pull HFI then no reason to stop at S0 HoO
you can't really miss 4/4 Mei unless you try so hard
or just Mei dps
HTR or RC probably
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
to get free Mei in 2 weeks
make sure to finish chapter 34
yea
<:DK:840944972383780874>
4/4 Mei = 3* Elf for Kiana
0/4 Mei = 2* JingWei
if you think about it
Mei is a 3* elf
<a:WOT:1069628996221935727>
HTR is S-rank support
no

90% of Poki and QT's chat will also download it
but like, im 100% sure
yea i mean it's creepy yes
so everyone suddenly explode because a dude downloading it is kinda weird to me
the problem is that deepfake porn of celebrities have been existing for as long as porn history go
yea idk why everyone suddenly trying to witch hunt the dude
cause im watching a clip of QT crying rn
yea QT and Poki appear on that gallery iirc
that's some of the most broken shit i heard this week
a streamer just had to apologize for jerking off to another streamer AI porn generated

<a:HUH:960281654046375986>

nini you never have enough crystals since like 5.0
time to wait for S0 Trio vs S0 IO
alright, seem like 9S Trio win again
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
a T10 Myriad player thumbnail in 6.4
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
9S Trio might take it from 9S IO too
this Homu one is gonna be interesting
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
next is her turn unless they try to delay it
<:wot:998941267041996862>
20 runs and keep flying out of CN's ult
why does Benares is more aggressive this time
alright wtf
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
SS SPA : AKA, Type Wolf, Type Bio weathers
S2 HoF : Tank, Heimdall, Benares, Fire/Ignite Psy weathers
but S2 HoF will still keep Ignite Benares if you stop at S0 HFI
HoF's boss or SPA's boss
it just depend on which boss will appear after that
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
no more Turg RC
Benares will be fun this time<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
SEA cutoff is around 650 iirc
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
yea SS HTR can definitely strike in the upper 80 with that leaderboard
that's like 2* Dudu low
oh wtf that's so low
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
there is no way
just head north, top of the map, like just straight up in the 12 o'clock corner iirc
SEA have 10x playerbase, so you guys have 20 nini but we have 300 nini <:bejj:1067071810853679194>
that's like 300 nini
the gap is like 300k atm
mine is already fucked in SEA
only missing the portal in it
im already done with area 3 <:bejj:1067071810853679194>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
until 4*
Dudu elf is the only elf where you will feel like you always missing damage from her
here <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789> ?
that setup definitely gonna missing like half the bar
im not sure about one shotting P1 with that one
and wasting time on transition
it's sp farming on HoS
in RL you're not supposed to use that one
cause they use that gloves
that's like 8 heki
tell nini to work harder
it's nini
just call it IMG Tree
not benares
nini the trio one is the Tree
<:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
how about you consider this instead <:MahoGun:732697688436375622>
not you and your Turg HTR
that's broken
486 pts in CN Nirvana
my gosh, that's the ref nini looking for
try adding Flame and Truth is the best you can do
寂灭点燃天贝贝炎真
oh that one is fucked yea
9S Trio and you can use them for a whole patch
you know this is actually a good time to swipe once and for all
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
9S Trio look like they're coming to dominate every weathers in existence
oh i mean at the budget version of them
or is still a tie at S0 HFI vs S2 HoO
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
who win on this boss
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
you can prefer alone but you can't prefer being disconnect with everyone
communicating is human basic desire yea
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
The datamined server
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Shitf Up strike them last month
They all got taken down
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
pre-censor are all pics that got datamined
none, when beta hit they already censored it to some extents
Aid is above
the pink one
so far at least, only Cocoa has pick up banner
only Cocoa is gacha
Soda and Aid are probably free
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
no Soda model
<a:aware:965946296236122172>

<:wot:998941267041996862>
<@385655541248163840>  sorry i lied, you need to explore each area 80 tiles to move to the next one
But im in SEA anw
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
Kiana ofc
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Great power come great responsibility
Nini griefing her own team <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:Huabirb:1068208652097429554>
You got chosen randomly
<:whip:1024122299034632272>
But don’t grieve your team wtf
And wait for it to open
You can sit
<:whip:1024122299034632272>
Then work harder
Use this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
To move to area 2
In the middle
Use the purple one
Use the teleport building in the middle
Move to area 2
But they are already maxed out
Ye those buildings
To speed them up to 100%
You just put those votes in there
There are 5 buildings in each map
Put it in anywhere that is not 100%
Find it, it’s somewhere out there, all treasures gather in One place
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Big Mac, Fries and ice cold soda
Valentine is coming <:pojj:1067071660081020938>

Snipe this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
how about malding for this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
2.25 cringe
generally always pick stamina cause you might want to use it somewhere else
not many will tryhard this boss in RL
yea should be chilling
<@906785655823147028>  what is your HTR atk ?
yea i think this come down to bricking your HTR or pull another stig set for her
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
or 5
1472 is around 4 atk lines
That’s kinda high actually
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
With atk lines and full dorm buff
Reptar said that 610+ is possible for SS HTR
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
In SEA i think S0 is still around 630-640
What is S0 PE score on this for NA ? <:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
waiting for tmr to clear it
SEA already unlocked area 2
alright
there is a puzzle here
how do i unlock the area around here <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
if you can't 3 charge + weapon to kill Huodou then it's your cap
oh if it's the event then LE start
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
because it's legit impossible for me to do it
i watch Huodou refs and i give up
that's what you think
do it faster
Huodou is just
im not even joking
do it faster
don't use it if you don't know what you're doing
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
by 100% all 5 constructs
need to unlock the transfer gate
no
don't ask if you don't know
It’s whatever fragile or kyoshiro use
Reptar just said that he only got 562
PE Should still be better than HTR
Can S0 PE still one shot FGO ? <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
<:hoshinoplease:740527297727168525>
im on St.Freya as it's supposed to be
but don't grieve my 30 xtals nini <:whip:1024122299034632272>
you can get enough currency for outfit in like 5 minutes
decent <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
generally Rupee
both are good
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
minus 30 xtals from half of the server
but not doing it daily is griefing your team
you can do the event in 1 day
HTR is better
whatever gear you're putting on HTR, even FHM
she doesn't
<:wot:998941267041996862>
HTR took like 50s
PE 5s it
no you can't
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
grab this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
if you're lazy you're griefing 30 xtals from half of the server
btw this is one of that kind of events
<:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
:gunj:
That is some <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878> you got right there buddy
What the fuck is even reded
HoO need a replacement for GD
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
If anything the next SP will be lightning
So Griseo wearing Paga ? <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
Oh im actually not sure about her new comp, maybe PV + CF is better
<:DK:840944972383780874>
Homei Mei Emblem
Rebel blade is worth it
<a:meltedicecream:975022253592940575> cube ?
But you need WE for that strat <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
SEA just got +2
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
On FGO
Oh btw next cycle temp will be +2
It would still be a menace
But not at this temp
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Yea im curious about it too
Won’t IO HTR GD score better in TC Wolf than SpA <:senthink:995298360317706300>
they effortlessly score 700+
i don't even think you need to try as long as you have 1 of the 2 Bio ranged that literally shouldn't exist both at the same time
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
i barely notice season has changed
you can't really feel winter is coming without snow tho
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
they don't even have snow in Vietnam
he rename it
<:wot:998941267041996862>
it's by yea
yea
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Flown
if 6.5 is another SP then it's doomed <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
ult spam is more fun and faster too
6.5 better be A-rank <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
not sure tho, saw Citrus maxing so can't be that bad <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
i think it's good in ER, just get some base atk and interrupt resistance in
after 65 6S Pri i realize i only have 400 torus left <:bejj:1067071810853679194>
im fucking around too much my torus almost ran out too
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
Yea surely the maincord retainers are all beast at playing HoS without Cosmic <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
Yea you only need 15k
Relax, you already got S1 HoH
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
Cata what are you doing, it’s 2023, every HB should be SSS
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
S0 PE will finally realize that they can’t live in their bubble anymore
Next boss will be fun
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
You know i once said this in maincord and a mf reported me for “ personal attack “
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>

pull this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
and it's so fucking messed up
they have zero respect for translators
that server and specifically lore channel
when beta hit people will realize that it take time to translate shit and not just MTL to call it a day
yea he only chat in there, stop posting pin and stuffs
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
when all those mfs did was messed up the atmosphere
what bug me the most is that all the fuckers keep trying to prove that they're doing a good job
so mess up the channel completely
all the mods suddenly want to prove that they have brains
still does
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
i can 946 AKA with IO but other 2 are annoying
i choose to sleep <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
MA Huodou <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
Maybe 650 is possible if i polish the run more and switch the gun to FFF
I got 631 with SS HTR, that’s not bad <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>

10% max HP
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
is it strong enough to save S0 PE
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
Trio only gain advantage with rank up or bosses that were made for them ( IMG, symphony )
<a:seelenoted:963697302151757826>
basically on Benares, Trio is not that good before SS HoO because HoO contribute literally nothing superior compare to 4/4 SSS CN
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
Kiana elf is too strong
<a:seelenoted:963697302151757826>
S2 HoF SS HTR 491D : 
This one is a little sus <:bejj:1067071810853679194>

<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
pin this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
 You know what we did ?  We pinned 
my gosh this guy
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
what does these guys even do tho to spill out shit like  im working my ass off on this server 
a real human being can type this out
there is actually no way

this one ?
mods vs marisa gang in CN discussion rn
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>  lmao i can't pay attention because maincord drama is too fun
she needs SS to be a support ? <a:aware:965946296236122172>
i mean SS HoO, not how big is her ass
wait im seriously asking <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
is SS Mei big ?
<:bejj:1067071810853679194>
i think they mentioned the correct play is 3* Kiana Elf + S0 HFI + rank up HoO as high as possible
i think they all stop at 3*, the good but budget players <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
so far the results are :
- Bull : S0 HFI = S2 HoO, Trio win at 9S
- Ignite Benares : S0 HFI = S2 HoF, Trio win at 9S <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
didn't pull the most important one
heki thinking he needs to pull S2 HoF when her stamps are in 6.4 spending <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
we gaming ? <a:aworryGaming:945537650146824242>
the trio start kicking when ranks get added
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
still do better than SS HoF
basically 9S Trio > 9S HFI ( using CN ) > 9S HoF > S2 HoF > S0 HFI > S0 HoF
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
HoF S2 score about the same with S0 HFI due to Kiana Elf
i lied
im sorry
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
HoF need SS0 to outscore S0 HFI based on early result
yea still does
we didn't have HTR at that time tho <:pojj:1067071660081020938>
our temp last round were minus 20 from them
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
that's insanely high actually
the 670 one
they're all waiting for top players to optimized the rot more
they said that Trio can score around 670-690 depend on how much effort you put in but currently HFI HTR CN is more stable for scoring 700+
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
Even for speedrun
If you want to kill Heim fast you need to bring BKE support
A glock and a rope

ER this patch is a fun one so im down to try hard a little bit
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

I will try to watch it to see what im missing
I haven’t watched it
Which signet does Citrus open with ?
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Isn’t it straight up better to go with the Infinity one
Yea
Open with Stars Signet only slow your run down
This HTR ER guide suck
<:echok:977515701961117706>
Good job, last time we ever use HTR dps tho
:Chorry:
Gaming Mouse and Fu Hua Musician
And not Bio
Unless we sure next Physical dps is Mech
I think getting 4/4 SnS is still alright
But without type bonus her damage is not that great <:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
All her relevant damage are ranged

Yea it’s not really a degen game
Wonder if HTR can score decent on it
Next is ranged Assaka <:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
Quitting Honkai soon <a:pogfish:1063841859664891978>
<a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
What happened on Tuesday ? <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
And no RC here make CB 19 way worse
Nothing special, just the lack of damage
RC rot wasted too much time
But i think the reason is mainly because
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
CB19 brick the run here if anything
Cause you want to squeeze damage in for execution
It’s mile better in this case
If you use CB19 then forget about it
But need FFF tho
At S0
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
HB score higher than RC here
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
wait what ? <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
not actual CN contents
i hate to break it to you but EN translator did that for the giggle
it's localization
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<a:sex:1008619079483007047> Seele
if that make sense
cause game is mean to be fun first
also i'd rather get the Trio than rank up HoO first
i think
her S2 won't matter much in RL
<:DK:840944972383780874>
think Bull is still HoO's boss
cause you will have HoO by then
bull will be easy next time yea
PE will get shit ton of dps loss if you don't know how to deal with hitlag
constant moving that mess with PE hitlag and transition phase PE has to use ult to destroy it
if you mess with him too long he become like that
like irl bull
you need to deflect it
it's the rage shield yea
all the mechanic of this boss fuck up PE so bad
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
and HTR spend like 2 seconds
PE spend like 5 hours to destroy the flying objects
<:DK:840944972383780874>
use to be top of the class
im good at physic too
if you use the correct answer the boss become RNG fest
Honkai 2023
you lack other options
that's the neat part <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
that's why it's hard
you're using the worst option you can use on Bull
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
S0 PE : 

S0 HTR SS2 JK Bastet Newt B RC : 

S2 HTR SS0 JK Turg RC : 
next season will be Nyx and HoF <:DK:840944972383780874>
Holmes or sth
should be filler
sp and some number buff
much better
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
otherwise it's just one rot from start to finish
only the transition phase sometime buggy
rot is easy tho
and it's physically impossible unless i want to brick HTR
im missing 100 atk from one rot the core
this abyss bull is fucked up
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
i have been questioning that ever since some fuckers told people that Turg RC is lit
eventually scoring higher with Felis
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
sure bud, when will that eventually part happen
<:DK:840944972383780874>
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
These SP type supply doesn’t have wishing well
No
Yea upgrading Academy is important, open more synchro slots
Yea it doesn’t matter, also pick up some relics after your cleared the chapter too
Yea that’s the way
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Yea like half an hour ago
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
CN can fill the largest ignite bar of AKA with just her ult
Sirin value is also not that great now anw even when she has ignite
<a:pogfish:1063841859664891978>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Just bi weely event, queue up with 4 others and get rewards
remember to do coop event in Nikke for resources <@309634550273933314> <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
Watch this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
But when will Awaken Chifuyu come to SEA tho
That is some lewd hanbok
<a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
The Abyss get better now
Yea the MA one is still toxic
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
It keep getting better
Once you remove Turg RC out of your life
Benares is actually not that bad anymore
<:DK:840944972383780874>
Abyss also look good
On HTR run i can’t seem to get the 2nd stack with JK tho <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Yea i think the dodge after first ult is kinda tight
<:echok:977515701961117706>
I think the fight is alright, not used with the laser in the beginning but the rest is ok
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:terisudoku:652745197716897794>
 new valk does not equal better valk. Trust me im not a Teri simp, i swear im not in Teriteri Hub 
wonder if they pull out the scum card again and put Symphony weather first week
HoFin combo bug iirc
i wasted 30 minutes on Genshin
Hu Tao didn't show up on part 1
ping Tet for the giggle gresham
and proceed to not kill the first wave
wonder what it feel like to enter Nirvana CN for the first time
you need to mald to even kill the core with 2 ults
cause shit was 494D
i remember on FGO S0 PE score the same with SS0 HTR
CN is on the way making it happen
yea this 3% extra breach will be broken when another tier got added or 500D+
her SS should have been S2 instead
lasy cycle i was like
it's huge on SPA, my SPA start to feel like she doing some work with CN and HTR
when you go like
it's not the same feeling you get with S2 AE
HTR
idk why
her SS actually diminishing so fucking bad
with S0 HTR
i think it's 9S PE > SS1 HoT > SS0 HTR
9S PE that is
i have wasted 5 hours of my life for nothing
1 of the homu events emblem
eat this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
no one care nerd <:nerdge:980201016853164144>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
because SEA is celebrating CNY
or 23/23 affix
it's all S-rank in dorm
no
nice mechanic buddy <:echok:977515701961117706>
<:uhhuh:368760315149549568>
What are you waiting for
Finish it then
<a:mhhacker:998945514894671912>
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Just by having elfs
You can get 2 crystals errand while having no SS dorm valks
The trick to get them is actually elfs
<:DK:840944972383780874>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
the visual is annoying
These MA bull refs are kinda annoying <:mfw:840549220406263859>
I missed like 5-6 of them <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
When will the new quest start ? <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:woggerswhale:653576160231424040>
It’s always hurt me when i have to do that <:evil:1049317760984940574>
I hate to do this but it’s the former
<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
The deadly one
Himeko Sakura Kallen
Im gonna use the real Trio
<:FeelsSadMan:816800787137036360>
the real trio
need 1 more that live in SEA
so they can gaslight everyone 24/7
and they take turn to gaslight people cause 1 is NA, 1 is EU
there are like 2 gaslighters in CN-discussion
i trust maincord with every parts of my body
according to maincord PE is only useful now at SSS <:echok:977515701961117706>
cause FCs interactions are top notch
i like ER more than EE <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
but they just solve it in 1 chapter
from civilians, goverments, etc...
the damage that HoV did to the world is already enough to do 1 full arc dealing with the consequence
world building in Honkai is kinda shallow too cause they don't want to dive too much into that matter
dw
will never kill themself
someone mentioning  i want to kms  in the DM
it's always the rope
like how Mei kick the shit out of Kiana
Honkai strong point have always been character interaction
even now their writing is still underwhelming
im ngl
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
what the
:Batchest:
the mech have 2 guns
you're thinking of the other gun
it doesn't
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
literally everyone tried to do 50 hit combo with Himeko suit
i even have a copypasta for that 50 hit combo alone
that question were asked a lot from my cadets
100 hit combo
do the gatling gun
get on the mech
that is easiest one
HoV i mean
it's a dream made from Sirin
cause change of heart or different writters
but the writing can be wack a lot of the time
Honkai have good plot
like
pretty much everything you need to know
and watch the chronicle
every once in a while search their offical youtube
if i have to be honest, for Honkai you don't really need to pay attention to every details like at all
adding emotes on top of each sentences
aster talking like a true chatter
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
<:whip:1024122299034632272>
Sure bud, get back to scoring AKA then
<:KokoX2:716998839248355451>
What the hell does that mean
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
What do i use for MA this weak, coach
<:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Mine is saved for bullets
<:whip:1024122299034632272>
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
HoO HTR GD
HoO team also has 3 IMG
Everyone use S2 HoO for Bull and Tree
So far seem so
Ideally just give her back Super Timestop on every rots
Need some buffs before release or on release
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Still T1 her own weather but she doesn’t own IMG weathers atm
HoFin now is kinda undertuned tho
think it's 9S PE and below that is HoT
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
you need to change support to BKE
charge spam is <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
Uriel and Aslaug
even for VK
but the last 2 weeks of 6.2 was cancer
<:DK:840944972383780874>
i like VKE and 6S
:pogg:
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
:pogg: a level
the game literally admit being horny while giving messed up stories
yea Anis also trying to calm Commander down by putting his hands in her chests
kinda messed up
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
or pay no respect to you
but there are also Nikkes that want to blow your brain out <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
literally trying to drug MC
Maxwell
<:DK:840944972383780874>
like literally rape
yea 1 of the Nikke want to rape us
yea ShiftUp always open about this cause their studio are famous for horny art
when i was discussing Nikke lore
oh i photoshopped Shamash into it
and dude is gay toward the current Commander which is us
<:DK:840944972383780874>
the 2nd Commander
<:DK:840944972383780874>
then they will be gay for the first commander
they actually give a canon reason on why Nikkes have big assets
yea it does, it's stated that their model were done that way to encourage male soliders in the first war
Dorothy without the battle armor <:DK:840944972383780874>
literally Elysia
this one is Dorothy <:DK:840944972383780874>
the only human part of them is their brain
none
<:DK:840944972383780874>
Nikke = enhanced cyborg that function based on human brain as the core
when they were stil human
cause they only used to be sisters
lol that one is a messed up case
but as you dig deeper you find out that not all human want that
where human are struggling to take back Earth
it's a gacha about Dystopia
she think of them as insect
she is racist toward Nikke that protect human
and 1 of the next upcoming character is literally a racist and manipulated
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
1 of the current playable characters, there is a girl that blast us with a shotgun into the vital organs
but
<:DK:840944972383780874>
racist, twisted, manipulated
in Nikke they have a person that is what Elysia was supposed to be
EN just use he in early days
CN use neutral pronounce
oh that one is due to translation
ER part 1 also had moments when Kevin talked like he want to slice Elysia in half
yea i mean they did retcon shit ton of stuffs
so an actual epic battle might still happen
at least Capitano is in Natlan
Tsaritsa definitely know that
she also slaughter shit ton of gods
i just mean her combat power back in the war
you would think with Raiden achievements Tsaritsa should have sent Dottore to Inazuma instead
also i still have no clue on why did the 2 Harbingers in charge of Inazuma were 6th and 8th
yea Inazuma was trying too hard on introducing characters
so he can use 2 elements
Kazuha for a moment believe that he is Anemo Aether
and Kazuha deflect it
literally a strike with intend to kill from Raiden
it's also funny how Kazuha is the one that did the friendship buff first
thinking back of Inazuma
50k chatters backseating on how to defeat Scara
traveler literally become xQc for a moment
they went from flashback to backseat
nah it's an upgrade
the characters are interesting when they didn't have traveler hanging on their mouths
yea and all of it traveler only exist as a cardboard
and then  i will die on this hill 
literally meet 3 cases
but traveler ?
like how Kiana overcoming all the hardship
yea i mean when you do it right it's touching
i was moved to tear when traveler think about all the people who they didn't meet ever in their life and get friendship buff from them
Gundam and EVA
except all the classic
yea like every anime ever
typical hero vs villian and hero come out on top due to friendship trope
it's shonen anw
i don't really care about the ending of Genshin
3.4 story i mean
i will update Genshin once story is full <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
isn't all uni like that ?
as long as it's SFW
my company does not banned using other apps in work <:DK:840944972383780874>
it's just reflex atp
i literally use excel to do 2 + 3 last week
cause you will be so god damn tired you don't want to think
you'd be surprised by how often you will use calculator to do simple maths when you get to work
but yea, i think the mass is actually happy with being in AG3
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
problem is that if i ever drop to AG3 i would delete my account 1s after
then Honkai also don't force you to spend
like just AG3
also if we actually lower than standard for Honkai
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
some don't
the problem is that some games forced you to spend
every gacha are actually expensive af, they're the predator model of gaming industry
Yea, can’t really introduce new valks if all you need is FT, IO, LE, HoF, HoT, HoS, PE <:DK:840944972383780874>
Time out time out, take a deep breath first before continuing this topic <:aichanpls:1063788845365211167>
can be FR DA HoS
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
relax bud
SEA have like 10x playerbase
If her stamps get added in ER they already update it now or give a warning
At least not anytime soon
It won’t be the case
<:life:1001518241610485781>
She still need S2 to be a beast
Choose this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
Kinda bonker now
Her damage does increase quite a bit with it
It now vary from “ literally doing nothing “ to “ decent increase “ for other teams
Yea they balance it
<:aichanpls:1063788845365211167>
Results are already out from other good players but they still think EoP Pri is a buff for Aponia only
You will find out how incompetent playerbase are
In maincord
Like if you take a look at CN discussion rn
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Can’t get punished if we don’t play in CN or KR
It just mean players are not competitive enough
Human are sheep
Probably still not
There is no fun if i have to explain that im mocking idiots
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
They can’t even recognize im mocking them because they think they’re in the right
Nirvana standard is so fucking low now that all of the idiots turn delusional
If there is 1 thing i hate then  it will probably be the Nirvana bracket change
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
I personally don’t feel anything about this matter tbh
Thrive ? <a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
They don’t try to learn different answers anymore even though there are more answers now
In a sense it does make players become worse
It just turn from lowkey to highkey
The shill is more obvious now yea
<:life:1001518241610485781>
The last relic of old valks gone like that
Imagine elf + all SPs in sim battle
<:life:1001518241610485781>
Sim battle is the only place where cata can use AE
For no reason
Yea that’s why HTR is turbo broken
She plays the same with 0/4
It does not really matter if you have her gears or not
<:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
They can also buff Kiana <:echok:977515701961117706>
more buffs for Kiana please <:echok:977515701961117706>
then look at CN and you can find 10.000 accounts like that
like you look at nini account and you think  wow, such a huge whale <a:pogfish:1063841859664891978> 
CN are like 1000x
but quantity ?
realistically if you look at the top, all servers are the same in quality
yea CN players keep performing way over the avg
even their RL is 460+
yea CN temp is way too high rn
i think Kiana does need more buffs tho <:echok:977515701961117706>
shit was paper
when wolf debut was literally 420D in Nirv
and give example of Tona and Wolf
S0 should score more than 700 with 495D
is actually saying
motherfucker
lmao
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
below SS you can only do like 2 more AAs
<:echok:977515701961117706>
3 AA and combo and dip
yea you can't AA too much with her pass SS
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
finally i can use HTR soon
yea -2
will probably going back to 46x soon
temp is going down so np <:echok:977515701961117706>
do combo atk
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
the sword state ?
exit what now
they're tied to story
Pilgrim's character doesn't need events to show up
well that will depend <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
Dorothy is after that
this is probably next characters <:hmmge:1015313814624931951>
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

the problem is that everything get doompost
yea it did
Centi is the best one
Centi, Dolla, Rupee
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
Remove some stupid emotes and add Kkona in here
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Where is the /
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
It depend on the position

<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
SN should have been a Flamethrower because being a flamechaser is not enough to get 5 ego signets from the start
SN need like 5 ego signets for a normal run
The office episode 2 ?
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
yea i was confused for a bit because someone sent a clip in here that said EoP Pri is only good on Aponia<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
so far i don't see any bad response about Pri EoP on Abyss
wait you need to do a combo atk with HTR for support role ? <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
it's against the rule alright

Lmao
Wtf
Bro
Add this one
They’re also both CEOs of The voice acting company Mihoyo are working with
Yea same person
Only catch them on other VAs occasionally
I wish Zhongli and Jean CN VA could do some streaming <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
The trigger for example
You can always pull other things
Dude actually use his irl laugh for Itto
I also like Itto CN VA
Yea he is a beast
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
He said free if they’re a girl
I remember someone used to ask on Kinsen stream how much would he charge to record for them a “ good night “ session but with Kalpas voice
CN
He is Kalpas VA in Honkai
Kinsen voice is hot tho
For no reason <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Kinsen had to trace back who swiped it for him to give them back the money
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
The fan just want to do it
They do
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Also Xiao VAs was in the same situation, his UID got leak out and his fans sent primogem for him to C6 Xiao
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Even before she can scan it
I remember Hanser did it once by accident and her fan just scan the QR for her
If you’re some famous streamers on bilibili you can’t show your UID on Genshin or QR code for Honkai when you swipe
He should have used female avatar to be a vtuber <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
Probably will need like 480D
Yea probably temp is still not high enough
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Like it doesn’t have that impressive feeling of S2 AE
Her SS is actually kinda not that impressive rn tho idk why
I was gonna ask for SSS HTR
Oh for a second i thought gresham mean he will do charity funding
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Probably no if i have to guess
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
Yea on like ice contents
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
Can S0 HTR dps btw ?
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
Ain’t no way someone got that but not me
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
SS
Time to sleep til Aka
Goodbye world
I got 500 with Nyx <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
Using AE in 2023 <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:hmmge:1015313814624931951>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Can’t even use HTR
My QUA option is Nyx
You know what is the worst situation
JK HB iirc <:hmmge:1015313814624931951>
So does rope and glock
I don’t think 300 is gonna make it to Myriad buddy <:mfw:840549220406263859>
And sleep
Just use the HoT rot nini <:mfw:840549220406263859>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Gresham about to brag he only get 700 on Tona while others can’t even clear
Do this <:worrykmstears:398047796399439873>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
Put Tesla M in there
Just test it with Mei M
Kinda broken for dps then
What is Irene effect again
<:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
Full Irene
Zhenyi TB Handel M/Mei M
Only apply to HTR ofc
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Handel Eden is better than Turg Eden for FR dps nini
But yea don’t do it unless it can gain you sth
Eden does deal shit ton of damage with her pri
I watch new Alpha cinematic and it’s still rough af
the smoothness is not on Honkai level yet
Just character
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
If i quit honkai probably will whale some in Nikke for collective purpose
Elysia’s treatment
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
If they even show any sign of disrespecting her suit in 6.5 i will end this game
I will probably S0 4/4 Kiana > S0 4/4 Mei > 3* Elf and decide later on to SS or not
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
CN only
It’s Bchips iirc
Actually 3 times, 1 for each round
1 time only
Only on select nini
It’s the same with last year
How was the result ?
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Neko just stop speaking poor people language
<:DK:840944972383780874>
You just change the leader
No it’s actually for 1  team
On a team that trigger QTE conditions is that their teammates exist
Why do you need forced QTE
<:DK:840944972383780874>
The ult CD is at 3* so it’s 3*
3
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
<:whip:1024122299034632272>
I still have no idea what make her top scoring this boss
9s DA
Meele HoC -> Ice RPC -> Bleed HoS
Rough start but everything will be alright
After Tona this patch become a normal one
Next week <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
We’re at Android C server of CN
SEA and GLB are getting there
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Temp is too high for absolute no reason
I think in CN even with the gloves S0 PE = SS HTR on FGO
And trio will still outscore PE <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
It’s a decent upgrade for S0 yea
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Oh right the gloves for FGO in Week 2
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
You can do every 2 days
the new event of new chapter, not daily but you need to clear 4 times per stage
<:DK:840944972383780874>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
3 sidestages that let everyone have reality check
Ganesha, Bio Mobs Lightning and this one
Truly the new gen valk
Also dps HTR rot is actually braindead
With shitty dodge mechanic
It was made for BKE
This is 1 of the hard sidestage yea
Tell them to pull the trigger
Her dps rot is alright but control is kinda garbage
I tried HTR dps on that stage and i actually clear it
<:DK:840944972383780874>
Or even lower than that
Temp was like 10D lower
Last time we had this side stage
<:DK:840944972383780874>
Reality check
Yea maincord yesterday some new face have mental breakdown in there
They can’t do shit
Lol i think S0 PE and and MPE is omega trash in this stage at this temp
yea it's life gift
<:DK:840944972383780874>
she needs double ego start and even then all her relevant damage are ranged
it's literally impossible to do ER rn with HTR <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
Rapunzel > Pepper > Mary = Emma
Oh you’re asking about Nikke <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
Weird question but JingWei
Cez B alone is better than any combinations that need ult to proc
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
It’s not TDM increase, it’s TDM taken
Cez B alone is already better than that
Not as good as Cez B
While you can do combo every rots
So anything that need ult to work is only good on paper and not actual gameplay
You can’t ult every rot with HTR before SSS
For some small damage increase
Oh it doesn’t work, it just for her own damage, the Aslaug T is there just to trigger 2 pc effect
Due to having weapon at least
On another thought, even if your PE is not 4/4 she will still perform better anw
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
If you have 12/12 tho
Scuffed HTR won’t beat 12/12 PE
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Why do you want to use dps HTR anw
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Im 4/4 heki, i don’t speak poor people language
Rotation will be slower but those combinations are on the same performance with Turg
If Turg is not available 
- For fire : Candy/Aslaug T + Aslaug M + Cez B 
- For lightning : Candy/Irene T + Tesla M + Cez B
<a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
yea
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
she does look hot
<:DK:840944972383780874>
SA pri
you know what HoS need
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
fucking SA in 2023
she is using SA
HoS dps is still good it's just that
yea physical dpses now are like 3 years old and 1 year old
while new Herrschers now have to compete with some of the most broken shit ever
HoV was competing with trash <:Gladge:967779035549663242>
cause different players have different read on meta regardless
yea isn't it just fucked for newbie ?
B alone won't also do shit
Alright
Barely reach it by 6.4
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
Owomath 73720-6000-10640
Owomath 38*280
6k xtals + 38 cards atm
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Owomath 44800 + 10920 + 18000
Owomath 120*150
Owomath 39*280
Owomath 160*280
I will need around 160 * 280 + 39 * 280 + 120 * 150 at the start of 6.4
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Fund me for SS1 pls gresham, only 60 pulls needed <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
So you have to know when to ult and when not to
It depend on rot, before SSS you can’t ult every rots
The breach coming from the ult
You have to
Unfortunately
That is actually most Nirvana nowaday
<:DK:840944972383780874>
They’re competing with Twitter for Dumbass Award
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
That’s like the 5% of unfortunate
I saw someone said they went 530 for SSS
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
How was Gresham pull went ?
if keep pulling that is
that pull progress is the same with me and nini, probably end up like me and nini regardless
so it's fucked anw
at that point you would probably get another card
you would need to do 58 pulls
The whole room went frozen
I even remember during a meeting, her temper was off the chart that when my boss was reviewing the new project, she hit him with a “ Just take your time, don’t need to finish it as quick as last night “
I remember in my old workplace, my boss’s boss is his wife so everytime they had a fight at home. The next morning would have the most awkward atmosphere ever
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Yea Mihara is not the worst one
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
World after armagedon
It’s basically an Dystopia setting
But she doesn’t want Mihara to be sad so she just cope with it
She knew
They were actually forced to do the BDSM thing given by the higher up
It’s Yuni
She just knew that she can put her trust in her sister but she no longer recognise the sister anymore
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
Her memory got wiped out after an outrage and she can no longer remember  her sister
Mihara life is tragic <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
Axia also good but she is B1
Yulha and Alice are good yea
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Instead of PX
Bro why did cata talk like she has SS 4/4 AE
there are also people 190 pulls in and barely catch S2
great job tet
actually a good team for once
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
she put JST on HTR
if it make you feel any better
<:DK:840944972383780874>
not even enough for S1
i think he went 110 pulls and end up with S0
fragile is even more awful
so yea, it's the all in angle
got 1 card
so i pull another 20
110 pulls in and i was 5 frags from S2
yea my pull progress was so fucking off
full 190
SS + 35 frags
their gacha system is just fucked up in general
or even offrate
they probably have some days that 100 pulls and no uprate
if you think about it
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
i struggling to find who asked Tet
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
if you get weapon in first 3 that is
so it can be lower
but you have 1 free box
39 is for 4/4
92
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
i think she only want full atk in Trio and at SSS for general team
when on FR you need actual animation cancel and sometime it won't even work
she is literally QTE in, ult, ult, AAAAAAAAAAA
unless for hitcount
no one care about her gatling gun in actual gameplay
it look clunky if you only do the tutorial
<:terikms:659698680344870922>
the only thing you need to aim playing this game is your head
Vill-V = braindead valk
FR = clunky queen
that is tripping
and i have no clue wtf am i supposed to see
im looking at Benares ref for HoF HoT HTR
<:DK:840944972383780874>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
her combo is what actually deal damage
HoO ult is just for applying debuff
SSS HoT and SS HTR
<:DK:840944972383780874>
329 pts
found 1 ref
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
HoT won't even be able to kill the mobs
sorry i lied, no one in CN used HoT during Tona, their temp were 490
yea you can, HoT FR HTR <:DK:840944972383780874>
HoO is still S2 or bust <:senthink:995298360317706300>
the first part is unskippable cause of important info
you can still skip
<:life:1001518241610485781>
<a:noted:1026163529759342692>
my friend just got grived from FOCA, stop at 60 and still no weapon yet after 3/4
you can also pull the trigger too
i trust in nini's money
i don't trust in luck <:DK:840944972383780874>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
all the purple in there talk like they're T10 so i think they're all the top dog
<:DK:840944972383780874>
CN discussion regular
that is some F2P strat right there
shameless also pull another Zaychik set cause he didn't know what affix to use at SSS
then he put in another 1k
shameless also told me he stopped at SS
i'd rather believe maincord having brain than mimi stop at S0 at the end her supply
that's her face when you put JST and CB on her
kinda fucked up tho
they actually lose the 80/20
yea
time to end this game forever <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:NovelHmm:1047176032668635176>
im thinking if i should go for Griseo red riding hood
<:DK:840944972383780874>
i used all 3 of mine on HoF
only the ult strat
you pull yet gresham ? <:DK:840944972383780874>
and do FOCA for the rest
fragile went 110 i think
i don't think anyone that still have competitive grindset stop at S0
Eden ult deal shit ton of damage
lol if you have EoP Pri and do Eden ult after HTR ult
Only craft it when you feel like you need it or you have another gun
Slowdown champ
Yea that feet is DA’s
CB19
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
I thought it was HTR
We about to see JST HTR from Tet
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
Zhenyi
In like 3 more hours
Gresham won’t wake up until 9
30 xtals
New code : TRUTH63
lethal is 1.75
my what now <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
just triple sp cost and sp/s
so far that is the answer i saw the most yea
but could have used some luck
so not like im gonna complaining
yea this is avg
That’s not bad
1 frag more than me
Lmao
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
How was the pull went ? <@385655541248163840>
Heki poor is not the only thing of you that need charity
The 1 card pop up at the last 10 pulls
I got SS and 35 frags <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
When is the next transfer
Nini im broke
<:DK:840944972383780874>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
lost 20 pity because a card suddenly pop up when im already SS0
my pity count got grieved <:DK:840944972383780874>
just CB 19
unless you want to play affix gaming which only benefit SSS HTR
not really
could have been way better but it's fine <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
whatever, good enough
no luck around
had to go til 190
fucking
<:nooooo:971478297185759272>
<:dongerj:981641448057356289>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
It’s average
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
So they have to give her new one
She probably lost Type HoS to HoR
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Should be yea
1 of the 2 is Bleed HoS
she is near the egirl level
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
do you have any idea how large SEA population is
I almost got killed by all the noise
Traffic is horrible wtf
It’s near CNY in Vietnam now
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
last time i asked Frann, dude also got kicked out of his armada for yapping about Mei in armada server
<:DK:840944972383780874>
this one background is too bright <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
head to CN social media real quick <:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
time for new Kiana pfp
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
the only recent change i see is Gresham's pfp
time to change game
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
yo <@385655541248163840> , less than 24 hours until HTR supply, send me the paypal before that thank you
10k xtals
<:DK:840944972383780874>
probably ? <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
oh they push these changes so that everyone can test new rots before V3
next week
that's broken
9x 6.5%
6S
and you get her when 6.4 is up
you just need to finish story in 6.3
no
the screen will be like the sky in new year
my gosh she deal super damage now
but i can't shit on him cause he genuinely like Mei
that guy is a professional yapper
<:dongerj:981641448057356289>
split scaling
what's up with that
i thought she is having damage trouble
wait they nerf her personal damage ? <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
after QTE +40% TDM for team
they also put more team buffs in her kit now
right before V3
that's a lot of fixing
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
they fixed almost all the current strats that are being used in beta
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:COCKBedge:939253294994436176>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
shit is broken
AE stamps for 2% fire buff
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
why tf they keep giving out MPE stamps
that pack is so bad
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
so the game just blow up in the West
and streamers play it to ride the hype train
the West just play it cause it look like Zelda BOTW
yea so far i don't think Mihoyo even do that outside of China
it's in contract with Twitch iirc that company need to occasionally giving out bounty such as  Play genshin for 3 hours  ,  Watch 3 amazon prime trailers 
oh it's bounty im pretty sure
i only know Mihoyo giving bounty
does Genshin even do sponsor stream ?
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
they even test CN stigs with HoO
like 7 or 8 sth <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
But it moreso boost the gap between her and AE/PV even further
Ofc it is
<:DK:840944972383780874>
0/4 is already broken af
She won’t be
Until SSS
Also her rank up after SS0 is useless for supporting anw
Unless nini transfer the rest soon
Not happening <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
If i get SS before 110 ofc i would still stop
That’s me tmr dw
<:life:1001518241610485781>
<:KianaFish:423917411465560065> ?
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
Yea TW have their own server so the rev make sense
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
Is ENG = NA + EU + SEA ?
Because people in that channel still struggling to read
Should have put that slowmode on lore instead
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
Why does that emote called dead from drugs ?
<:DK:840944972383780874>
You will never find me using swear words outside of this server
If you keep shitting on idiots
You get used to it
Cause dude is so retard but he keep thinking he is in the right
The mod dude i mean
Tbh if it were me i would just quit the server
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
I shit on that mod last week too
Fragile is pulling what i did last week
can't you just put it on HoS instead and still run Cez SI ?
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
wait why Felis
fucking <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
highest score so far that i see from you Tet
you can still cope for 600 with Shui
sound like a plan <:DK:840944972383780874>
heki is still living in his bubble
this shit is too painful
will probably do triple supports tmr
<:DK:840944972383780874>
im out
i just did 10 MPE runs and my QTE refuse to crit 8 out of 10
more relaxing than MPE run
if you play triple supports that is
i would slap her ass <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
with low support ability
Kiana is still stronger than HoF, it's Mei that dragging the team down
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i want to shit on this guy but maincord is having 30s slowmode, i can't even mock them
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
Mei's stig having shit support aspect because Kiana is too weak
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
she literally one shot the boss in timestop
her run is not even stacking shit
this one is real
yea the 59s was photoshopped
it's not even a photoshopped like the HoH 59s one
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
lmao what the actual fuck
unless she can pull out a glock to shoot that outfit is nothing special
i think the effects are good, the concept is too simple
yea there is no COPPA in Asia <:DK:840944972383780874>
always wash your hands <a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
wait i thought you got demoted last cycle, how come you still have that many trophies ?  <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
so i just advise him to ignore SoE for now
upgrading SoE to kill the dog cost too much
tbh with how many pris we have next
<@906785655823147028> are you winning son ? <:DK:840944972383780874>
so he demoted cause he listen to me
i told him to not upgrade SoE tho
he also got demoted in Huodou
yea reptar is getting back to RL soon
the only physical dps he has
probably using PE
and even he is not 117 low
i know for sure that reptar is struggling this Abyss because he has no MPE, SnS or Paga
that's like doing a blind run and dip
yea that's too low
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
budget Harran
A rope
You know what is not expensive ?
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
Why would you seal the chicken
HoT has advantage on a lof of thing
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
as long as i don't reach cap coins yet
yea me too, i actually think ER is fun <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
i don't really need ER coins but it let me feel like im doing ER for something
i won't be able to if i reach max cap for ER coins <:DK:840944972383780874>
i want to test HTR ER
i save it for Thursday <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
as if she already doesn't expensive af
like giving HB CB19 Pri now is the same as executing HoH even further
<:DK:840944972383780874>
just stronger buffs but with CB 19 pri the one that have to be kicked out will be the dps instead of JK
<:DK:840944972383780874>
being you
when HoS get another boss
but no boss in Abyss to test
i know for sure it's good for MA
btw do we know the truth about upgrading GD Pri is a bait or not yet ? <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
breach
wait until he show up again and people might tried with HoT + HTR
no <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
for current CN RL temp
but Kiana can do well on it
it's Lightning Wolf dw
so Wolf is coming back soon
6.4 beta does have Wolf <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
Inukai did
Jayson doesn't ping for Affinity fanfic
the only useful thing inuka ever did is restraining himself to not ping everyone every 60 seconds
no
after Turg RC die
i'd rather kill myself than having to deal with another RNG layer
yea i heard that it's good but people in there keep pretending that putting Turg in Bronya is a good idea when you have to run JST GD or JST CN  <:DK:840944972383780874>
wdym Gresham, maincord told me that Turg is enough for everything <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
10 pulls 2 stigs
or it can also go really well
 Just get lucky 
but i prefer the old way
good guide <:DK:840944972383780874>
nice strat <:DK:840944972383780874>
i hope i can get 5 cards in 190 pulls <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
nini it's missing a 0, can you transfer the rest soon <:DK:840944972383780874>
GLB and SEA apartment are the least competent branch i have ever seen
yea cause they update the 6.3 Benares for us in 6.2
no more RC on Benares
oh wait, this week we can finally have the team for Benares <:DK:840944972383780874>
yea, do the full combo with SnS before switching to Senti
yea you do
or else triple supports just better due to flexible rots
you need to save as much points as possible <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
i don't even know what does BE do
If it’s worse than GMN
It doesn’t matter
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
Wdym by enough
2pc is literally worse than GMN
2 pc SSwords is not a real combination
Yea, just use GMN on Senti and Tesla T on SnS
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
Do you have Tesla T ?
2 more days
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
Pardo yea
catching up to Android server soon
SEA is 473 <:DK:840944972383780874>
im waiting til Thursday to do ER <:DK:840944972383780874>
Break this <:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
when you're at trouble, make it double
i got one for oyu heki
nini helping like usual <:DK:840944972383780874>
that dude even use HoV to tickle boss
hak you're in RL
0/10
<:DK:840944972383780874>
budget runs
so HoH actually has more bosses than her
on QUA weather you can also use HoH
MPE only has like 3 T1 bosses if we're talking about SSS MPE vs S0 options
does she ?
hey <@385655541248163840>  there's 3 days left until bronya, pls dont' forget to send the funds <:DK:840944972383780874>
And search it from NQN
You can check the name of each emote from that serie on this person profile : 
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Korean company always making hit games for these kind of gacha
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
They also focus a lot on music
Events so far were also all good
Yea like i actually enjoy the game for its gameplay and story
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
But Nikke is doing better than i expect it to be
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
The game is making the same profit with a casino
You also physically can’t surpass Genshin total rev even if you want
Basically total CN revenue = triple IOS revenue
In CN you physically can’t track down Android revenue due to too many brands use Android for their phones so the best way to do is double IOS revenue to estimate it
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
4 ignite trauma is kinda small too
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
There is a CD on adding ignite trauma to her basic and combo
Wait i still don’t get it, how come HoFin keep the ignite 24/7
Not all kindness lead to good things <:evil:1049317760984940574>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
Realistically speaking they’re not that strong in Abyss, it’s just that their waste movements can be cut down due to their timestop ability
<:DK:840944972383780874>
Yea skipping CN look fine now if you plan on using trio for all fire contents
<:DK:840944972383780874>
And that shit is broken af
Her M piece do yea
2 RNG layers gone and this boss become punching bag
cause Moon Soul is both used for AKA and BKE
then click on the 3rd tab for recent release
Nirvana Ignite Moon Soul Truth
btw <@370438895965306882> , for accurate search you will need this 寂灭点燃月魂真
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
sharing is caring
just add this in 真
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
This shit deserve a restraining order
That MLXG copypasta is too good
<:DK:840944972383780874>
Good thing im a collector only
Oh yea so extra 50 pulls
What is the deal with special supply again
You will need like extra 50 pulls for her to S2 i think ?
She doesn’t have free stamps
They will add her stamps in ER soon
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
He is making it too obvious
i do like watching speedrunning stuffs
well ER is fun if you're into speedrunning <:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
should have made HoFin timestop only last 10 seconds but you can do whatever you want until timer run out
<:DK:840944972383780874>
as far as i can tell
yea and also on some bosses where damage is not a problem, they can't compete with HoT anw
but i did enjoy it
i spent 5 hours on Abyss FGO to practice the transition too
i know that feeling <:DK:840944972383780874>
yea if you have to mald for it that would be kinda monkaW <:DK:840944972383780874>
and pause the whole stage to destroy the crystals
swapping look fun tho <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
kinda crazy how special QTE can reduce swap CD immediately
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
press the ult and get out for Kiana to pause
they swap Mei in for like 0.5s
they did
<:DK:840944972383780874>
wow 9S trio stealing one by one
another one
<:DK:840944972383780874>
HoT is so strong they make a whole team based on HoT
<:DK:840944972383780874>
<@148145559897636865>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
yea, TFT league <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Pulao is the name of a dragon
my mental just went boom from TFT, time to head to maincord to shit on people <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
heki wtf are you even talking
Pulao
see you guys in PGR 3 months later <:DK:840944972383780874>
FBI on the move <:DK:840944972383780874>
hei also went missing the same time with bruh
it's nearly 2 weeks since he went MIA
btw where is bruh
<:dongerj:981641448057356289> <:dongerk:1061701790640373861>
dongerk
i was looking for this
<:dongerk:1061701790640373861>
it was supposed to be here 2 weeks ago
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
due to lockdown in Shanghai
my fucking HoF figure is delayed again
also
sure bud <:DK:840944972383780874>
where is the Elysia figure inside the case ? <:echok:977515701961117706>
probably SPA weapon
oh you mean what weapon
the rope
can't say for sure how mald the fight is with only footage
yea just HTR team
actually a skilled boss
Otto is fun if you don't have to deal with the thought to oneshot him
<:DK:840944972383780874>
i had ton of fun with HoF so that 2k is still worth
i felt the same during 5.5
deal with it nini <:shrug:1016228944330100757>
1 RNG layer gone
ignite Bella is also less mald now, no more Turg RC
the only thing that make AKA hard is the line up you use
she is literally a punching bag now
like no joke
AKA is actually pissed easy lmao
<:DK:840944972383780874>
where is my super fund
nini <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
even MPE kit look good in combat when all she does is jumping backward
there is no such thing as boring when you use it in combat <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
that thing is gone forever ever since the change
<:DK:840944972383780874>
it's gone
the stig box still have a chance to get screwed over by weapon being the last piece you get
cause the box in 110 milestone is what reduce the RNG by a lot
it's 110 pulls that is a must
like imo even 60 pulls is not a must
cause on avg you spend the same for 1 uprate piece
it's better to just stop
if you get her under 30-40
the rotation is good if you pull for HTR
<:DK:840944972383780874>
starting from the Bull
if anything i'd try to go to Nirv in 6.3 week 2
that sound broken <:DK:840944972383780874>
MPE lead too
probably <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
you need to break 3 shields to finish boss fight
Kallen -> Judah -> Kallen iirc
cause there are 3 shields to break
you still won't
cause you get shieldbreak bonus from killing the 1st shield
Kallen's shields are still not as heavy as Otto
you always lack dmg to kill the shield
there is no such thing as overkill with shield in Nirvana
<:DK:840944972383780874>
nini is thinking back about her first prom
yea it's the reason why Lightning will never have a QUA dps <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
use your best team <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
it doesn't iirc <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
you better do my next Abyss gresham
when everyone out here malding for Abyss you're laying your ass off on vacation <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Super Kick is fastest clear atm
yea ER <:DK:840944972383780874>
im still fucking blind by the trio gameplay <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
you can unlock everything except 1 with just 3* ?
so it's bug atm ?
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
aight <:Ayo:983495219699933204>

kinda fucked up but it is what it is <:mfw:840549220406263859>
when HoFin and HoO wasn't online yet
he posted in V1 Friday
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
consider it's near CNY
i did expect it to happen
yea they also removed the HoV pose
nani ? <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
her best build now is the Super Kick
<@416445660443967491>

<:DK:840944972383780874>
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
the hit game Jenshin Impact ?
wait for some testing <:DK:840944972383780874>
para has ICD
there is no way
this elf trigger a full ignite ?
yea there is not a single instance where ignite ran out
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
100 pts higher than S0 HoF
isn't that like
814
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Greshi actually scammed my 70 pulls
wow
<:woggerswhale:653576160231424040>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
only 5 days left until pulling day
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
where is my fund greshi, did you forget my paypal ?
that's sick man <:mfw:840549220406263859>
not apply to everyone
lol it's just for minmaxing
Another valk that want 2 stig set
But on other teams she want sp reduction and sp/a
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
HTR has 75 sp in trio mean she will want full atk then
Now that i think about it
I will just all in on Wafers
<:DK:840944972383780874>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
Yea probably just SS2 HoF and max dorm or wafers then
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
With CN and HTR sp regen
Im not sure if you should go for S2 HoF as of now
What’s that nini, the amount of pulls you have ?
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
<:nerdge:980201016853164144>
But Kiana look good yea
Dudu is probably still the budget one if you only want 1 elf tho
And a good gather
Look broken for fire
<:nerdge:980201016853164144>
Yea
Umm actually you can use HoT on Kallen cause she also deal physical damage on her Basic attack <:nerdge:980201016853164144>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:DK:840944972383780874>
Just in time for Kallen
they should be tied
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
it look like S0 HoFin > S0 HoF but im curious about S0 HoFin vs S1 HoF
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
she will still be use at least 1 per patch
probably still SSS CN
what's wrong <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
:Cumge:
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
Should have played this one first before It Take 2
Bruh i just played A Way Out and it feel unpolished compare to It Take 2
<:DK:840944972383780874>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
His refs are like 1 of the most fucking annoying refs to follow
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
Yea but my hands are not fragile’s
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Gresham is in beta smoking all the fragile’s guides to trick me into 190 pulls HTR
Yea it’s from login box
I remember not, could ask Gresham to check, he is in beta
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
1 run and sleep
Easy +0
QUA shill is the best tho
HoO stamps in ER
<:DK:840944972383780874>
<a:SeeleNoted:874736846259781692>
need HTR for better score ?
so new pri not making any diff on BKE for the usual rot <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
The rot is probably not fully optimized too since he still use TBand
I think fragile did post a MA vid with HoT + HTR
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
BKE = PV + HTR
If you mean the opener then no one use GD in BKE anymore in 6.3
Im not sure about Abyss but MA you can upgrade it just fine
time sure flies
wait what <:Ayo:983495219699933204>

If you get her below 60 then just stick to the plan but if more than that i’d try to push 110
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
Bonya is the friend that your parent trust wholeheartly and you use her when you want to go on a date with your actual lover

Bonya was not even on the fan art during anni
APHO Senti stun SP
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
It took 3 years for AE to finally die
Like not even joking
Yea 0/4 Bonya already does
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Kinda fun
Yea using 0/4 HTR to kill those RL contents
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
Somehow he actually enjoy Bonya

in CN they call her 月魄, the 2nd part of her name, Moon Soul  <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
寂灭月魄 471
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
so just wait to see if you need to upgrad SoE or not
it's Huodou next and Kallen later
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
if there is no benefit then don't
same go with next Huodou and Kallen
if you think you can promote with lv 65 7T then upgrade it
whatever can get you benefit immediately
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
cause so far everyone said she only work with S2
i really need them to add HoO stamps in ER or spending
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
that's actually not the reason
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
his ?
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
The run is clean <:Ayo:983495219699933204>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
that's 4340 on avg each
you need 13k total from 3 deep trials for full rewards
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
need 300 of it ready for Kiana elf
yea i only use the remote to pick up adv mats <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
like literally just enough
they give you enough for all of it iirc
do the story
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
just use the remote
for example you're 3 tiles away from the mirror/mat
you use the remote to pick which number you want
1 last ride <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
yea it just depend on temp and rank <:DK:840944972383780874>
<:dongerj:981641448057356289>
she is struggling to deal damage
and IO dmg is already low on this temp at S0
it's 20% vs 50%
on Type Counter weather you have less % dmg buff
<a:GoodTake:1033035960662896730>
this close ? <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
that's the neat part
the more precise your spot is the closer the mobs dropped to each other
the Oz trick is harder than it look
So i have been using VKE for the whole patch
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
CN literally can’t do 2.75 unless you get 3 ego in first 2 floors
This patch suck
I will probably alter between 6S and HTR next patch for ER
You mean Pardofelis <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Decent
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Waiting for 6S ER

<:mfw:840549220406263859>
Heki you need to meet real women
Kiana’s design is not even sexy
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
And then label cool as strong
Human tend to like what is cool and not what is strong
They don’t play Honkai for Kiana, they don’t play Honkai for anyone in particular
And anything that is less than cool consider as weak
Real answer is because people often refer to cool as strong, even irl
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Reading is a gift
Because people don’t read
That is the last one
Not 6.2
It will be deleted in 6.3
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
and HoH also was awkward with her bow form until V3
HoF had a complete revamp on V2
yea that's normal
her animations and hitlag kind of stuff
i think testers still said that HoFin right now feel unpolished to play
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Fresh out of the oven <:evil:1049317760984940574>
AKA coming back next patch but no more AE evade <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
You know if she is dead Mei is coming with her nini
<:OkaygeBusiness:900551897251979317>
I told them “ Where is the Super Suit “ and i got it
They did hear me alright
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Unless deleting account happened
Dw, they don’t care about Chinese players neither

<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
This TFT patch fucking blow
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Only 3 bosses left for 6.2
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>

<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Your account is the result from a chain of making bad decisions
Heki even if she doesn’t need HoFin your account is still fucked either way
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>

I believe that humanity can only move forward if everyone talk like the Bonya
<:life:1001518241610485781>
Before there were grass and river, there were Nini
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Still can’t believe Nini said “can’t believe you’re that young “ when im 27 and she is 27.5
Gresham is the type to do a quick one on the airplane in the middle of the sky if he feel like it
Cause im still young <:evil:1049317760984940574>
Lil bro you’re literally talk like a highschooler
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Bruh is like last year of Highschool, right ?
I mean unless he went MIA for a week he probably just busy studying atm
Probably getting arrested
Who ?<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
I actually want to date a twin at least one, like the movie Justin Power <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
If you went on a date with Seele, would it be 3some or a normal date ?
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
I actually can’t shit on people with good intention
This person is a weird case, i want to shit on them but the problem is that they genuinely think that they’re giving correct advices with a genuine attitude, not doomposting
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Not the elf tho
Oh yea 100%
Lil bro is being cringe again
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
We beat the kid now ?
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
It’s Mei that look like Kiana’s sidekick that can’t work on anything else
Kiana look good on general fire weather cause she doesn’t have tight rotation like in her actual team
Consider what Kiana has been through, a little trauma is not surprising <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
It’s kinda obvious from the way heki talk. Heki is fated to be bottom, especially 6 feet under
Jingwei Wing is kinda broken, she can heal up to 3k per ult
Time to warm Keqing <a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
My internet just went out
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
Nini you first
Let’s go
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
9S DA tho
HTR handle it iirc
Melee HoC top score is actually DA lmao iirc
Yea shield Kallen
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
All the old valks
MPE also got 1 this patch too
BKE also got 1
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Don’t ask if you don’t know
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
SS HoS is almost F2P now
Could be worse
That’s not bad
i eat the same dish on 5 different places and it all taste different  <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
in Vietnam all the Chinese food have less oil when cooking compare to real Chinese food
yea each chef tend to apply their country culture into the food and not trying to copy 100% the original <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i eat a bowl of spicy ramen and i almost die
what a beast
yea iirc Chinese cuisine literally have 4 provinces that specialize in spicy food<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
i was eating at a Chinese restaurant when i transferred to Vietnam and they literally have peppers in everything except water
Korean non-spicy = White people spicy
:Kkona:
Big Mac
16k <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
only aka look like a beast tho
yea that's a -1 retain spot <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
and i think i only succeed 5-6 times to position the mobs
lol yea i did try for 2 hours
i think i was 80 pts behind Kyo so i watched his ref and decided that a sleep is better <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
that remind me, last Komas i was in Aka and Kyoshiro's bracket <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
buy some skill then
<:whip:1024122299034632272>
we gaming
<a:aworryGaming:945537650146824242>
just play like a beast nini
oh shit next is Lightning BKE <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
what the hell is Project Zomboid <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
yea, HoR can compete again on more than 3 weathers are good <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
and SoE is Bio Slayer
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
in this temp i do expect HoR to be way better than BKE same rank
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
not like im 100% certain about it
with SSS JK she should be
if she ever show up again
maybe on Type HoS too <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
If you time it with her weapon active
But her hitcount is decent without it
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
SSS
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
she won't
30-40 short from cap score in Nirv
Not bad
there are only 2 good players in your screenshot, 1st and 6th <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:keqshrug:830244288028999681>
Mathing
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
They have to opmize them more in V2 V3
No need to learn anything now
I watch some Trio gameplay and i realised
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
See ya
I need to watch some New Year movies
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
It’s Moon Mode, Sword Mode, Time Mode alright
still 12 hours until i can start shitting on people again
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
that is too much words
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
that even bad players can retain 1 or 2 cycle
Nirv right now is so so easy
<:nerdge:980201016853164144>
i will need them to post their retain history
tbh even for Nirv players now
<:Ayo:983495219699933204>
how is that even possible
they're 1 demotion close to AG2
tbh someone also just posted <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
if you do that now it will instant pause the game <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
so they just change the course
but players complain too much about HoH in ER
nah they definitely want to do it
tbh i think it's fine
yea it will still be big regardless just not as big for The Trio like other teams
just a so-so idea
not a good thing either
which is not a bad thing
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
i mean her 3S is still busted, just not in trio
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
no flame
they actually make The Trio for player like heki
yea i think it's not that bad but i also think it's not good
there is no way
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
i like your magic words
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
i actually don't even know what am i even looking at in ref
and you will regret pulling all 3
use that team more than 3 times in Nirvana <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
it's lit
wow idk what even happened in that vid
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
that rank up is a little bit coincident
<:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>
What is that emote
You don’t want Super Cutscene ?
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
60-70
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
The only thing im good at is chatting
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
She is just AE with timestop
cause HTR look so mald to work with tbh
Kiana is the one im more confident to invest
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Just wait
They can add in the on/off button for it
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
No more Super Kick
It switch to Super Cutscene
No
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Yea the kick is cooler
After 6.4 if she die she die
I actually have a lot of fun using her with HoF so she is already worth it
Not bad
Only got 1 wrong
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
I will see how the pull with HTR go first
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Thanks the lord nini always got my back
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
That’s not what you told me in 6.1
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Can’t watch anything
Im still haven’t back to home yet
How does that work
You want to do Bronya - Kiana - Mei - Kiana
As far as i can tell
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Wonder how strong they’re together
They’re both normal S-rank standalone
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
It will be in ER
Need more movement from Mei
Yea it look stiff
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Maybe they will give free S2 in ER
SP valk <:DK:840944972383780874>
Moriso has it
Even her expa scream SP
Mei is literally the SP
Cause this is still pretty much standard team
Yea i think the schedule is just fucked
A whole team got introduced
I think the problem is more about timing
Dps - S rank support - SP valk, no ?
Realistically are they even that expensive <:HMM:966625453194485760>
If there are even 1
It just look like a pain to learn new trio optimal rotation
Dw, tmr i will be back <:life:1001518241610485781>
Old Hua suit vibe
I like Mei’s skill concept
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
I will look into it tmr
I mean the exciting part of beta is testing various teams in Abyss and MA
I don’t think they add it to beta yet
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
She is free
That is expected
<:evil:1049317760984940574>
Easy promote
In a good way
Your bracket is just absolutely shit
is it mainly Kiana or you have to switch to dps with Mei too
i really want to see how does the new trio play out <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
in the new event <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Kevin uses the bat and score a homerun with Su's thermal mug
ain't no way <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Nini said she got me on the 1st and 3rd so im safe
yea 370k is 9s 
~180k 3S Kiana
~50k-70k 3S Mei
~120k-130k 3S Bonya
It should be up by now
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
I will keep shitting on idiots until i get banned from that server
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Bun bun ofc
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Only valks appear in the story
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
Looking at this am i the toxic one
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Probably because a mod warned me after i said someone look good with a rope
Damn i thought i said more, not that many
I do it everyday in maincord
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Im teaching them life lessons
It’s not bullying
<:life:1001518241610485781>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
In lore channel tho
A regular yea
Dude was so emotional that he left maincord and report me to the mods
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
I shit on another idiot
Im muted for 3 days so i can’t shit on these idiots
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
cause human can't be this dumb
it's too dumb to the point that i want to believe it's a joke
can't tell if maincord is joking or not <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
i remember i have to reaffix PV for real cause i miss a tiny bit dmg
Husk is fun when you meet the damage checkpoint <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
yea need some cons to compete with C0 Nahida <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
is he good now
what even happen to Haitham anw nini <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
23/23 is useless
where she need 3x cdmg
and Seele new suit turn out to be physical
only need to affix 5 pieces
it's lit
CNY also have 1 23/23
i still have 3 event affixes for her
cool
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
ain't no way she need some atk
HTR should be full sp red and sp/s right ?
i need SSS JK now
yea her stigs literally change depend on boss with hitcoun shield or not <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Chifuyu <a:Explode:1025665382599630848>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
that's what you get if you let people don't play the game mod specific channel
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
When will 6.3 be over
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
4 pri next 2 patches
We still in the lack of pri resources
Yea i think it’s basically the same
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Will probably be like 40 frags short
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
I think im close to SSS JK after next patch BP
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Just SSS JK
I see <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
What is that use for
Lightning on hit yea
stuff like MC BB HF NS
maybe after 6.4 they will only release meme suits only <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
someday
and we will be free
dw eventually Mhy will fuck up the game
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
and they will have to balance them in V2 V3 again
i predict in V1 The Trio will rampage every bosses ever exist except physical bosses <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
just Kiana herself as an elf
like no twist, no plot
she is Kiana Kaslana through and through
this one is just Kiana herself <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
if not delay that is
3 hours and 30 minutes to download
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
yea a better Sirin and budget Klein
don't know about new Mei
on HoT team at least
it won't powercreep Klein <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
ask the useless mod
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
on the bright side you can probably go with budget team in RL like HoT HTR RC
IMG Kevin <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
he will go  Nothing personal, kid  on everyone
if it's the same as his boss fight it's over <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
require the trio
it will be a blast
i can't wait for Mix Weather Kevin
could have been worse <:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
could be worse <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
which just make it worse
i think even S0 SW is better than SS HoH on this boss
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
im looking forward to hang myself
i just checked their other vids
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
it's SS0 HoH
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
 Truth 
just this one
真
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Doesn’t look like a braindead support
Will probably get used to it as time go but yea
The more i see her refs as a support the more i appreciate AE
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
HTR will feel extremely mald to play around
Ngl
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
cause it mean i dodge their pity like 30 times in a row
i'd uninstall this shit game if it ever happen
100 pulls for EXPA
whoever made this also see the world in black
you need 10k for max rewards
it's to collect the rewards
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
level up the rabbit combat power to 15

<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Back to malding Kalpas and Kallen
Yea she will tickle him to dead if you tryhard enough
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
So she die regardless
He is psy
SW > HoH > MPE ( use RC instead of SI )
T2 iirc
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
No, the interns gather when Abyss end and play some boardgame in that 30 mins to decide the next temp
Adjust the temp, divide brackets, etc
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
No need to care about Shield Kallen
I might not even do Ranged Kalpas
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
HoR + JK will murder it
If it’s any other bosses that are not Kallen
They have to make it to be Kallen
<:DK:840944972383780874>
You’d still be fucked regardless of Paga M
Don’t remember how much tho
The act 3 quest give blue crystals
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
but SUPERSUIT
nothing can stop this urge <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
but WHERE IS SHE
cool
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
im not sure if this one is a downgrade, think it's about the same
with extra BP points
think about the same
lose the pri raid
yea probably
this is during the 2nd and 3rd week
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
1 event = 2 blockade
it replace blockade as a whole
the event is 2 weeks long
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
you already have SUPER CUTSCENES in 6.4
doesn't matter
just change it to Aint No Way
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
there were some super stuffs happened some hours ago
wait, nini didn't have it the whole time ? <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Heki you’re still 17, it’s illegal to use drug
What will that ever do ? Not die by accidentally burn grass with Bennett ?
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
Like the one where they made a bounty for some sheep to test Overworld hidden level
And they gaslight innocence into thinking it’s actually a helpful task
KQM working some of the useless shit ever
It’s still useless like the one 1 year ago
Oh wtf i thought they improved that optimizer already
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
I haven’t touched that site since they revamp it
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
I don’t think there is anyone that upload refs of tripple ice sp on RL
GD PV RC ? <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
omg me too
WHERE IS SUPER KIANA <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
oh just DM the useless mods
Do better <:whip:1024122299034632272>

and Benares
dw
4/4 CN is still good for HoF if Heimdall ever appear again
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
but it's Mei M
sorry i don't speak poor people language <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Heimdall can’t be stole away
She will 100% keep Heimdall
3 more days and i might done forever with this game too
gratz
with this amount of cutscenes they're putting
at best all the suits from Kiana foward will just be meme suit <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
WHERE
IS
IT
so where is it Tet
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
you tricked me into pulling 4/4 CN
also gres, did you see her kit ?
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Where is the SUPER SUIT
Gresham, tell me
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
so she scissor Raven first
but she needs to practice with Raven first
something something want to marry Kiana
Gresham wtf <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
WHERE IS IT <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Aponia takes Ranged Assaka back
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
i was born to shit on idiots <:OkaygeBusiness:900551897251979317>
cause high chance people that i blocked might spread misinfo in other channels
i don't block people even when they make my temper go higher <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
words are not coming too fast out of my mouth, i use them that way
i insult people on purpose <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Just slow on picking up stuffs so often words come out of his mouth too fast
He is 40yo
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
not even just ice weather
on a lot of weathers too
cause decent player use it can compete with below average player that use the correct team
i just mean the team seem actually good
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
reptar hasn't even demoted from Nirv yet
im starting to think this triple supports shit is literally the play here
for no reason
last time reptar was +100 with triple ice supports
free retain for everyone
HoD is literally easy <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
i just want to get HTR card every 20 pulls
i won't ask much but<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
605 is already a decent score
unless your bracket is like 5 myriads in it
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
your score is good enough to retain, dw
Let me know if you found the answer
that's a happy ending tho
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
which is like 70% rev
yea but then you will be in CCP blacklist and have to abandon Chinese's rev forever
a party in CCP support you mean nothing if the whole CCP want to reduce the freedom of gaming industry
to publish new game
and they're all struggling atm
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
but every big gaming company have it
probably, Mihoyo look like they have someone in CCP backing them
the new gold mine
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
even Valorant
and for the past 2 years, CCP haven't let any foreign game to be published in China
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
even Tencent is struggling
CCP is getting strict with game industry
ZZZ will be released on 2030
also you know that HSR keep getting delayed because i think they haven't gotten the last permission paper to publish the game yet <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
they hate their playerbase in general <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
im this close to quit Honkai so they better not delay Super Kiana
Monday is act 3 yea
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
until Monday at least
like even the testers are scared to talk about it
actually no rumor about the characters
if she is alone then ain't no way she will be free <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
31 hours
if it's Mei then Monday
SUPERSUIT ?
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
the problem is the SUPERSUIT
Mei suit will be revealed in story
31 hours
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
back when everything only have 2 HP bars
set is broken
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
it's Fu Hua Musician
oh FHM is not Fu Hua Margrave
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Cinder Hawk + 3/3 FHM
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
not 5 pts
5 tiers
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
so it's lowkey aight
they still use S0 HTR
yea i mean even with their 490D
even CN residences are forced to play with S0
tbh i see that a lot of CN refs use S0 HTR <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
60-110-150-190
it's always 110
around 60k by the time 6.3 hit <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
alright gres, tell me your wisdom, should i do 190 pulls on HTR or 110 and FOCA the rest <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
it's okay, if your age is still on the clock <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

AE in ER = yoga for 20 minutes Finality <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
HB in ER = summon 20 drones
1 of her Ely signet will reduce ult CD
KMB in ER will be a menace to play
only old valk has physical dmg in their ele kit
the last buff is for old valk
she needs to start with 3 Ely before F4
CN is just a bad valk in ER
it's mainly VKE
isn't she clear it under 3m
how can your 3S HoH even taking forever tho
just use VKE <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Cool, where is the box
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
But the correct play is to your chest instead
That’s because people think you have to shoot to your head
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Just remember heki, a glock is less painful than the rope
<:susbeeGun:823987933353869354>
It’s a secret

Not yet

I don’t have much experience in self restraint, i only restrain people

Look good
I like Pu Lao’s design
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Just in time then
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
When will Pu Lao rerun btw
PGR <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Im this close to quit this game forever <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
With no box
Or another HTR supply
If Mei is alone in 6.4 mean she will have normal Foca and Expa
And the discount we have is pull 190 pulls
It would mean 3 S-rank back to back
Problem is not just that <:borrySit:1001445019661639680>
And im on the edge of uninstall by next Thursday
All the info are leaning toward Mei only
Yea
And im forced to quit this game
Im actually worry Kiana won’t be in 6.4
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Tet you’re so poor you make all the Blue states hobo look rick
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
CB is dead except for MA so it’s whatever
<:peepoYes:965975508829483030>
For 1/2/3 elements in your team, boss take x/y/z dmg
Also some weird ass abyss weather is coming soon either way
Meta rn is just pray that your investment won’t go to the bin after 1 patch
<:peepoYes:965975508829483030>
You mean 10k <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
You need to upgrade it for better commissions
Only need to mine for those artifacts
Just do commissions
No
Yea 9
not fully optimize
this is just early run
if HTR can do it
yea probably
snipe as in pierce the core in P1 ?
the core have like 10 billion HP jfc
PE on Bull : 
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
As long as you’re physical you will always face crit malding
PE is literally having the same crit issue with every other physical dps
no one play Honkai anymore <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
score is actually kinda close <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Triple ice supports : 

S0 HTR : 
i know it won't profit them but at least let me get the skin
Mihoyo should have reran the collab again <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
but you can get dupe
just like you say, put all the skin in lootbox
because of the lootbox mechanic
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
extremely hate by Chinese
Blizzard and EA are like
they will send trucks instead
if you can get dupe
people will swipe as much as they can
if you can't get dupe
it depend on the mechanic
if Mihoyo do that there will be at least 10 trucks in their HQ's entrance next morning
isn't that what Blizzard and EA doing rn with their lootbox mechanic ? <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
the EVA skin was too good
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
i know some new whales would pay 200$ for that skin
old pyramid skins contain the EVA HoR
wait that is actually a decent deal <:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
I honestly don’t know anything about A3 so can’t help you
It’s a bug they will fix in 6.3 sth
The effect also didn’t connect
It’s not animation cancel if you ask about the bar dissapear when you got hit
then RC and GD dps on it can't be bad
but if the boss is made for HTR
i will update once im home
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
This cycle blow either way <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
All thanks to nini
So game is good again
But nini said she would fund my 6.4 collection
I was burnt out from having to swipe too much
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Heki you can’t even be at 14 unless you skip the last patch rewards
Because waiting on these solium take forever
I need 80 of those skip tickets
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
<:PantsGrab:897468918896160789>

cool bro <:nerdge:980201016853164144>
cool <:echok:977515701961117706>
don't think so
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
heki <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
HoT is still there <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
because she is a good QUA valk
Having expa select after CN/SEA anni patch
it's the normal schedule for GLB
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
That GD is basically weight down the team
only 11 patches later for new AE to show up
this is the same type of people that think AE would get powercreep soon because she was in 5.2 BP
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
dude wasn't joking
that's the problem
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
wait is the whole Central just came to CN chat to shit on that guy <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
i froze for like 5 minutes because i thought we were playing in different 2022
the other day a random dude suddenly show up and claimed that CN is biggest bait of 2022
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
can't really blame him with all the weird takes in that chat
fragile shit on that chat like 99% the time he join
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
i will probably find a big church in here, sing for a bit during Christmas and go home <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
tons of paperwork for new branch
probably last xmas when i was still in Canada
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
not like Vietnam celebrate xmas anw
so the HQ paid extra to work through xmas
i want to have a vacation too but our new branch can't afford it yet <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Barely cross the line to use discord legally
Isn’t cherry omega minor ? <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
But for everyone safety just assume he didn’t
He didn’t tell
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
and she threaten him for cash
Like a dude almost got FBI’d because the girl he had been exchanging nude pic was 16
There was also some crazy drama back when i was still active in their Genshin channel
Mental and family etc
I can’t remember but it has some wild excuses
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
The but is so confident
“ listen man, i know he’s wrong but…”
And dude was like
The dude i mentioned was a 2nd year in Uni
No there are uni and college in there
Miss the most crazy drama ever
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Shit was wild and i was literally so out of loop because that shit happen during 5.0
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
I remember the lead TC of WFP literally defend a pedo
On occassion maybe they get to groom someone
Some streamers paid their mods yea
With 80k manchild
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Cause that channel is literally a kindergarten
You get paid with cash if you’re a mod in xQc’s channel
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Buddy you’re playing a casual game, all the valks are literally the same powerscale
“ Just because he/she got nerfed doesn’t mean they will become bad “
Lol i still hate how all the mods in Genshin TC talk the same
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
Drop the link gresham, i will make them to png tmr to become emotes
Ain’t no way
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
So 56.200 xtals
Oh shit i also need extra 3k for Griseo skin in 6.3
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
7% increase mean 7% more leftover cash for SSS God Mei
better delete these first cause carv still visiting here <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
let me find his Chinese name <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
what's wrong

<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
it was too lit
yea i still remember when Dota Autochess was first introduced

Teamfight Tactics
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
actually still luck based
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
im this close to become a TFT pro
what took you so long to quit this shit game
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
It’s time for 3090
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
on top of that can't even use Turg RC, not like it's a bad thing but shitty damage without Turg RC
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
DA is just annoying to play, you have to play coinflip simulator and time your rot
Aka scoring 764 iirc
9S
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
No more joke
<a:aworryPat:976232062199668776>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Then how come alice call you a gymbro
Just go to the gym baban
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
Time for HoS DK or HoS 2.0
Physical does lose some of their bosses now
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
HoS is a complex valk
It just depend on rot on whether which one you want to use
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
The new gloves have the highest buff for IMG target
MKP have the highest buff for physical
Yea when you want to burst
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
Think cap score Jizo still use DoS
Once a lightning boss appear
But we will find out soon
I honestly don’t know after the adjustment
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
I love Honkai Impact
And the patch after is also double pri
Next patch is another double pri <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
42k xtals <a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
And 6.3 onward it will die forever
Thanks god no more Turg RC in 6.2
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
This Turg RC sh*t is too cursed
Yea im this close to uncap my fps <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
I usually do a turn around after RC ult to buy some time before HoF QTE in
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Just memeing dw
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
No way right ?
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
Unless Honkai can’t make it to March
It’s just weird they gave you guys all anni rewards in the form of xmas presents
There is a 9S HoT in my bracket scoring a huge 300
Don’t have lightning res tho iirc
Think so
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
So they give you guys winter rewards
They anticipated that Honkai won’t last until GLB anni
Wait i got it
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
From CNY login
Yea but it mean that GLB anni will just be 10 cards
Anni rewards ?
Isn’t that
<a:PecoEat:617771723344969747>
i think will get some Korean BBQ tmr, talking about it make me want to try some <:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
is that even enough for 1 bite ?
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
i think PX can also clear some Agony 1 side stage<:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
S0 HC S0 HTR, even CN have F2P like us <:OkaygeBusiness:900551897251979317>
i watched some Tona refs with HTR in it and im starting to think S0 HTR is good enough <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
<:clueless:1030024390190055445>
surely
but this time for sure even CN will be forced to stop at S0/S2 HTR
welcome to China <:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
he is Psy
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
i think this much is enough <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
Nirvana Kalpas
千劫寂灭
Kalpas is a decent bet tho <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
yea i think your friend can try again with Lightning BKE <:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
what was your result last time on HoD <@906785655823147028>  ? <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
but triple ice supports on HoD is actually good iirc, not sure it if require skill or not tho, haven't tried it myself  <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
yea i haven't seen any neither <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
unless they don't have HB <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
if they can level triple ice supports in time for HoD
actually HoD is better bet
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
don't know if it's a good news or not
yea they can go back for HoD
and the run were going so well too
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
Benares can dodge everything, one of my run she dodged my blackhole
yea unlucky, should have held back last cycle <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
it got worse the more teams we suggest
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
Para Lightning Husk
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
and i think CN is fun to use so extra point
but lowkey this boss is fine, the RNG is acceptable <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
so i switch to Hearthstone
i want to try DA too but my first run with DA, Benares sent me to the other side
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
still can't believe reptar actually manage to stay in Nirv for whole 6.1 <:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
Nirv temp rn is also too high for cope team to work too
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
and hope that miracle can happen
yea that will have some sp issue, i think just HoH RC SI
can you bring SI with HoH ?
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
i just think that maybe bringing SI along can do something about it
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
lowkey
maybe HoF CN SI ( SoS + Turg ) might do wonder ?
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
yea i have no clue how to clear the current sidestage with that lineup
<:yaehmm:1051687026090578030>
is your friend name heki or sth <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:OkaygeBusiness:900551897251979317>
yea SoS and Aslaug or Turg on her
SpA - AE/CN - Griseo sound good
does your friend have SS 4/4 SpA ?
how about SpA ?
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
yea no shot HoH can clear it unless 9S
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
if they have fully built ice
actually you can try bruteforcing with HoR
nuh uh
SSS DA and SS AE also score 684
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Benares is tanky af
She deal 0 dmg
Ofc no one will use her
Her unique multiplier is on collapsed target
You need to position Benares or keep retrying until she stop dashing
Does anyone still have her rankup
Ain’t no way her S2 is 15% better than S0
kith, he mentioned S2 <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Is a coinflip simulator
This boss
<:borrySit:1001445019661639680>
and a chance to compete for T100 on Bull <:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
3% more breach is also good if our temp keep chasing CN temp but it's just too expensive
S2 is a decent upgrade so if you feeling lucky then it's good to grab but i think even at S0 4/4 she is already better than SS AE 4/4 ? <:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
addicting to HI3
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
yea iirc some new one got added
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
they also added new side stages too
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
sharing is caring
1 SP and a whole element feel alive like ever, only took them 10 patches <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
i think HC also take back Kosma now with CN ?
actually a decent score
so everyone just rather fly to US for tournament or do some rank match <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
yea they have some restriction on hosting tournament, have to ask for permissions and some paperwork if you want to host anything <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
but diamond gamer yea <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
i peaked Masters in season 7 when elo was bugged <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
back in my Uni it was just League and Hearthstone
 Nice weather, take a 5 minutes walk and back to gaming  <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
but i barely leave my house unless im gaming
yea the weather is nice in Toronto at least <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
i remember on 1 of my week off, i had to fly to NY to participate in a MTG tournament <:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
Canada is actually kind of boring if you want to find gaming local tournament <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
yea Canadian <:coolguy:1052958038883041352>
yea, last year in Toronto, the snow was a little too much so traffic in my area got fucked for 2 days straight <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
my xmas this year is fucked
they don't have snow in Vietnam <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
just use RC
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
we gaming ? <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
190 pulls
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
Start sharing free box pls gresham
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
Heki Turg CN is not real in Nirv
Time to use your 9/13 Fire Team then
I love Honkai Impact 3rd
Nini’s alt in maincord
Pull wiser, not harder <:HuTaoSmart:870878469280628736>
Promote the HTR’s pull guide on official account
You know what Mihoyo should do to distract players from no free box ?
Unlikely, probably act 2 which is Monday <:mfw:840549220406263859>
It will be last straw for me
If they even fail this 1 specific job to release the game main couple together
<a:aworryGaming:945537650146824242>
Kamen Rider Mei soon
New story drop
But tmr we gaming
We gaming ? <a:aworryGaming:945537650146824242>
IOS is not fooling around
20-22k
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
look like someone need a restraining order
all the posts in their CN social media accounts get flooded by comment roasting them except for Kiana's birthday post
do they actually intended to piss off playerbase
idek why Mihoyo is so persistent on this free box <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
The one that walked away <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
God Mei’s model is this close <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
Tmr is story update
I mean maybe Keilo will think again tmr
<a:aworryGaming:945537650146824242>
There is never enough HoD
<:peepoSitGamer:984923819619795034>
6.3 Abyss complete schedule
<:borrySit:1001445019661639680>
Good stuffs
TFT, League, Dota, Rocket League, COD, Valorant
Play other games
if you feel burn out just take a break tet and keilo <:borrySit:1001445019661639680>
That are some creative setup
Why even pull the supply
Tbh if you can only afford weapon on SP supply, you should either pull out or pull the trigger
It’s a famous setup when people tried to pull weapon only
Thanks god they finally make a good version of it
Bleed HoS will just be an easier Type HoS, Type HoS shouldn’t exist in the first place <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
I can always tell you the lie if it make you feel better
Yea i don’t think hekate is worth it
Last type HoS use Griseo sig weapon
Let me check the last Type HoS
Or maybe not
I think
So it’s 1 case Hekate win
6.3 will have Bleed HoS
Probably shouldn’t, we will have double pri in 6.3 and 6.4
It’s only for T1 Jizo right ? <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
<a:smadging:1034847088737005628>
Honkai change so much in just 1 year
New season also just started in other games im playing so more tempting to swipe
Everytime i look at it i just want to swipe on other games
I still don’t like how greedy this design is
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
Im trying to whale less too, my family also celebeated CNY so i will have to prepare a lot of things for traditional stuffs
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
110 pulls and dip ?
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
The goverment cancelled it
I did
Or else i will send a truck to Mihoyo
So she can’t be bad
I just know that she require 190 pulls
Im not keeping up with this beta either
<@148145559897636865> got a surprise gift for you <a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
Honkai on other hand <a:aware:965946296236122172>
All these KR games are kinda tame except the grind
It’s lit
Time to wait for Awk Chifuyu
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
Dog internet connection
Wait nvm, it’s my site that can’t see all the patch notes <:huh:966619839307321394>
I think devs haven’t paid any attention to this server since im start playing
What’s wrong with SEA Counterside <:huh:966619839307321394>
You can use HoT FR PV for easy 400 <:Gladge:967779035549663242>
SS HTR or bust <a:worrySwingSadge:981759583779446866>
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
My only bad take was “ I think Honkai is a good game “
show your trophies count if you're in NIrvana
maincord should have added another rule
<:OMEGALUL:816800661626421308>
and think his takes become legit
dude is retaining in EU Nirvana
nah this dude is just delusional
maincord keep suprising me with their shit takes <:OkaygeBusiness:900551897251979317>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
AE, DA, HoF, CN
i think fire have all my favorite valks
everyone attention are on HTR
cause like, i think she is fine at SS+ but no one bother to test her <:worryWDYM:945713408395849739>
oh he was asking if she were dead or not, i actually don't know how to answer that without including 9S in
idk if she can beat 9S HoS dps without 9S HTR
9S that is
still T1 Melee HoC i think
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
so she net 20%
gain 30% fire dmg and lost 10% fire dmg
get back the fire dmg buff
i will just use AE
for real this time
i will skip HTR
even when you're just a pleb
being competent in Honkai cost a lot <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
probably 5k5 min
4k is kinda low ngl
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
5-6 weekly packs depend on patch, 300 for each, monthly pack 1980 Bchips, BP 1280
not counting outfit and extra packs
i think i spend like 4k Bchips per patch consistently
only 100$
the topup event is chump changes tet <:ICANT:921403877285306399>
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
i promise i won't  swipe anything for the rest of 6.2
me too <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
yea just need 9S <:mfw:840549220406263859>
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
SEA will only get 10 cards tho
yea should be
wdym my budget
buddy you pull for Vill-V and her gears
keep snorting that copium
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
even when it sound logical
logically speaking you can't skip CN in every mean possible
ye the stigs are broken
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
so you need to actually do damage with all elements
i think they change the charging speed of the bars
oh you're right, this week is HTR week <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
but in 6.2 it's RC
they change Benares mechanic in 6.3
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
HoH and ?
who will you use on Kasumi without HoF or HoT
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
6.2 Memorial Arena Week 5
i prefer the former
i mean both options require malding anw, crit mald or learn to play FR <a:aborryPunch:855007511546429450>
yea i only hate her movement, it just feel clunky whenever i put her onfield too long
DA is kinda a bio dps with HTR <:clueless:1030024390190055445>
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
i put Nyx in, 10 runs and then be done with QUA weather
yea, im actually don't have hands to play FR <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
but not as bad as FR clunkiness
well i guess malding for Paga positioning is also kinda bad
it's not that she is that good, they're just forced to use her
if you see someone use FR on QUA
you will encounter bug movement with FR 90% the time you use her
FR is the most clunky valk to play as dps
you know me so well <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
baban, try to guess what im gonna say <:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
neko pull a heki <a:aborryPunch:855007511546429450>
he rolled this patch
but what about 4/4
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
neko why did you roll for Vill-V card again
<a:SeeleNoted:874736846259781692>
oh im just asking cause i don't even know how Vill-V work <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
you can't get off Vill-V turret ?
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
the compensation
but where is
but it's aight, i can understand it, can't really do anything, lot of shit happened in this year from story standpoint
yea the story is coming to its climax so they want to tribute 3 main characters so pacing is cancer <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
what's the context for it ?<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
they don't really care about this cancer pace that much <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
i think most players i know only pissed off about the box
if you're pushing thing this hard at least give compensation
that's take the cake
but no box ?
pacing is cancer but aight, i can understand it from their standpoint
she is just a valk for Myriad with how im seeing people lost the motivation to play even in Nirvana
but you will be fine without HTR
no chance that's happening
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
do you even get any value from S1 S2
also i hate how this valk is S0 or SS+ <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>

<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
it's lit
i will have enough exactly 190 pulls by the time 6.3 hit
aight just finished calculating
They don’t have to worry about 6.3 torus
On the bright side
No easter bunny, no tooth fairy, and no free stigma box <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
you can't get away with murder without proper equipments <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
no it tell you how to get away with orgy in law office
what a disaster
everything is better than 7.5
haven't looked into set 8 yet, just look lit
i play in Garena server but if you want to play stack for the giggle just ping me <:OkaygeBusiness:900551897251979317>
finally have some free time to grind ladder again
yea it's up for 3-4 days i think
TFT new season just started, kinda lit <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Or at least another chapter after chapter 34 and that chapter is connected with chapter 34
Chapter 34 is not the last chapter
There are chapter 35
80% chance it still a double valks patch
20% chance 6.4 won’t be a double valk patch
Good news from 6.3
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>

that's a good new tho
if you don't roll for good opener
Heim is actually terrible
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
what is the command again ? <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
you're lacking a crucial mechanic
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
S2 is already scummy but SS
I still don’t get it, why did they change the usual 3% breach of S- rank from S2 to SS for HTR
So giving free box mean high chance their playerbase can’t get SS+
You see HTR need SS0 for her breaking point
Mihoyo actually want the best for you
Yea ik, i just want to say buddy
Aight buddy
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Can’t wait for the breaking point if Mihoyo keep ignoring the elephant in the room
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
CN is actually pissed off so much
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
190 pulls is fine but this is just scummy
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
Lightning will be fine without HTR, Fire is looking omega sus without HTR after 6.3 tho
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
I expect 13k Bchips when 6.3 hit
Aight gresham, i will DM you my paypal
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Problem is the fund for 190
If you do 190 there is only 20% you can’t SS her
maybe God Kiana and God Mei will have free box
aight since HTR won't have free box
you're typing out a sentence
hak that is not even an emote
sorry bud, Christmas is coming <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
bro why do you have the full movie in your PC/phone
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
like Morbius ?
<a:aborryPunch:855007511546429450>
Yea i think
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

Heki you’re literally a racist
<:whip:1024122299034632272>
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
My transaction just go through so i haven’t even started to play yet
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
Do you need to charge, isn’t her QTE release all the stacks ?
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
gresham, does S0 CN workable this temp or only SS+
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
I can’t even get CN frags, this is rigged
S CN
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
heki your advice is horrible
Time to reserve some trucks in case no free box
Aight
Lin on these nuts ?
Last hope is 6.3 stream in 5 hours and 30 minutes
They’re ignoring all the complaints so chance is slim
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
Almost 6.3 stream, hoping for another banger BGM
I really need to work on that
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
Collecting trash
At some point will it just fade away ?
Why do i feel like your emote keep getting blurry each time you use it
But probably still have enough for Kiana
It’s near my Traditional New Year so can’t spend money recklessly
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
Enough funding to get SS Kiana and everything, probably
So im fine either way
Also after some calculating i have 70% chance to survive 6.4
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
Like for some, they can’t accept mediorce score
It’s the competitive blood that drive people to do it
Fragile also said he would retire Honkai, 10 minutes on bosses and done but he couldn’t do it in the end
Only x2 and monthly pass
When i said i would quit the game it just mean that i will stop buying monthly packs + weekly packs + BP
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
just in time for nothing
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
or she has to be SS0
is S0 CN usable ?
yea nini always have the fund get away
might save me some cash
i need to have RL mindset
turn out Nirvana retainers suck at restraining themselves
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
thought he was skipping her for HTR
fragile pull 4/4 CN ?
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
If it’s the 1st stage then it’s piss easy yea
Does she buff HoF too
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
can i ask for a TLDR <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
6600 Bchips for all of them <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
never use HoT in this fight before <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
oh i see, thought it was Klein <:senthink:995298360317706300>
you will have to wait a bit, no ? <:senthink:995298360317706300>
can you trigger HoT QTE again the 2nd time without Klein like in the clip ?
wouldn't it be impossible to replicate it due to the downtime to trigger HoT QTE ?
<a:SeeleNoted:874736846259781692>
I mean the crafting stig method
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
Have the affixes mats always this expensive when exchanging to coin ?
Isn’t 50% of American are Chinese American now ? <:mfw:840549220406263859>
I thought Carv is a native european ? <:mfw:840549220406263859>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
My name is also as white as possible cause my parents pick the most common white name for me when we moved to Canada
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
Cause nini is literally playing Genshin with her real name
Does Knowing someone full name even let you do anything ?
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
Just hit the button
But if you’re set on to whale then possible
That is some famous last words
That’s like 40 pulls
i did consider that possibility
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
or else i will have to use Turg RC
i hope my transaction go through before Sunday <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
maybe a little more
valk like AE will just be a disaster
the game is all about competition
tbh they can't make valk with extra steps anymore
you don't
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
without QTE in
how do you get all 3 stacks in the beginning again
probably the cards pull
the gears pull were fine
avg is 76
that's already lucky
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
not bad
time for main dish
could be worse
not bad
aight
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
They will announce free box tmr
Only need 150 pulls
You can get 2-3k more from events
That’s not bad
send me the fund before 6.3 hit
aight, i already sent my paypal <:mfw:840549220406263859>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
but she can have some sp trouble in support slot
so you will want to affix full atk
the bull is currently her boss in RL temp i think
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
that one will be tricky
i think it's fine
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
that will cost a lot of affix mats jfc
i guess CN want 3 atk + 3 spcd
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
no
and i was gaslighted
1 time i decided to trust someone from maincord
dude keep telling me CN dmg is not good
i was being gaslighting 2 days ago by a fucker in maincord
lmao
CN's damage is actually huge
monthly + BP
it's like 20k for 6 weeks patch iirc
fixed 17k
5
you can't get HoT until the 4th week
actually you have to complete 4 of them
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
or at least around 5% sp reduction is enough
iirc CN myriad go full atk on her <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
So far good investment
And only 1 cycle need CN
Alright, 10 bosses in 6.2
i doubt GLB will put in effort to refund
just buy everything
even ER coins
yea next monday they refund you all the currency that you used
don't know if they will put that effort into GLB
they refund later in CN
that's a bug
does it even matter <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<:clueless:1030024390190055445>
do what i said, not what i do
do you actually expect us to skip SP gears
Tet
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
probably have to wait 2-3 days for Bchips to come
only need some Bchips to buy those SP cards
my pulls are decent too <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
have you check with Elon Musk ? <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
Bchips haven't gone through yet
nini
<:PaimonClap_Soreko:817090582953328713>
spent 3000 xtals for 500 xtals in ER
it's alright
heki atp you only need to be put down <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:mhpeepoclap:998941254027051028>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
just use 4/4 Raven or Turg RC
but not your Purana Turg CN
ideally ofc you want CN for peak performance
you don't need CN for Heimdall
for what
oh i mean im waiting for the transaction<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
don't have Bchips to buy SP cards tho <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
gresham told me she is not a bait
yea, already 4/4 her <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

Nini, i haven’t received 13k Bchips yet, you might want to check your paypal, 6.2 is near <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
what the hell is that nini <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
i do need some HoS stamps <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
like literally none
there is no line that Mihoyo can't cross anymore
nini we already have HoF + HoS ADV <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
because of SS God Mei
but you won't have any tokens for them
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
so this year might be HoF + HoS
last year it's HoT + BKE
spending yea
btw guys, chance is that this year CNY shop S-rank will be HoF <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
if you think you can work out that much xtals then you should go for CN gears
based on my calculation few weeks ago, you need an avg of 150k xtals to pull for 3 patches straight
i thought you pulled a lot in 6.1
this close ? <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
Can’t believe 6.1 cost that much
I ran out of Bchips right before 6.2
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Time to hit the gym when retirement hit
<:OkaygeBusiness:900551897251979317>
The correct answer for CN vs HTR are among these options :
- Skip both 
- Pull both 
- Skip CN, pull HTR
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
but we will get Type Husk para ver anw
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
there is Type Husk hitcount version in beta
it's Type Husk
raw dps can't show you how bad cope gears actually are
when Himeko is 1 rot P1, 2 rots P2
but for LWH Thales M you need 2 rots for P1, 3-4 rots for P2
LWH Thales M is like what ? 89% compare to Himeko TMB
like Fire Tank for example
85% basically mean -50pts
even 95% mean you already got forced to do more rotation as temp go up
it does
free from MA
probably
type wolf with 470D is gonna be pogger
<:life:1001518241610485781>
inb4 Type Wolf last week
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
6.2 look so scuff for anyone but HoF
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
with constant ignite DA might just be dead
that one is still a mystery
Parvati
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
and no SpA or DA boss yet
only 2 bosses left for 6.2
only 2 bosses so far and both are HoF's bosses
we might know God Mei's kit before CN supply end
if 6.3 is a 5 weeks patch
oh btw
I have no idea
HoH doesn’t have type advantage on ice neutral
S0 PE
And PE only lose to SSS MPE
The only neutral physical is Bleed Vill-V
Problem with physical bosses are that
There is no Ice Neutral in beta
I won’t say she is not as good as HoH this soon
Oh the maintenance is a National thing, all games in CN have to close for today as well
They will just be more careful when sharing stuffs
Not like it will stop dataminers from doing it
Yea <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>

i was 1 second short

in the middle of malding rn
yea just checked it
it's the screen that shaking
oh it's not their asses jiggling
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
we literally have Aponia in Honkai
can't get attention without fanservice
degen aspect is normal for gacha these days
im still playing it atm, need to mald for a hard map <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
a typical KR game
game is decently hard and team building is farily good <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i haven't been able to see anything but the bullets in this game
if you watch others play it
yea it look like a degen game <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
somewhat like TPS, you just control the aim
i have been malding 4 hours a day in Nikke <a:aware:965946296236122172>
but the core gameplay and character dynamic are good
Nikke just look like a game for degen
Genshin generated 245M$ in the first month
for example
JP also loving it
Nikke generated 70M$ this month
 you're doing great at being a clown 
is that supposed to be a compliment ?
i have extremely high temper when it come to stuff i care about and i can easily be pissed off by the smallest reason possible

puberty
don't be negative

then i just ignored the dude on 2nd half
almost got me on the first half
yea it left me speechless ngl
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
i pointed it out and he told me that it's SpA fault for not being able to abuse the bug
then he posted a S2 IO 747 run with bug abusing
the discussion was about SS0 SpA vs S0 IO on Type Wolf
oh yesterday i had a weird discussion with maincord residence
<a:runningwithmora:854107883796693012>
humanity have always been moving forward
don't be like maincord
it's normal to always aim higher
so their scores will suck anw
i think most people can't recognise the value of those little buffs is that because their rots are not even optimized
oh it definitely matter even for casual or not, the value of 10 atk or 3% ele dmg
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
or praising Hitler
like playing WoW and suddenly someone start talking about Alqueda
i mean building it in a game won't really call out the goverment's wrong doing, only the game company will be punished for it
try checking in GI if you can still change your status
just a guess but they probably don't want people from other servers to log in CN servers and start discussing about former PM
basically just kill other people relax zone
only harm the company, it won't spread awareness or anything
tbh i still don't get the point of going into a game and troll the goverment <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
like some fuckers in NA Jenshin build Tianmen square iirc
problem is that most rioters bring politics into the game because gaming space is supposed to be  free 
no copium
with some minor characters battlesuit
probably break patch
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
but HTR kit literally confirm that God Kiana will be Fire
CN is a never look back angle
like, if we 100% sure that God Kiana won't be fire
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
this schedule put too much pressure on pulling all 3 patches
there won't be that many SS HTR in SEA i already foresee it
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
the 2nd one to go is gonna be God Kiana <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
that is a possibility yea
im not really worry about xtals count, nini got me on this one, i just wonder if there is any off-chance that CN is a bait or not <:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>

even use Scarlet pfp
i might just quit Honkai for real and focus on CS + Nikke

yo gresham, what is this
what should i pull for next 3 patches
enlight me with your plan
gresham
lowkey
HTR is skipable
lowkey without free box
tbh
before Kiana steal all IMG bosses
pulling Holmes to use for 2 patches <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
what are you gonna use Holmes for ?
should i pull for 4/4 CN or not
the point is that
not really sure on that
probably FR in RL ?
IO's weakness will keep showing up as temp go up
SS0 HoR > S0 IO
then you could always level it
if the only difference is pri level
IO PV GD

HoR
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
We’re actually this close to 6.2
No need to pull for only Cez T
Tesla T is equal with Cez T so it’s fine
T pc doesn’t have an alternative that boost more dmg than Cez T
You won’t
In your amazon wishlist
<:life:1001518241610485781>
PE will be dead in 2 patches and HoH is in a yike spot

Those 2 already become outdated valks
By the time that supply is up
so you feel it faster
cause Herrscher this year was late for 1 patch
it have been this way since 2020
it's normal

Is she still broken at S0
Nvm i won’t trust Gresham anymore
I trust Gresham
I want to skip CN and go for safe route but Gresham told me that CN is not a bait
So they want to justify the act of skipping HTR

it's the competitive blood that make we become like this

lowkey
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
lowkey it might not be enough
carv i don't think that's the fund of someone who want to pull CN + HTR
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
actually hard lmao
i have to focus to survive the boss fight
no cap but i don't think i could even see what does character look like in combat <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
im actually enjoying it <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
you can only pull 1 time only
it's a paid banner
Nikke generate 70M$ for its debut month
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
what a deal
that's instant SS
and 4 more stamps in spending
if you buy 2 bundles you will get free S2
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
broken
1280 Bchips for 3 stamps
they will announce God Mei bundle
you mean our fund ? <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
but my Kiana will be SS right, nini ?
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
they're aiming to surpass Tencent next quarter
God Mei will be 2023 Mihoyo
it's 2022 Mihoyo
just pull on Pyramid
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
when you can sell them
why give them for free
that will be enough to cover God Kiana's pull
that's why i begged nini for some chump changes <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
just focus on Bonya + God Mei
if your budget is tight then you're force to skip CN and God Kiana
limit 2 bundles
it will be 3 stamps for 1280 Bchips
i can already see it
lol she won't be ER stamps
what make you think so ? <:life:1001518241610485781>
kinda stupid tbh cause it's literally impossible in the beginning without sacrificing at least 1 of the trio gear <:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
but some others want to get all trio
yea if you don't plan to pull 6.4 then there is no point for 110 pulls and pray on FOCA
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
the goal is also to xtals balance in check
41
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
i think it's more about  a good point to stop without damaging your xtals balance before CNY  
ideally ofc you want to go for 190 pulls if you can but if you can't then 110 is a fair point to stop and try to get the last 2 from FOCA

<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>

i mean i can always swipe for all 4, not like it's any big deal <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
on their debut supply
im actually thinking of skipping SP gears
i can't believe this is like the first time in 2 years that
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
i just don't know if going for CN is actually the play if somehow Kiana end up wanting both Mei + Bonya
then beg nini for some extra 2000-3000$ to SS Kiana
lowkey i can manage to pull for all 4 <:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
it keep getting worse

Huodou is Bio

CN is assuming SS HTR is the default
SS HTR yea
can't say for sure about Nirv tho
and HTR score like 50-70 pts over RC in RL
no type wolf in live server yet but on Benares they use CN + RC
HoF can still keep her bosses
yea they will introduce 10 new bosses for IMG Kiana
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
and Lightning still gain more from her
not Lightning
but HTR is supposed to be the new core of Fire
score did improve by a lot so there is that
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
copium
maybe they're still not used with HTR setup
but if GD no gun then FR is better
only for QUA bosses
you will want to put HTR in Lightning team
if MA bosses are lightning and fire
but the scenario is that
they did get better
basically this
HTR in Lightning team > HTR in Fire team
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
score is improving but buff timer is awkward
HTR has problem with fire team
testers are saying that
HTR with fire bosses
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>

10% gap is so big tbh especially on fire boss
i don't even think i want to use CN without her 4/4
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
which bother some players
i think she is fine, problem is that pulling HoH force you to skip CN for HTR
keep regretting on pulling HoH

Lightning is the first element to have a proper 2 teams right ?
kinda nut, no ?
HoT/PV/FR
God Mei/HTR/GD
you will have double HoT for MA
with HTR and new Mei
if you think about it
time to conquer Jizo
HT is having all the highest score rn
or beta testers are still not used with her
but in Abyss that's kinda debatable
like, in MA, HTR is undisputely stronger
yea both hitcount and para cause you need her ult for Husk dying phase
but that's also probably because of Husk mechanic
or none at all from PV
barely increase
yea like
RL 445D S0 Aponia Klein 3.5* score 784
this is closet i can find in CN RL
im trying to find the recent Husk of CN
barely increase
it's RL so hard to tell but from the look of it

the one that in charge of reacting huh in <#1003723962758475786>
only mod can bypass that
it's a setting from the bot

im trying to find the most generic keyword for it <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
?
the discount banner one
the best spot to stop is probably 150 then ? and pray that you get 1 of her signature in less than 20 pulls  <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
actually with how thing go, if you manage to get S2 at 110 pulls, you can probably stop
there will be 4 idiots without SS HTR to compete with you
so for every brackets <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
just the chance is enough
the first one
non-awk
yea like full 190 pulls on that supply
100% ?

If you guys want some entertainment, check maincord CN channel
They will have to give a free box
If CN keep up their work
CN is complaining about it too
Keep assuming 190 pulls
No sign yet
You mean free box ?
Been a while
It is actually a SSS worthy skill if 40
Should be 40
Because fire doesn’t exist
No one test for fire team yet
Not this one
Unlock new passive
The one i saw was an unlock one
Is it an unlock skill or upgrade ?
Aight, if thing go wrong i will send you my paypal for mental compensation
CN is near
I need to make decision quick
The mech one
HoR
Or at least SSS JK
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
9S tho
Bleed HoS probably mean Type HoS was stolen by HoR
I mean they did cut 1 of BKE’s bosses
QUA is questionable
IMG is good
Bio is free
Mech dps is also free
Psy dps is free
I think Phys is in a healthy spot
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Half of them were about quitting Honky

Actually it might be fun if you use HoS dps
Idk about fun when the best option is physical

Sirin 4* is broken, agree ?
Maybe new fire elf is only a small upgrade on Sirin
Maybe you don’t need 4/4 for Nirvana
Im starting to think maincord is right <:mfw:840549220406263859>

Wait for G4 Fire

SS0 and im out
I don’t think i will go for SS1 tho
That’s easy
Weapon active already trigger evade
Oh actually
QTE - Evade - AA - weapon - ult - ult again
You need to evade into the 4th AA
As a support she look fine ig ?
I don’t even know wtf im looking at
As a dps she look awkward to me
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
But pure dps comparison she overpower PV and AE
So in actual fight the gap won’t be that big
I mean ye we still have weather system and type counter stuff
What if you butter it up with a glock
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
The start of something new ?
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>

Also why does nini prefer to CN as Air Conditioner
Skip HoH
Also that mean God Kiana team will be HTR + Turg RC

⌜i'm not red at all right now! you're seeing things!⌟
⌜stop laughing! s-stupid!⌟
But i will need to pull it
I really don’t want to resolve in this last resort
Sound doable
So i will need to work on 50k
Nini will cover for me 100k
So we will actually need 150k xtals ?
Stuff like Gundam and Railgun
Cause HTR new ability in story is to create anythingg that humanity believe in
And it’s probably an actual lego gun too
Sadly
No
More dmg - more dmg - more dmg - more dmg
Her rank up is also the most straight foward rank up too
But at SSS she basically toss every others out in neutral
I mean at S0 she is not that good yea
At S0 maybe you can use HoS to compete
HoC will probably be SSS PE boss
Im only doing it for the giggle
Im waiting for this one in Nikke <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

Look like a way better AE too
Actually look nut yea
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
I actually fail to see how an Ice dps can be this strong
Or it’s her dmg that make those diff
What buff does she even give with her dps set <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Her stig  ?
What does HTR use on those team ?
Hieu Le is testing S0 HTR
They send you S0 and 999 frags
You can get lower rank
Cherry stop being a clown
I can’t check it atm, maincord say SS1
On HoT
Shit internet
I can’t watch it atm
HTR won by 30%
SS1 HTR vs SSS PV

let me fix it rq
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
missing anything ?
6.2 : 4/4 CN = 76 * 280 = 21.280
6.3 : 190 pulls HTR  = 53.200
6.4 : 4/4 S0 Kiana = 160 * 280 = 44.800 ; 3* Elf = 120 * 150 = 18.000 ; 4/4 Mei = 39 * 280 = 10.920
Total : 21.280 + 53.200 + 44.800 + 18.000 + 10.920 = 148.200
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>

well this is bad
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
the solution for low rank PE is that you need 2 more PE
triple Herrschers with triple PE's passive
<:POGGIES:816801290783948830>
and Kiana Mei HTR is the only way
but Mihoyo might prove me wrong
i can't even see them having a dedicated Abyss boss because that will be so fucked up
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
i mean yea but im more concerning about Abyss performance
breach value on Herrscher valk is so low for all the reason in the world
inb4 it's Kiana RC CN <:okfine:971481680265216130>
ain't no way CN is not a staple in new Kiana comp
new Kiana will be IMG Fire anw and unless HTR can persuade me with broken fire support kit
i physically can't skip CN
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
QTE event
she is only a little behind 9S IO on Blood Bio Mech
HoR actually coming back on a lot of bosses with this weapon
yea she just kill the shield way faster
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
yea imo you already have 75% shieldbreak from JK, no need for 50% more from Paga M <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
they ignore the 2pc effect, just need the buff from Bastet T
top score of SS0 HoH and above prefer Bastet TM Cez B on RC
it depend on HoH rank from what i saw 
<SS0 HoH : Turg TB Paga M

>SS0 HoH : Bastet TM Cez B
that's what i heard
boring fight, not many top players attempt for capscore so they won't upload
yea top score in main server use FF HB
closet one to our D
not much 9S ref this time
for a second i forgot HoH already out
yea

pro tip : If you retain in Nirvana your emblem will never expire
what the fuck
both look awful
your team is the strongest meme comp
She is not slaying shit but it’s fun
SSS is for dps AE
for support rank up you only need S2 and SS
It mean AE have higher chance to be farmable soon if her replacement is out
It’s not meta advice
Don’t risk it on AE
Even if there is 50% chance she would
God Bonya is obviously too soon to say that she will replace AE but
I won’t
If you can snipe Utu or Eden then yea
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
Not AE
They give Aponia breach to make sure PV and GD are her best supports
HoT and Aponia does
The value of breach on them is too high in Nirv
For IO and FR it’s always AE
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
Does Nirv look like this now from RL perspective
Look on the bright side, using JST make your run look entertaining Tet
is it <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
in America people can't even afford health care
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
that is to be expected, HoF can drop AE anytime she want anw if there is an actual second Fire support <:ICANT:921403877285306399>
this work ?
Yea you should try it out, a good game to kill time
Balance between hard and fun
I think even without the fanservice this game at its core is still a good game
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Cause i need to focus on the field or else i will fail
I actually can’t even focus on the character
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Need skill involved too
Lot of answers for hard stages
Gameplay is cool imo
Yea actual game
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
This Nikke game have no reason to be this fun
I have been slacking off Honkai too much
is this post nut clarity ?
<:whip:1024122299034632272>
get back to work and aim for 600
if you want to be safe then start aiming at 987 and release when 3/4 of the aim bar ran out
it depend on fps, you can hit at 989 if your fps don't troll you

<a:aware:965946296236122172>
50% chance that she will need that SS to hold off against new Kiana
Her SS is crack but this one appear right before new Kiana is too sus
HoH being the last gacha S-rank of the generation <a:aware:965946296236122172>
Ignore the old generation
Just double down on new trio nini
You mean SS new Kiana ? <a:aware:965946296236122172>
Including HoH <a:aware:965946296236122172>
Old valks need SS to compete
It mean new trio will start the next generation
This is actually a preview
6.2 week 2

Rino quit ? thought he just did Fire Tank 6 hours ago
you barely have dorm buffs
<:huh:966619839307321394>
what are those numbers
<a:skillgib:975244908090781787>
she was with SK and AKA iirc
it's from S-rank box in Pyramid
that's what it look like in SEA, if you're lucky you can keep farming noobs for 1 whole patch
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
and reptar has been in Nirv for a patch
i haven't even met reptar yet
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
cause SEA have so many brackets
ngl i have never met my friend in Nirv neither
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
farm or get farmed
it's life <:life:1001518241610485781>
meaning you have more chance to farm noob
SEA have at least double the amount brackets of GLB
lowkey easier
nah it's the same
same temp ?
<:OkaygeBusiness:900551897251979317>
Wait til next Friday to decide on buying that bundle or not, next Friday is 6.3 beta, if they don’t buff AE with new DK/new stig then another Fire Support is coming
How long until they take down the bundle ?
Her ult CD is hidden at 4* for the giggle
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Without 4* Dudu i bet the score will be around 500-550
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
So you hate the poor ?
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
So scoring 663 by PE is not even that bad if your account still lack dorm buffs/DKs
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
Idk the capscore of S0 PE the previous HoD but PE score on IMG boss are not linear, if she reach the checkpoint of damage her score will just jump from 700 to 800
Look like HoD 3 patches ago
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
While you do 1 run on Kosma and +0 for no reason
You can play like a beast in HoD and still got -200
Manage to retain on Nirv doesn’t really prove that you’re a good player or not first few times cause it’s relative to your bracket RNG
Time to sleep <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
And we’re this close for CNY Herrscher
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
I still can’t believe pulling 3* Elf is the correct move over Herrscher of 2022
And im telling you it’s not HoH
You think she doesn’t have bosses because Mihoy decided on which valk should be the popular one
You know that is because of bias view right ?
HoF still have the best design
Yea, out of all 5.x valks + the 6.0 Herrscher
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
It’s hard to have new one if they don’t let SS slot have SSS boss
6.2 Memorial Arena Week 1
Idiot
And while the weapon active is there you can stack up more ember
You want to stack up ember to 10 before using weapon active

that stage have both Psy and Mech

this one
<:welkinmoon:1034992105673736273>
probably not, still APHO Kiana
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
so Kiana won't suffer love hate relationship
they let you get used to IMG dps bypass IMG mechanic
PE is also just a preview for Kiana
HoF top score on Benares is just a preview for 6.4
all planned <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
no tanky mobs for fun and typeless
typeless
and best of all
but Ranged Kalpas look cool and Ignite Benares look like old Abyss boss <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:HuTaoDead2:878438335905935470>
shield Karen look like a  you think you're done with SnS ? Whoops 
literally just a  use X  boss
yea i don't hate RPC either but i fail to see the purpose to exist of the boss
typo <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
you need ult + 3 or 4 predators
Kasumi has huge ice bar
yea for both fire and ice team <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
what a menace
i will have to use Turg Cat 1 last time on Kasumi tho
thanks god 6.2 is near
RPC don't even belong to either skill or rng side, dude is just there
my favorite boss is HoD back when it's not PE's boss
i need RNG factor that at least i can have control over it
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
i don't know how is it a plus when i have to pray that my FPS won' troll me
you're forced to use RC
worst Fire boss is actually AKA
like you can't even improve your rot anymore than what you use
Fire Tank have such a consistent run that it's all come down to gear and skill
because you never have to fight that menace using BKE
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
i can name all bosses that are worse than tank
Kasumi, Type HoS, Elysia, Type Wolf, Lightning Wolf, Bleed Shield, Homu
probably <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
cause CN temp also decrease on some piss easy boss
probably <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
like for QUA bosses the avg would probably be like 400
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
adjusting the avg score depending on bosses
it just mean they know their playerbase too well
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
score above avg too much -> +2
if they score above it -> +1
like Mihoyo put an avg score a server should score
so it's probably related to avg performance
466 atm
SEA is +1

In some trading group in SEA, the book price rn is 50$ for the brand new one
Reading skill not found
But there are minors playing and they think they have to pay 200$ for the book
Or you want the money
Nah it’s normal, you have to be really want the book to go for it
Less than 24 hours

SEA’s book already ran out
It’s 500% dmg on her ember mark iirc

Most of the time 3S on HoT is pretty OP, lot of damage
If you can’t do the non-shinzan he will go into clone phase

You can sit down and play instead

SEA still have 4k left
will probably have spare time to enjoy 6.2
im slowly climbing back to 3k, work is almost finish <a:Streaming:1039019999811088414>
no think, just pull
i just know im already double down on Fire being good again
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
i haven't read it too
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
surely her SSS is not that important
i think i will stop at SS CN <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
pulling for her after that is actually griefing your crystals <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
she was only a good investment if you play in 5.5
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
can't remember their name
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
i spent 5 minutes trying to figure if dude was serious or not
i remember during 5.6 some dude in maincord trying to convince me that LWH TB Thales M  HoF can retain Nirvana
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
but on Nirv she is not even close to triple supports
HoR come close to HoH in RL
using RL experience is kinda a joke ngl
so you can at least know the value of a 4/4 valk
you need to at least suffer in Nirvana more than 12 cycles
yea im not egoing or anything but i think to have the right to talk about meta and stuffs
give her a DK <:xdd:1022782509316059176>
literally carrying 2 dead weights and HoH still need JK to pass her
and some dude actually believe that HoF need a DK to fix her problem
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
PE and HoH
only missing in Herrscher's patch
i still don't know why maincord keep pretending that HoF's boss have not appearing every single patch so far
yea it was 5 AKA in 3 patches
to make sure im not sleeptalking
wait, lemme check <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
another AKA
and disappear til 6.2
2 in 5.7
1 in 5.6
2 in 5.5
but her shill was intense
<:xdd:1022782509316059176>
and turn out all the FCs are strong for the giggle
she felt strong cause she was also the first gacha FCs too
it feel like yesterday when CN discussion trying to tell me that IO was the best valk ever created
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
we have like 10 braindead valks
even for ER standard idt IO is worth it anymore for our roster rn
im done with IO forever
next patch i will use HoR instead of IO on Bloodlust <:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
you're always this close to 1 rot his P2
because holy fucking shit using HoT on Kosma
for your mental health
Vill-V is still a good investment tbh
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
and Hua new suit is not anytime soon until APHO3
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
cause it mean no AE revival
lowkey i don't want new Mei to be Kiana's fire support
you mean in 4 hours for SEA ? <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

dw, just remember, you're a swiftie

You already used Griseo and HoS on Kallen i assume
Any psy dps work
you bet

get in
it mean you only need to clear 1 stage of Abyss <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
reptar just finished it
<@148145559897636865> there is an extra quest to get 30 tokens from new OW
Who is the new guy <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
We got JK instead
is that capscore for S0 HoH ? <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
lmao
but SSS SpA
well i expect SSS SpA to steal it from SS Mobi too
not SS+ Mobi tho
SpA will steal Type Wolf from S0 Mobi for sure
except Lightning Wolf
Mobius is this close to losing all of her bosses <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
nini, you need to use Elf Ely to gather <:life:1001518241610485781>
but HoR score close to her
T1 is still 9S Mobi
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
and SS1 HoR > SS Mobi
after Mobius
HoR is 2nd best option now
Bio Mech bloodlust
oh wtf
SS2 JK, 1500 atk in the clip so i guess JK rank doesn't really matter in this team pass SS0 ? <:senthink:995298360317706300>
mimi is a beast but i don't know how much effort they put it meme runs tho
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
fragile didn't do 3 supports team this time ?
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
there is no way you want S0 BKE when 6.3 is 70% to be mech physical
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
Yea the weather change in this country is annoying
<a:aware:965946296236122172>

should be full of fire
idt there will be more than 1 QUA weather
oh <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
but top score is 9S HoH nini <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
oh iirc today or tmr the daily cap will be up to 400 tokens per day
what's wrong
order the book
get out
get in, 2 PE ults
it will be easy anw even in Nirv
HoH will probably topscore it but i don't think my S0 HoH gonna compete shit
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
just because i can use HoF on boss stages again
i like Fire Tank and Type Kasumi
except for JK this patch all have fun bosses <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
if you buy 4 Paladin you will have 40 JK frags and 80 HoS frags from the BP
<:FeelsSadMan:816800787137036360>
Imagine having time
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
There is Eden afaik
You’re probably asking which valk can reproc it off-field
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
Imagine if it were M
Thanks god it was B tho
Yea not with B piece alone
I mean if you do desperate pulls, should have used it on SoE supply
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
The problem are on other valks too
Tbh you’re overthinking the value of her signature in RL
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Heck it should even be enough with just her gloves
TB + Mei M is more than enough for RL
Getting B is already lucky if you do desperate pulls
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
i just saw it and never visit that channel again
i don't know why, i didn't even want to ask
i will tell you rn that 12/12 HoF team can somehow struggle in Masters Agony
the casual chat
you haven't seen the chat in maincord yet
that's where you're wrong
just Agony
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
no flame tho
cause even Agony is lowkey hard for people without hands
i don't suprise about people missing some tokens
she is this close <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
it's the annoying Ganesha sidestage again
you can get on Hepha's knees instead <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
hope Senti can come in clutch <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
yea in the trailer Kevin bring her to his knees
but the chapter tittle is already obvious enough
we will know about new valk in 1 month
new chapter already ended in 6.1 nini, this Thursday is 6.2 <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
is that for the ancient mode ? Memorial Arena <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
16 + 10 + 32 + 2 = 60
JK stamps = 16 balls
SSwords M = 10 balls 
you need 250 frags for SS HoS
60 frags : top up 
100 frags : HoS card 
80 frags : BP Paladin
1 stamp = 10 frags = 2 balls
can't you get all of it ? <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
if you want SS HoS, you can  try to get 4 Paladin this time <@906785655823147028>  <a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
like 30 ?
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
oh wait it's SN
is it Nyx or SN ?
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
so you can get some Nyx stamps in the top up box
you only need 280
yea more than enough actually
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
yea it's probably SSS PE > SSS MPE > the rest
let me look again to see if anyone posted it
i tried to find even SS PE but couldn't
no one use PE below SSS in that fight in main server CN
<@385655541248163840>  oh yea i forgot to tell about it
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
The key to Nirvana is avoid losing trophies and maintain your trophies above 2000
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
Istg reptar is nowhere close to capscore on each bosses and somehow his results look like he will be god among maincord
Nirvana’s dalao sharing experience

CB19 officially become useless
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
lowkey the score on Hepha will still belong to SSS HB if JK is not SS0
it's bugfix alright
im also probably demoting this cycle
me too
There is no way you can make it in time from Forgotten to Agony
Like if just comeback to the game for the book
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
There is a Q that require you to be in Agony
Or not even in Agony
15 tokens probably mean forget to do ER
It’s guarantee now
Already Monday in SEA yea <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
405 is kinda close tho
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>
Don’t need to sweat on Friday
It’s 405 in SEA
That hit will count yea
There is a hit after 8 seconds
Her ult hit after 8 seconds will reapply Mei M
Griseo ult + 1 auto before swapping to HoS
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Idk how close your fight looking like but if you want to bald more try replacing Beet M with Mei M
She already have breach in her kit
I don’t think you need Hua <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
Aponia + anything but Mobius/Vill-V  <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
Greatsword + Cloudwalker <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<a:Streaming:1038782415759474688>

Haha <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
okay
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
That’s definitely +100 on avg, reptar is about to +100 with 554
Yea i guess it add up <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>

top 3
wait actually
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
yea this boss actually have least RNG among all ice bosses
can't be bother to torture themselves
i guess it make sense, their temp are a little too high on main server
Ice HoV ?

relax guys
only 1 boss anw
look like it if you don't have HoR and SoE
not bad
time flies
it's almost 1 year since i quit
because Ely is not helping anything
im 100% sure if you want to capscore Kasumi you need WE to cut down the time
Ely's gather is the most pathetic gather i have ever seen
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
lowkey
lowkey WE is not even that bad
<:worrySniperAngry:920552131642142741>
greshy, your boss is behind you
look not, i think you only want to use full Liu Qi or full Ana ?
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
with Liu Qi you can probably ult + mini rot the shield
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
with SoE HoR ?
you're not gonna kill HoV without shield disable passive
probably HoR still
what the fuck
both sound terrible
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
For the giggle
Suddenly +3 instead of +2

620 xtals income
S HoV is good, 3% physical buff
I think they ask if SSS HoV can retain in RL
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
All the mfs
I know at least 10 scalpers still haven’t done the tasks yet until weekend
SEA’s numebrs rn are fake
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
If it’s not over 12500 you can jerk off next week and still get it
You only need to pay attention to it on Sunday’s night
It’s normal
It’s fine to have bad opinions
Ana is cuter
Lowkey Liu Qi is overrated
Good job keilo,now score SSS Huodou
you were overthinking
im also paranoid, i have been jerking off normally in NNN <:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
unless
no way it's have 660 to buy
should be collect 660
so if you exclude Lens/Time Swirl Passes/Ethernet you can pretty much clear the shop
the estimate amount is like 1k8 ?
i think it's fine to exchange it there

at least you can win <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
the Power Nine's price only took off when their father, the OG designer passed away in 2016
but the value of those 9 cards are based on their irl storyline too
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
yea 1 of the Power Nine
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
there are cards like that in MTG but i don't know if they actually worth that much
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
so like, gacha irl
i see <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
i still don't get how some pokemon cards worth hundered thousands
i will give it a try when they launch it <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
i don't think that equal with  dumb  and  illiterate 
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
i wonder if Mihoyo actually want to balance Genshin's card game or just make it a for fun mode
if it has good balance patch yea <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
they organise a lot of Yugioh tournaments in Vietnam
i want to learn YugiOh too but the game mechanic is too fast <a:aware:965946296236122172>

just take a break guys, mental health is more important <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
self achievement
kind of proof that you're improving <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
competitive or not
i think first time retaining or promoting on new tier is actually important for a player
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
yea but the tittle is Genshin Impact
<:soulessSadge:818862331869659197>
Mihoyo stop pumping out good media
looking at the Senti and AE gif make me miss Elf Academy
<:life:1001518241610485781>
probably best to send them the Keanu's pic
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
probably shouldn't
that is kinda too mean
next time i will hit the same case with this one
fucking
and they quit the game for 1 month
i once had a cadet that share some internet stuffs and i replied with  im sorry it happened, if you want you can always take a rest from internet 
<a:worrySwingSadge:981759583779446866>
they probably thought you tried to hit on them
i just took you guys in for the rewards
cadet these days ask so fucking much ffs <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Veliona would probably split her from head to toes
neither is Veliona
her legs got damaged by Sin Mal
the one HoR couldn't be
she will be the real Mechnya
the dude keep flying away almost tilt me to the roof
i tried a little bit on this boss, settle with 700 <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>

i thought you have SW
that's the american way
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>

<:HuTaoDead2:878438335905935470>
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
the Hare boss fight i mean
the new one transition phase look like it's made for MA
no
they can always add new SSS bosses i guess <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
if new Bronya is physical
i think it's most likely SSS Kallen <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
they're not deleting anything
cause the boss is kinda still there <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
im actually curious why do they decide that boss that have SSS won't ever show up as SS again in the schedule
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
probably SSS Kallen ?
speaking of SSS, wonder what will be the next SSS <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
but the fight is fun so they get a pass
not even Vill-V boss
yea i still don't know why they make SSS Tona too <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
that's kinda blow, i really want to see how well 3 supports can do on that boss
Dude kinda dissapear after 6.0 on MA schedule <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
MA Hepha
i just realised what is missing from 6.1 <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
yea her grouping skill feel better but the dude still decide to fly away sometime
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
I will uninstall this game
If this squid fly away 1 more time
Istg
I see
I feel normal toward Honkai but it’s because of nini’s funding <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
And try for her gear later in the future
Just save those 2
She needs at least 2 pcs of her signature to be better than Turg TB
Nothing
jerk off later
screenshot and post it on twitter
order the book
go out
go in, 2 PE ults
yea probably HoD is faster then
i see <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
the task require 12 stages clear sth right ?
does boss stage count as 1 or as 5 stage ? <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
i will send a truck to Mhy HQ
istg if that week side stage is something menace
<:TeriNotStonks:1009441195673538642>
But surpassing BKE ? Probably not
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Now i think she get back to being good too
She was good back in her time
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
She drifting around before didn’t do any dmg either <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
paper boss even with 484D <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
im pretty sure
heki will pull sth on 6.3 again
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
that's concerning
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
ah
wdym Herrscher charge
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
Before you finish, can you check if clearing 2 waves and quit midway still count toward the task <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
30 is old format, when they add the new box in BP if you exceed lv 70 they add more frags too iirc
Raven + AE showing how dumb it is to have 2020 support and A-rank in the team <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
Yea 9S Nyx is 3 pts behind on that one
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
Hope she can show her value on those 2 that Mihoyo made specifically for her
2 more bosses for HoH this patch
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
So you have to bald less
But on FGO it’s better if you can’t one shot
But HoH is concerning <:pepe2:368744338445828106>
PE also starting to fall off but still a beast in RL so she fullfil her value as CNY Herrscher
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
Benares
Just search fragile’s vid, if you can score more than 720 on S0 HoH non-elf then she is good
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
No ?
I also think she is fine but if a Herrscher value is “ she is good for MA “ then it’s kinda concerning
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
Not even capping rn
It’s actually true if you don’t count her MA value, S0 HoH 4/4 without 3* elf is not gonna outscore even S0 JK
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
So there’s that
And JK also buff ice team in general too
But HoH has to compete with SW and JK
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
Like HoF was in comparison with HoT/DA, HoT was in comparison with  HoTF, HoR was in comparison with 6S/UA
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
More so the recent S-rank are all strong
I guess when you put it more realistic, it’s not that she is weak
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
Yea the competition is also high
The dmg is actually high for zero reason and in SS1 it buff whole team ice dmg
You need to do her finisher
For normal players ofc
But imo Elf Ely 3* > Elf Ely 2* > JK 4/4 > HoH 4/4
I guess she is not a bait consider you still need her for MA
If you’re a normal player, just monthly and stuffs, do you actually not consider HoH as a bait in this current state ?
<:life:1001518241610485781>
That’s deep
make sure you're in RL during HoD Abyss is enough
don't need to do that
you're in EU
the tiebreaker will depend on HoD Abyss
yea unless you can mine 3k ores in Thursday
<:OkaygeBusiness:900551897251979317>
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
so that i can know how many fuckers can potentially fuck me up
i will wait until Sunday's night to clear the last ER tasks
these guys
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
next cycle is Ice HoV so you can 100% clear all stages
it's better if you promote this cycle tho <:senthink:995298360317706300>
<a:animenod:814063051854446653>
blow in Abyss -> still good to invest
if im not tripping she needs 3 weapon ative and ult to freeze Assaka
RC fucking blow in this fight
yea if JK is 4/4
HoH use JK and RC
SW use HB and JK
i need to read more <:huh:966619839307321394>
she has auto evade ? <:huh:966619839307321394>
based on CN result it's SW > Aponia > MPE = HoH > HoV iirc <:senthink:995298360317706300>
now that is something come straight out of novel
JK has auto evade in ER <:huh:966619839307321394>
for a moment i thought you ask if anyone want to let you play HoH for them
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
i didn't pay attention to them before
yea think so
<@218762069338619906>  <@148145559897636865>  when your Abyss open can you test does it count if you only clear 2 waves of Side Stage then quit, iirc the condition for 2nd part of Abyss tasks are clearing 12 waves <:senthink:995298360317706300>
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
If you exclude their effort on designing her effects she is the peak of braindead design
Wow JK in ER is literally braindead
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
I can’t run it down in time
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
What if there is a way to get 3k on 1 day
That’s actually concerning
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
Can we get 3k ores on Thursday ?
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
sound like a sonic angle <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
so you will need to clear all 3 stages of Abyss to get the book
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
so the tie breaker is HoD Abyss
it's 5/5 10/10 15/15 yea
reptar also just DM me <:senthink:995298360317706300>
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
IMG only have 2 main stages
should be
<a:smadging:1034847088737005628>
Abyss  open in Friday, the mission refresh in Thursday only for the giggle
it's fucked
wait im at 2800 trophies, i can't even run it down in time <:huh:966619839307321394>
time to run it down to RL
it's over
it's HoD
what boss is it
look like you will need to speed run Abyss on Nov 11th to get the book
the amount of tokens per mission
only Abyss left
so 
- BP points : 15/15
- ER : 5/5/5 and 10/10/10
confirmed these 2 so far
but the BP points require is 3000 and 7000
once he do Abyss
i will ask Reptar to update the token amount
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
<a:mashirosweat:803924188267544596>
It’s 1/2 for 3000 BP points
The 1st pic
BP points also have 2 tasks too
6 ER tasks and 6 Abyss tasks
Look like it <:senthink:995298360317706300>
Also Abyss tasks reset on Friday too
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
That’s a lot of tasks
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
<@148145559897636865>  <@218762069338619906> from Reptar
All day grinding for that ? <:pepe2:368744338445828106>
There is a dude in SEA with 40k points in fall gals <:pepe2:368744338445828106>
the buff also don't favor PE <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
these kind of clips are fun <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
actually this patch schedule look fun so far tho
time to ask how long til 6.2 <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
but i still think it's a chore <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
the rougelike one in Genshin does have some potential
no joke
even Honkai side events are better than Genshin side events <:okfine:971481680265216130>
I just broke my PC in a fit of rage, seeing that Sushang 4/4 came in almost full 200 pull guarantee. I only needed one last stigma for wishing well but HoYoverse embarrassed me in front of my family. My two children are crying. Frightened by my anger as I shakily walk around the room, the neighbors are knocking on the door trying to calm me down. I can't stand this, call the police because I'm about to do something crazy - that is hoping to get SoE in one ten pull
actually fun
i promise
fall guys is fun
<:Rinoooo:558188634247921664>
Tet out here thinking about all the pulling decisions
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
IO still score a little higher
it wasn't during CF and bug cancel animation
should be better than S0 IO now
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
cause she bing chilling her mechanics with you
lowkey Bleed Vill-V is a long fight for no reason
DA need at least that many rank up to score in Rime
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
it's SS1 vs S0 HoF so kinda make sense
tell me if i can uninstall the game in 6.5
<:wakamocoffee:1001363098407555183>
you need some sleep bud
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
i actually want to play her now
highkey CN look nut to play <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
8 bosses in 1 vid
this is a longass vid <:senthink:995298360317706300>
they actually changed the best actor for Geralt <a:aware:965946296236122172>
time to block the show from my netflix
also i just read that Liam Hemsworth  will replace Henry in The Witcher SS3
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
JK and HoH score will probably always maintain as  as close as possible 
so it's not like SSS JK will score better than S0 HoH
but SS1 JK onward also buff HoH
it's still a 25 weeks wait
also SS JK scoring close to S0 HoH is actually fair i guess ?
it's not that she is weak at S0 but it's JK + RC + HB combination are strong
oh she is strong at S0
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
the rest can stop at SS
imo valks that are worth to SSS are probably HoS only
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
still have some damage but not SSS worthy
SS2 is alright too but SSS is kinda sh*t
i don't know how big that is but up until SS0 all her rank up can make a lot of differences
her competitor is a 4.4 valk
cause HoF doesn't have any competitors
just need to double PE damage to steal all bosses with shit supports
sound like an idea for IMG Kiana <:senthink:995298360317706300>
touche <:senthink:995298360317706300>
they stop giving insane TF on new valks
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
are you sure about that tho ?
stay tune
guess where the pos will drop in the next episode on ranged Assaka
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
yea lowkey refs nowaday are  Finding SP pack 
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
that will kill the fun of playing AE
weapon active -> normal attack
JK farming sp period is literally 0
i don't like that idea tho <a:aware:965946296236122172>
other than that im clueless
well for now the only possibility i can see is AE DK <a:aware:965946296236122172>
Bronya can be Physical tho
Mei can't be anything but Lightning
yea sadly <a:aware:965946296236122172>
Yuki Mei
they can name change her
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
for the giggle
and Ice Mei
Lightning Bronya
what if
oh wait
imagine competing with Physical while being Ice/Fire <a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
and that someone is not gonna be Ice
cause they need someone to kill BKE <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
couldn't be any weirder than pulling an elf is smarter than Herrscher of the year
not the most crazy idea
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
installed it back on Friday to do Abyss
last for 24 hours on Thursday
i did it once <a:smadging:1034847088737005628>
that bracket was like 3 beasts and 17 noobs
you should have scored more than 650
<@906785655823147028>  also watch the vid above and learn the rotation reptar <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
HoH won't let me down on this one
week 2 P2 is Hepha
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
you will never see me again
if i ever see those 2 stats in Honkai
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
introducing new stats, EM and ER
like at this point i don't think playerbase even mind anything anymore
maybe if they want to spice thing up <:senthink:995298360317706300>
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
like they actually can't
yea lightning can't have QUA dps
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Bronya : Physical Mech
Mei : Lightning Psy/Bio
Kiana : Fire IMG
shit game
i will go F2P from 6.3 onward
if i don't see new Bronya beating SS1 BKE
thanks god JK can't score 47.600 in MA
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
im actually melting right now
ofc i don't think so
no copium but HoH will score better than JK by a mile in Airplane and Hepha Abyss
worth
740 is 4 pts higher than JK
yea i only need to play better <:clueless:973756617109676032>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
then can she start doing damage now ?
yea at this point can i get back my 40k ?
so probably around 740
Korath is S2 HoH SS JK 758
no copium
you need HoH for MA Hepha
it's fine
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
should have tried JK dps
kinda bummer <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
SEA is 462
461D is NA right ?
someone else
probably score better than my S0 HoH
should have used JK dps then
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
i thought it wasn't even close in CN but low temp do wonder
but tbf, kinda impressive how close the score actually is between JK and S0 HoH <:senthink:995298360317706300>
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
JK is fun tho, gotta admit that
damn, i hate how you have to use brain with Ice now <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
to ult every rot RC does need to be on field for a quite
that probably depend on the fight <:senthink:995298360317706300>
4D for GLB and 5D for SEA
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
but it will reduce heavily in GLB or SEA
yea that score is impressive
i think it's 700 sth
i got 700, i keep forgetting to position JK <a:smadging:1034847088737005628>
reptar's bracket
i think that is close to capscore of S0 as possible
750 and 733, look like beast players <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
wtf <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
i think my stomatch is kinda fucked up already
yea i will get a health check during my day off <a:aware:965946296236122172>
8th or 9th sth <a:aware:965946296236122172>

i need another energy drink <:senthink:995298360317706300>

<a:smadging:1034847088737005628>

<a:aware:965946296236122172>
using S0 HoH is such a chore man
i will do abyss tmr in my free time
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
oh btw, does anyone know the result of the comparison between SSS HB vs S0 JK ? both 4/4 <:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
at worst shouldn't it be Sirin
yea idk why it's WE either
budget EXPA
in GLB announcement i think ?
yea it's real

if you keep buying Paladin
i also have like 2k last time i check

what if it's Da Bronya in 6.3 <a:aware:965946296236122172>
not worth to overthink it
only 1 boss
even on Tank you can probably cope with AE + CN anw if you don't aim for cap score
they don't need Raven anymore
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
best option out of all of those
yea probably just full gear DA
ice dps i mean
their dps is HoH right ? 4/4
ic <:senthink:995298360317706300>
is there a situation where you need double Turg TB anymore if you already have 4/4 JK ? <:senthink:995298360317706300>
<:xdd:1022782509316059176>
even 4/4 S0 HoF need DA to be SS to compete with her
does your friend planning to build HoR ?
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
what about Ana then ?
she is trash yea
ranged Assaka
reminding people that it used to be her boss
and HoV showing up here and there for fun
i think it's SW > Aponia > MPE = HoH
yea she is decent there but having to use RC in that fight is really a burden
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
gotta move foward ig <:senthink:995298360317706300>
this is not the Ice team i grew up with
you need to cancel animation of HoH, slow start sometime for Cez B and having to determine whether JK ult first or RC ult first <a:aware:965946296236122172>
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
only the bosses have RNG
where Ice is supposed to be click click and score high
i kinda want to travel back to 5.6
it kinda amazing how Ice went from having the most braindead line up ever to the current one <a:aware:965946296236122172>
JK below SS is not even a valk in this fight no cap
Benares's fight is all about sqeezing sp
probably true tho, S2 HoH S0 JK = S0 HoH SS1 JK <:senthink:995298360317706300>
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
what is her S2 again, is it more sp on charge ?
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
that's not bad <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
i love sp bald <a:smadging:1034847088737005628>
yea i think so
just Carole ult -> elf -> Griseo ult i think  <:senthink:995298360317706300>
Zither is there for burst mode buff iirc
it's MA new strat
she looks like she need it
i will probably save them for CN <:senthink:995298360317706300>
yea you need 3 lines of sp red and 2 lines of sp/s for RC
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
SSS JK will kill Benares on her QTE
aka said cap is around 830
yea Aka ref is extremely bald <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
i actually don't know the detail of that one <:senthink:995298360317706300>
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
20% ice dmg iirc
that's what it is to be good at the game <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>

<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
i guess the book will probably worth around 50-60$ ?
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
the book worth real money
jk aside this one might be close tho
100
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

enough time to run it down to RL anw
guess we just need to wait 1 week tbh <:senthink:995298360317706300>
and tell me do i need to run it down or not
remath it guys <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
2700 trophies now so i have to run it down 4 cycles
in RL they're squishy too probably don't need to drop to A3 <:senthink:995298360317706300>
it's whale
let me see which boss it's gonna be
i see <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
if it's 5/5 then probably
that probably depend on the stages too <:EulaThink:846768577839497216>
so you only need to clear 2
yea but 3 abyss stages get you to 665
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
only the first 2 stages
it's 665 so you don't need to finish all 3 stages right ?
im thinking of running it down to RL before Nov 21st
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
<:EulaThink:846768577839497216>
just need to do it before Abyss open, no ?
do you actually need to do ER at 4 am ?
saw people use it but idk the context
what does this meme mean ? <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
good question, let me know once you figure that out too
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
That’s decent for 3 Elys run ?
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
Look high according to reptar
also why does your JK's weapon is not 65 yet ? you play her as dps, no ?
it's for DS
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
not bad for JK ig <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
around 700
what was S0 avg last cycle again <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
But atk is fine
Min maxing on HoV Nirvana iirc
you can cut it down
if you exchange 4 JK stamps from BP
25 weeks
Dante B for collection points

Yea, Knowledge is a misread from google translate of Sentinence
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
It’s HoS stamps
In general probably always atk
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
I remember it’s full atk on HoH team and 2-3 sp red lines on HoR
<:life:1001518241610485781>

Pull out the card
Tet, in desperate time
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Not before SS tho
Idk the exact break point but JK will eventually be better than HB even when she is naked
JST, Mei M, Avo, anything work
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
for no reason
yea her kits are full of words
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
and on top it all, she doesn't feel too extra
yea JK's design is nutty
close to never
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
morally questionable
that make cherry interception even more wrong
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
someone might need it
next years it will happen with JK
yea pass down the knowledge
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
instead of changing from 6 to 8
cause they delete the old one and add in new one
it refresh after maint
yea if you buy out on Monday
it's broken
dorm supply
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
and i only need a million dollars
which is like 25 weeks away
it will worth it once JK reach SS
budget ?
what a beast
SSS day 1
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<a:seelenoted:963697302151757826>
only 100$
ok but that's not even far from F2P
but it's from you
<:huh:966619839307321394>
i have been going F2P for 6 months now, no cap
just go F2P
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
yea cause somehow her ult cd is at 4*
yea should be
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
No
Oh i can answer this one confidently
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
DA is so trash at S0 it's not even fun anymore
when you want to use her in ER
gj <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
and AE is still a meta pick
this pattern for HoS look exactly like AE in 5.2
Pog
Powecreep by 6.6
is that a surprise <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
Just mean wait for 6.3 info before deciding which to pull next <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
don't neglect on JK tho, at around SS0 even with Cosmic + Turg she will still be better than HB
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
HoR important rank are : S2, SS, SS1, SSS
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
so probably SoE > Firepower > Eden's gun ( if you have enough for 50 pulls ) > skip the rest and wait til 6.3
sound good enough to try on SoE then
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
full Ana ?
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
you don't have HoR right ?
then you can also probably skip SoE supply too and try to get Eden's gun in week 3  <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
lightning and physical
can you list your other teams status too cherry ? <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
i think skipping SP gears is never a good idea but i don't know if this can apply to your case
this is a tough one <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
how is your fire team looking ? <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
probably still a skip for JK
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
FF19 ?
weapon on HB and RC ?
her weapon ofc <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
you will need 28 more AL
if you complete both SSS bosses
80 or sth
yea
only use Raven on 1 specific boss
but it's CN + RC
too soon to tell
Tet still got beaten by Lolicon Master
rather use 6S instead
JK is bait, barely better than AE
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
probably still need to prior elfs then, imo just forget SS JK day 1 and see how your pull play out after getting 2* Dabber + Klein <@906785655823147028>  <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
how important is 3* Dabber again ? <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
you probably can if the left over frags from pulling add up to 50 <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
probably still elfs ? iirc you don't have both Klein or Dudu right ?  <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
first time hearing that <:pepe2:368744338445828106>
they get double reset ? <:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
top up reset only in anni
you guys won't
yea you never know when will Gresham click to join those spicy servers
i will thank you later
nini in case i miss a few crystals, just do it like yesterday alright <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
40k <a:aware:965946296236122172>
you want literally half of 6.1
ofc you have to swipe
no joke sherlock
20 weeks
so you only need to buy 120 frags if you SS day 1
4 stamps in total in 6.3 BP shop
20 frags for each BP, 2 BPs in total
should be <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
Yea lite literally make the game better
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
Expa in 6.2
Yea elf rotation for GLB
This is what GLB will have in 6.1
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
For some reason Honkai is still running
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
where is the nini toxic one
Next she will probably get beaten by someone name Cute and Funny
But she got beaten to the ground by Lolicon Master
<:life:1001518241610485781>
but you're supposed to be the very best
<a:aware:965946296236122172>

Me rn
<:senthink:995298360317706300>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
i can use HoF without feeling like shit
i like these Herrscher's buffs in ER <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
those KQM mods can't be any more real than that
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
as if im asking him for a duel
yea i remember when i want to double check a comparison between Hu Tao and Raiden the dude suddenly ask me where is my spreasheet
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
now not anymore, the latter at least
there were only 2 fun things i did back then, using Hu Tao and doing Hu Tao's calc <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
literally some numbers are pull out of their asses
they don't know how to apply trials and errors into their calc
off the chart
yea that place is kinda <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
mf can't even pass F11
so i asked the dude to apply his rotation in his Abyss run
i once was in an argument with a mod in KQM about how realistic a rotation is
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
except they have no hands
yea they're like Honkai's dalao <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
how is it invalid
mf i use my own artifacts
or else it's invalid
i need to use their standards
if i want to compare 2 teams
they start making shit like
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
bro literally just let the players input their own
even start making some sh*t like  standard value  for artifacts
 high 
they became a little
during the Inazuma version
i don't like KQM either <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
kinda annoying
ask some dudes in KQM for rotations and stuffs
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
have to input the dude's buff again
like when Kazuha was introduced
the update part whenever there are sth new is also annoying <a:aware:965946296236122172>
don't interest in any other characters
granted i only work on Hu Tao's calc anw <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
it does tiresome for the ground work tho
tbh they're actually easy once you're done with the preparation, the calculation i mean, you just need to put down the ground work and it will auto pilot later for all kind of teams <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
i used to work on those back when im still interested in Genshin <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
lot of TCs in KQM are Uni students that want to improve their skills
researching on that actually help you improve your skills by a lot <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
<:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
you sure that's the only reason ?
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
you mean entertainment ?
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
sure bud
it's kinda weird it happen twice in a row
and Bronya is the bait valk again <a:aware:965946296236122172>
her domain does look good i guess
at least they put some effort into making her domain <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
which literally no one even pay attention to timer or duration
unless ER
but you never stay in that for 18 seconds
18 seconds burst mode
yea what's wrong with that anw <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
like she just feel slow and rough when i put my brain somewhere else
my uncomfortable feeling when playing HoH is that i think they put too many effects and wasted movements on her  <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
kinda sad <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
like i think PE clunkiness is fun but i don't enjoy MPE at all
yea, bow doesn't clicked for me <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
cause i don't find MPE fun at all
i still use HoF on MA tank even though MPE will score higher than her <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
and she is most likely fire so i will bet on fire again
yea im already double down on new Kiana <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
it's like a SS2 rank up instead of SSS
her SSS feel lackluster
yea, SS0 is enough <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
she died while still this young <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
so did Nyx in her first ADV
will see
Eden skin is still 50/50 for me <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
yea that's assuming you guys get elf banners <:okfine:971481680265216130>
JK bundles : 1280 * 2 = 2560 Bchips
S-rank bundle : 1680 Bchips
Monthly : 1980 Bchips
Total : 6220
feel like sth is missing <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
im not entirely sold on summer Eden yet
oh just JK bundles, monthly bundle and probably S-rank bundle too <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
and wait for their 3.0 before spending again
i think it's better to skip the next gen elf
they keep giving the current gen elf in spending event
also if later down the road <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
<:okfine:971481680265216130>
also i received it nini, ty
yea just see how will your pull play out
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
not more than 2%
i don't think Klein 2.0 would bring anything bigger than current Klein
also looking at the difference between WE and Ely
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
you can 3* both of them
you will have some frags left over and with 150 frags from spending
assuming you don't get Klein early
and try to 3* both
imo i would pull for Klein still
how close are you to 3* dabber ?
lightning elf will be a long time
this CNY is fire elf turn
<:life:1001518241610485781>
it's the confidence in yourself
gresham do you know what is the difference between you and the Elysia dude

KR is truly a competitive server
it's also kinda amazing how someone as good as fhem is also a Nirv bouncer <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
how can they even reach that, they literally have 20 servers <a:aware:965946296236122172>
jfc, CN IOS is 484 <a:aware:965946296236122172>
still better than playing JP Gacha ig <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
i wish i didn't know Honkai exist
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
+1 week
so it's a bug
Reptar said they still reset it in SEA
i have no clue for GLB <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
why did you even post a Vill-V ref <:life:1001518241610485781>
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
I think last circle S0 Nyx capscore is like 770-780
It’s low
<:life:1001518241610485781>
HoF did top last time but the temp back then was 440 <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
yea not even close honestly, CN cut the farming sp time of AE by a lot too <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
the dude look like a puppy in RL
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
it would be cool if it also reset in Mon
open 1 day early
probably not bugged but <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
my apartment almost done cleaning up the mess, i will have 3 days to sleep to recover from this hellish month <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
you pick the right answer is more impressive
Lore accurate weapon <:woggers:652740192653934633>
The only reason this sh*t game still remain good
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
Jk show me new Kiana and i will swipe from dusk til dawn
Lately i have been feeling less and less attached to Honkai <:life:1001518241610485781>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Just like the owner
Sound like a plan
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Broken
Secret info but IMG Flame Kiana will be balanced around Nirv 500D for S0
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
They’re born to deal with the niche mechanic
I know, that’s the fate of QUA IMG
New PE is waiting in 6.4
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
Sorry bud, have to deal with it until 6.4
Wonder if S0 can even achieve that
I did a 4.18 on SEA but my PE is S2 <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
This boss is slowly getting out of hands for S0, can S0 still 1 shot it theoretically ?
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
EU is like 457
GLB only get 3
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
in reality, you didn't
cause even when you think you already did it perfectly
back when im still trying hard in Abyss, i asked Rino to watch my runs
tbh that's not exactly a problem, most of the time i think the problem is that no one is there to point out where did you do wrong <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
no cap
give me a complete acc and i will climb to T1 Nirv
highkey im being held back by rank and gears
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
i can't see your run so i can't know your cap but it's possible
or else you're progress this smol <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
yea you need to know which run is good and which is bad
if you can record your run it would be better to see where did you waste time
is it this close <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>  or nah ?
i mean in P2
how close are you one shot the core ?
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
<a:mhworryrun:998945496318087198>
better than HB
that's not bad
so Raven still has 1 boss left for her <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
HoF has built-in breach
it's actually normal for HoF
i think she looks good to play <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
last tank cycle
heki has a plan <a:aware:965946296236122172>
Asuka <:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
the ting ting sound feel cool <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i like CN weapon sound tho
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>



<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
Actually retard boss
The Homu King
Mobius other bosses are also terrible
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
Like yea Mobius is fun when the sp req is not tight but rn i always want to kill myself having to use her in Abyss
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
My Abyss experience with her is terrible
I only think Mobius is fun in ER
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Personally i think Aponia comp and PE are fun
PE feel clunky but when you get used to it, she is actually fun
Cause you get this 2 times in a row
Playing HoH is like playing 2 HoF at the same time
Objectively speaking
If you don’t like sth about HoF, you’re wrong
<a:alert:960403776991264798> L-TAKES ALERT <a:alert:960403776991264798>
Skill issue
I use it all the time for 2 more refreshes
It does
Just make sure the simps of good valks can’t play the game
If you can’t make your valk be good
Not even capping
Ngl this will actually cause irl battle royale
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
She is kinda old now
Like HoH ?
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Close the game and say they fixed the bug
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
CN solve her entire ignite ass problem
Because she is piss easy now
But im just thinking whether if CN using ult on P1 can outdo the value of hitting weakspot
I never pay attention to it
How much % dmg taken you get from hiting tank weakspot ?
A mercenary in tight suit doesn’t have a chance to outlive the symbol of China
But tbh it’s Fu Hua lmao
That’s sad actually
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Who even call her MiA
Who
<:EulaThink:846768577839497216>
Who is Made in Abyss
That is actually horrible
Same case with Nyx <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
Yea before she is Fire, she is QUA
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
CN is enough for HoF as far as my eyes can tell
this schedule feel kinda dumb now <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
then new Mei can only be Bio or Psy
if Kiana is IMG, Bronya is Mech
but then again <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
so dumb
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
maybe she wasn't a bait after all
im still surprised SW get a boss this late
not like anyone is trying their best on QUA either except for T100
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
that's a lot things you gonna pull
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
there must be a reason other than being a burden on Fire
also seeing how hard they try to keep AE in the game
there are some signs that Hua will need her power back + Senti appear rn, that's why i think AE actually has decent chance to get a DK <:senthink:995298360317706300>
HoR still back in the competition with BKE so it's not that bad <:felisthink:973578915962560592>
<:felisthink:973578915962560592>
cause HoF is not gonna get one or need one
she actually has a high chance to get a DK
2% fire buff
so probably SS AE <:RozaThink:671125370719830056>
im not sure if AE has any future until i see her using a DK in story first but probably so does HoR in your case anw, you have SSS HoH
<:RozaThink:671125370719830056>
doesn't you only missing like 3 frags ?
Less malding
Lowkey, this boss is easier if you can’t 1 shot the core
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
It’s a menace
If they released that weapon V1
I felt glad they actually tried to balance that weapon tho
<:borrySit:1001445019661639680>
But recently they didn’t try to hide it
They have been doing this for ages tbf
<a:alert:960403776991264798> BUG DETECTED, REMOVE 1 GRID <a:alert:960403776991264798>
“ Sir, we make JK doesn’t have rime trauma to not mess up RC but she will be a burden on this boss “
<:HuTaoSmart:870878469280628736>
Bugs are features until we can fix it
It’s keilo
<:worrySmart:399961505614921739>
But you just said Senti is Hua
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Yea AE is the only support valk left that you have to press more than 1 button at a time
Like i think her buff numbers are fine, new DK only need to make her up to date with other valks like JK
She just need a DK to stop the clock
I think it’s her next in line to get DK
Seeing how hard they’re trying to keep AE in meta
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
AE need a new DK
But yea, have to buff new Herrscher to the sky but not forget to milk some cash alongside
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
I honestly think JK could have been Fire S-rank support
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
SoE is just a solution for 2 new bosses
Yea should be, i think Ice G4 is enough to justify her coming back to the Type Weather competition
The dude <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
but HoR got a recent revival, AE is hanging around being herself from 2 years ago
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
But at least she tried
Yea not enough
Raven probably only have Tank left
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
Too bad that it look like even S0 CN already kill Raven
<:peepoSitGamer:984923819619795034>
I will keep updating <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
I share them above and in CN gameplay, you can search my message that has link in it <:peepoSitGamer:984923819619795034>
Smoother the rot for all fire dps
CN performance looking good so far
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
close to call bingo yet ? <:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
yea he looks normal now
CN love HoF
could also be bias <:okfine:971481680265216130>
S0 HoF/SSS CN/S3 AE vs Heimdall ( RL 445D, 826 pts ) : 
<:okfine:971481680265216130>
can't even find S0 HoF ref
these support patch are a tragedy
SS0 HoF/SSS CN/SS0 AE vs Benares Abyss ( 445D, 753 pts ) : 

SS0 SpA/S0 CN/S2 AE vs AKA ( 445D, 784 pts ) : 
the real team for Benares is waiting in 6.4
this is just a preview <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i don't know the condition for it tho
P2 Benares is default red but her wings will change to Blue/Red/Purple
it's her wings that change color
it does change her form
cause only 1 stack buff
you can also use 1 element team but the score will be so low <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
keilo, watch some vids i posted, this boss is a fun one <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
unless Mihoyo give all 3 of them huge numbers
but that kind of team will easily be powercrept lmao
Kiana + Mei : dps
Bronya : off-field elemental support
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
so this SSS Benny is a preview for new Trio
in 6.2 new story, the trio will fight against Kevin, Bronya stand behind shooting like a support
wait it's all coming together now
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
finding S0 HoF in CN is the same as finding S0 HoH in CN
it keep the unique of SS Benny
yea this boss actually a well designed one ngl
you can use pure Fire/Lightning/Ice on the boss but you won't get all 3 stacks of the buff
and you can only destroy with the right element
destroying each gem give dmg buff
in the transition phase it has 3 gems for each element
yea it's typeless
but the score will be pathetically low
so you can use 1 element on this boss
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:okfine:971481680265216130>
no one is bait
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
they will be a team together
actually a preview for new trio
that one is just a showcase for CN
top score use HoF HoT RC
for new Kiana and new Mei
this is a preview
only missing HoR
current beta top score use HoT HoF RC <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
ignore the score, not optimized yet
HoF HoT RC vs SSS Benny, Beta v1 : 
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
no full buff on Himeko yet
it's less damage if you start with ult first
Himeko doesn't need it
LWH 2pc need ult first to trigger fire taken
that's only for LWH and Thale
i don't trust beta testers on optimizing the rot anw
that's all what matter
but she does look smooth in HoF team
she has the S-rank privilege
oh she has timestop during ult
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<@385655541248163840>  <@148145559897636865> <@370438895965306882> <@291907279291285506>
ignore the score, probably not optimized yet
Someone finally posted actual gameplay
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
They probably can’t fix it so they shut down the method
The core won’t regen full HP if you spamming pause
This pause CD is to solve IMG core bug
That one should have been fixed
using DA in 2022<a:aware:965946296236122172>
Rimestar hopefully stay as HoF boss
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
throwing and stacking sh*t
but i can't understand the rest of her kit
yea her trauma application look good
im reading some of this Fire SP kit and i have no clue what am i even reading
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
not like im a try hard on MA either but even i not that clueless
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
no point in talking about it when 99% of that channel don't even know what MA is
i quit the sp pack drops ngl
what is the topic
where <:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Next 2 patches look rough
Heki your xtals need a break in general
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Yea i get that, i alter between Time Runner and default
<:LiliPolice:647244885237432320>
That’s a ban keilo
L-nya take
Time Runner <:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>

you're a kid
i want to know the ending of this story
update the conclusion for me if you check it <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
idk about the one between fragile and the dude
oh that one is from maincord
<:HuTaoSmart:870878469280628736>
Your journey is not about beating anyone, it’s about beating the you of yesterday

Self reflect
<:gayge:1017439025742753802>
is this some kind of roleplay
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
spicy Thursday
and CN gameplay is discussing about valk again
actually delusional
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
what a shame <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
so uhh, did the dude from maincord admit he's wrong yet <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
probably
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
unless :reallymad:
would be funny hahaha
yea imagine she is the only SP of this gen having sp issue <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
only HoF probably prefer MA
wouldn't Vill-V/DA/SpA prefer AE over MA
actually <:holothink:963352118855626753>
what a joke of a set
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
-30 pts
Marg on Eden = having to do her combo atk to trigger timeslow
when someone remind him about it
yea he said this in CN gameplay
he said if they were to use Turg he wouldn't even think about doomposting it
he blamed all the beta testers cause no one good tested 7T
no lol
so the score on bosses was not that great
he was doomposting 7T cause beta testers was using Marg Eden
i remember that one
and probably big ego too
except a big mouth
the elysia dude has nothing
fragile has high temper but he is good <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
 you only score higher than me cause you're rich 
1 of those people
bold claim
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
i have to climb back to RL to match their trophies
say he will wait for me in Nirv
oh the dude
anything hot ? <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
These copers
Aight aster <:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
competitive outside of CN/KR <:OMEGALUL:816800661626421308>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Viet also celebrate it
CNY is still 3 months away
next week
better be broken <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
start of 6.4
6.4
ignite is most likely a must
i can't wait to learn what will Fire SP offer <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:okfine:971481680265216130>
which is never
and wait until you have spare xtals for her
yea imo, if you can't guarantee 4/4 JK then you better plan on sth else <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
cause next IMG will most likely be Fire
this Fire SP is actually crucial <:okfine:971481680265216130>
<:okfine:971481680265216130>
the long awaited Fire SP
it's 100% Fire SP Ai-chan
Artificial intelligence lifeform
yea they hinted it in the BBS's post
<:okfine:971481680265216130>
6.2 will be another SP
good news for you
yo keilo
they reunited <:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282> <@385655541248163840>
chapter 32 CGs is out, looking like a banger <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
where is the +1 coming from
5 more slots on Nirv expand the amount of brackets too much that you barely have to try now
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
and only demote when i forgot to clear sidestage
i do 1 run the recent 10 cycles except for HoH's bosses
more players -> more brackets -> more noobs to farm
SEA is also slacking if you consider the % of competitive players to its playerbase
i don't think outside of CN and KR there is a server that is not slacc
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
you mean sh*t transition phases
not this close <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
5D in Nirv is actually night and day

she did a good run
you're correct, next patch will be her last shill

f*ck this patch
i will do 1 run on FGO, 1 on Kosma and don't look back either
i did 1 run and don't look back
maybe it's possible for 600 in EU only <:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
also isn't EU Nirv 457D atm ?

oh nvm then
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
<@906785655823147028> can you check SEA myriad to see if there are any HoT on it ?
maybe he is a beast or he is too high on HoT copium
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
ok i don't know about 600

yes

shouldn't Eden dps better in this case ? FR is SS1
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
the only ref on bili
don't hope on it too much
i will try
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
probably Avo M or Paga M
different sets
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Use Eden dps instead
5
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Nirv soon
Hak is RL retainer now
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
I belive different tiers have diffrent formula cause 450D RL in CN don’t feel that tanky compare to 450D Nirv in GLB
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Or Sinful scaling
Is it actually RL scaling
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
Nini is busy funding for my pulls
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Holding hand for extra 5 seconds
<:huh:966619839307321394>
5% fire dmg ?
help with what
all of cata supports are on life support
i will keep struggling with her bosses for 3 more patches
i guess S2 HoH is kinda cheap when you think about it so not that much of problem for her enjoyers <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
should have balanced her around 470D at least
yea i don't know if it's me or S0 HoH is actually not feeling so good at this temp
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
her being mech will be kinda awkward
with HoH damage
tbh now that i think about it
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i wake up and have 15k Bchips in account
nini serectly swiped 200$ every patch for me
my sponsor is nini tho
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i'd actually down to pull for it
i'd actullay cum
imagine QUA Mei and IMG Kiana
- Kiana has 2 kits, IMG dps and QUA support
- Mei has 2 kits, QUA dps and IMG support
<:okfine:971481680265216130>
imagine Mei is Fire support for Kiana
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
before Raven and PE come
spamming fire and IMG weather in 5.0
yea they did that before
and it's between Mei or Bronya
6.3 will be the bait valk like usual
dw nini Kiana will be in 6.4
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
RC was released in 5.6 before HoH tho
new trio will be lit
new gen will be balance around 490D
where every neutral bosses are ph ysical boss
she brought physical to this point
HoS started the new gen
i hope last gen ended with HoH
PE is falling off and HoH is trash at S0
time to up the standard
but i think it's about time for new generation valk tho <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
recent Herrscher is Psy
her bosses can't appear tho
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
BKE -> Mech Physical Bronya
PE -> IMG Fire Kiana
VG -> QUA Lightning Mei
the new trio will replace all Dudu's suits <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
we're boucing between 460-465
look like the intern doesn't let us reach 470D yet
they better balance Kiana around 490D
not 46x
yea she was balanced around 45x
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
in this temp
because i don't want to use S0 PE and 2* dabber on FGO
im kinda glad i pull 3* Dabber and S2 PE <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
instead of this menace dog
doesn't the dude stay still like a dummy ?
lowkey Dvalin doesn't sound that bad <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
she is supposed to solo all bosses
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
you guys just play her wrong
SPA is the best valk of 2022
this boss and its arena structure is killing me
i hope next year we won't have some stupid sh*t from Genshin anymore
lowkey the boss is so bad that you can retain with that score <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
any knowers ?
im not sure if Turg TB alone is better than full Irene
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Turg TB, Teslma M
change of plan then, any Zhenyi ? <:okfine:971481680265216130>
unless you don't have AE too
just use the setup i mentioned above cata <:okfine:971481680265216130>
actually struggling
S0 IO can barely damage the shield of Type Wolf
50% lightning > 20% type counter bonus <:okfine:971481680265216130>
actually a retard moment
and Type Weather reduce her dmg
Type Counter is so f*cking bad on wolf because S0 IO already struggling in Lightning
you can break shield without Paga this time
50% lightning bonus > 20% type counter
no need this time yea
Handel IO, Turg PV, Marg AE
AE is better yea <:okfine:971481680265216130>
<:okfine:971481680265216130>
someone use Handel IO and still score 556 in SEA so
you can just use Handel IO and Turg Cat
Oh sh*t
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>

It was 792 for 9S but it’s also in V2 <:hmm:767936100920328202>
<:okfine:971481680265216130>
nice joke
but im too weak for nirvana <:kekcry:973697358799978626>
<:Sitstarege:965953263474188329>
Nirv back then was like 420
Probably back when RL was still 360
<:worrystare:653847469830176779>
Should be in RL too, IO doesn’t have breach
I go <:woggers:652740192653934633> everytime my BKE rot turn out like what it supposed to be
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
Kinda fun
You know, the moment that you hit the jackpot
Lowkey
BKE is fun if you just close your eyes and believe
But lowkey
I hate bow in general
<:paimon_tank2:749921486348746872>
Tried to use MPE on it for the giggle
Oh me and nini was talking about last cycle
Wdym tai ? <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
This close <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
We’re this close <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>  to 6.1
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
Ofc
The only mode that matter
Probably only take back T2 QUA in Abyss then
Oh wait i just realised, she can’t even use JK in MA
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
With JK
Lowkey i think Nyx will take back T2 Abyss QUA and her boss in MA
I wil give Nyx more chance when JK hit our client
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
Say no one ever
Oh sh*t, can’t wait to use Nyx
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
The dude
I only remember FGO
What is our MA next line up ?
<:life:1001518241610485781>
I still have trouble deplete his balls
I don’t know about Kosma tho
Down to sleep ?
That’s kinda mean
6.1 MA week 3
There are very few things you can adjust vs Tank, most of the time just sp management if you are not 3S HoS <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
I watched this before, rotation still didn’t matter in this boss, after the buff expired in P2 the rot is fixed until the dude die. My problem was on trying to fit more damage into P2 to 2 rots it
Abyss
Yea <:hmm:767936100920328202>
I just spent 30 tries to know how much fire balls MPE can tank
Rotation doesn’t mattered at all, in P2 you have to tank at least 1-2 hits to tank advantage of weakspot
I keep dying in my first 30 tries
But it was horrible
I tried MPE too
There were like 1 or 2 9S MPE in SEA Myriad, even Griseo + HoS can’t shave off the difference between their dmg
3* Dudu save Physical so fucking bad
Last cycle there were 2 MPE retain with S0 HoS and 3* Dabber in my bracket
Should still be enough to retain with S0 HoS
Shino did it
SSS MPE scored around S0 HoF last time iirc
That’s some confidence

Just need to retain on it and you can fight Otto next
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
hak stop, it's a doggo
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>

Round 2, Fischl's battlesuit full name
ok i got a hard one
Quick quiz, type out Hua signet name in 10 seconds
it's not my fault, in Viet, it started with Hoa so im usually spell it wrong <:okfine:971481680265216130>
get yourself together
hak you're starting to lose yourself
keep restarting the fight until Huodou die
isn't the best part about this boss is that you don't ask anything <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
shield breaking + insane TF coming out of nowhere
it work but not better than using triple physical supports <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
reference to how Stan is
in Dudu's eyes it's as weak as a cat
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
in CN myth
Huodou is a dog
this convo <a:agonLeave:818862560643383346>
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
cause RC is supposed to be Ice Support
hopefully
i guess she might steal Type Houdou ?
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
isn't that depressing
at 9S
will have a chance to beat BKE on Type HoS
HoR with her new toy and new support
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
you should put that effort into beating Lolicon Master
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
unless you put ele restriction on it
Type Weather is just so bad, if you make a neutral Type Boss, it become Physical boss
that mean the competition on Type Bio will be even more depressing
actually it's so hard to release a physical mech that is miles better than BKE
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
which everyone and their moms have
not better than SS2 BKE
better than S0 BKE
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
why is this named Fischl instead of BK
backpulling only work if you're like this
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
HoH is also already old valk
T1 : 763
T100 : 594
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
that is enough to retain in Nirv
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
for the giggle
doesn't heki have all gacha ELFS ?
problem solved
get a gf/bf with huge badonkers/dongers and ask them to cosplay Vill-V
this small <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
QUA Mei would be sick but it has close 0% chance to happen
Mech, IMG and Bio
i can already tell next 3 suits type
that's 9 weeks
and you're considering pulling her in 6.1
3 weeks in this game mean a lot
i also think tmr is Kosma
yea probably lmao
RL tho <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
what does it feel like to be good at the game
do you guys ever wonder
next is lightning wolf
i was trying to cheer you up tho, Tet <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Greshy, you use Vill-V
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
Cause i bet your fight with him will look like coming out of Transformer
Can you use Transformer theme this time
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>

oh gosh gresham, i'm such a dummy player, i can't do anything well..... i really want this nirvana retain but i'm just so bad at the game! i saw your big and impressive score in myriad, you don't think you would..... pilot my account, would you?
gresham you got a really great score on myriad, you're so talented.. wow, i bet you can't do that on my account? or can you? you should try and find out!
gresham im only a rl player dw
<@370438895965306882> Greshy, want to do my Abyss tmr
start with G
i know someone will want to do it
these stances man
but i won't post it cause this channel is already weird enough
yea there is one
<:EulaChrist:842379237066539008>

im a virgin
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
in Genshin you have dummy from 1 to 1000
yea but HI is fun and have actual bosses to fight
tbh i still don't get how Genshin still manage to trick whales into swiping <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>

not on server with NQN
it's probably in nini private server
i still don't get why Kona become the emote represent for Americans
oh that one, probably American spirit <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:Gladge:967779035549663242>
but it look souless in EN
they're all so beautiful in CN and maybe JP/Viet
like HoH's skill names
<:Gladge:967779035549663242>
glad that i study Viet and CN
it's actually hard to translate CN into EN
i can see why it suck tho <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
i'd rather die than using dirty words describe Ms. Tao Dian's characters
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
turning her into traveler simp
i'd rather them don't ruin Hu Tao
i don't mind it tbh, Hu Tao is tricky to put into the journey
i like Hu Tao's design best, it's full of emotions <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
not on character design tho
i think there are still some effort putting into Genshin
imagine being tortured by Candace <:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
the start of everything
vibing rn while working
this is kinda lit <:life:1001518241610485781>
only HoF can use it
f*ck it airbone SP
airbone too
ignite
fuck it
im down for 9 more SP for each element : Physical - Lightning - Ice
or we need 10 more supports
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
not like old players can take advantage of it anw
with how many things new players need to buy
they should double the income <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
i thought it's like 80 ?
can you actually get 96 per week ?
this close
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
im this close to done with this game instead
it was paired with Jizo
not like we can use Phys on Houdou 1st week anw
i see <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
SnS just break the shield and Houdou go <a:agonPeaceOutC:819820630501359626>
i don't see Houdou being freeze <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
did you intentionally go for this ?
actually, why Selune <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
or HoH sp will be scuffed ?
AE instead of RC
did you try AE yet ?
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
who did you use ?
copium
but new mech physical dps might coming soon anw
yea just wondering
like not just as a support but as a mech physical dps
yea but in case of physical dps i mean
SSS SnS definitely 
Pull for Paga : probably depend ? <:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
or next patch
<:huh:966619839307321394>
80% ?
what is the chance next SP can kill SnS anw ?
and go for SSS SnS like usual
is it ever tell new players to still pull for Paga
no joke
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
oh this is why Houdou was with Jizo 1st week

It mean Tet is doing Starscream on live server
that doesn't make it better <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>

<:hmm:767936100920328202>

What’s that
But she performed better than SP, SP was struggling to get enough sp for boss phase and her dmg also was quite concerning
Definitely not cheaper, require SS0 as minimum iirc
She score decent in QUA whale, but that boss is kinda free for all ig ?

is it not Enterprise Resource Planning ?
call me the stairs because i want to be stepped on <:life:1001518241610485781>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
that's why summer Herrscher is gonna be Dudu again
high chance IMG Kiana will prowercreep her comepletely
i just realised, i can only use PE skin until 6.4 <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
just by pulling SS Vill-V
you could easily be a myriad player 4 times in a row during 5.9
actually true yea <:ICANT:921403877285306399>
best anni ever <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
free MC on anni so the only thing you can pull in that anni is either Dickens or Tesla 0
i almost got jebaited by it
later i experience the 1st anni of Honkai on 4.3 and it was horrible
mine was HoT cause i came back when i saw her beat the sh*t out of Kiana <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
it used to be hard for new players yea, and some skill issue players
AF couldn't do much in 150D
ER performance iirc
no copium
might do it again in 6.2
not that long ago
when was the last time they make use of that useful system ?
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
i will be fine with a Raven that can ult every rot without having to do anything for at least 3 rots <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
sth like  Fire suck, don't pull 
i can't wait for 6.2 to be Fire SP, someone will probably come up with sth to doompost her <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
what a menace
also tbh, using HoT on Kosma make me wonder why i didn't just pull Vill-V <:mfw:840549220406263859>
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
 dead valk before release 
i posted some extremely mald run and people be like
my favorite during HC and HoH patch was people asking HoT score on their bosses
what an echo chamber
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
by a lot you mean 90% of maincord
now that i think about it, i don't hold any grudge against him, probably just my temper went up yesterday <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
and he has some serious issue on voicing out his opinions
i don't know him before, just recognised the dude yesterday
yesterday, dude was in some help channel and advise someone to use Nyx - AE - JK
suck that he probably enjoy the attention
but the TRL guy in that drama deserve it
damn, that's impressive <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
wonder if it's a solo-project or sth
dude keep thinking game is going to end soon so he can quit or sth
it's kinda suck how the drama played out, but like Marisa already felt burn out at the game before
community work
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
70% Marisa won't even come back lmao
it's someone else work, marisa is currently on break or sth
yea that's what that company do best, keep putting out degen design <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
this is literally the gameplay
this company only make degen game
i like her hairs, not her color <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
the leftmost one catch my eyes
ofc no Husbando, it's a pure sex bait game <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
it have release date now <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
they also do other works
Tet, FBI don't stop at charging into pedo's house
cause it mean the hackers can get into the public server later with those codes
FBI had to involve to solve it
yea it's like the GTA 6 code leaked, not Genshin
their security is not that bad
HSR already dead before release <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
if you let some strangers in your party and come near you, you might get hacked and lose everything
btw, i heard that ToF is having some bugs involve with hacking <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
but it's beyond saving now
yea i also had a blast playing it
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
so they was in red zone for 2 years and can't even upgrade the game
but then the company invest in baseball team and lost all the money
pure raiding and farming
it was good 6 years ago
i think Blade and Soul fit what you want nini but that game is beyond saving now <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
i think Lost Ark is ok, i also don't like the alts part either but it was salvageable on early day
i literally have to force myself to play that <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
1 of the main theme for guilde resource require your guild to prepare for PvP
that's why i hate playing Black Desert so much
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
yea i hate pvp too, all i want is just raiding and grinding but not too much grinding
good one <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
but i was addicting to WoW on its released
yea that sh*t is like one of the best MMO ever made
isn't that a mobile game
ToW as in Tales of Wind ?
Elder Scrolls
that is something
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
modern MMO is terrible tbh <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
that passion is what holding me back
but he still yelled in discord every nights
the boss is literally near 50 and have 2 kids <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
more so because my guild have been running for almost 15 years lmao
i actually prior Lost Ark more than Honkai
but then they moved to Lost Ark and now im stuck in Lost Ark
glad that my guild decided to quit it altogether
yea that sh*t is terrible <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
like decent
i think that BD NA is still doing good on steam ?
that's how good Amazon at dealing with gold bots
and KR has been running for 2 more years longer
inflation in market already close to KR <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
i knew they will 100% fk it up
when i heard Amazon is publishing it
Amazon literally kill that game
im not even kidding
Lost Ark NA is doom lmao
<:642560581005737984:643464189259677706>
yea i just say SEA to make you guys feel better in case you guys don't get it <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
but not sure if SEA and GLB can get it or not
week 6 is EXPA and spending event
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
thanks god nini will sponsor me 6k Bchips for next patch or im doom too
no SS JK, no need to use unless Ice HoV <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
4 more cycles to go until this menace patch over
<a:SeeleNoted:874736846259781692>
400 torus, 520 metal, 150 nano
next patch already have 4 bosses to use RC on
im on upgrade RC
what is FR lead at S3 ? i forgot <:pepe2:368744338445828106>
depend on team
but you won't have to worry about the cooldown
also HB is forced to use CB 19 <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
never use RC unless on MA Starscream
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
JK is an upgrade for AE anw at S0
no copium
oh i actually mean it nini
SS Nyx will be good in 6.1
lowkey
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
if you're a beast you can copy Korath
<:peepoYes:965975508829483030>
i got outplaced by him everytime with my SS Nyx <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
search Korath
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
Nyx will take back T2 spot in 6.1
lowkey
are you sure you can clear QUA stage with your acc reptar ? <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
don' exhaust yourself
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
farm her through what ? crystals ?
<:HelloFbi:977468843884691456>
gres is kinda perv
why does your first thought is mind break
what's wrong <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
If you can’t extend Turg duration then Marg is better
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
No Marg either ?
Wait tet, why do you use Turg Eden with Shamash Pistol <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
No copium?
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
The weapons are all useless except 2 uprate
Position and crit
Kinda mald tho
Yea definitely
mine too cata!! i have all the mobis you need!!
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
this close to become maincord offical residence <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
im this close to RL <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
<a:worrySwingSadge:981759583779446866>
thinking i already done it
i was trying to sleep
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
the previous Hepha cycle, i got 700 and went to sleep but when i logged in again i realised i forgot to do side stage
not like i can tell HQ to tell other apartment to clean their sh*t themselves <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
i ran it down 800 trophies
im almost reach RL after this hellish month ngl <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
Maincord be like :  MA is useless, only need 46k on each boss  <:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
it's just fate
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
heki probably didn't read after that, keilo and me was typing a lot during that time
it's probably fate
i think heki asked about exchanging CB 19 6 hours before CN Abyss open
yea that info is too cruel for heki
that 3* Klein is a threat to Gresham tho
Streamer doing bedge strat, twitch chat spamming it
it's die of bedge, TFT emote
<:borrySit:1001445019661639680>
Look like sp issue on HoT
<:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
Yea im not paying for SS JK either
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
Them removing 1 grid from the Freeze meter that is
Maybe Mhy will reconsider it as a bug
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
HB now use FF all the time
But heki, CN changed Hepha Abyss, CB-19 have lost it last value on HB
This will be too cruel for heki
<:MonkaRex:746738692894490645>
I forgot to ping heki yesterday
Oh fuck
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
Have fun using her tho, but her S2 have to wait till BP
Yea sound about right <:borrySit:1001445019661639680>
<:HoVCookie:599331162690813966>
Idt her S0 can do better than SS1 HoT tho
<:borrySit:1001445019661639680>
I have Aponia, only S0 tho
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
if only her bosses show up
yea, i have the most fun using her, her combo is smooth and camera angle is not f*cking me over
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
but fr tho, where is tank, or heimdall
fire tank, ranged tank, ice tank, lightning tank
i will entrust you with the next 4 cycles Gres
hey <@370438895965306882> , Abyss is almost over, make sure to DM me and get my Abyss done this time too <:GanyuCall2:837254071856398347>
nini is losing it
don't have any this time <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
damn really <:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
<a:modcheck:870823155344756746>
fragile indeed nuke all so nothing left to be seen too
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
but Marisa can make her work, have you seen Marisa use starter Kiana do a 10 sec kill
<:worryComfortsLilBrotherChorry:900946731422867467>
<:borrySit:1001445019661639680>
CN T3 Previous round, Sep 13th 1925 :

<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
I will try looking for it once im free, if there are any
I see
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
What’s wrong
Triple supports team S0 JK ( 2* Elf Ely ) vs Optimus Prime 470D : 
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Tank, Husk and Kallen
i used to hate this guy because seem like he just translating CN's rumors but he seem genuine about doing this
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:woggerswhale:653576160231424040> ?
Keep up the good work, next in line is QUA Starscream
Sound like you’re having the time of your life
Jk but probably burn out
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Instead of feets like Genshin
Genshin players realised you need to use hands to play
But my previous bracket someone retain with 103 pts using HoH
I can’t say SEA is any better, SEA just look better cause bigger playerbase <:keqshrug:830244288028999681>
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
Abyss schedule is already exhausting
less people give a f*ck about MA
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
for mine too
remember to double the cost nini
yea, 100
5 for non-awaken, 10 for awaken
naked HC <:dongerj:981641448057356289>
nini fund me SS0 JK and SS new Bronya
usually 1 week before ?
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
try using this in your next record
i have some suggestions for you
quite sad, isn't it ?
the temp is not high enough for sh*t like HoT and Aponia to actually make a diff from DJ
RL rn is pretty meme
<:Okayge:1008753708391206982>
<:OMEGALUL:816800661626421308>
i don't think they made any announcement
but judging on the vid's tittle of using HB FF19
not sure if they even make an announcement
yea this one is kinda obvious on why they did that
<:OMEGALUL:816800661626421308>
oh also Klein
the only elf that fill up trauma is Sirin iirc
im not even sure if the elf have any freeze trauma ? doesn't it just extend freeze ?
<:worryCult:909541822936809542>
in 6.1 they remove 1 grid from it
oh 6.0
the order must be correct
you need RC weapon + CB 19 + RC Ult
yea for Abyss Hepha, in 6.0 specifically
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
good effort tho
carv putting a joke to light up the mood
Ranged Assaka is still HB shill <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:borrySit:1001445019661639680>
this is kinda lazy but whatever, dumb change, should have been this way from the start
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
i knew something was off
because HB doesn't need to use CB 19
lol i just realised why does triple supports feel better now
not better than ice taken from FF
it's only extra TDM
<:OMEGALUL:816800661626421308>
should have gave her a pri CB19
they actually realised JK having none freeze trauma in her kit make her become a burden instead of an upgrade
lmao
but i guess it kinda too much
this change actually benefit HB too
if sometime you see random freeze it's Can throwing bombs
can't let JK be a burden on the Herrscher boss now, can she ? <:OMEGALUL:816800661626421308>
probably feel better
but tbh i don't know why Newt B either
the blue circle is Newt B cooldown, it was almost done with the CD when RC exit the field so Can throwing bomb will trigger the buff
no, i don't think HoH and JK has any freeze trauma in their kit
DoE doesn't have freeze trauma
HB can use FF19 on Optimus now <:omegacumjestic:872116629918593074>
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
better than S0 HoH ? i think
it's decent at SS3 iirc
RC weapon active
now you can freeze Hepha after heat phase with just weapon active + RC ult
<:OMEGALUL:816800661626421308>
so that JK can beat HB
1 less freeze trauma now
they changed Optimus freeze meter
wait
<@370438895965306882> hey let me know when you're ready to do my abyss today <:GanyuCall2:837254071856398347>
<:worryCult:909541822936809542>
SS0 JK will save my poor HoH
But nini will get my back in 6.1
I paid 300 pulls for her and her S0 is literally griefing me, wdy want me to do
<:worryCult:909541822936809542>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
in 6.1 i mean
HoR should do decent tho
yea i think Nyx kinda blow herself up in this boss
it's triple supports team
isn't 615 pretty good for that temp ?
SS0 JK, 3* Ely, 474D <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
what about Griseo model
idk any language
is this also Brazilian joke ? <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
<:Okayge:816800409804210196>
our crystals
it's the evidence of 25.940 crystals
it's your pic keilo <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I mean the crystal, idiot
Nothing can escape my sight
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<:OkaygeBusiness:900551897251979317>
You mean our crystals
Cause 3 pc Turg is still huge for ice specifically
Somewhere between 85-90
About 90%
After that it would be some random ice bosses here and there
So expect that thing to appear a lot for 2-3 more patches
You only need CB19 on Optimus Prime but it’s HoH main shill
Wow that is literally nothing <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Heki already do that on basis
Bussy <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
It require 3 per donation
Donating to armada commissions
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Groom minor
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
But they choose to put it in 6.1
Crazy how ranged Assaka coud have been Aponia shill anywhere from 5.7 to 6.0
That is some mood for Monday alright
I bet week 2 MA will have FGO because that’s how it supposed to be
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Nini got my back on this one
Ice HoV
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
That’s lot of work and time
It vary
bad player
can't do 50F in Griseo event
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Next new trio will be a team
If a valk doesn’t havw built-in breach, the breach buff from AE will be 3-4 times more important than usual
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
But Aponia need breach to make sure she will be paired with Eden 100% of the time
Vill-V also has another multi on collapsed target i think ?
Yea Mobius has double independent multi
Aponia also has built-in breach among all FCs <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
JK stig still seem to be pretty broken if you ask me
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
you better have 4* Dabber
Yea with these temp
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Ofc nini will get me SS0 JK day 1 but what about others can’t afford it
I hope im really understimate her buff value because she look useless at S0
She seem to be doing a lot of hit tho
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
Her S0 to S3 lirerally doing nothing for the team
It’s for JK dps
6 in bchips, 6 in spending
her S0 to S3 is literally to enhance her personal dmg
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Not Carv trying to sell Nyx
4/4 or die
50% already on her stig
It’s on her stig
It need to be SS to be broken, is it not ?
I don’t even think her rank up from S0 to S3 have anything broken
<:TeriDerpMelon:928714410762063943>
Im still not sold on S0 JK > SSS HB like maincord keep suggesting
PV > GD every time of the day
Should have learn 1 or 2 from Jenshin
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Honkai drama just suck
This sh*t blow
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>

That essay look like it require more than 1 braincell
Any tldr
<a:worryramen:967581731395870770>
summon a fire SP
yea not the best one to deal with in Abyss neither
good luck
if you don't have enough tickets it will be one hell of a grind
at some point you need to stop being poor
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
2 weeks is enough yea
so 18 entries per G4
140 per piece
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
do you think HoR also say  Ride On  on bed ?
naked HoR <:dongerj:981641448057356289>
HoH only have 1 boss so far, even a naked HoR will score better than her on Ice HoV <:huh:966619839307321394>
are you seeing things hak
5 ice bosses ? <:huh:966619839307321394>
i want him to be Soundwave
SSS Heimdal is next in line
SK -> Para Husk -> QUA Shockwave -> Lightning Wolf
SpA can score well even on lightning wolf
just use SpA
or  I want to use my S0 BKE 
are you one the people who also said 
 Woohoo, i can't wait to use Turg RC 
why do you type it like it's bad that it's not type wolf ?
could be type wolf
could be worse
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
with 470D
because Lightning Andrius is coming back
you can morb 1 week from now on
to morb ?
next week look good
if your PE is busy then 70% chance FT is your answer
this week
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
it's Cezzing time
but you don't need all of Paga
6.1
Paga was 5 patches long
Shujing is still the SP stig that live longest
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
i don't miss it when i have to use BKE and SA on SSS Jizo + Type HoS
<:life:1001518241610485781>
said no one ever
i miss those days when BKE need to use SA
that is some necrophilia sh*t but i won't judge you on that <:HMM:966625453194485760>
but it will motivate keilo
my D ?
without multiple servers they would be at 800D
CN have 20 servers
they're 483 now
wonder what does it feel like in KR
CN is struggling with 478D <:mfw:840549220406263859>
at our D i think SS1 HoR is enough to compete with S0 HoH yea
AKA fight was fun tho
more or less yea, they also release SpA to deal with AKA which is like 50.000 years old boss and literally no one ask <:mfw:840549220406263859>
the sole purpose of that DK is just to create 2 niche af bosses ngl <:mfw:840549220406263859>
on Type she has to compete with BKE and SnS
on Ice she has to compete with HoH 
on MA she is useless
but the problem is more on her competitors
HoR deal ton of damage with DoR yea, G4 is already enough to bring her back from the graveyard
this close
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
Still can’t be replaced on Tank unless fire SP use Bow
Turg RC is a menace but it’s good
You can use Fire SP + RC
Buff value, duration, ease to play, smoothing rotation, lot of things a fire SP can offer to kick out AE
Breach is important if you don’t have built-in breach but when you do it become less important
You don’t need breach to replace AE
<:life:1001518241610485781>
The problem is
accurate pfp too
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
I'm telling you, Marisa Honkai is as cracked as he is jacked. I saw him at a 7-11 the other day and he was buying cases of stamina pots and adult diapers. I asked him what the diapers were for and he said  they help contain my full power so I don't completely shit on fragile . And then he rode Krishna out of the door.
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
it become fun
gatekeep new players but when you actually learn how to play it correctly
Honkai is so f*cking bad
<:515476106753867776:515730530310815744>
yea but when will awaken Sigma come to SEA ?
new players getting gatekeep from playing the game
the more meta a game is, the less value a guide become, kinda suck ngl
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
guide doesn't outdated in 1 week
i think Genshin is really a good game and that's why it can afford to have good community
people already looking toward futrue when HoH didn't even get released in GLB
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
Valk value 
- Power : strong, meta 
- Usage : 2-3 bosses, good coverage
- Pulling advice : don't because she will be 1 patch old by next week
and it will become like this
you need like 2-3 weeks to make a good one
you know what is funny about Honkai's valk guides ?
it look huge either
you're not missing this one
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
probably did it intentionally
does the Moriso's drama include one ?
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
pretending to be a young boy to trick older woman is also catfishing
wtf that's a lot drama i don't know about <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
we need more players vs players
Honkai drama is like players vs Mihobo
Drama
What Honkai community always lack
<a:diesofcringe:972420698654003210>
But the 2nd part is cringe
Well i guess most informative HI3 CC is true
That is kinda cringe ngl <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
suddenly things get serious
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
that was awesome
he also read the Peko copypasta out loud while Tet trying to kill the zombie
i was deeply moved when Gresham yelled  It's yeehaw time  <:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
<:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>

1680 Bchips in 6.1
We’re playing gacha game
Too bad
So not until 6.6
3 S-rank slots are already booked
Not soon enough
Lightning Para
<:echok:977515701961117706>
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
aight you can forget the convo about FT above
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
can't be that bad, yea
if you try hard enough
i think you can get a good 69 pts
but playing FT on Nirv
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
on Nirv, FT should be better
Shieldbreak
it's boss stage
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
Otto is the true heavy shield
2 sp off to use ult
the 2nd rot on SK, MPE will start with 68 sp
if you can't dodge SK's attacks precisely
i will give you an example with SnS on this fight back then
overall better performance than whatever the hell you run on SnS
extra dmg when you break the mob and boss's shields
sp regen, can 1 rot the zombie, better buff since SnS can't use Cez B anymore
and is indeed a good one
Hiroshi posted again <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:okfine:971481680265216130>
12/12 Morb can score a decent one vs SS DJ
You can morb on Para Husk
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Kinda concerning
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
I found this gem
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Lowkey
Lowkey couldn’t be worse than Turg RC
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
That’s what poverty felt like nini
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Nahida next S-rank battlesuit
That’s Nahida
RNG = fun <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
It’s variation
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
Also, Hiroshi hasn’t posted anything since 2 weeks ago
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Where is Pri - Stigmata
479D ?
Yea it’s already felt like reaching rn with 46x
I already felt like stretching with 461D
How can CN even 1 rot the zombie anw
Even with Griseo
Good to know nothing change
This boss is still the same as i remember how it was back then with SnS
Or else you can’t meet the check point of damage
Starring Dabber in this fight is actually important <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Good story but sh*t gacha
Ikr
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Cause Benny and Hellmaru was her shill
HoR also has extra TDM against Psy i think ?
There were a lot of weird type counteted passive back then
Extra 16/16 if you SS day 1
Probably, you need 480/480 and 32/32 on patch day
<:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
Still rank advantage
Yea but you can still use the old trio
<:Okayge:816800409804210196>
Imagine if they’re Herrscher augments
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Instead of SSS new Kiana
Then i think i will SS all 3 of them
If new Mei and new Bronya are supports for new Kiana
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
HoR is also part of the trio
Probably tank that week too
Don’t know about SSS Houdo tho
If Ice HoV only show up one
Tank a -200 is also not a bad idea
If you skip JK then you can’t skip HoR DK, need an answer for Ice HoV
Skip <:Okayge:816800409804210196>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
at best you can maintain aroud 3-4 stacks with elf ?
so elf is not enough
it's 1% physical dmg taken per stack and the stack only last for 5 seconds iirc, max 10 stacks
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
yea, value MPE over FR
the farm recommendation
does MPE even worth more than FR in term of new account value
wait, this one is kinda bad, no ? <:hmm:767936100920328202>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
if you're in a pinch that is
i won't upgrade anything unless it can gain sth in return
what's wrong
probably it
and sleep
yea probably for real F2P, just pull JK gears + Eden weapon supply <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
for a good start
can they at least buy newbie BP
kinda hard to give F2P advices <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
so you have like 10% chance to get a valk that can use 1 of the 2 DKs
how many valks are in Dorm Supply again, 20 ? <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
when you can walk out with 2 DKs ?
is it bad to sink at worst 50 pulls into new DK supply
let assuming they're F2P <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
so it's more than enough for eary contents
+ they let new players get the G2 version of Ana, Peary now
new DK supply also have AF in there is high chance you can get both DK
they can actually have her if they buy the newbie BP, it has HoR and like 5400 xtals in there or sth <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
HoH is cool and fun but she is also damn expensive for 0 reason <:keqshrug:830244288028999681>
you get +20 atk and a decent S-rank that can carry you through level 1-81
the cost efficient from getting HoR new DK is too much <:keqshrug:830244288028999681>
skip HoH
i would say
yea if you're new player in 6.0 or 6.1
just keep chasing the supports route and you will always end up in  RL Masters and below
in my perspective rn, if you're a new player, you don't even pull for the newest Herrscher until EX
I think she is a good valk but like, why would you ever advise anyone to pull for her
Yea Aponia is a “ good to have “ <:keqshrug:830244288028999681>
There is a high chance those 3 will cover all 3 elements
Like lmao
And Mihoyo literally show 3 new S-rank in the next 3 patches
And they will need 1-2 months before those valks can even be used properly
Too risky for new players
Shouldn’t consider pulling for any S-rank atm
Im honestly agree with fragile on the tier list pulling recommendation
His tones when commenting are so aggresive
I’d say fragile held a grudge against marisa lol
2 days, patch day is on Thursday
Free S-rank box event start on Saturday not patch day <:holothink:963352118855626753>
what's that
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
<:HoVCookie:599331162690813966>
Don’t need to farm the bars like an idiot
SS0 HoR or SS1 is also important in Abyss
10 for awaken, 5 for non-awaken
I mean after 25 weeks if Mihoyo still haven’t released another ice support then maybe F2P can still use her
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
HoR rn is dead dead
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
HoT
yea but our current line up are not balancing for S0 to do their gimmick bosses <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
and i don't like this new gen
we're reaching new gen
you mean S2 right ? <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
does nini even have BKE ?
isn't Sim Battle now just HoT + KMB ( + AE if it's Jizo ) ? <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
then die again
she also got revived for half of a patch by Utu
or 2
she was meta for 1 patch
VKE was a good one
im not a lolicon
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
extra TDM on Bio bosses, hope it will be enough to overtake BKE
SoE also target BKE bosses <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
she score same with HoH
but in RL
HoR f*cking blow in Nirvana
ofc HoH's bosses won't be stolen on Nirvana but for the love of god, 90% of playerbase not even in Nirvana
what's wrong with that
jfc
but don't revive them to kill the previous S-rank
i actually don't mind them keep reviving old valks
it's Nyx DK
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
the flower part is in Seele's hand
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
VA from physical to HF lightning
it did change element
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
im this close to send a truck to Mihoyo
change her type to IMG too
i need HoF augment
should be on Oct 20th for valk reveal
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
next patch will be fun until they put 2 FGO and 2 Kosma again
we need to accel into the future keilo, no more waiting in the past
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
tmr will be Ice HoV
next patch look more fun
cause god help me i don't want to run Holmes on FGO
maybe it will get back to 450 on FGO <a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
yea SEA is 461
does NA Abyss 461 too ? <:hmm:767936100920328202>
it's a sleep angle
i will need to run Holmes on HoS
if temp go pass 465 in Abyss FGO
oh i just realised
everything about the last 2 weeks are a menace
after that the line up is a menace
it will end after i do a quick 5 hours on SK
actually
patch already ended
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
Kalpas
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
heki will pull Vill-V on QUA Herrscher patch
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
heki will spend into that patch pyramid skin instead of the valk
for 10 weeks at least
i won't comeplain
if 3 of them are a team
lowkey
CN will hire some truck or hyperion truck to Mihoyo HQ
that's a truck angle <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
as always
probably Bronya
who is the bait one in the trio
the question is just
CNY is guarantee double S-rank
3 patches
10 years at least ?
Honkai was normal then the Flamechasers came
cause the update is like x2 faster than 1 year before
CN players does complain a lot recently  <:keqshrug:830244288028999681>
they use her model
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Elysia is playable Nagamitsu
we already have playable Nagamitsu
i don't think a water gun can scare them but maybe some of them scare of water
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
so it's just a matter of  want  instead of  need 
waste of time
adding old valks won't bring them any good
i mean if you look on business side
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
but you guys won't get the rest
should be day 1 for GLB
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
kinda F2P friendly i guess
<:borrySit:1001445019661639680>
aight, SS0 and sit
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
what does her SS1 do, is it broken ?
just enough for SS0
6 max but you can only get 3-4 if you plan on exchanging elf frags
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
limit 2 packs only
it's 3 JK stamps per pack
AE, FR, HoR, MPE i think
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
JK packs - 1280 * 2 
S-rank pack - 1680 
Summer Eden - 1680 ( ? ) 
Total : 5920
how much Bchips does 6.1 cost again <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
You can try using some Charlie Chaplin’s music in your next vid
That’s a wild setup
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
probably 800 by now
imagine CN temp without their 20 servers
should have make 2 server for KR to reduce the stress
playerbase are probably huge
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
they surpass CN
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Is the double spin bug still here ?
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Don’t you have Mei M ? Idt Jst M work on HB
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
After that you better hope you’re not raging into thin air
Yea the first 2 hours of repeating you will slowly get used to it and naturally get rid of useless movements
Why not 690
too bad for EU i guess
Apple forced every apps to update their prices like 2 weeks ago, it's in their policy <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
and some specific countries
yea only EU
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
they already updated the price on my Iphone screen so price already go up on IOS
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
not sure about Google Play
all games raise their prices, it's inflation or sth, only on Appstore tho
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
6.0 feel really long now
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
the previous one and this one are both easy <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
uhh, the auto battle one
i guess people complain a lot about that one <:pepe2:368744338445828106>
only the chess one was hard
the abyss is easy dw
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
my mood is my OCD, i will actually can't sleep for 3 days if i mess it up
unless Mihoyo specifically make it impossible to buy out
but i will die if i know that i can't buy out the shop
yea, you don't need to do 12 times the daily if you don't plan on buy out the shop
you only need to do the daily 12 times
guess i was wrong
i thought this one is supposed to be easy for everyone <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
how is this even possible <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
he doesn't, he skip HoH
you miss 44 pts there, how is that an almost <a:modCheck:931874369213435944>
i can barely hold myself together now <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
i couldn't see it anymore after 2 hours trying
yea you want to time it right after you see the red circle
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Gres, say my name
7% or something like that
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
I bet Tet spent 10 minutes dancing again before damaging the dude
<:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
I think i sleep a total of 20 hours the past 7 days
Other apartment messed up big time and mine have to clean it up <:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
Probably have to settle with 700
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
I can’t even see the AoE circle of Hepha anymore
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
My lack of sleep is killing me
instead of sniping
i'd say they're struggling in side stage
looking at that score
the other 2 answers for this menace is waiting in 6.1
HoH vs non-HoH
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
you're supposed to like it with your IO
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Probably both
Playing Raven or playing S0 IO
But i don’t know what is worse
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Without the bug SS SpA should be better than S0 IO
The dude was a menace ngl
For the giggle
We just got the para one
Yea there are 2 type Husks
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
Surely IMG Kiana will take over IMG bosses with Fire SP in 6.2
Need the boss to show up on live for more detail
SSS PE > SSS MPE > S0 PE for Vill-V
I hope
Until 6.1
BKE also top score Type Houdou
But if your damage blow he will have more than 1 phase
He only has 1 phase
The dude
Even when you win, you win like 5 pts
Yea it’s actually hard to compete with Physical for all the reasons in the world
This is even worse than HoS on Griseo 1st week lmao
Hope Mihoyo still rememeber she exist 1 year from now to rerun HoS
Her 3S is specifically for HoS yea
<a:modCheck:931874369213435944>
Unless SS1 JK is broken
Griseo make the gap between them too big
I actually think it’s still BKE lmao
It’s kinda amazing how much AF boost a sh*t valk to this point
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
With rank
If the boss is Bio, the answer is always BKE
I just remember her SS is a must or some sh*t
I actually don’t know her rank up
Her timing to use sh*t is a menace
Eden and Turg is 10 times better than whatever you put on RC
<:keqshrug:830244288028999681>
And if i have to be honest, ice supports are nowhere near the level of Physical and Lightning
Yea SoE look fairly normal now
Only Type
The lower the temp, the less advantage she has
She needs time to charge up so
I can see SSS SnS tie with BKE on RL Jizo
She became a beast
When BKE get her rank up over SS
No shot
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
Also sp management kinda sus
She will probably have some trouble with QTE on Tank
But she is just blow
Hepha has extra TF to make her look good
Her TF actually blow
Not just that
Couldn’t be worse than HoF tho
I lowkey think HoH suck at it lmao
Think so
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
SS HoF will take it back
Realistically speaking when AE is out of the team
Not even at SSS
Probably when AE is out
<:dongerj:981641448057356289>
HoV shield will be so damn huge
CN IOS is 474D now
That boss is the definition of 1 answer only
For Ice HoV on CN server
I actually can’t wait
Then nothing is ?
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Nice joke
yea after the big flame hit you need to freeze him to cool him down
if you freeze the dude, the bar will rise up and when it  fill 2/3  the dude will rage

Kallen’s suits used to be fun and strong, now she is just fun
<:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
My fav mech dps
There was also RI
Doing nothing but shooting
Imagine using HoR on ranged Assaka
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Her new weapon active should also be ranged too
<:bronyastick:1013082286851366952>
She will be carrying you again next patch
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
They should have make more Type Mech
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
7TR looking strong with type counter buff
<:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
You can HoT through it with ease
<:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
She can clear you
<:life:1001518241610485781>
That is some menace run
<:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
Maincord will tell you to run Turg RC instead of Raven
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
Fighting the dude
I have motion sickness
Even lightning wolf is not better for me tbh
Should have stop pushing that thing out
Wolf is just a menace
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Like SS HoT vs S0 IO
Speaking of wolf, does HoT perform good on Lightning wolf ?
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
I think mimi said she could do Fire Tank and Ranged Tank fast enough to be T2
Does her coverage even bad <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
And score more than your avg MPE players
Im 100% sure a S2 Vill-V can do blind run
You have to bald for it tho <:hmm:767936100920328202>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
But isn’t she just perfect for EX tier anw
Copium
And 6.2 Fire SP will make her even become better
Granted that the content is hard because of her
She makes hard content become easy
Ex tier ?
Isn’t Vill-V just
The more i think about it
Ngl
<:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
MPE is definitely good but i will use every single excuses possible to not use her
S2 ? Can you stop embarassing yourself
Ex tier
SS2+ ? Cool
MPE is just a veteran check
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
Ice patch for real this time p
And HoR also has 3
If HoH still have 3 cycles in 6.1
Now that i think about it
What a beast
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
<@180679257851166721>

and SoE is niche compare to it
that weapon is so unfair lol
<:meiroar:1013082206098444300>
you're fked
if you don't have anti-lightning mechanic
HoT on her way to steal every single boss ever exist
SSS HoT score more than SS2 DA i think ?
oh you actually won't even use DA on Pig looking at that line up
at clearing side stage
yea DA is still a beast <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<a:mhworryrun:998945496318087198>
enough of these running around like idiot mobs
yea i use dabber in that sh*t side stage
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
 let me stop my rot real quick and pick up some orbs 
even when you use Mobius
the bio lightning side stage is the worst ngl
<:woggerswhale:653576160231424040>
just sleep
well that's 15k
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
if you're a new comer to Nirv
there are a lot of sh*t side stages ngl
at best i think they're just tie
Hiroshi hasn't released new vid for S0 JK so i can't say for sure but half of the vids of S0 JK it's lower score than previous Benares cycle <a:SusgeClap:835512309480161280>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
but the tier list one is good me think
like S0 JK > SSS HB one <a:SusgeClap:835512309480161280>
but recently Marisa's takes have been a little sus
it's good to raise the the player awareness tbh
i don't blame Marisa for wanting to push out contents
what's wrong ? <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
previous cycle, they also bald to improve from 701 to 704 on Kosma
yea shino always bald til last minute recently
841 on last minute iirc
it was Shino

but i think you can get 1k minimum with any random drawing
yea it's not worth if you exchange the xtals into real money
participate in the contest i think, but you need to establish a decent followers
isn't being an aritst on Hoyolab can farm you infinite xtals ?
probably being an artist tho <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

no hak you need to put your FR on field and hit couatl
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
Or MA TF slave
Carole is more of a mech dps now
And SK top score now is Griseo Paga M
Even on huge shield boss in RL such as Otto you can just put Paga M on Griseo and retain on it
If new players prior then it’s always Griseo yea
also i want HoR to top score Type Houdou and Type HoS too so i don't have to run BKE ever again
they better hide that boss forever <:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
these Halloween emotes looking funny <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

Owo 8ball should i try Kosma for 1 hour
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
HoR will need to waste double the time of S0 HoH
but the crab is Psy
Benny is typeless
i think S0 HoH capscore on 470D is 700
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
that score is terrible
this close <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
<:TeriNotStonks:1009441195673538642>
score going down
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
i only know how to use Nyx
you will actually need someone that already use MPE on that menace to watch it
6 years of milking players
Honkai just gross 1B revenue
i don't think the game will end anytime soon <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
i'd rather eat -400 than spending on QUA valks that is not Herrscher tier ever again
that is true
nini is this close to pull S0 Vill-V <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
you have to position them too
yea you do
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
does your stat match Shino ?
where does your damage go <:pepe2:368744338445828106>
for the giggle
if you have SW you can use her
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
so physical has advantage on these bosses
iirc lower def than normal physical boss
the dude 705
oh i mean in SEA it's S0
close enough
S0 HoS <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
highest MPE in SEA rn is 705 <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
this one ? <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
this is the most pathetic mindset i have ever seen
holy f*ck what is this inferior complex
with 50 more D <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
who did you use to deplete Couatl ?
there is no stacks on your FR
also
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
wtf is this
you need to do it like thread in the needle <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
time to unleash the fps cap ?
<:keqshrug:830244288028999681>
they better not reduce her bosses because HoR also need shill
it's already 1 out of 3
or at least she better be
HoH will most likely have 3 on 6.1
3 on release, 3 on next patch
so far they're about the same
 maybe just a little bit more  <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
most people will slack so it's your time
tbh, QUA bosses are the one where undergeared accounts try the most <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
you need to actually pay attention to him
yea this boss actually f*ck on your reflex
Said no one ever
“ Woohoo, can’t wait to put Turg on RC “
As long as RC Turg exist i will never like that team
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Replace all the sh*tters
I think new fire team will just be Dps - Fire SP - RC tho
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
Yea if next fire SP replace AE she might go to WT soon
I will need to see the next fire SP kit first before deciding who to pick from that pack <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
New players get it easy now ngl, you can legit get SS1 HoR even if you only start playing in 6.1
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
At least it’s a 840 on Kasumi
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Doesn’t seem like it change for you
F*ck this week
Oh yea just skip this week
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Alberich bow or some sh*t
The meme strat that shoot to death
The physical gun
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
No joke but if they have nothing for physical, getting PBA will even let you score more than A rank Carole
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Yea probably, most people in maincord use supports to deplete Kosma stacks too
Even S0 HoF can 47k Kosma <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Isn’t 47k like running non-optimal valks ?
oh you don't, the drone still up is enough
yea, JP gacha + competitive aspect is literally a homeless angle <:keqshrug:830244288028999681>
stay poor
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
you have never played a single JP gacha
this is highkey a blessing ngl
i still don't know why Vill-V isn't Fire SP
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
i actually don't know how to explain, i do it just base on my reflex to the  ting  sound <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
nini just turn on the sound <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
wait wdym by how to break, after he charge -> open his body -> collapsed attack
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
MA ?
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
use HoH
wdym you give up <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
that's a little too far <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
nini, you're supposed to bring your HoH to T1 <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
you need to have HoT first
FR is this close to being useless <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>  
and 7TR make a comeback for HoT on literally every single boss ever exist
epi you will still use HB if you plan to use triple supports <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
if you still use HB then what is the reason to not SSS her
like 5% ?
i remember extra ice dmg taken
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
and it still won't matter
cause in RL you can make 10.000 misplays
everything we talk are Nirv standard anw unless specify RL
<:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
this close <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
can you try for 300<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
don't use SS HB
i expect her outperforming around SS1 ngl
my cadet got confused for a moment
but Marisa seem to think otherwise
yea i expect that much too <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
he appear twice this patch hak <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
my cadet told me that Marisa said S0 JK 1/4 with Turg is better
seem like S0 4/4 JK is not better than SSS 4/4 HB
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
didn't they give each CC like 5k xtals per post ? <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
content creator money
not a bad idea
it is
zhenyi is in firepower
time for Omega Strikers, enough of Honkai today <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
f*ck this boss
my reflex is fked
not even 0.1s
1 second after

jebaited moment
but the attack come after
it  ting  first
this f*cking boss

what a beast
oh right, MPE can't get the buff from Beet M <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
intentionally troll the run
probably troll on the HoH's run
that ult on the last crab is so random
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
probably to fit S0 damage
look like he intentionally nerf HoH
looking at HoH ref
how can the score be so close
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:FuHuaApprove:660878725356847105>
It multiply the comedic element of Tet’s run
<a:worryramen:967581731395870770>
Should have enough dmg looking at your vid
HoH end ult - RC QTE combo weapon active - Ult to execute
Just end it while the buff are still up
<a:worryramen:967581731395870770>
Like i said above
Try to cut down time on P1 first Tet
<a:worryramen:967581731395870770>
JST M is a good cope one
You think it would be faster if she just end HoH ult at 1:09 and use RC ult to execute the core ?
for abyss ? just record your best run <:holothink:963352118855626753>
465D now
SEA is slowly reaching 470<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
there wasn't a ref of SS0 on the same temp back then on IOS server, in android 468D the diff was SS0 ( 762 ) vs SS1 ( 775 )
and put it on DJ ?
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
does Bio Physical even have a purpose to exist ?
if they care about Bronya then Mech Physical
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
cause 95% the time you won't even reach your old score
it become stressful once you want to improve it
just weapon is lucky enough for your situation
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
i don't think hak will have enough xtals to get any of those <a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
and now suddenly we cross that point
but i won't say she is decent at S0, more like Mihoyo balanced her damage back then around 450D
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
i don't even think S0 can 1 shot core ?
it's 463 in SEA rn
yea S2
PE is decent on her weather
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
wait for live version i guess
so now no one will ever know at what point JK is better than SSS 4/4 HB
i think people in beta was so hype to test JK that they all upgrade her to SS0+
should have reduced weapon active CD too smh
HB ult is 18.5s with RC, CB 19 is 20s
higher attack, more dmg, doesn't need to change your rot to wait for CB 19 desync CD
im curious at which break point that JK is better than SSS 4/4 HB
don't ever upgrade FF pri just because you want to put it on HB
CB 19 is fine yea, just need to wait 1.5 sec after the first ult
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Bronya will be the grief supply again
But knowing Mihoyo
I do hope they are augments so Mihoyo can release all 3 of them on CNY
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
They will persuade me that it’s close to 4/4
Dw maincord will come up with some weird 0/4 usable combinations
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>

it's Newt B on RC to fit with the rot
he thought Newt B was on JK
that dude didn't watch the vid
Cez won't be up in time in P2
Newt B on HoV is because of the rotation
oh btw <@385655541248163840>
but tbh, SS1 is a good stop point
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
so i actually think her SSS is irrelevant now outside of SSS MA
it's good back then cause HoR is so f*cked up with sp regen but SoE and Liu Qi look like it can let HoR use ulti back to back
if her SSS is still relevant or not
her SSS is also good but im actually not sure after they buffed HoR sp regen with SoE
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
yea HoH has too many waste animations
SA is the longest one to stay alive until she didn't
but to think HB would die like this <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
yea on Hepha she will probably need it
he has like 2 lines of sp red
sp reduction on RC
<:HimekoLMAO:928714433809756170>
he prepare the affixes for 470D+
but he can't grieve his affixes
Aka can get more pts
3* Elf Ely <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
oh wait, Shino pull a 839 today <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
i guess i just used to play around FF pri more <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
it's akayuki
and Felis need to freeze the boss
cause i can't one shot P2
idk about SSS tho but if i use CB 19 then i have to wait a little bit on P2
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
having to wait 1.5 sec is basically losing 10 pts
yea CB 19 is griefing this fight ngl

“ This game is so expensive but i can’t quit, this is awful “
My cadet vent about the game more than me
Can’t scam free points
Finding a cadet is so hard these days <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
yea i don't want anyone in my social circle know im in this server so not the friends we made
for me it's about the will to play this game
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
they better not put HoV on patch day
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
nice HoH shill you got there mihoyo
Houdou and HoV gonna be on first 2 weeks
it's just mean
also i still don't know why SoE has to be on patch day
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
they want to rival Microsoft
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
again
cut off 1 week for fun
they shorten it, Sushang gears i mean
look at the duration <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
We can reach 470 by the end of this patch
Temp rising steadily
Only Judah
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
What is NA current temp ?
they play Honkai <:worrystare:653847469830176779>

don't ask the obvious Tet <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
can they at least split it evenly through 6 weeks
yea i hate how they frontload her Abyss shill
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
i expect last week is Kasumi
somehow PE and Vill-V have 2 cycles this patch
i hope 6.1 at least still have 2 ice neutral
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
im more worry about HoH shill
dw, we will get some live results before our 6.1 patch day <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
 I can't wait to test Nyx with QUA bosses on beta 
what kind of thought process you need to even reach that goal anw
no one is M enough to do that in beta
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
i don't think anyone try that in beta, we will see when JK goes live tho
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
which also happen to be Nyx weakness
abyss QUA was designed to cover Raven and AE weakness
she only use RC in MA Tona
yea, she never use RC to begin with
Nyx does get a better AE so not that bad <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
im actually a Fire SP believer
what the <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
around 10-15 sp i think ?
yea her SS is extra sp
i guess SS Nyx will reduce the malding part <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Unless your name is Vill-V
But that’s the neat part of QUA weathers anw
Granted that you need to mald for it
at S0
yea
she is still able to +100 in SEA so she is nowhere bad
Nyx probably
In 5 weeks
At best 14k i think
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
kinda tight
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
What is your goal next patch ?
this is actually a 50k on patch day or bust
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
PE outfit is also on patch day
probably 5 weeks patch i guess
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
just like they did with HoH
they cut off 1 week
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
no
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
2 weeks and 1 day i guess
yea it's 29th Sep to 14th Oct
shouldn't it be at least 3 weeks <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
why does JK supply only last 2 weeks
oh wait i just realised <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
if you mean by enough as in AG3 and AG4
HoH being Psy really screw everyone up <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
it's fine <a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
Interesting
That setup on Heim is
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
The sandbag
Next is Ice RPC
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
This might sound troll but S0 0/4 Aponia can score at least 530
chance they will buff JK personal dps on v3 for the giggle ? <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
zero <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
yea, 2 more days
so yea, kinda fucked up Sushang's backstory
unless they announce it
the novel will never reach that ending tho <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
she also was badly injured so she couldn't protect Shenzhou anymore
cause she need his org to protect Shenzhou <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
- Sushang vs Fu Hua 1 on 1 
- Sushang injured, Fu Hua also injured
- Sushang got put in the pod, Fu Hua joined Otto side
basically i can guess 1 or 2 from it
observed it, cause Fu Hua didn't have the answer he wanted
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Sushang got injured real bad that need 500 years in the pod
at the end Sushang and Fu Hua fought each other
and went along with him
Otto wanted to find the Immortal Phoenix to revive Kallen, Sushang met him on his journey
cause she went a journey to find Fu Hua and the novel never got finished
so im not sure how much time had passed since then when she got put in the pod
she actually act like a 15 years old in the novel <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
cause Mihoyo put the novel on hiatus
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
we actually didn't know how much time had passed in SS novel
oh 15 is when she was first introduced
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
and Sushang pissing me off
it's their schedule
honestly double SSS boss is not even that bad
i hit that 0.01% everytime
my first gacha was when im still a sp*rm <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
nini is beyond saving <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
im not, the combat look good and smooth tho so it gain some interest on me <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
glad that she didn't randomly teleport on my last try
Sushang just put some pressure on me
im this close to play Honkai 15 minutes a day
if this sh*t game keep continuing like this, when ZZZ is out, im quit in 0.1 seconds tbf <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
⌜eh, why are you here?⌟
⌜don't stare at my bio! idiot...⌟

⌜stop laughing! s-stupid!⌟
Tet, you already knew what to do
same <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
so no more HoT DiP
this one is already fixed, no ? <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
HoH might take over tank now <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
SW already took over Husk
actually
dw
oh <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
i guess SSS Hepha is also the same but not to that extreme
no one can touch it
SSS Houdou is design specifically so that
nah dw
TIL
someone just told me that Aponia can do Sushang transition phase faster than using PV ulti <:mfw:840549220406263859>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
That’s why you need 3 Ely set
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:POGGIES:838690911944572978>
you won't have enough sp to ulti without that 10 sp
still full bastet
you will never use it
what is the point of keeping KoC <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Domain of Ego
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Without new SoE even HoR will have a hard time
Yea
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
The only answer
HoR
The “ ting “ sound
Notice them by sound is easier
Our would be even more easy
CN myriad all use Griseo + Paga M for their 480D
Yea, Paga M on Griseo
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
Griseo is better than SnS so less crit mald
It’s actually less mald now
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
Not even HoT can do anything about it
SSS Houdou is the peak of niche
And to top it all
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
1 answer + HoT
New bosses were just
But the last 3 patches
CN had been putting off with those cause new SSS bosses so it was fun for a while
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
At least HoT is good
Even CN are mad af with how niche these revivals are
Honkai getting expensive these last 2 years, can’t blame anyone <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Or just the gacha in general
Grieved by this patch ?
Lol, burnt out ? <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:POGGIES:838690911944572978>
he is back to save the day
probably still better than your 900 atk FR
try SW <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
what's wrong ? <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
Im 100% sure DA without both AE and Raven is trash
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
highkey good
i guess this is a way to not let HoH has any competitor on ice neutral
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
average upgrade DK but cracked G4
so i guess it's balance out with HoT situation
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
cause it's dps focused
compare to Handel is even more cracked
the OP also said in his vid that Liu Qi is cracked
yea
probably week 2
5 weeks to craft full Liu Qi mean you miss on a lot of bosses for her
oh i just mean the shill in 6.1 <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
im not spending 5 weeks when the shill is over
and maybe 1 or 2 Liu Qi
yea it's still +10
they said it's  slower to finish  i think ?
yea and the new bike mechanic is not better than doing 3 charges in a row
they said the weapon rn is just +10 and to counter HoV + Houdou MA
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
or mech type
on neutral
it's actually not better than DoR
yea
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
oh wow CN are actually mad about new SoE
<:monkaStop:816801542211895327>
This boss scam like 150 pts by doing all the stupid mechanic
and Cez M is require
you need to fill it up
the boss has a bleed trauma bar by the end
wait a minute <:holothink:963352118855626753>
they stuck at lv 69 450/1000
F2P can't even even get to lv 70 iirc <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
I actually don’t have MA refs in hands <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:prayge:953617261535559680>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Probably Irene FR, Turg PV, JST RC for the team that hak want to use
even if that channel is half braindead it's still trustable on some matter
i remember maincord gameplay help did recommend it
where is GD
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
MPE dealing double her damage
but it's bugged hitbox
around 50% of HoH score
MPE should only be able to score the same with HoT on Ice RPC
MPE just abuase the sh*t out of it
but it's bugged atm
it does
can't wait for people to abuse MPE on ice RPC
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
but next week is Para Sushang + Ice Helicopter
on top of that no sp pack dropped
yea that boss look terrible
Top 10 <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
yea this elf supply is the worst if you aim for starring it
and i got 3* + 100 frags
180 pulls for 3*
during Dabber
i got struck by that once
full pity
yea i was looking at some of the refs and HB ulti is kinda annoying  <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
8% sp reduction on RC and the temp is too low to even use it
yea Aka said he grieved his HoH <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
jfc, the score is pretty high <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
<@385655541248163840>
let me ask someone else <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
doesn't have Honkai in my phone or my laptop so can't even do my Abyss <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
oh i haven't came home yet
tmr might be Type Kasumi
actually <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
at least 1 of them must be ice
3 bosses left
W5 P1 is Tona
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
For me meta defining dps valk are all Herrschers <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
I just mean gameplay wise <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
so in all seriousness, i think AE will join WT in 6.2 <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
we did have HoR went in WT before HoH
CNY Herrscher is gonna be fire
but im kinda serious here
AKA is trash tho <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
AE is joining WT soon
yea i have a feeling <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
but swimming and chilling tho <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
close enough
Valkyrie Gloria ?  <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
<a:SusgeClap:835512309480161280>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
And HoR rank up pass SS1 is kinda lackluster ?
SS AE is important if you want to sweat but 95% the time it is not the key factor to improve your scores
Those 2 options are both kinda “ whatever “ ngl
and you out here shaming him
he is just trying to have fun
<:life:1001518241610485781>
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
But wait for Freeze Hepha to see
Rino said our D is too low for sp red to come into play
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
I think Rino said everyone all use fhem’s timing across all D
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
no matter what rank your valk at, they're still sh*t if you stay in Masters and below
they're teaching you an important lesson
Gresham lucksack again
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
Finally Type HoS T1 spot might no longer be BKE
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
But they actually change JK to a support for both types of shield
SW finally a T1 container <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
wonder if this is optimized or not <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
T2 on QUA bosses, T2/3 on Ice Neutral, T3 on Ice Bosses with Type
She is surprisingly good at hanging on
fhem does make it look easy <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
SW only has Ice Ely left and i lowkey doubt it too
Benny + Hellmaru are both HoH's now
ice does get a lot of new bosses recently so there is that <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
i got the translated one, half English half Viet tho <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
can you at least craft Shakespear B for her ? <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
or you have sth else you want to pick from PE's S-rank box ?
i think her SS1 is fine to have, kinda ?<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
Agree ?
Buffing HoR after HoH
It’s still a shitty idea tho
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
wow even triple ice supports score better than S0 HoF
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
so Psy is their last choice
and Bio is just bad
i think she can't be mech because they want to revive HoR <:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
But yea next one will be IMG first
No normal type for a while
And the next one after that should be QUA
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Next Herrscher is IMG
Try search for link i posted with Benares in it
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
It’s CN temp, i remember posted it in here
S0 HoH > SS SW
<:hoshinostare:914555563889795112>
Only in 6.0 tho
Like 3-5 pts sth
S1 HoF barely increase score in Kasumi’s fight
S0 HoH lose to S0 HoF in Kasumi
Just Klein but higher numbers ?
What would new Lightning elf need to be better than Klein 3*
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Now that i think about it
those things better use on valk like HoS
she can use sp/s but not sp cost red
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
the SS Vill-V too ?
<:natsustare:914838084514902096>
Iirc
They did the same back then with HoT purple skin
For fun
They open the event 1 week early
The week after that
<:arublindstare:914194172204961792>
<@!385655541248163840>
It will start next week
Ywa
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
90% of the time Dabber strong point is big gather and TDM
Yea i’d go for Klein 3* there
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
And lightning is not lightning without 3* Klein
Their value are about the same but 3* Dudu matter when you try to 1 shot sth, most of the time IMG stuffs
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
You’re planning to pull for Klein first ?
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Yea not sure if they change foca select or not
60 pulls for weapon or 50 pulls per piece ?
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Im a beast at catfishing
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
But just block all
If you get exposed just change your bio into “ Have to take a break from honkai due to drama, DMs still open for my importance “
And you can get some funding in 1-2 weeks
Start talking with emoji
Yea you literally only need to go in honkai chat or beginner help
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
And you can catch some big fishes
You just need to not be yourself tet
Yea don’t use that one in maincord
Just join maincord, talk like a normal girl in there and after 2 weeks maybe some kind ~~simp~~ soul will buy you Hooman TM
Tet
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
Nini is about to smoke on the poor
I’d laugh til dawn if Hellmaru and Kasumi won’t show up in these last 2 weeks
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
And Abyss has Sushang + Clock
HoH shill patch
<a:cluedespair:965946296236122172>
F.I.R.E
I still think investing in PE rn is risky even though she is too broken to be killed by Fire IMG lmao
Hard to tell, if your friend only want a phys dps then i would just suggest MPE, she is the best at being mediorce
<a:cluedespair:965946296236122172>
And Kiana still has to use Raven + AE
Next fire elf will still be dog
Next elf
The bull is just IMG boss
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Keep moving forward
So just don’t
But pulling PE now is also sus
<:795357298481954816:798379305460957235>
Without fire sp
So it kinda sus atm
But im like 90% sure new IMG is gonna be Fire
<:782880522870980609:798379287341695096>
-1 placement
Paying by put you in hacker’s bracket ?
After 6.1 ofc
She is coming
Save for new IMG
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945>
That suck
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
150 pulls for 3* ?
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
does anyone actually read it ? <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
so skipping HoR is not even that big of a deal, just Ice HoV anw
not top score but retainable
triple supports team can retain in Nirv in HoH weather
i think the main reason why everyone thinking of skipping HoH is just because <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
only Ice HoV and SSS Houdou in MA
shouldn't be that bad
honestly speaking
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
if it's ice damage, im done with this game
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
wait it should be ice vulnerability
now im more confused
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
yea im confused looking at it
no weapon ? <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
or else you're playing in hard mode with how tight her sp gain is
sp/s on her is kinda mandatory
she is on-field too long for sp cost to be useful
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
maybe SSS SW can win against S0 HoH <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
ice benny
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
For the giggle
1 set of TB can be used on FR dps
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
Yea it will be useful
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
for max dmg
and i think 3S HoS use Glut T + Holmes MB ?
but it require too much effort
S0 HoS can also use it
Abyss
in general if you want to aim for higher cap
depend on strat but most of the time it's Holmes TB + Dracula M
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
isn't that kinda sus ?
i think 90% CNY valk is gonna be IMG Fire Kiana
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Ely has better uptime
at 3* Ely is 25% and WE is 24%
at 3* WE is 24%
it's 2*
but shorter duration
WE is 18%
yea isn't 2* Elysia < 2* WE ?
probably 40k in 6.1 ?
that's not bad
13k left <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
4/4 HoH + 3* elf ? <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
i can't check <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
don't you need to tag everyone ?
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
nini, any damage report ?<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
can't play until next week
im on a business trip
good luck nini and gresham <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
1 sp affix is okay most of the time
you only need that if you super sweat
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
Nini will also need some luck if she still go for full package
Good luck <:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Nini you still go for SSS ?
closing Honkai 3rd and release HSR + ZZZ <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
actually closing next year <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
this schedule is just being weird for no reason
but it's still bugging me either way
i mean she will still get them the highest revenue this year for GLB anw <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
yea i thought Elysia is this year new daughter, what's up with this schedule <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Tet already commited to be an AG enjoyer <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
but doable on most part
like without HoR DK, the budget is still tight <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
tbf JK alone is not enough to create this kind of situation, it's HoR new DK that put the final nail in the coffin<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
you think so ? <a:diesofcringe:972420698654003210>
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
JK + HoR is better than HoH
if you already have SW
this sound so troll lol but
yea, like <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
just eat the -200
on Ice HoV and some HoR shill
yea i mean even worst case possible
the thought of skipping Herrscher in their debut patch
it still bugging me tbh <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
yea the choice is pretty clear
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
but it will kinda be a waste if you can't get all JK stamps in 6.1 yea
so kinda balance out , i guess ?
but others may not have 4/4 HoH to compete with you  <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
it's just which valk do you choose to commit
i think both patches are fine to waste on
so i think it's just commiting or not at this point
assuming JK stamps has the same quantity with SpA, you need to spend 61k for all 7 stamps
<:hmmm:979143314718720020>
cause if you don't exchange JK stamps what will you even prior in anni shop ?
i don't think spending event info is gonna affect the decision much tbh <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
everyone in CN channel are all Nirv retainers tho <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
Fire need 2 SP back to back, agree ? <:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
at best a fire sp can only make HoF tie with HoH on Kasumi, the only boss they share <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
a whole new world of dumbness
that conversation was so dumb i don't even want to post it here lmao
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:worry_think_kms:653794252131794945> <:worrykms:398047795732545536> <:worrykmstears:398047796399439873>
raw dps test ofc
yea Liu qi in V1 is like 95% from Hooman stig i think ?
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
And yea BP is most likely Ana + KoR
V2 is friday
i can't play for the rest of the week, got a business trip to do  <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
i remember i didn't need to bald for PE QTE crit to break the shield this much <:hmmm:979143314718720020>
it was around 440 for SEA iirc
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
cause everyone just said  fuck it 
easy +100 or retain
no cap but shouldn't you guys want to fight Otto more
compare to just use Nyx and SW
just 5x more effort
yea she actually capable of scoring high
who even say that ?
 Wohoo, finally we can use Turg on RC 
yea idk why people in maincord be like
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
keep restarting if the mobs f*ck you up
the key of RC dps is just that
no FF, 2* WE
this one is fair <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
without FF and WE
wait what, no, fragile did 73x sth with RC <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
i miss when SP gears can last longer than 6 patches
only for 6.0
i thought it was sth like NEX TB and Welt M ?
RC dps actually prefer off-field
that's for ER sadly
good investment <:woggers:1002597195645714582>
until 6.1
still useful wow
soon it will be Hepha abyss and MA
you need burst rot and not spamming multi rots
but for Hepha and RPC i guess RC is kinda bad there <:holothink:963352118855626753>
but AE literally doing nothing on field
cause RC deal more dmg while off-field
she would still be an upgrade for RC
yea even if they halve JK dmg
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
she is actually good
but that is Myriad, for Nirv standard alone RC dps is not even a cope option
no more RNG
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
yea HoH will fix it
it depend on some RNG tho
in SEA
yea there were actually 5 people sneak in Myriad with RC dps
i remember during 5.6 SEA temp was lower than NA <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
last time Benares she still did quite good but that is low temp
for Hellmaru she actually only like 50 pts behind SSS SW if RNG is good
it depend on boss yea
while playing in EU
this morning someone even told me  Most of the time Nirv bracket is harsh for RC dps, you only get lucky 
keep putting out some weird advices
yea idk what's wrong with people in maincord recently
<a:Yaeslap:966597937696223232>
and somehow maincord still advise people based on 2021 Nirv standard
after Nirv expanding
people definitely slack a lot recently <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
+200
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
i think you didn't even survive kindergarten math <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
im lost <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Tet is actually a believer <a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
that sound terrible <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
you should wait til Saturday to pull hak
or else your HoH only worth as Bridge Valk and 620 xtals
you better pray for the weapon
you sure are excited with 12k xtals
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
6 per piece iirc
<:795357298481954816:798379305460957235>
cause everyone with PE shouldn't be in RL
But i can’t find the source
It’s just CN meme <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
Meme
<:huh:966619839307321394>
So CN Mihoyo doesn’t ask for a report every month or what even lead to that to happen ?
hak the bait is on Thursday, not Wednesday <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
what's with tmr <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
That’s a +200
Then again maintaining in AG3 is better if you’re confident in your ice team
Isn’t +100 enough to go RL ?
Time to farm some extra 100 trophies while you’re there
Hak going in RL for ice weather <:woggers:652740192653934633>
So abuse it for the last time
They fixed it in 6.0
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Don’t ask
It count as combo
Her air punch is combo
yea that's actually how people that is not pretending to be competitive work <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
i haven't even fought her in ER to know her mechanic
but doesn't seem to be hitcount
she has some numbers
don't think so
yea 6.1 will have Ice HoV + Bleed Vill-V
yea if the rotation doesn't f*ck PE over it will probably be PE boss
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
Bleed Vill-V look like a free for all
at least they still make neutral boss
1 less boss for fire
but Kasumi is ice boss now starting from 6.1 <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
now ice too i guess
only lightning and physical exist in this f*cking game
not like Fire is an element anw <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
probably just depend on temp, i just base it on last time the dude show up
<:life:1001518241610485781>
you will need SS2 DA to kill it in Nirv
next time it appear
yea Parvati is tanky
they're actually the less bullshit bosses in this fun and balance game
Tank, Heimdall, Parvati, Rimestar, Kasumi, Aka
tbh i like Fire bosses the most
yea all phys bosses are crit gaming <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
This boss is peak restarting
Or else it will mess up the dps phase
PE also need to crit all of her QTE on Otto P2
SK
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
CN discussion strike again with one hell of good takes
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
Im surpised they can even kill Otto in time
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
It won’t
and the shield is like 30% thicker than whatever we have rn
it's 475D yea, he can't one shot sh*t
<:life:1001518241610485781>
to Rei ofc, he is trying his best, just a little confusing most of the time
<:life:1001518241610485781>
stop being mean pls
what's up
<:life:1001518241610485781>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
lowkey he is actually want to help, he just have trouble with using words
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
but you can get lucky
kinda below the avg
20k + 50 cards is like what ? 32k
around 180k is a safe spot i think ?
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
at least SN is in the extra useful zone
there is no SP that doesn't need 3S except the dead one
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
her non-bike weapon active dmg is so high rn
yea i think CN players all said that
yea as expected from a Chinese character, they knew what theme is best for that character  <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
her sword passive still activate
i think it's a bug with dead JK
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
SoE HoR 0s MA HoV
yea, MA is irrelevant unless you're pretending to be competitive <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
in MA that triple supports team will be as scuffed as possible without starting sp
that only in Abyss anw
or the beta testers are missing sth
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
ngl she looks balanced to me even in her V1
so SSS JK probably come as close as possible to S0 HoH
S0 HoH is about 40 pts higher than SS JK <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
Fire RPC will just be  Ouch, hot hot hot 
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
PE literally cut 100 pts of those f*ckers
without PE
yea most of the time you guys will be struggling with IMG mobs before Otto lol
bruteforcing the shield
nah lol, i actually think you guys will be fine
you will be fine <a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
if you believe you will be fine, you will be fine
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
We will get Physical Otto
It’s because Heim was bugged
He is not that bad if you have Paga
Physical Otto has a thick shield yea
<a:HuTaoPanikPat:869915353436786708>
<:collapsedwoggers:652852676228546611>
JK is not jk around
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
for SS0
her dps is actually huge
it's still 445D
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
Please don’t be Mei, she is not supposed to be the bait valk
The S rank lightning will be the 6.3 valk <:huh:966619839307321394>
I just realised
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
That’s good i guess
At least they’re having fun with her design
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
“ What if we make JK as the opposite of HoH, like she can regen a massive amount of sp just because she want it “  - Devs talk
Never doompost in my life before <a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
What is HoM <:huh:966619839307321394>
Paga M is enough guys <a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
surely it won't be as good as 7TR <a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
you better start it now <a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
healthy relationship, get to know how big the world is to treasure the one next to you more
tbf Kiana also had a lot of dates after Mei left <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
it was used in Reburn 2 along with Star Rail first introduction
this one is probably just prototype
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
she has every traits of Kiana and Mei tho
their final form against Final Herrscher <a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
yea the truth is already written in the stars
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
she is always free
Mei
it's the truth <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
6.2 : SP Susanah 
6.3 : S-Rank Seele 
6.4 : double S-rank Kiana and Mei
wait actually
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
6.3 will be Seele new battlesuit
wow it actually make sense now
HoD Seele is the bait
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
no way they seperate main couple
they release PE and SpA as a couple
6.1 = 5.2 
6.2 = 5.3 
6.3 = 5.4
i mean SW
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
same with last year
6.2 and 6.3 will most likely be 1 bait S-rank and 1 niche SP support
end of next arc
nah i bet it will be CNY
Otto too
yea, HoDom did stay as story boss for a long time right hak ? <a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
i lowkey doubt it will hit tbh, need to actually test it
<a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
so PE has 2, Kiana has 2
bet it will just be 2 new aerial IMG bosses
and the new boss has aerial mechanic, PE won't top score if they keep the same mechanic on Abyss version
it's not that early, 6.4 will be 1 year mark for PE
yea i bet my entire life saving on IMG
IMG Fire Kiana <a:Believer:1018162620102103170>
the bull with aerial mechanic is hinting at it
she is most likely to get new suit instead
im pretty sure she won't
for no reason
randomly start shooting mobs
SW is the worst in this boss if you ask me<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
every single one of them
that is how ice bosses work
nini i hate to break it to you <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
not like it matter, IMG Kiana is coming <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
that's like 50 pts higher at least
780 on 445D
but damn, HoH actually smoke HoF now <:mfw:840549220406263859>
i only have SEA ref <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
bonus pic, everyone favorite setup on RC
6.1 v1 Type Kasumi 445D S0 HoH SS JK 780 pts : 
Maybe they’re just good
Why did they have to do this
Yea skipping JK sound even dumber than skipping HoH <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
Sound good
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Then it look alright
Probably yea
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
100 pulls is the avg for 3* elf ?
kinda creative ngl <:mfw:840549220406263859>
yea it's short for that name
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
and Husk original name in beta was Time Manager
Luo Zhixiang is a famous singer that got busted for cheating his partner, then people meme'd him as Time Manager because his schedules were packed but he still managed to spend time to cheat on his partner
this one is because of CN meme
Husk in CN = 罗志祥 - Luo Zhixiang
boss name is kinda mess up too
so usually if you're looking for Abyss ref the keyword are : 
[ Rank ] + [ Valk name ] + [Abyss Tier ] + [ Weather ] + [ Boss name ] 
       ( Optional )                                               ( Mandatory )
searching on their terms are 10 times harder for no reason cause they like to meme around
CN is like that
then MPE = 爱莉希雅
if the weather is physical content or somewhere MPE score better
but that is also depend on the weather
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
they just move it to HoH
but MPE used to be 爱
MPE = 粉色妖精小姐
HoH = 爱
let me get the word for MPE
HoH = 爱
MPE = MPE
yea cause in CN
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
like their actual battlesuit names ?
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
but temp is 442D
highest S0 record <:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
<:Tericross:1002795340304486471>
it make sense, if you have SS0 HoH you shouldn't be in RL
jfc
no RL ref for SS0
let me look for it
for ice rpc ?
so he has to use S0 JK probably
yea he doesn't have S0 HoH anymore <:mfw:840549220406263859>
No wonder you talk like one
<:life:1001518241610485781>
CN beta is just copy from your main account
Probably his friend account
Aka doesn’t test S0 anymore ?
Wait SS Ely <:huh:966619839307321394>
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
Rank on HoH and JK ? <:holothink:963352118855626753>
That’s broken
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Unless JK is too broken
763 sth for 435 iirc
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
At best she still tie with HoF
I highkey think
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
On Kasumi
What is the highest score Aka got so far nini ?
For mobs before Kasumi

<:huh:966619839307321394>
They actually can put SSS Hepha and SSS Houdou on the same week now
Holy fuck i just realised
The account is a legit one but the dude probably got hacked or he got dragged in using hack
Poor dude
It’s a hacked account
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
Sushang can’t be bait because she will let 6S score higher

You should visit there keilo
Maincord giving me a good read
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>

It’s the maincord special
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Dw i got you tet
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
maincord actually said Sushang might surpass HoH because MPE surpassed HoF
motherf*cker
6.1 look stacked for SEA
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
SEA
during spending too iirc
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
let me ask the dude his budget <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
he is worried about 6.1 instead
yea he has more than enough for 6.0
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
he is still half-new, like just started playing in 5.5
dude is actually panicking rn <:mfw:840549220406263859>
yea i just try to collect opinions to help my cadet <:holothink:963352118855626753>
what do you guys think about this, seriously speaking, low spender context too <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Fist and Sword
she does look like Senti
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Unless she is incapable of dps in any ranks
And SSS Sushang instead
It’s actually a wise move to 4* the elf
Depend on how her kit play out tmr
I will be actually serious here not even doomposting
Moriso said so
SSS in 1 patch <:woggers:652740192653934633>
But what’s with Sushang in 6.2 BP <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Really lowkey <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Really lowkey
Ok but lowkey it’s true for RL
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
And Pogonini still serve niche purpose
Bastet has the same life span with Pogonini is hell
They better be careful with whatever the f*ck they will release tmr
<:mfw:840549220406263859>
My favorite setup Turg Felis is about to be her default in 6.1

<:life:1001518241610485781>
yea i think her ulti hit even less damage than Can's bomb
Krieg score higher than 6S <:HMM:966625453194485760>

I still can’t get used with the score on 2nd boss <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
can Vill-V even 47k ? <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
should have saved since 3.5 <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
tbh i can understand why the game has a lot of bugs, their schedule is actually unhealthy for the devs <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
sort of
only regen like 1-2 ?
it won't regen all 8 HP bars
if you spam pause like 10 pause per second
HoD is bug again i think
gotta admit that
but there are a lot of bugs recently
what kind of fucking feature is that
yea but the dude also replied before that  it's not a bug, RPC is just big so it's a feature 
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
and i got this reply
i posted this in maincord explain about the hitbox bug of Ice RPC
i hate to break it to you keilo but they're actually retard
i hate to break it to you but S0 or S2 HoT can't reach the height we're discussing
<:omegacumjestic:872116629918593074>
no one can score on bosses that Physical is the T1
no Tet, that's the beauty of Honkai
she should also be Top score Tona now
because no one but HoH can score on Hepha MA
she is T2 in Hepha yea
so i just pay attention to the numbers
yea my eyes most of the time can't focus on the screen 100%
cause if i have to watch the icon in AKA i would actually die <:life:1001518241610485781>
watching the damage number usually
i actually don't pay attention to the icons most of the time
big bunny = apply buff 
small bunny = you know it's still up
if you can get past mob and P1 with no errors
yea P2 is actually chill
but there is actually no window for error
can't watch rn so idk what's going on
or else it won't work
yea you need to position Oz exactly in the right
BKE opener ?
the dude pour more effort into meme runs than his main
all these meme runs are either viewer accounts or his alts
oh he actually use viewer's account
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
it's always Otto guy
yea if you want to find sth like this
<:life:1001518241610485781>

It doesn’t matter which S rank you pull

Mihobo really like this setup i see
gotta ask Ashn for that
i think it's ignite Ganesha
HoT 297 in 469D
you can post this in maincord nini
lol it's also Abyss, who even think that HoT can score well without Eden anw
Im Back to work too, break is over <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Need to prepare for the worst
Cause new raid is coming soon
Well at least i will try harder next patch to get back some trophies
At least Lost Ark is still more fun than Honkai rn
<:life:1001518241610485781>
For no reason
My guild keep pressing me to do multiple raids in Sunday
Keep forgetting to do Abyss
Lmao
Im actually lost 800 trophies this patch
<:life:1001518241610485781>
And whenever i ask sth Rino replied with “ With my hand, yes “
The only top player in SEA i ever talk with is Rino
Dw it’s normal to seek for the acknowledge of top players
start of 6.1 <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
or 2.5* elf
50k is only enough on avg for 4/4 S0 + 2* Elf

I actually need to see Ranged Tank and Ranged Assaka on live server
Can’t freeze anything with that meter
In Kasumi you don’t even use Bastet
<:KallenWink:598310046102716417>

<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>

<:holothink:963352118855626753>

I wish they could let me turn off PV QTE
the beauty of Abyss <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
pure rng
and not  i can't wait to get HoT in 6.1 EXPA select 
 Oh bet, 50 pulls for +10 atk and meta dps 
yea she is like
new players will want Eden's gun anw
i think she is not cheaper when you build her from 0 but because it's Handel and you can just pull for it on Eden's supply
English sometime is too hard for me
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
i struggle too when i can't think of words
i take that back, maybe English is not their first language
the answer is already left the wrong impression tho
that's like saying HoT is not as strong as Mobius, she is just more useful
but what's with  not exactly ... but 
i mean the second part is fine
delusional
just do it <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
and whatever the hell on BKE
yea so that week is still HoT on Kosma
highest i can find so far 
SSS BKE S0 HoH 39.456/47.455 : 

SSS BKE SSS MPE 39.773/47.728 : 
I will find some more if there are any once i get home
I don’t think anyone have tried it at all cause we didn’t have a situation where 2 HoT top score bosses appear until 6.0
<@!148145559897636865>
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
I just look through some MA refs and some use HoT on Kosma, HoH on BKE
You can still use lightning affixes on it
I think they also haven’t fixed SSS BKE yet
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
So you can still abuse it in 2 more weeks
It will be fixed in 6.1
Same with lightning RPC
But look like Ice RPC only answer is HoH
I can’t recall if tank was like that
Apparently Ice RPC has another hitbox so the ulti of MPE hit him twice as much
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
I just learnt that MPE can score that high on Ice RPC was due to a bug
only GLB is slow
SEA is already banned <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
that's SS Aponia
Vill-V abuser <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Gresham can't wait to use Vill-V on Kosma i see
cause if Pardo is not the one that freeze Bastet won't trigger sh*t
you know that Bastet is actually completely useless on Kasumi
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
only lose like 20-30 pts behind HoF is reasonable
and for Kasumi it's just because Kasumi has big freeze trauma
her score on tank actually look nut
i actually think she doesn't need better supports, ofc new ice support would boost her performance but im not sure it can be a big boost
you think so ? <:holothink:963352118855626753>
742 on Type Kasumi is lower than HoF iirc
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
it's 163 stacks sth yea
ideally that is
for SSS you want all atk
yea every Ely in CN has like 44 atk in each stig affixes
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
who can get more stacks win the competition
that's the key part for this Kosma
she can get 150+ stacks
472D SSS MPE ( 4* Dudu ) 678 pts : 
477D SSS FR ( 4* Klein + SS AE ) 552 pts :

update Abyss Kosma score
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
I don’t even think SS Mobius makes any diff in dmg
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Just don’t spawn Houdou <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
always has been <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
6 days
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
im on WT + SP
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
we will know by next Thursday
yea probably <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
but i doubt 6.1 only have 1 valk
it depend on how many valks 6.1 have <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
i think all Fu Hua's suits are fun to play
so that she has at least 1 good thing about her
yea she absolutely need to be in ER
probably mech physical
it will be physical
if 6.1 is a dps valk
i have a feeling  <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
the only broken investment in 5.x version were PE and 7TR
but she doesn't excel more than that
she fullfil her worth from 5.2 till now
yea Mobius is just a normal S-rank valk
Morbius ? <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
cause lightning is so fucked without forced QTE
i mean so does other one, but Klein 3* is crucial for Lightning the most <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
hak <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
so for 2* she can be used in every teams
Dudu has TDM in her passive instead of ele dmg/ physical dmg passive
so if you pull for 3* just pull whichever team you like to play
at 3* they're practically the same in term of how important they're in each team
Dudu is the best option
if you decided to stop at 2* yea
but this elf elysia is good at 3*
if you only pull like 1 gacha elf ever then it's always Blade Dudu
6S HB Felis is HoH best team
lucky you nini <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
CN discussion resident <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

cata
and score like 650
maybe some top players will use HoH tmr
give it 1 more day of doubt <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
cause you can't bing chilling with the stack like MA
this is so fucked, except Vill-V i don't think other valks can afford 100+ stacks
Abyss Kosma 469D S0 Nyy + Gaming Mouse HB + AE 441 pts : 
cata fund me SS Vill-V and i will do your your dailies for 1 week ( except Abyss, MA, raid ) <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
LF donation for SS Vill-V <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

i just checked Kosma ref
bad news
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
that's a lot of talking for a Vill-V abuser
<a:diesofcringe:972420698654003210>
Abuser
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
they nerfed it to 200
it was 300 in v1
doesn’t have extreme high dps or actual hitcount
Nyx is just doomed
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Only FR and HoT can probably do it beside Vill-V
Yea and tbh, the actual shill is 200 stacks hitcount check
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Marisa quote it as taking extra dmg when ignited
I don’t remember it as ignite shield
I will see if anyone use her on Kosma
Lowkey HoH can score well on Kosma <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
I don’t  remember any Kosma runs in beta actually bother to ignite
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
around 7k for avg pull ig
16k more <:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>

the pig is back

asterite fund saved

we're in the break from SP release keilo, it's in the past now <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
drain asterite for no reason
like actually suck
i will be honest with you farming augment valk suck
sound like a good time to quit the game <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
can't wait for 5.9 to end <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
i think S0 4* > S2 2*
this elf is actually a 4th valk when paired with HoH
40% TDM
for no reason as alwyas
3* is actually huge
never noticed until now
yea idk neither <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
is it actually cost this much, i never know until now <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
I will find some PE refs <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>

Time to sleep, just finished work <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
<@!148145559897636865>  this is the stack counter
Tet wtf <:life:1001518241610485781>
Nyx : <:life:1001518241610485781>
Abyss Kosma has 200 stacks ball i think
Oh i just remember
Nyx hitcount : <a:modCheck:931874369213435944>
Oh forgot to mentioned, you need to be on-field and deal dmg to the orb so any external sources are just griefing you
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Vill-V is forced to use Raven due to her lead
In MA
Anything is better than Raven
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
That is one way to put it
Elf eat 15 stacks sth
120 but in practice max you can get is 100-105
Yea i think SW can default 90+ stacks
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
But Nyx doesn’t have that luxury dps
The reason why HoH can bruteforce it is due to her high dps for no reason
When drones are around
But apparently Nyx can get 20
Yea but you want Nyx to get at least 60 stacks or sth for 47k idk
And just end up griefing Nyx
So even if HB deplete all 100 stacks she won’t get anything
Yea but only the one on-field get the stack
Yea max strat HoT is about getting her to 100+ stacks
Nyx has like 20 stacks
The stacks give you extra dmg
She can’t deplete the stack herself
Keilo, even Nyx can’t or barely 47k im pretty sure
That’s new <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
But SN will do 0 dps if that happen
Griseo can deplete all 120 stacks in 2 seconds <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

Abyss 3rd will just be Hepha + Kosma
Oh i was talking about next week MA keilo <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
cause it's omega sus now
and it depend on what rank that SW is too
SW should only have Elysia left
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
i think Assaka should be Aponia's boss by now
i bet it will be HoDom or Otto
next week will be Hepha +1 <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
dw keilo, you won't feel bad about rank up if you use C6R5 to clear 5 seconds Abyss in Genshin <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

i don't, i did once, it's smooth but it feel wrong
like using drugs <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
my example sound so wrong but you get the git
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
it's not worth but it's addicting
like when you use drug
it's just addicting
most of the time +1s in MA and like 0-5 pts in Abyss
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
not like husk like you to begin with
yea fairsky is addicting to fps scamming
but pulling for PE sound sus now even tho im pretty sure she won't have any competitors for at least 6 more versions
i think S2 HoT is fine for hak
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
PE and 7TR are probably the 2 best investments during 5.x
literally time stop just by breathing
but HoT can stall the timer enough for Felis to do the job
i mean yea, i think MA Hepha transition phase won't let you burst him down unless you use HoH or sth <:omegacumjestic:872116629918593074>
minus 10s because you're unlucky
SSS Benares will probably fly out of the map
now that i think about it
-Players are complaining abyss is too easy, what do we do boss ? 
-Make the monsters fly out of the map
i'd rather fight with SK than those flying wolves
those flying wolves are the worst tbh, it's not even about RNG, it's about flying out of the map for no reason
<:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
someone can target you and steal your primos if they clear faster than you
what if they introduce stealing system
unless
but honestly i doubt anyone ever do that in Genshin
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
booking is still work for particles
they already fixed it, for the mecha at least
open book, chilling, the boss literally think that 1 hour have passed
it's called booking in genshin
this one only have 3/4 kappa
<:Kapp:816796508405104641>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
can't let nini bait me
yea im f2p now
SS sound like a good stop tbh <:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
the diff is like 30-40 pts
let me check again for sure
she already one shot Kosma P2 with SS
yea SS look like a good stop
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
what is her rank up again i forgot
like actually impossible
these scores are extremly bald tho except for Vill-V
SSS HoT : 47.760
SS2 HoT : 47.744 
SSS Vill-V : 47.728
SS HoT : 47.664
S0 is 47.520
<@385655541248163840>
SS0 HoH 47.632 on SSS Kosma : 

SSS HoH 47.648 on SSS Kosma : 
does SW even win in any neutral match up ?
should be MPE
478 was last cycle
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
for no reason
yea 480
should be 480 already
let me check the current CN temp <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
can't be any higher than 465 <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
yea some didn't look bad, but some look extremely bad and encouraging to spend money
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
in 2022
actually improving backward
lot of changes and the QoL keep decreasing
they also try to suck dry HS too
Blizzard <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
the game first quarter revenue is somehow $100 million too
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
not high end
and your account is still mid end
you can spend 400k in Diablo
but that is because you want to get everything
yea if you don't have time to stock up the amount of whaling can be huge <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
until now
you know that i never even think of something like  Gdi, i should have pulled SS BKE  back then
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
the game only speed up in this specific year
i mean you will be surprised by how low i spend back then keilo
i think around 600k <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
that's for Uma KR, the game is running like sh*t in KR
basically before the max cap for Speed ( the most important stat in the game ) is 1200, but after 1.5 years annivesary, the devs think it's time to be free, so they uncap it to 1600 but the whale calculated that it's actually only 50 pts increased in effectiveness <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
they uncap the stat and now some JP whale calculated that you need 3k per month to stay in T100
Uma Musume just had a big drama about base stats like a week ago
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
in some JP gacha 1 base stat can cost you like 300$
and for JP the standard model is  base stats 
keilo you will be surprised to learn that it's standard model for KR Gacha
she is the only character i refuse to play
i quit because i couldn't stand playing HoV
the HoV era
i started Honkai during the most insane period <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
tbh i still enjoying it even tho i have played for almost 4 years <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Turg is even older and still looking like next ice support sitg will kill Bastet instead
Zhenyi is also 10 patches old now
i mean it's normal lol
<a:NODDERS:931874243069751326>
sound delicious <a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
HoT is too strong <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
mfs saw the ref of HoT on Hepha where the OP had to play like his life depend on it and be like
it's fun tho <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
The rest are on them
I literally only posted the ref for them and add in “ she is a bait “ <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Mission accomplished
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Speaking of maincord, Cn discussion residents have all reached the point where they genuinely think HoH is a bait keilo
nini is poisoning me with whale mindset <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
nini is the type to tell homeless people to buy a house <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
only a whale like nini can speak like that <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
gacha player moment
<:life:1001518241610485781>
yea till this day i still don't know how many stones it took
how many stones to max 3* elf again ? i forgot <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
what if i just want to be free from this game ?
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
i assume SS SW
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
Not a bad score for RL
SW in 2022 <:life:1001518241610485781>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
3*
the ice elf is broken
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
yea i think it's all on the elf
S0 SW 47.504 on SSS Kosma : 
depleting stacks like there is no tmr <:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
as expect of HB
HoH only get like 37 stacks in that ref <:hmm:767936100920328202>
i wouldn't say useless but HoH is the 3rd option for Kosma now <:hmm:767936100920328202>
S0 HoH 47.520 on SSS Kosma ( same with S0 Vill-V ) : 
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
good news
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Cat is just bad fighting Abyss Husk, you want to maximize your damage during his kneeling
S1 DJ <a:modCheck:931874369213435944>
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
they don't even want to discuss about a bait valk
i feel like the people typing right now already settle on  HoH is a bait  nini <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
sure, let me post it real quick <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
Tet you're supposed to let your carry deplete all the stacks for dmg buff
S1 HoH ( 471D ) 694 pts : 

SSS MPE ( 471D ) 674 pts : 
i was asked to find the result of HoH vs MPE on HoDom, i will post it here too for fun <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
hak you're supposed to position HB if you want to use it for P3 Husk <:life:1001518241610485781>
playtime over
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
wait this is the meta channel not the degen one
<:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
 Tero3 ? I hid it out there, search the whole world if you want to find it  - Gol D.Roger
<:life:1001518241610485781>
the OG doesn't have Tero3 but i know it's out there
that's 1/3 of the treasure
it's feature
it's not a bug <:life:1001518241610485781>
yea you can definitely retain in Turkey Nirv with this score
it's the ultimate answer
it's not porn
wdym nini, they're out there, someone that share the dream with me <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
gresham, if you dare to dream then join me to find Tero3 <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
time for RL
good luck hak <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
iirc Aqua also just graduated <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
oh i already followed her 2 years ago
gresham send it <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
the only one can beat her now is Bio Physical
she can't be bad
she is lightning
and the reason is simple
just saying that she is actually good
ofc i won't advice anyone to pull her nini <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
no, i like Aponia's personality <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
her coverage is actually cracked <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Aponia is T1 in Ranged Assaka/Sushang/triple Husks  and T2 in Lightning Wolf
i think Aponia's coverage is also high
she is lightning
tbh i have never thought Aponia as a bait  <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
lightning being too cracked for no reason
can't really blame SW <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
even in hitcount husk SW score is also not exactly high either
mostly because HoT can cheat it
tbh maybe not lmao
but Avo M is generally better
you need to actually find that out
depend on your damage and rot
but yea, you actually just rotate nini <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
oh wait Irene is better my bad, was thinking about HoS dps lmao <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
so Paga TB Avo M is better
you don't need too much ulti for this fight, you can rotate as much as you like
best setup for this is Turg on HB and Paga on FR <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
just use SW - HB - FR
nini i can guarantee you <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
highkey you can promote in Blood
Nyx <:life:1001518241610485781>
everyone and their mom does
just throw all the dices at them <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
1/4 PE is not that much better
consider you can 12/12 ice team
no you probably will benefit a lot with HoH
just straight up PE or die
no other answer
PE's bosses are the most interesting boss <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
she is actually a good choice
her scores in MA is also good, like if you want to settle for a good time and still has -1 score compare to the top
<a:modCheck:931874369213435944>
while SW and SpA
her bosses appear on par with Herrschers
Mihoyo does have a hard-on for Aponia <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
should have pulled Aponia <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
try it <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
yea sound good
all fully geared ?
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
you still need FR
HB <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:heh:990308225314328576>
this Husk will be extremely tanky for no reason if you don't have Apoina
and the intern picked Para
yea there are probably 2 husks to pick for type weather <:holothink:963352118855626753>
they changed it during v3
so it was originally Para  <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Probably just picking wrong boss <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
1 more to go before this game kill itself <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
she is beyond useless now so it's a good warning
DB deserve 1120 AW <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
get em next cycle hak
<:worrySniperAngry:920552131642142741>

The more broken one is coming
Idk what elf is on suppy right now but don’t do it nini
that one is for fun tho <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
this is the only place keilo can find me talking normal <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
finding a thirdwheel <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
fair point <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
you want to burst when Husk kneel down
AE is better here i think <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
With Felis : 

With AE : 
Once i get home <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
but those are minority
some also use Hitcount husk for Type Husk too
Type Husk = 克制罗志祥
Para Husk = 麻痹罗志祥 
Hitcount Husk = 次数盾罗志祥
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
In CN they just call him clock, some will write his full name down for search purpose
I will write it down once i get home
But don’t use SnS tho, HoS SI SA is better <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
You can use HoS dps <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Dumb ping again <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Oh wait im blind, it’s 1280 not 1180
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Hak you need 1500 to promote to RL, you need to +200 this cycle and Husk cycle
these mfs are colorblind
im trapped <:Despairge:957713851103735838>
right now <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
for Bastet, Felis needs to be the one that freeze to trigger the effect
good because you shouldn't use Bastet B in the first place
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
QUA patch is over <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
What mode now <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Only MPE can score close to HoH
For some reason HoT is not doing well against Ice RPC <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
my POV <:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
QUA valks are only needed for promoting this cycle <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
This boss is a contest of 10 pts diff like HoD <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
I already saw some in SEA Myriad
Actually cracked
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
SS SN <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
They are bound to die no matter what valk you using
The mobs are paper so Mobi is normal
lose that many pts is kinda weird
maybe fps issue <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
her finisher will always lost you 1 point
7TR is also the same
the timestop is only until the animation end and not when the damage connected
you get it wrong hak <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
better to use JST + Newt B/ Cez B
doable but you need to ulti every rot <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
the sp battery is Felis herself, not Bastet
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
it's actually also non-existent even if you use JST
that SP problem is a non-existent problem
i will be honest with you <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Ice RPC 469D HoH run :

Abyss Husk is a walking menace <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>

3 more weeks <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
it's hiroshi so this is should be the highest cap for 120 FPS
<@385655541248163840>  theoretical capscore for S0 HoH + 3* elf
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
buy HoV next for 6.0 620 xtals too gresham
alright <a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>

Good news for you gresham, you can clear her side stage this time
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
but so far her scores on Abyss are good enough of a pull
need to wait at least after week 4 for actual feedback
SSS SW score like 47k on MA Hepha
<:huh:966619839307321394>
on Benares i mean
S0 HoH score pretty much the same with SSS SW
nothing much to say atm but so far they're pleased with her performance <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
i have 1 right here
i don't even know what happen but that HoT run look like he is having fun <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
and that HoT run is not your normal run
that's 10 sec higher than HoT <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
i think 680 is S0 HoH capscore
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
hope i don't have to use HoT on Hepha
just finished watching the HoT run on Hepha <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
as dumb as they're, Nirv now is free for all <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
they're actually Nirv retainers now unfortunately  <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

but those jerks probably still think HoH is a bait
they stopped talking about it<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
alright <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
nini, should i post HoH capscore or should i ride this wave and brainwash them again ? <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<@385655541248163840>
i can't find any score higher than 47.5k like Ashn mentioned
i will try to look into HoT
<@385655541248163840>  S0 capscore rn is this
CN has like 10 servers for Honkai <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
let me find if any top players already do it in IOS

<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
not the one photoshopped but another 3S HoH
the OP has to make a video explaining it
it caused a bit attention on bilibili too
for fun nini <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
you can achieve that record even with S0 0/4 Ely too

<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

hak
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
SS1 is 742
3S is 764
sound like a steal
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
S0 HoH 661 pts
S2 HoH 704 pts
let me check the difference between HoH S0 and S2 first

make sure to 3* the next one nini
yea elf is kinda broken <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
you think so <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
the character is basically happy go lucky and punching <:woggeroraora:653797582346256414>
KR's voice sound neat
i kinda fall for her design and voice actor <:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
oh <:hmm:767936100920328202>
oh, neat <:hmm:767936100920328202>
so i have to upgrade her base instead of gacha-ing for her ?
the one above is an awakened right ? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
she looks so cool, im down to play Counter Side waiting for her <:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
<@370438895965306882>  when will SEA or GLB get this character <:Teriwoke:1005467330026934282>
guess we will find out tmr
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
from just replacing Cez T with Tesla T
like suddenly +7 seconds <:huh:966619839307321394>
let me find the clip
yea
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
this time it's like +8 seconds
+1 compare to HoF
last time even fhem can only do 47.760
what make the difference that suddenly SSS MPE score that much better than S0 HoF and even tie wtih SS1 HoT
im still wondering <:EulaThink:846768577839497216>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

By the book 2030 will have 100 hackers in T100
The hackers need 1 month to go to EX
Mihoyo need 1 patch to ban the hackers
Yea, no more consequence for hacking in EX
SEA has never stop being sweaty <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Gresham pulls both
<:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
VV abuser
Gresham you’re one of them what are you talking about
Also in Husk too if you use HoT because HoT take advantage of the mechanic of the fight <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Turg is generally better for FR, Eden, etc…
The shorter your rot is aka the lower the temp
It just depend on your rot

- What do you use in IMG weather ? 
- OK
OG Kiana abbreviation will be OK tho
I mean PE <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
I know for sure that real Kiana beat her, that is still tragic
<:life:1001518241610485781>
But they also released Mobius 4 patches after
She wasn’t exaxtly released to deal with these new QUA bosses
Nyx was released to solve Bloodlust
Tragic valk
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
She smokes Nyx by a far margin when both are S0
Like i think she is broken if you ask me on how does she perform relative to other QUA options
I think Vill-V make QUA’s bosses become much easier than they should be
Im not sure about the part “ she can’t even do that well “
And it’s not even her fault too <:hmm:767936100920328202>
What’s bad about Vill-V ?
<:hmm:767936100920328202>

Let me use Cat and Raven real quick
I would like to have AE upgrade too <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Even HoF can’t save these 2020 supports
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
S0 HoS and 3S MPE + Griseo
Even higher than 3S HoF
I think 9S MPE is the new cap for MA tank
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Oh i remember now keilo, i think for some reason 7S MPE can score 47.840 on tank on the 2nd week
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Can you convert it to 47xxx number
But i don’t know about HoT on tank yet <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
7S MPE is definitely 1-2 sec higher than S0 HoF
I think CN capscore on that week was HoT Aponia Fischl
Did they fix in GLB yet
The Aponia bug
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
With bug abusing ?
Can’t wait to see HoT and Aponia on Husk tho <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

Holding hands for how long ? <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

HoT is legit straight up pray

Guys you are supposed to read the mechanic <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Jfc
And in Nyx case HB breaks them all
<a:Cooking:1009490757943570453>
Each stack give you a damage buff
The stacks from hitting the orb
What a tragic valk
<a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
Just because SW can get double the stacks that Nyx can
I think SS SW should score higher than Nyx in Kosma
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Her P2 is legit 50 stacks
I tried Nyx on Kosma and i legit think i can’t even get 47k
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Not like she is any good in Kosma either
Just morb it <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Kosma or ER ?

The first ever IMG dps is physical
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
Or won’t release at all
And they won’t release IMG ele dps anytime soon
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Like free S rank pick ?
Wdym by the chance
PE doesn’t even have shared damage <:life:1001518241610485781>
Imagine getting outscored by Mobius and PE in your own weather
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
But she got outdamged real quick
Nyx was released to solve Bloodlust tho tbf
Until QUA Seele <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Im down for this QUA shill be over after 6.0
But they zoom in the camera for this Tona for no reason
The visual is good tho <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Cause it have 2 qua mobs waves

S0 Nyx is still doable

S0 HoH probably tie with SSS SW
last cycle SW didn't have Cez B and Ely Elf

then fast hands <:holothink:963352118855626753>
to 1 rot P1
like-wise i think for RL, what matter is just 3* Blade Dudu
don't think it change much cause in the clip he also 1 rot it
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
he just has 5 accounts to do RL contents
that dude is a Nirv top player in SEA anw
this dude probably the max
RL keilo ?

aight carv, i trust you this one
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
as if people play Genshin care about what the fuck is avg investment
and always choose what is considered as  avg investment 
but my problem is that TC tend to have a superiority complex
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
yea it depend on enemy types
TC people nowaday are all fucking delusional <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
until i got burnt out
i used to take TC-ing seriously
stop using chatting guys <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
you bet, instead of bombing google classroom, we should bomb Wendy this time <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
imagine TC-ing perfect combo when Raiden/Hu Tao/Ganyu/Xiao/Itto can do whatever the fuck they want
like in Jenshin, you don't have any reason to improve
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
90% of Hu Tao's reddit don't even know how to do more than 8 N1C
0
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
easy retain
imagine TC-ing in kid game <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
real question tho, will Nahida be a broken character <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
not Hu Tao <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

Elysia or Aponia
next one is a hard one

Eden won <:Despairge:957713851103735838>

<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
There is also a local HS tournament coming soon, i want to focus on it more than dealing with QUA weathers
I will keep slacking until the end of 5.9 <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
now i wonder between Nyx and Vill-V, who score better in Tona <:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
like highkey do
hard to tell but i think so <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
literally just die at this point
<a:diesofcringe:972420698654003210>
before she die
Nyx will be able to score T0 her last boss
if SEA and GLB rise to 465D at Hellmaru
i just realised
for literally no reason too
you bet it is <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
i expect we rise to 465D
yea probbaly <:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
so it's either bracket RNG or SEA also love Couatl
i got a 7th for 454 i think <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
and Kosma too
Tona look like a pain in the ass
whale i think is the easiest one by far
yea it's just cringe <a:diesofcringe:972420698654003210>
i just sick of it from 4.8
like i don't even want to be in Nirv when there is QUA weather midway
tbh QUA weathers in general im really bad at it <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
cause im extremely pissed at bow playstyle
i mean personally i don't use MPE
i get outscored by her so i can't really say she is bad <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
i think she is nuts, especially on QUA weathers, but then again it's physical in general  <:worrythumbsup:759845056743473204>
even when they're naked
it's a +200
PE + HoS + Griseo
tbh, does it even matter at AG3
i actually don't even know how much does MPE below SS can score <:Despairge:957713851103735838>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
but it's actually just HoS and Griseo being too strong
like we're talking about how SSS MPE can come close or surpass some Herrscher records
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
good luck
competing directly with physical
backpulling for PE now sound terrible too but on the other hand i don't think any IMG dps will coming out soon
no sweat, AE adv coming in 6.1 <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
more damage for PE
her important rank up are S3 and SS3 tbh
you won't use her anymore cause 6.1 is Mech Physical Sushang <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
am i missing anyone ?
what is even the answer for new Hepha again ? Ely, 6S, Felis, HoR <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
and Hepha has like 3
i mean Couatl has like 50 answers tbh
no need to think
pull or die moment
i hope they put Hepha as 6.0 first boss <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
you mean sniping time ? <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
nothing can escape my sight <:worrySniperAngry:920552131642142741>
yea Sunday is hunting day <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
it's not confusing anymore if you stop using normal human week
abyss week start on friday
not normal week nini
it's Abyss weeks
Otto is on monday
first boss will probably be sth ice related
no, we getting Otto before Ely release <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
jk aside nice roll gresham <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>

any remarkable quotes you can send here ? <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
yea, superiority complex + high temper <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
reading it back this dude is actually funny <:ICANT:921403877285306399>
you can 4/4 her
Vill-V coming to BP after 20 patches
save it <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
the Neon one is too broken
and not the outfit itself
yea i think Felis summer get carried by all the accessories
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
they're tied
Felis is not that impressive to me cause the Neon skin is also broken
Eden is actually the best so far ngl
i might sound like a lolicon if i say what i like about it <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
let me find the shop picture
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
3000 token, how much stuffs can we buy with those
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
no asterite pack nini ?
Mihoyo can't fool me, i know they're hiding real Herrscher in 6.1
jebaited <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
but it might change with real temp
like with low D you would be trolling if you sit on HoH to do 2 charges
it's a nerf  yea but it's based on 435D performance
i actually don't need to do anything
also the doomposting after V3D is hillarious lmao
then why does Wendy die <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
i mean in general if we're talking about RL as a standard then QUA and IMG valks are the best spending, no ?
and RL retainers sound more like Nirv retainers than me and nini
in maincord me and nini actually sound like a troll
the dude type like Nirv retainer most of the time
if anything it's Elysia's number 1 fan fault
lol no it's actually not my fault
RNG festival
jfc
ice bosses malding is the boss themselves
i doubt Cez B require malding tho
no one will ever run bastet B with Ely except for MA and Hepha
also if even CN don't run Bastet B
yea <:life:1001518241610485781>
not the stig
cause the sp battery is Felis herself
and no one run Bastet B
i mean we said that about Ely
Turg is still too good compare to how old it is
<:life:1001518241610485781>
the thing about ice is that, unless they made the new stig sth like  Can't be stack with hunter mark  then 80% of the time it will kill Bastet
<:life:1001518241610485781>
especially Ice and Lightning supports
if they're not careful they will kill newly stuffs instead
tbh right now the support line up is totally fine, except for fire  <:life:1001518241610485781>
her SSS is just straight up broken
yea even her SS is already omega value
jeez nini
getting baited by 6.0 again
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:DurandalGooseL:706773806756397067> <a:DurandalGooseR:706773827224469594>
nothing new
but the other 2 is also this way so
this boss is actually PE or fucked
<:life:1001518241610485781>
this valkyrie is almost 2 years old and still as broken as yesterday
after first rot you will start with 90 sp instead of like 50-60
oh i mean SSS HoS is important for your 2nd rot on P1 tho
too broken
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
tbh i think the key is just SSS HoS
starting sp in this boss is broken
lmao
and SSS HoS = +50 pts in this boss
cause high rank PE also mean faster p1
i mean you're fucked either way tho
yea it's either 1 shot the core or you are fucked
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
yea you need holmes strat to reach 4 mil
ah you don't use Holmes strat ? <:life:1001518241610485781>
it's 459 here
is NA Nirv higher than SEA ?
i mean nirv
oh you can't one shot the core in NA ?
and you can't one shot the core
if you misposition her she will ulti right into the spot that the last seed was spawn
i mean blade dudu
position Dudu because she is dumb
hit the seeds for fun to gather sp
basically nothing lmao
<@148145559897636865>  <@370438895965306882>  who did you guys choose between Kalpas and Felis
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
her dmg is still too high for RL current temp
the change probably only noticeable in Nirv temp
nvm probably just dumb changes
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
i think HoH ulti change is foreshadowing sth
and then fuck this event
i need 2 big win
Kalpas it is then
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Kalpas or Felis, i need help to win big time
Who is more broken
I need the council to help me with Kalpas vs Felis
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
First win
Finally
Somebody pleae tell me Aponia won
<:life:1001518241610485781>
I need to recover from 7 losses
Your stats is broken
Aponia you need to win
Please for the love of god
You can’t even guarantee to get 7000 tickets
Mf
This event is terribly designed
How is this even possible
<:life:1001518241610485781>
That can’t be good <:huh:966619839307321394>
that's not bad
3 wins out of 12
this event is terrible
and i haven't even reached 3k tickets milestone
there are 7 matches left
this game is rigged
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
cause i know keilo chose Ely
i picked Vill-V this time
aight
can i even get 7k tickets before this event end
this event is terrible
<:life:1001518241610485781>
mf
SAKURA lose all matches
I keep betting wrong
How is this even possible
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Kalpas won <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
i just need Sakura to win both and i can recover from all these losses
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
Sakura always win against Kalpas
her skills are broken
SAKURA won't let me down
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
yea on theory, no way you can keep losing 50/50 <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
unless this event run for another 2 weeks, i can't even get 12000
after 4 days i manage to gather 2700
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
and 12.000 tickets for all the coins
you need 7200 tickets for all important rewards
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
thanks me later if you manage to recover
aight, i will vote for Sakura this time keilo <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
cause i ran out of them
the game just gave me 10 tickets
oh sh*t
keep betting wrong
i think i have a talent for this
i all in on Eden
aight
victim blaming <:life:1001518241610485781>
<:worrySniperAngry:920552131642142741>
kei  nothing escape my sight  lo
that dream is a little too detail
3 more days til HoH go live <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
so do you keilo <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
a wonderful scenario
imagine Type wolf with 480D
CN now is also 472 iirc
probably due to Nirv bracket expansion
just like in CN
temp is going up for no reason <:omegacumjestic:872116629918593074>
is counterside fun <:pepe2:368744338445828106>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
so 3pc Bastet to extend freeze duration is better
<@516591030326525983> oh btw, i just remember, Abyss Hepha is Freeze not Ice
cause now it only take them 1 months or 2 to get to EX
all the hackers decided that  fuck it, time for EX 
i hate that after exp buff
playable soon
but i like her vfx during boss fight
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
she is tanky even with S0 Aponia
next boss is FGO so it's free +100 if you're in RL <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
like for some reason it usually take them 1 whole patch for it
wonder what took them so long to ban a hacker
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Even hackers are compete against each other
But our hacker score 970!
Oh SEA has hacker too
It will have ignite alright
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
With her upcoming DK
That mean G4 Fire might also revive DA
I don’t really mind Handel being better than Benares
<:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
How free are we talking about
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
Both whale and Kosma are designed specifically for Vill-V rot
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
Kosma on Abyss look awful
where SS HoT ? <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
yea maybe, they did drop Sushang in 2nd week <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Hepha is the best boss to force pull
lol i expect them drop Hepha immediately on first cycle
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
probably can, Cat's buffs are different from Fischl
wonder if HoF and HoT can score on 800+ range too
interesting, just saw this in maincord <:HMM:966625453194485760>
CN discussion already stopped talking about HoH  <:life:1001518241610485781>
when HoT is already get her 2nd chance
using a support valk that is even older than HoT is not how it should work in 2022
i wish they could take care of fire a bit more
enough to retain on Nirv during Parvati cause no one had  DA <a:modCheck:931874369213435944>
before 5.5 HoF coverage was actually the same as HoH now, took over Rimestar
they just stop releasing fire bosses in general after PE, SpA just live on the edge cause she is mech <:Despairge:957713851103735838>
you can't blame them, im just too good at brainwashing <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
okay but why does this mf still breathing <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
my hard work is just paying off
here gresham, i didn't even mention anything about HoH being bad in the last hour <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
hard work paying off
it's spreading
i don't even need to say anything anymore
oh, not me, velvet just start demanding she should take all neutral mech <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
i don't even need to type HoH is bait anymore
see my effort paying off in cn discuss ?
lol, nini <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>

SS, don't ask why  <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Nyx
i just said f*ck it, get 450+ and sleep
i didn't even use AE <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
but you are <:echcry:963512825215598673>
just settle for mediorce
dw nini the cut off will be low anw <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
finally SEA and GLB can start to use CN ref <:life:1001518241610485781>
at this rate we might reach CN temp on 6.0 <:holothink:963352118855626753>

mf <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
lose 5 times
i just unlocked new achievement
i all in on Hua
jfc <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Hua vs Mobius
who won
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
her theme, voice and gameplay
yea it doesn't really hurt my performance without SS Aponia but i just like her in general
i enjoy using Aponia these days
i should have went for SS Aponia ngl <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
same with Aponia
she is actually fun when you use her
ikr <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
but if even 472D doesn't need Bastet B then no one need Bastet B
i guess we still need to wait for CN live performance
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
mfs keep saying sp issue but all her runs use Cez B so i find it hard to take anyone seriously
yea i expected it that much
which mode ? <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
On avg who does the most dmg ? Felis or Ely
<:nerdge:980201016853164144>
yea even S0 HoH already look stronger than SS SW <:life:1001518241610485781>
uhh, i can't wait for 10 SS and 9 SSS HoH in my brackets during 6.0 <a:diesofcringe:972420698654003210>
like 80% of the time if you put effort in
i do think now it's possible to retain with S0 consistently <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
or just ping people in general and keep staying mad
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
then you keep pinging people for their objective opinion
and some superiority complex too
first you need to be mad
it's kinda easy to be a nirv player in maincord
yea the problem with maincord is that they have already spread misinfo <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
it's survival of the fittest, you must put effort in <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
it's hard work tho <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
watch my 2 weeks effort
this is me keilo
but ofc i won't get baited <a:Chatting:1008014388508237878>
HoH looking strong<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
highkey if you're in AG2 and below you can use pri FF
yea im not sure about SW team but if you're not Nyx pri FF always better than CB19 <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
V3.5, same player : 
V1 HoH's records
- RPC : 855 
- Hellmaru : 850
- Benares : 833
- Hepha : 817


V2 HoH's records
- RPC : 836
- Hellmaru : 854 
- Benares : 794 
- Hepha : 819
so she was like a walking time stop button
she also have TF when she enter burst mode and exit too <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
before you can stack a lot of tf on each other with how easy it is to trigger her QTE
but they compensate it on her ulti passive
yea it's a nerf to MA viability
i mean she still look good, having sp issue doesn't really mean she can't do damage outside of it <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
it was up as soon as possible
12 hours ago
what happened
btw i thought Velvet is Ely's number 1 fan <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
can't blame them
probably new player
yea but probably in a crisis due to seeing my messages <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
kinda my fault
i will try helping him
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
hard worker <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
If you search my messages in CN discussion that have HoH, 75% of it will also have bait and mid
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
My 2 weeks effort
Not just memeing anymore
Yea but it’s spreading for real this time
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
Now they will soon think HoH is bait
Nini i fully brainwashed cn discussion
nini, stop torturing yourself in cn disccusion<a:Chatting:1002924600012832899>
that's not bad
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
it's 3010
they definitely not help anything
green role is helper <:WorryPat:954328661270618122>
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
jfc
<:life:1001518241610485781>
I literally have to use everything to keep my temper down whenever this mf spread misinfo
This mf has a superiority complex while being dumb is beyond me
<:life:1001518241610485781>
No matter the topic
Everytime this mf type anything my braincells just disappear
jfc, this conversation has a lot of participants for no reason <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Imy is probably having fun <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
showing statistics and charts when i think they stated ingame about 10 pulls pity
but Imy is actually wasting their time with that random dude
<:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
okay but why does Imy just not show that dude the 10 pulls guarantee
that's interesting
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
what is the context of this
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
Assuming BP + Monthly Pass + Buy out Weekly and Monthly Foca Cards
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Can you even compete in AG3 with a 30 days account ?
But it’s up to 3 weapons if im not wrong <:holothink:963352118855626753>
i played it for 30 minutes, i almost die from boredom  <:Despairge:957713851103735838>
btw have you guys tried ToF ? <:hmm:767936100920328202>
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
if you pull enough amount you can't be unlucky
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
yea but i like her normal clothes more, just personal taste <:hmm:767936100920328202>
im actually not a fan of her Herrscher's design, what i like is her shining personality <:hmm:767936100920328202>
i already double down on 6.1 S-rank Raven + Fire SP Jackal
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
lmao
when i realised 4.9 wasn't about Seele
back then i bought full shop every patch from 4.8 to 5.0
you can save a little by buying all the cards package until 6.0
sound about right
full package until SSS ?
what is this for
<:life:1001518241610485781>
Just double down on 6.1 Raven + Fire SP Jackal
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
In Beginner help you don’t even know if your question was answered or you just get blamed for pulling anything that is not HoS
Honkai help is slow so everyone have more time to explain for the newbie
Beginner help is a sh*t show most of the time <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i don't think people pull on it enough to math out soft pity
but i guess they realised it's not gonna work <:hmm:767936100920328202>
it would be huge upgrade
if they keep the pattern small spending = elf frags
i mean yea that's the problem
and even 6 foca cards are a scam with how pricey they're <:hmm:767936100920328202>
now they replace it with 6 foca cards
i mean it's better than nothing tbh <:hmm:767936100920328202>
having none is even more fucked tho
it's fucked but it can be useful <:hmm:767936100920328202>
i guess
kinda pog
but 6.0 spending will have 6 focused cards
i mean 5.7 spending did have 50 elf frags
keep getting greedy as time go
jfc
next spending also don't have elf frags<:hmm:767936100920328202>
with how strong those elfs are nowaday, you can just pick 2 out of 4, 4* them and you're in a good spot
and they're good to go
yea i think the future spending prior for S0 Nirv retainer is just : S0 4/4 + 3* elf <:hmm:767936100920328202>
<:omegacumjestic:872116629918593074>
and still may not retain on all weathers due to how shill work
it is how it is <:hmm:767936100920328202>
to reach 2k for 3S
you will need an unbelievable amount of bad luck
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
it's 2k for full package usually
but that is because of R5
if we account in R5 then Genshin is another problem <:hmm:767936100920328202>
even the gap between SS and SSS is alreaady huge enough for a whale
f*cking hell
SSS in Honkai is like
Genshin become so generous
once you have spent all the way in Honkai
<:life:1001518241610485781>
throw them in the teapot with lv 1
the rest characters after 1.3 that i pulled, i only pull them for fun
i think my account still only have 8 level 90 characters <:Despairge:957713851103735838>
and quit again
i will only log in to pull Nahida
even with Sumeru coming out
yea i already lost the flame to play it, kinda suck
i saw Klee's trailer back then and i was overwhelmed <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
having to coop with 3 idiots for event rewards
and here we are
one hell of a game
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
new players download Genshin and get to explore all 8 regions
imagine 5 years from now
the amount of contents are also good
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
but it can't satisfy me
i think Genshin is good as a normal game
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
if it end up like Genshin im out in the first 15 minutes
if the game can satisfy my competitive blood
will give it a try tho  <:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
that's the neat part, im always f*cking with everyone <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
not even download it yet
i don't even know what that game is like tbh
<:life:1001518241610485781>
ok but LF > +14 for ToF raid <:life:1001518241610485781>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
and senpripripri
<:life:1001518241610485781>
Pri stig or lv 90 weapon
so they have to upgrade old valks power output first
they also need to make sure you have more damage first for new bracket
<:life:1001518241610485781>
and i mean fucking Wolf
with how the current temp go
rn some bosses are lowkey impossible to mald
but i don't expect them release new bracket soon <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
<a:Chatting:1002924600012832899>
and fps
<:omegacumjestic:872116629918593074>
not S0 BKE ofc
<:HoVCookie:599331162690813966>
even in SEA
yea i think so too
imagine if Genshin can share 30% of its playerbase to Honkai and all of them actually try hard to promote in RL
yea that's the problem with RL <:TeriThink:928714644040871996>
the para combo
it was Shake T Fuxi M Newt B iirc
but RL most of them don't even try
cause if RL players actually try hard then i think F2P gears will show where it lack
it's actually kinda hard for this problem to come down to 1 conclusion <:TeriThink:928714644040871996>
high chance that 10 of them already lack skill
even if you face 19 players with 12/12 team
i guess the thing about RL is that
but for RL i guess Aponia is also kinda flexible <:TeriThink:928714644040871996>
i was thinking of Nirv standard, i don't think F2P HoF can even kill P1 tank
but when you put it in action in their Abyss, the gap just keep getting wider
numbers on paper can look decent
yea i can't think of any valks after DA had flexible gears anymore
<:TeriThink:928714644040871996>
turn to PE's playground
from how HoD was a  one for all  boss
kinda desperate
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
but budget PE is still probably better than other options
yea it's -100 <:omegacumjestic:872116629918593074>
 Abyss coverage  what the hell is that lmao <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
yea if we go by abyss design then it's from DA that they think  Having 1 answer only for each boss  is a good idea
Ele is not gonna compete with Physical in their field anw
i just mean physical
more breach
breach <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
imagine HoH is the last dps of this gen <:hmm:767936100920328202>
i mean design wise, after DA they did have a change of heart with how they want to make new valks from there tho
abyss wise it's true, she did dominate for a while but the problem is that after HoS she was one of the old gen<:hmm:767936100920328202>
or kill her in the name of love <:hmm:767936100920328202>
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
just think about it
don't take it literally
<:huh:966619839307321394>
guys im just asking an example
<:huh:966619839307321394>
if you have a   date  with Senti in Hua's body is it legal or nah ? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
i have a better question
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
what is worse ? Dating a 12 years old looking girl but she is actually 50.012 or dating a 20 years old looking girl but she is actually 12 ?
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
didn't really have many choices
Mobius did it to save her
yea she was dying
that's why Hua is flat for the rest of her life
yea MANTIS can't grow up
her surgery was later on
9 was when she first met everyone in MOTHs
<:huh:966619839307321394>
her real body is 50.012 years old
<:huh:966619839307321394>
even if they do she is 50.012 years old
they won't know who Griseo is <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
im an introvert at heart
i really can't speak or yell with strangers <a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
i never use voice comm either
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
my cousin play her first League game and was told to go kill her self
people are mean in every games
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
but i can't even do the 1st combo
fighting game pro scenes are so much hype yea
CSGO, Valo, PUBG, stuff like that
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i only like to watch FPS esports
clearly a normal human being
im also teaching children basketball in my free time <:hmm:767936100920328202>
<:omegacumjestic:872116629918593074>
i still remember i was there when Miracle do the lifting in game 5
Liquid is NA <:HMM:966625453194485760>
wait what's wrong with naming sport with ball at the end <:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
but Eden is not the type i want to date tbh, i want to have a date with Aponia among all FCs <:HMM:966625453194485760>

im only into adult wdym

like did her parent ask for her to get bullied or sth
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
who name their kid  Timido Cute 
lol i hate Timido mostly because of her name
i like her side personalities <:Binoculars:943798474699309116>  <:HatsuneBoobs:738307244269109358>

i pull Aponia because i like her personalities <a:KokkoroDance:824886410028515328>
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
 Why does Mihoyo keep buffing Aponia, what a shill !!!  
-> Scores keep getting lower
cause their dmg contribution are already a lot
independent buff on Fischl and Eden is actually huge
yea it's a nerf
maybe it's not Aponia top scoring but they want to use SSS HoT on Kasumi instead <a:PeepoSHAKE:931874355267371049>
yea it's Vill-V on Kosma
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
so they want to use HoT on Kasumi
maybe because of Kasumi too
this is current rank 1 for last week MA <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:omegacumjestic:872116629918593074>
50 Aponia
it is on CN topscore atm
S0 Aponia  > S0 Mobius until SSS
yea and Aponia beat Mobius on all ranks for MA wolf
<:omegacumjestic:872116629918593074>
current top score on MA wolf is also Aponia
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
i remember Meme also has crit passive
early design is wack yes
it's not Aponia's fault if the boss can be cheated by HoT <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
HoT can cheat score with it due to its mechanic
the problem is Husk
imo Aponia is perfectly fine
<:life:1001518241610485781>
i mean 150 pulls Vill-V
not S0
truth be told i still think Vill-V is a good pull <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
where is your SSS MPE <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Couatl
SEA is catching up to CN <:mhcatblind:998941267041996862>
Kinda gaming
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
She only swiped for all of it
She didn’t, she hired others to farm for her
I think my Guild Master in Blade and Soul used to have like 24 accounts <:omegacumjestic:872116629918593074>
CN players tend to play with a lot of alts
a lot of CN players play like that tbh <:omegacumjestic:872116629918593074>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
wording is a bit confusing, english is too hard
yea <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
they gave you 3 of it to max out 1 valk
the event affixes that they gave you
and simp for each of them on different account
dude just play 5 accounts
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
i know a guy that have 5 accounts with 23 * 6 affixes on HoF/MPE/HoT/Mobius/Nyx respectively
actually they just have 10 different accounts to use all 3 23 atk affixes on 1 valk
tbh i recognised a lot of mechanically  good players in maincord but their takes are also 0 IQ takes <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
This elf value will be so high if Mihoyo still remember their Herrscher is ice after 6.0
<:hmm:767936100920328202> she loooks amazing at 3*
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
That is busted with 3 Bastet
I didn’t know elf ely now give  20% freeze duration
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
Yea
And turg cat
So it will be Turg cat + Bastet M
-15 pts
Or else you have to do the stupid weapon active
You need Bastet M
Lol the problem is that you actually can’t use Handel cat for Hepha
Not me, i will use my SS 6S <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>

2023 Honkai, new player breaking through to EX after 3 days of playing and search keeby's guide then proceed to ask :  What is this SS MA bosses he talk about ? Is it some sort of ancient mode ? 
i don't think those 2 will contribute anything to your current account, maybe save up enough for HoH's weapon ? <:hmm:767936100920328202>
so your future battlesuits have more affix mats to waste on
i think it will pay off after you SSS all of them <:hmm:767936100920328202>
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
for 1.5 years at least
but that also mean you have to give up affix mats
it will take like a year and half after you start using witch orbs on them too <:hmm:767936100920328202>

i forgot to do boss stage <:life:1001518241610485781>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
So Hepha and Hellmaru score go up, Benares and RPC score go down in v2
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
SK with 470D
It’s a nightmare
I don’t really care about temp going up but for some bosses with heavy shield
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
Hope Mihoyo adjust the codes
Also apparently the temp in CN keep going up since bracket change
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
As long as you have hands you’re forced to join Nirv
Even as much as a joke CN discussion is
By next week they will be in Nirv anw
I will give them a new player’s pass
Maybe they’re just confusing
Nvm the dude is talking like a new player
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
Maybe because he f*cking immune to ice and dash like crazy
Some useless discussion into why don’t you use Felis on Wolf
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
How can you even type in there nini
CN discussion is making my eyes bleed so hard
Looking gaming <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
and probably some JP whales too who can't handle no 10 pulls pity
<:HoVCookie:599331162690813966>
cause TW and HK also play on SEA too, some of them
yea a lot
SEA just sweat to death
i don't doubt EU players, i only doubt the playerbase
f*cking ungrateful
it's 1 AM in my cadet timezone, he just yelled at me
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
can't log in rn but let me ask my cadet for SEA myriad
S0 PE can T50 myriad
yea their Nirv is the lowest
whenever i saw someone type dumbshit, it's EU
all 0 IQ takes coming from EU players most of the time
something must be wrong in EU
istg these EU players
after 5.5 new valk only get 3 bosses on their patch and 1 boss per patch
like it was actually normal before 5.5 CNY patch
paper
temp was like 380 back then
you can also retain back then with HoF on ranged tank too
DA
she was used in Type DXY
DA only top Parvati back then
<a:diesofcringe:972420698654003210>
just like Parvati
never show up again
specifically design for Carole
it's the shield mob stage
5.3 Abyss 
 HoF was barely used 
i have to beat this fucker up before i go to bed
this fucker
<a:PeepoSHAKE:931874355267371049>
should also tie with HoF on Kasumi and SSS MPE on Ranged Tank too
she has 4, that's plenty
wtf do you mean more bosses <:worrySniperAngry:920552131642142741>
even <:worrySniperAngry:920552131642142741>  RPC p1 too
HoH now can <:worrySniperAngry:920552131642142741>  them
yea for those mob stages
same person so easier to compare her v1 and v2 <a:seelenoted:963697302151757826>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
But lately Mihoyo with their shill make it hard to judge a value of new valk anw
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
Do well and top score are diferent things tet, if we judge a value of valk on doing well then S-rank valks are all overrated
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
After that…yea
But that only specifically true during 5.5
I guess in a sense SpA is a good value valk cause she was so cheap
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
CN discussion is just delusional with their cheap SpA pulls while Carole and Mobius can also do the exact same things
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
+ refund supply and SP gears ofc
Yea i have always tell my cadets that it’s best to only pull Herrscher and CNY valks
SpA is living with the “ I am also mech type “ niche
AKA doesn’t even show up anymore in Abyss
And only 1 per parch since then
PE bosses show up 3 times in 5.5
Hell i even doubt the 6 months part
But yea i agree with 6 months life span
As long as they keep the pattern 1 boss every patch
So i don’t see her out anytime soon tbh, like HoF
So what Mihoyo is doing rn is just 1 boss per patch for every valks
Bloodlust is coming back in 5.9 again
<:hmm:767936100920328202>
At S0 i mean
So from 4 weathers to 3
Also even without the bug she will only lose type Andrius
She still has bloodlust
No, bosses
Share dmg + mech
What i mean is just that her bosses are exclusive top score to her mechanic and type
Cause they will need to release an exact copy of her, she is not that struggling in Abyss anymore with CF
bug abuser <:keqewide:849348200011661412>
the bug
just abuse it
keilo, if you're depressing enough <:Despairge:957713851103735838>
<:worrySniperAngry:920552131642142741>
Maybe because the rot is not fully optimized but we will see
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
I looked it up on bili and HoH’s run on Type Kasumi with HB is actually not better than the run with AE
spicy news in <#973924771727290399>
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
actual disrespect on Himeko
some mfs still want Himeko coming back
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
it's like Himeko coming back after all her talks in chapter 25
cause it's her dead that make everything possible for currrent main story
that's cope
<:HoVCookie:599331162690813966>
like lore-wise we know we will meet Kevin's old comrades at 1 point
the idea of ER has been hinted like 50.000 times everytime Kevin show up tho
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
she is not the Kiana i love
i actually dislike HoV lmao
i think my favorite ranking is : HoF > HoT = HoS > HoR > HoV
for others it can also be HoS
but for me it's HoF
some people i know still think HoT debut was the coolest
i think at this point it just depend on favorite characters
cause you know
but my opinion is biased
i did hype for HoF more <:deadge:975652771082698782>
436
<a:aworryKnife:468792461649641495>
they better not release a so-so Herrscher
Mihoyo won't let me down
but im still looking forward to her v3
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
but yea it feel sucks when you're one of the people that can fullset it without any problems
design wise i think it's good when they can keep doing that for others to be able to compete without full set <:hmm:767936100920328202>
im getting closer to SSS DA for free
<:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
she would still be strong but rely on her gears
they can nerf her dmg by a bit and make that she can use ulti every rots
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
imagine with Felis in team and still have sp problem
better result
just split it to full rot + small rot and use Cez B
that's why people gave up on Bastet B
right now even with Bastet B she won't have enough sp by the 3rd ulti
no joke
yea i actually think she needs some buff on her sp regen
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
i expect ranged tank is also the same
as expected
but looking like a tie with Type Kasumi between HoF and HoH
just dm them and ask for a fight irl
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
you want Paga M on someone
i just realised how awkward ice team is on Type Kasumi lmao
some Nirv run in CN just slap it on her with IMG affixes
yea BiankaT is SP best stig now
<a:diesofcringe:972420698654003210>
<a:diesofcringe:972420698654003210>
cause i barely play
didn't even gain any trophies this patch
i think so far all my trophies are tie
i don't even have any motivation for this patch and next patch ngl
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
i almost got demoted back then in 5.5 by SS SpA
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
shouldn't SS SpA an easy promote in RL ?
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
her s2 help
let me check it
<:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
but their rankup are basically the same, HoF and HoH that is
it's extremely hard to tell with rank up
it's a tie
<a:PeepoSHAKE:931874355267371049>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Physical now has Griseo
Probably tie on that one
it's just a meme <:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
using Fischl with HoH sound kinda sus but 46k should be easy
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
hacker why are you speaking in riddle <:huh:966619839307321394>
<:worrySniperAngry:920552131642142741>
or RPC
abyss HoD
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
my dude scored 990
SEA had one during HoD i think
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
Me when trying to explain anything to maincord <:Despairge:957713851103735838>
im down for last 2 weeks have Lightning RPC and Type Kasumi <:worrySniperAngry:920552131642142741>
really lowkey
FGO - Fire Tank - Type Husk
lowkey 5.9 is not even that bad
<a:diesofcringe:972420698654003210>
so it become more cringe to deal with it
but their experience only stop at RL
they always talk about valk performance with Nirv ref in their mind
the hardest about talking with them i think is that
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
that you saw above
and i got  just use wall 
i did explain all the pros and cons for them
oh i just simplify it for the meme <:Despairge:957713851103735838>
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
people only see the result of ref but not the effort putting into it
<:Despairge:957713851103735838>
Me : Felis Turg is not even that good compare to MA becasue it require 30x more effort 
CN discussion : you're wrong
why do they keep pretending to be in Nirvana
what's wrong with people in maincord <:Despairge:957713851103735838>
<a:modCheck:931874369213435944>

<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
No more thinking needed
Best way to play gacha
-Fire RPC ( can only be damaged by HoF )
Im down for them to step up their design
This require too much thinking
<:EulaThink:846768577839497216>
Some sort like that
Blood weather : can’t use Mobius
She will be good if we have ban system in Abyss
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
A good sidestage sweeper
She is a good valk for new players
Joking aside i think if she ever come to BP
Good valk
Already on life support i see
<a:PeepoSHAKE:931874355267371049>
Does Nyx still have any boss ?
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
If you can’t beat them ingame just ask them a for a fight irl
What’s wrong, next boss is easy score Gresham <:HMM:966625453194485760>
Yea there are only : Ice RPC, Freeze Hepha, FGO, Sushang, Hellmaru, Benares, 2 lightning husk, QUA Kosma on beta iirc
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
although Nyx is trash but at least give her a proper death
she score higher than SSS Nyx
that damage will surely be nerfed
<:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
<:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
<:worrySniperAngry:920552131642142741> <:worryMantaRay:945494671042412586>
Ely gameplay be like
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
But is it me or her finisher feel like a whole year passing by
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
No Bastet M = demoted to Agony
Just Bastet M + Felis ulti
Freeze Trauma
Press Felis ulti and Ely just go <:worryMantaRay:945494671042412586>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
This one is another +1 for Nirv temp
Wonder when will we get our 5th HoDom
Embedded failed <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
Biri just get burnt by imy
<:NotLikeGanyu:803812299436982332>
Everyone are talking about math
Even maincord are talking about probability now
just get good
secret to success
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
Yea <:keqsip:994857348436865124>
<:NuwaVomit:586318295297294339>
Next time can you convert it to nuggets currency
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
HoF figure will only be here by December tho <a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
But HoF come first, ramen come 2nd
A whole year of ramen
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Like 800 ramen bowls with extra topping
30 frags not ramen bowls <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
<:keqsip:994857348436865124>
30
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Wonder how many ramen bowl i could have ate with 2k
<a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
2k is like 300 chipotle’s bowl
3S in Honkai is so expensive
Look right yea
HoF is non awaken so the avg should be lower <:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
Is that awakened valk ?
<a:diesofcringe:972420698654003210>
but lightning valk score high on QUA weather
<a:diesofcringe:972420698654003210>
SS Eden in 5.8 ?
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
old Himeko suits need 10 years to do 1 AA
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
6S dps is so low
actually im not sure about -5k <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
MA Hepha
<:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
iirc 9S HoT score less than 9S Aponia around 30 pts <:hmm:767936100920328202>
does she not ? <:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
So everyone can use 6S
<:PaimonHmmm_Soreko:817090583431872612>
But this Herrscher bias is way over the top
They’re trying to bring back Herrscher bias
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
So they probably also want Ely to takeover hellmaru
There is hellmaru abyss in beta
Btw
gresham, check out the cool stuff in <#973924771727290399> <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
players can choose to use whatever the hell they like
6.1 Fire SP so we have 3 mech killers
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
this is actually sad
<a:KokkoroDance:824886410028515328>
6.0 Abyss prediction :
Ice RPC - Lightning RPC
Freeze Hepha - lightning BKE 
Fire tank - Ice Benares
Ranged tank - Fire heimdall 
Type Kasumi - Ice hellmaru
this is supposed to be Herrscher season
this is so sad, like actually sad
<:huh:966619839307321394>
she has ele breach and bonus tdm against mech
temp go to the moon
soon we will have 10 HoDom in Abyss
6.1 Fire RPC with Fire SP
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
yea i posted the link in <#973924771727290399>
new boss in Abyss
<@148145559897636865>  <@385655541248163840>  <@370438895965306882>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Ice RPC
Freeze Heph
QUA Kosma
DJ is kinda gaming on clock btw <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
this dude is funny <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
wtf <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
dw
i mean QUA Herrscher will have that same feature
Juan is IMG Herrscher <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
75 SP ulti, break 2 layers
i can already predict what will be QUA Herrscher broken mechanic gonna be
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
S0 Nyx and SSS Nyx no diff
on MA they still fullfil their worth
on Abyss that is
or a gaming mouse
their niche can be replicate with a f*cking lightning support
QUA is meant to be flop <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
diversity you see
1 QUA every year
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
for f*cking next year
but they save that spot for Seele
so Ely could be QUA
Vill-V could have been anything but QUA
and only kill Seele's fan
if she were to be QUA, she would be so much of a good pull
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
game's killer ?
wonder what is Ely's theme
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
Dudu theme is IMG killer
S-rank Herrscher always have a theme around them
until PE come
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
HoD used to be HoF boss in Abyss
PE enjoyer <:Durandab:972857882964009091>
im fine with PE being the only option anw so it's fine
oh yea i remember that one, OD on Carole <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
why tank need the 4th option anw
but the like of FGO/HoDom/Jizo only have 2 options <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
but we absolutely have no need for more Psy <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
10 dpses compete on tank
next Herrscher is Psy <a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
jfc imagine if the nightmare come true <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
i mean they're not that bad on tank but compare to the like of Fischl + FR or Griseo + HoS
but fire supports need 15 seconds to farm their sp
i mean HoF damage is still like so damn high <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
yea probably but Fire SP when <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
isn't this just mean fire support just suck
that is like extreme reset run
that run use Holmes TM + Newt B
+2 compare to S0 HoF
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
no you just need SS HoF <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
Maincord is another tier of dumb
SpA <:heh:990308225314328576>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
Seem decent
HoF getting 1 boss every patch
Ely is always like this <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
<:WICKED:965940133864034337>
SP is somewhere between FR and HoT
Current top score is Vill-V > Nyx > Ely > FR > HoT
Lemme grab a clip
Like, way easier than MA Tona
The boss is easy tho
It is SSS Tona
In 5.9
That is almost enough for 150 pulls
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
This boss fuck up PE rotation so hard
No way PE can outscore Carole without rank up
It’s Marisa’s PE
That’s SSS PE
just do it <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
i remember it's HoT SR FR
She wants to prove herself as the best engineer by killing strongest man alive with man made weapons
In Abyss there are way too many other options because QUA valks aren’t competent
QUA valk in general you only pull to score better in MA <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
<:keqsip:994857348436865124>
SSS HoS has +40 sp
Kissy has better buff
all of the affixes are IMG or Lance atk
<@385655541248163840> <:WICKED:965940133864034337>
i don't hate any valks in general, just hate people <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
and she is mech so she can do type bio but she doesn't T0 any of it
even less than HoF during her shill
no, her boss appear like 5 times <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
istg these people didn't know what it look like before PE got released
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
boners
what's wrong with maincord and their b*ners for SpA <:Cringe:975612628779024434>
Suddenly everyone become a MA tryhard
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
Maincord in a nutshell
Ideally 5 minutes before it close
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
i predict Herrscher will start the new wave of dps
yea this is the point that they can't release new valks with the same power as old valks anymore
They don't release Priarm for old valk anymore
yea that feel kinda bad tho <:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
i think Priarm is fine, saving a lot of useless valk in general <:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
Vill-V's value is just so low
like SSS Couatl + Kosma
i mean unless they pull a d*ck move <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
<:FelisD:987145546974253056>
 idk, try having a brain 
yea now i think the req for Nirv is just
when Nirv now is 10 slots
but not like it matter
good score in abyss tho
probably just sh*t in general
<:woggerswhale:653576160231424040>
spend less = more nuggets to eat
i mean i can afford for Vill-V but highkey i will skip her too <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
<a:ZhugeDance:723165871387705485>
IMG weather is getting good shill
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
this game favorite type
and also being Mech
shared damage mechanic and her boss being basically either Fire or Light make her secure a good spot in meta
she is still a good valk, probably live longer than usual too tbh
<a:PeepoSHAKE:931874355267371049>
isn't that basically 5 seconds per stage ?
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
so they keep the mindset Mobius = God till now
people just get used with shilling Mobius due to ER back then
yea dw about it, i don't have any hope in Mobius being a better valk neither
<:OttoScared:873503904401338409>
they are so confident i almost think it's real
like yea, i know Raven is bad but she isn't always bad, especially in RL context <:Bedge:990510746238611527>
oh it's just the usual how sh*t Raven and AE is but they just not take everything into context
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
oh i was talking about the fire team part, look like they shifted the subject already
honkai official
holy sh*t if you read CN discussion rn you might have either brain-damaged or a good laugh <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
while you need to fast cancel with AE and chilling farming SP with Raven
and her supports too <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
<:woggerswhale:653576160231424040>
so does Paga
Aslaug is busted
<:KianaFish:423917411465560065>
how can you even skip Raven, the only thing  you can skip is Aslaug
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
my guy is actually saying  im glad i skipped Aslaug refund supply 
fire just sucks
im damn sure it's not even because of Vill-V
If we’re lucky that is
<a:NODDERS:931874243069751326>
And beta start on same day with story
If we’re lucky valk reveal will be 1 day before it
Next Friday
time to sleep until 6.0 beta
the rest of 5.8 look straight forward <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:heh:990308225314328576>
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
finding 9S ref on bili is so easy lmao
no wonder PE score is lower at low rank
i realised this boss f*cked up PE rot so much
oh i just watched S2 PE ref and SSS SnS ref <:ICANT:921403877285306399>
<:sky90:976492870204813372>
just reset
that sucks when it happen
actually i don't know
because
<:FelisD:987145546974253056>
wtf is wrong with this boss, there is no PE ref that is not 9S on bilibili <:huh:966619839307321394>
give me a minute
alright <:HMM:966625453194485760>
and the dude said potentially 700+ if the stars align
<:huh:966619839307321394>
S2 PE
im actually convinced CN are full of hackers
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
does bleed trigger turg ?
i really can't tell if PE is supposed to be good on this boss or not <:TeriThink:928714644040871996>
<:HigoThink:585629884630695948>
is PE score supposed to be low on this boss
the scores look low <:HigoThink:585629884630695948>
<:woggeroraora:653797582346256414>
<a:SadgeCry:932986657798512660>
SEA and GLB on their way raising the temp to save Nyx final boss
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Yea Vill-V low cost ulti make it so that she just walk in, press ulti, 1 free layer gone
1 layer for free while others have to pick up ball and chilling with Couatl
Yea her score in Abyss is way higher than the rest
HoT
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
<:sky90:976492870204813372>
Neko moment
Oh i use the wrong pronoun
<:heh:990308225314328576>
Right before he sniped the sh*t out of gresham
That’s what keilo said
<:KianaFish:423917411465560065>
I can’t wait for week like FGO + HoDom, FGO + Jizo, Wolf + BKE
<a:seelenoted:963697302151757826>
The problem week will be when they push 2 bosses that has capscore on the same valk
Kosma : HoT/Fischl/FR
Jizo : Hos/Griseo + PE/BKE
Hepha : LE/Carole/Mobi
Yea that week look easy if anything <a:SeeleNoted:874736846259781692>
doesn't mean it's not ugly <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
<:COCKBedge:939253294994436176>
where is your SW <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
2 out of 4 ice bosses are typeless so they can release any type they want tbf
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
probably Bella, Hellmaru too
<:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
type Kasumi
<:worryoraora:653794051308650536>
wolf keep appearing with the most annoying boss fight ever
yea it was Mobius into SpA
<:woggerswhale:653576160231424040>
and we're most likely about to have the 3rd mech dps of the year
this game favor mech too much for no reason
AKA <:OMEGALUL:867273141197864961>
how can a boss have an rng opener where it suddenly take more lightning dmg for no reason
like so so bad
Husk is so bad
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
the time i go there is just to spam some emotes <a:ZhugeDance:723165871387705485>
brain-damaged
asking meta advice and proceed to explain how meta is not matter
copium rehab center is fun but the amount of brain-damaged in there is too high
probably an easy skip even in Nirv tbh <:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
and uhh Nirvana bracket change mean people will think that they can skip Vill-V
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
actual wish.com PE
unlikely, her score is high but her gameplay is like the most boring sh*t i have ever seen
the only channel that have the least dumbass
im a regular in maincord lore <:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
maybe if the temp is low enough you can run HB instead of Raven <:HMM:966625453194485760>
im not sure about RL tho
you just start P1 with Vill-V ulti for 1 free layer
no, just the normal rot <:HMM:966625453194485760>
so you can just ulti right at the beginning for 1 free layer
but her damage on collapsed target is actually high
they did increase her ulti cost
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
she can double collapse in a short period
that's why Vill-V score on Couatl is way higher than the rest rn <:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
So you can only buy 10 frags in total
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Isn’t Ely and FR frags are like 8/8 per frag
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
How many AW and AL can we get per week ?
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Peak useless
Unlike DB
BN is so sh*t but her dorm buff is good
<a:KianaCookie2:646215964471328789>
You should try to get all the dorm buffs if you don’t know who to farm next
coming from behind <:huh:966619839307321394>
that will be much easier to scam pts
imagine if Eden has an outfit with vfx change <:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
the dude play with 1000 FPS
i think you can scam 2 pts if you're karato
don't think it's doable at 60 fps <:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
and not couting that frame
the game will lag
at the last dragon tick before Kurikara dive it , you switch to Fischl and use weapon active
require HoT new outfit tho
actually there is a trick that can net you 1 extra pts
you either have enough damage or you don't
this boss is actually a straightforward boss <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
there is actually not a lot of space for improvement with BKE
you can bruteforce it by just resetting your run until it work
i don't think you need any brainpower for Turg Eden
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
stop wasted better stigs neko
using Handel on Eden = wasted
<:meiMad:997543209221750834>
shouldn't your ping supposed to be like 10
<:huh:966619839307321394>
why does your ping 437 tho
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:HigoThink:585629884630695948>
<:woggerswhale:653576160231424040>
weird <:HMM:966625453194485760>
also is your Eden SSS nini ?
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
old boss problem
<a:DAM:995214446601453589>
Yea this strat can’t be solved by skill
using Marg or Aslaug on Eden = forced to use ultimate = minus 15 pts
<:keqsip:994857348436865124>
Turg is better
her gun active can refresh Turg so if you have enough damage without the need to use Eden ultimate
it's a non-ultimate Eden
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
first wave is Mech mobs
it's Bio
as long as you're mech you can do it, just slot Griseo in
but bleed boss is just the same as type HoS and type Houdou
top score should still be BKE <:HigoThink:585629884630695948>
still BKE
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:pepeHmmm:965974667544391760>
because they feel like it
Prinzessin der Verurteilung
PV is the battlesuit name
Fischl is the character name
yea
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
But still, 15% more crit rate won’t hurt
Well, sort of
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
restart until PE QTE decided to crit is not the gameplay i signed up for
that's fair, i also really need SSS Griseo <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
i see
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
nini, AKA dorm buff is reducing ele dmg taken
im certain that Felis score better than her
🚮
DB and AKA is trash
<:sky90:976492870204813372>
imagine not being able to damage both HP bars
seeing other valks POV on HoDom compare with PE is literally heaven and hell <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Prettier than Papilo Lily ?
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
Even SP does better than SN
Nyx’s value will probably be reduced to the 620 xtals squad
Vill-V also looking better than her in every aspect <:sky90:976492870204813372>
The mobs spawn won’t be as tanky to need her soul-link mechanic
Yea if the temp is not high enough
And only in Nirv
Probably the only boss Nyx can top score now
In Ice Hellmaru at least <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:TeriThink:928714644040871996>
With Griseo and HoS, is there any chance that SS Nyx will lose to SP on Couatl
Im actually wondering
and other options such as HoT or MPE is like in the area of 47.3xx - 47.4xx
<:TeriThink:928714644040871996>
yea i remember new S0 PE capscore on SSS FGO is like 47.728
elemental doom <:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but MA look like a pain
if Heimdal is bugged then we will probably get Fire Tank <:HMM:966625453194485760>
keilo, thoughts on week 4 and 6 ?
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Should be, the shield count toward bleed dmg iirc
no double sleep pri <:woggers:652740192653934633>
<:keqcopium:838673827910123560>
They’re saving it for QUA Herrscher
<:quantumwoggers:855085607398277200>
Maybe Vill-V won’t be Nyx 2.0
They have 3 QUA Abyss to cycle now
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:collapsedwoggers:652852676228546611>
her abyss is literally design to make sure Raven weakness doesn't get exposed
this is disgusting
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Lol now you can go to EX even before saving up enough xtals for 12/12 team
<a:KianaCookie2:646215964471328789>
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
yea back when Felis wasn't released, if you want to score high with SW on Assaka you need to off AE
TIL <:A_NoteTao:928234793844486164>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
I need to get better at reading and learning about these multipliers
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Til
<:HigoThink:585629884630695948>
Type counter and type buff from abyss
<a:KianaCookie2:646215964471328789>
Griseo boost the advantage on these Bio bosses too much
Also increasing dmg on Bio + shieldless enemy from Griseo too
<:huh:966619839307321394>
It’s 50% tdm
SN <:ICANT:921403877285306399>
PE dps is better but even then 50% bonus dmg is too much to surpass
PE is strong but not that strong
Unless this is some Agony 1
Fiction
<:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
<:782880522870980609:798379287341695096>
Both boss version and playable version
AKA is trash
But this a once in a lifetime deal <:huh:966619839307321394>
4 hours and 30 minutes
<:huh:966619839307321394>
50 SP to trigger ulti or sth
Yea she does have SP problem now with V2
Not entirely a bait
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
Vill-V raw dps looking good
For some reasons SEA love AKA the most
<a:KianaCookie2:646215964471328789>
It’s SW, and also SpA on AKA too
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Wasting 2 minutes on Hellmaru -> Mobs spawn doesn’t line up -> Too bad
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
But that is also Abyss
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
<a:aTeriSmug:754195006738399304>
Teri become a Herrscher Slayer
What if instead of becoming a Herrscher
Lightning Teri <:woggers:652740192653934633>
<:woggerswhale:653576160231424040>
S-rank fire support and A-rank Fire SP
what if 6.1 drop a huge bomb <:pepe2:368744338445828106>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
Fire doesn't even have a single SP
you still need someone to work with Felis anw
<:pepe2:368744338445828106>
yea i also feel like  skipping AE because she is in dorm and missing from most comps  is not a good take either but i guess it's personal perspective
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
only need to roll HoS and AE tho
oh im in the faction  AE is still worth rolling for  <:worrythumbsup:759845056743473204>
exclude her and pretend Fire doesn't exist if you don't play from 5.5 <:worrymad:987990517453303820>
i just feel like using it  <:worryoraora:653794051308650536>
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
and 35% for MA
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
F2P line up for RL Abyss
Physical : Ely/HoS/SnS/SI
Fire : SpA/AE/RC
Lightning : FR/PV/AE/GD
Ice : RC/HB/AE <:worryoraora:653794051308650536>
i mean yea, if you only care about Abyss there is actually no S-rank you need to pull <:AgonConcern:799494217717776425>
<a:Yaeslap:966597937696223232>
don't pull PE at that point you dumbass
<:OttoScared:873503904401338409>
<:sky90:976492870204813372>
i just see this as a good option for F2P to get full rewards on SSS and dip
<:OttoScared:873503904401338409>
fhem is a beast
<a:Yaeslap:966597937696223232>
90% of nirvana players also can't replicate fhem's run
but i can guarantee you
this may sound mean
normal human can't also replicate fhem's run
chill nini, it's fhem ref
<a:Yaeslap:966597937696223232>
unless you can't afford it, there is actually no reason to not pull PE
no, there is actually no reason to not pull PE <:sky90:976492870204813372>
with 7TR
2nd highest should be SS1 HoT
<:sky90:976492870204813372>
good joke
relax bud, S0 PE score is 47.760 <:sky90:976492870204813372>

<:woggers:652740192653934633>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Not like ice need to be save nowaday but their dps options are so grief
<:TeriRip:801041888642727937>
Ely will save ice
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
That mean Seele Herrscher will also be this strong
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Being a Herrscher level valk with IMG type make PE too strong
<a:DurandalGooseL:706773806756397067> <a:DurandalGooseR:706773827224469594>
By next year PE will already fullfil her worth
<:collapsedwoggers:652852676228546611>
QUA Herrscher will have like 10 collapse tbh
So Vill-V has to take that spot
They’re avoiding giving Herrscher type QUA
<:FelisD:987145546974253056>
But it’s Mech Ice
6.0
Trash rank
It’s S2 BKE <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
Rich nini
Max pri Griseo
They buffed it in V3
15% now
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Was talking with a dude from maincord and he literally trying to persuade me comparing SS SK vs S2 SPA on wolf is not fair
They never admit they lack skill
Uhh, giving advices on maincord is exhausting <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
could also be better
why would her crit rate buff is placed at SSS anw <a:hostantrum:963352189957455932>
nah, balding on Jizo without SSS Griseo sound terrible <:sky90:976492870204813372>
fix it real quick
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i  was meant to say  Mihoyo was trying to hide the big CG coming
<:KianaNotLikeThis:681767172304928768>
wait i mistyped it, f*ck, i mean encrypted, why did i type decrypted
<:AgonConcern:799494217717776425>
to prevent leakers
no Mihiyo do it
one big CG is coming
they even encrypted all 5.9 CGs too
they setup for it with Ely's memories on island  <:AgonConcern:799494217717776425>
<:woggers:652740192653934633>
like Black Abyss into Midnight Ataegina
probably will transform into another weapon with Herrscher power
it's White Flower <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<a:hostantrum:963352189957455932>
it's actually the lack of SSS Griseo for these failed runs
no Paga <:woggers:652740192653934633>
<:KyaruDed:665063091419086848>
It’s literally what it sound like
<:SentiStare:972530564659835001>
Some are waiting for Griseo’s cross
Currently it’s 4 chairs with FT CH BB, for T100 it’s 50/50 between PE and FT

She just enjoy gaslighting people
Even better when Viper doesn’t even have a tragic backstory
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
Then the 5th one it turn out that she just gaslight him into thinking so
Her bond story from 1 to 4 are expressing how much she want to spend time with the Protag
Viper gaslight people so fucking hard <:dejj:1067071941367824474>
<a:TheVoices:1167902356646674462>
how long does Blue Box author need to hint that the new girl like Taiki
okay what the fuck man
if in this loop he is older bro would probably be more of a menace
bro fucking killed Billy on the spot
i just remember how much of a Beast top was <:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
we're so <:barack:1154719413682057306>
yea Unchaste and Unback will be a banger
so we can use we're <:barack:1154719413682057306>
i hope it's Unback
<a:therehego:1183176161996570664>
probably Juiz yea
ok but next chapter who will Fuuko get to first
yea probably not a lot
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
cause Juiz need to recover her memories and tell them everything she know
like have to
they need to use Remember right
now that i think about it
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
yea isn't he look like a fucking beast
cooked too fucking hard
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
now it's this chapter and last episode
when Andy and Fuuko first went to Union, the manga was at the chapter Fuuko met 10 Master Rules
idk how the author did it but he keep arrange new chapter to match sth with anime
Gina barely hang on to make the suit not fucking vanished
but Change power is still overwhelm af
<a:therehego:1183176161996570664>
in real time
okay but Andy just shoot his 5 fingers to Earth
this woman is fucking busted
Gina will need to step up her game
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
what happened with can't affect living being
hold up, wdym changing Gina <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
she both look like male and female at the same time
Holy shit <:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
<:PauseChamp:889033551276830770>
let me read it first
wait what happened, i just got a phonecall
still looking like a beast
bro is not burning anything in his sight
holy mother of sick
the fight with him they can't even fight, they need to talk with him
im down for him to just be Meaning
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
then 1st rule has more chance to not be Death
if 3rd Rule is somehow actually Change
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
sort like that
but for microbe to appear and evolve into sentient creatures you need Nature and Evolution
like she can only shape the Earth
Change might also has same restriction
so Unchange can't use on living being <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
like she can use Unchange on Phil but it's moreso the artifact body
so far Gina can only affect objects right <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
then like 3 months or 1 year later Sun added Evolution in
oh wait that's not what i mean, i just mean the Earth was constantly changing to be able to inhabit <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Sun and Luna also add new rules here and there so maybe Evolution and Sex got added right after anw
“Changing” itself to fit with the living
But i think the Earth shape itself make sense tho
Yea the change with “microbe” was definitely a reach
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Yea the change in structure of the sea and the microbe born the 1st creature iirc
And the first creature exist because she exist
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
If we assuming she is Change then her hair would be DNA chain
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
Young Juiz did look like she was genderless in the flashback
<a:therehego:1183176161996570664>
Yea and if Fair + Justice are also master rules
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
It shape the entire basis of world
The definition of “Change” is actually huge when you think about it
Thots?
Lowkey she might be Change
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Something wider than Sex and Gender
Cause Language wasn’t a Master Rule so now im starting to think maybe Sex/Gender is also not a Master Rule
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
what are the chance the 3rd rule is not Sex/Gender
Okay after a while of thinking
actually beast
cut his arm, draw one and then die later <:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
appear like a beast and just genuinely want to help Fuuko and Andy
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
but i think most people fall in love with UDUL because of Akira
the stake and scale become higher when Galaxy was added
yea the atmosphere of the manga start changing whaen GIna show up
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
new UDUL chapter in 24 hours
but you know what is even more hype
i still think his reveal is the best in 100th loop
i actually can't wait for Akira to make his debut
yea, literally a beast <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
imagine this panel in anime tho <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
next episode will probably stop at Rip, Latla, Feng and Creeed boarding the ship
so we won't be able to see Chikara until episode 12
yea Juiz was giga sick in that frame <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
and showing that he is genuinely care for Tatiana, he was afraid that Rip might do harm on her
this is a great change, hinting at his betrayal later
especially when Juiz told Andy and Fuuko to bring Tatiana with them, Billy was concered for a moment
they added more Billy's reactions and focus when talking
i just finished episode 10 <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
or 5
4 episode to wrap up Chikara and Rip's arc <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
oh it's anime original but it's the countdown until end of August
when did this show up in the episode
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
Bro look like he just woke up from a hangover
Yea Robin was washed in the showmatch an hour ago
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Who is physically the witch then
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
Who is the witch?
Kana is gifted, she can't understand how rotten normal human can be facing genius
not even close
also Kana with the im more and more undestand Nino <a:classic:1058849393370992650>
<a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
safety always come first
yea, she would probably ask them to use protection
<a:GAMBAADDICT:1088508671144759358>
female Kaiji
and Kana somehow always double down on the worst choice possible
do not worry, Ruby won't be edgy for more than this arc
yea Aka was putting a caution there through Frill
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
no one will suspect anything
they can always make out at home
but Ruby and Aqua doesn't need that tho
the fucking they are so in the role they went to hotel together
he had the chance to cook there but he picked the easy route instead <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
yea there is no point for drag out Drama but i guess it's the easy way to lead into Ai's personality
could have reached peak
could have been better tho
yea it wasn't bad
not a 10/10 week<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
still a decent chapter tho
ok Aka is not cooking shit
oh im not sure about that one <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
time to find out <a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
this is a stacked week
if Aka also cooked with this one
oh OnK new chapter
yea it's probably sth different
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
sound like a manhwa
wait what is vlt again <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
oh you already finished it <a:therehego:1181972218859765830>
you should read it too
Himmel's love for Frieren is too selfless
Frieren this week chapter is also good <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
i can bet this panel is just him being exhausted
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
look like he is exhausting himself
but Fujimoto should stop drawing weekly tho
the pet that Power left in Denji's hand tho <:sajj:1067071714518892584>
did you read CSM new chapter
cooked too fucking hard <:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
why does Top look like a beast tho
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
and Juiz is Fuuko with white hair
Victor is Andy with Black hair
literally Fuuko with white hair
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
You down?
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
It was so peak
<@148145559897636865> i just saw a leak image
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Yea when they finally get to Autumn i think this pace is fine
They will need at leaat 10 episodes to cover Autumn
With the pace they’re doing
But srs tho
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
Is actually gonna be nut
The fight between Andy and Victor
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Aintnoway?
If they get to Autumn yea
Literally fucking die in 1 panel
Bro has the craziest jump among all
Sean <:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
If you haven’t read the 101st loop that is
Yea Gina was definitely just a plot device
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
<@148145559897636865>
she was an UG, a 4 cost carry and Ace
yea that's also why Samira was weak for the whole set <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
the unit itself can still grief you
so even if they didnt' want to grief you
Ekko and Jayce are just strong units
it tend to happen in challenger games too
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
econ trait and they're all beasting
for no reason
Jayce and Ekko are too fucking strong
oh that one was cause design flaw tbh
doesn't matter if they have to sell whole board
like as long as they're 2 lives at least
you'd tend to see high elo players do more extreme play than low elo
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
high elo sell their whole fucking board if they're uncertain
oh cause you weren't familiar with open fort yet
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
this guy really think challengers and pros will struggling to win/loss streak in low elo lobby
<@148145559897636865>
<:Looking:1154847280529162260>
wasting each other time for fun
<:maaaaan:937725992968028171>
so his deduction is that this one might be broken
cause Yone and stuffs got buffed next patch
lil bro picked Live for the Danger
this is what happened playing no stat
<@148145559897636865>
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
yea there is just no subjective opinion, stats always right
stats are just broken
they only correct the 30% or lower
they always miss like 70% of the actual meta
or not the best
their read on meta is not good
it prove that even pro players who play and stream this game for living
but during these past 2 years when tactic tool first show up
yea human tend to overstimate their ability on certain thing they good at
So they all wait for the day patch goes live to check tactic tool
But it didn’t work out
Like if PBE hold any value you would have seen pros play it a lot
So they’re just wasting each other time
Cause 8 players can’t study the meta that fast
I think it actually help you nothing at all
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
In a way it’s just where bad players convince themselves that current patch is bad
Playing PBE give no value
Yea if we were to be honest
Is he a beast
Who is woohoojin
<a:Aware:889021591776817172>
But i don’t like the implication behind Mutsumi’s words
Yozakura this week is pretty good
Yea that’s true
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
New book > games
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
Yea it’s only my priority, cause i prior reading above everything else
any manga deserve a chance to try out even if they're bottom of the barrel <a:sett:1159553311511412818>
oh i always give new manga a chance even if i don't like the genre, i also read Dandadan a couple chapters in the early but drop it for a while
<a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
can you find my lost D tho
yea im starting it, like a beast
cause the manga focus on to make sure the readers catch on that 2 MCs might want to fuck each other
pacing and world building i think are all over the place
Shadow Eliminator sth
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
instea of improving the quality, they choose to put in BL's hint so that the manga won't be axed <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
they just baiting people into thinking it
yea that's why i hate it, they don't have any intention to write a proper one <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
it start out with no BL hint but the author start putting in BL to gain more views
Blue Lock is BL bait <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
fucking worst
and on first chapter the author already put in BL's hint
i just check out new exorcist manga <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
no other manga get me exciting over new chapter in WSJ anymore
kinda fucked up that now i only wait to read UDUL  <a:chatt:1171806575313301514>
the sickest ramen to Sun
time to deliver it <:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>

The drawing or your lower part
Which part is hard
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
the ultimate happy ending
there must be an artifact that can seperate Andy and Victor
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
<@148145559897636865>
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
It sound like hell
Probably not
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
And good at gaslight people into buying beer
<:caught:1175079388874805351>

I want to be Ootsuki
Need to gaslight everyone into thinking it’s a good show
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
It lack a Tonegawa
You know why it got boycott
So they create a game based on sth that the show mocking it
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
I think there are like 300 debtors participated
This one remind me of Netflix Squidgame Challenge they just put out
Kaiji is insanely popular during the 90s to 2000s
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
They also have the Bog in like 5 or 6 Pachinko’s stores in Tokyo
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
And Kaiji’s One Poker arcade iirc
Fan animation

is it missing an R
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
it must be a sick joke
pulling the most insane joke out of thin air
that sound really fucking hard tho
yea i won't mind if the author did build it up <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
It just feel undeserved to me
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
It’s a character that suddenly pull a 4th wall joke out of her ass
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
It pissed me off so fucking much
Without any build up and shit
Does it ever pissed you off that suddenly a manga do 4th wall joke out of their ass
King Golf
i only know 1 good Golf manga and that manga was a beast
to write a good sport manga you need to have the readers feeling it too
the problem with their golf manga is that it lack passion
yea Kuroko no Basket's author
it's so hard to write about golf
but it's golf so probably gonna get axed soon
neat <:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
oh new sport manga just dropped
<:FeelsStrongMan:816797263811575819>
The universe will probably shaking
It’s actually wholesome
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
That’s 1 of the smoothest transition into fucking i have ever seen in manga
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
I still remember the chapter when they go outside for sightseeing and then just bang
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
For Iyashikei on top of my head is probably Barakamon
It’s the start of greatness <:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
He would do anything to reach Autumn
If the director love UDUL
Akira <:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
A peek into peak Shonen
It have to be at least Autumn
And they’re probably gonna spend entire of 2nd cour on Spring
Atp it would be a miracle if they can even finish Chikara’s arc
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Probably not right
Do you think we can even see Galaxy next episode
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Is kinda concerning
1.5 chapters for each episode
And i have to say
I just skim through new UDUL episode
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
Bro forgot
Probably some mental gymnastic answer
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
And Araki hit back with “Oh, my bad”
Why does Star Platinum range in 1st chaptet was like fucking 5km and later on it’s only 3m
I still like when everyone asked Araki in the interview that
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
What now
If you get it and you don’t have plan to kill yourself
Remember the suicide stand in P5
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
If it were me i would just fucking out of there
It’s a miracle that Johnny can even think of the way to use him
Tusk Act 1 was so fucking weak
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
Modern action manga keep forgetting that part when put out “strongest” valks
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
There is no strongest stand, only strongest user
I still like the world that Araki created
WoU is still top stand designs for me personally
I do want to reread P8 at some point
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
Bro keep getting beat up by “Jojo” and then solo everyone else like a beast

David Production
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
Everyone want the anime to reach the peak of shonen asap
They’re complaining about everything that can save even 1 second to speed up the pace
Checking UDUL subreddit, everyone are complaining about the anime but not because it’s bad or anything
Lol
:PU_PeepoChugsDrink:
ice cold beer
and probably beer too
<a:peepoEat:1023631981814231171>
at least he still get to eat the steak
also Kaiji need a break too
just a preview
yea P4 is pretty short
Just don’t read 99 and 100
But you can also read chapter 98 if you’re curious
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
Even 17 steps can’t compare to it
Peak gambling
98 spoil the game they will play
But 97 is a good stopping point
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
So they take 2 chapters of P5 in P4
They want to have 10 volumes with 10 chapters each
Yea it was due to printing issue
Or at least 99 and 100
98-100 belong to P5
It’s the end of P4
Oh btw if you will take a short break after P4, stop at chapter 97
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
I was talking about when Kazuya purposely messed up with the seatbelt
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
Like mistakes after mistakes
Isn’t that after they got messed up real fucking bad
Oh wait what
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Tell me if you think Kazuya was cheating or not
When you reach P4’s break point
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
15 years ago it was more like 4.5M usd
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
Instead of “im gonna steal this kid money”
I would fucking run the fuck out of there
You know if someone bring me to my own grave before we start playing game
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
Ichijo look young af so he probably didn’t have that much money flying around
Yea and Muraoka seem to be in the business longer than Ichijo
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
Ichijo lost 700M
Muraoka shit his pants when he lost 480M
Poor guy
Ichijo is probably dead
bro begged for his life right there
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
yea he genuinely didn't want to go back to the UG
and here Kaiji having fucking mental breakdown when he realized Kazuya would actually fuck his body up to get the money back
other gambling works out there, the MC just smile like a beast he is
ofc you would still shit your pants
but when it come down to dead or bankrupt
like you can talk all you want
yea i still like how realistic Kaiji is
bro chill, did you not hear what Kazuya said the whole time
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
and Kaiji was like when will we gambling
can't be any more clear than building a grave for Kaiji and make him sign consequence contract
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
cause he was beyond the point of dead
yea at 1 point he just asked Kazuya money like they're friend or some shit
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
and really fucking think that imma ask for a second
just won 480M
like the start of P4 is already enough evidence
always find a way to back to starting point
yea isn't Kaiji a fucking self-destruct button <:caught:1175079388874805351>
Tonegawa was too fucking cocky for someone with 0 skill
than having to gamble with Kaiji
like he'd rather beat the shit out of Kaiji and bring him back to the underground
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
that's why he will never compete with Kaiji
he acknowledge Kaiji
i think that's what make him more dangerous than Tonegawa
i think
he acknowledge Kaiji's gambling skill, that's the most dangerous part already
Tonegawa 2.0 is much dangerous
that's why Tonegawa is gone for good now
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
compare to Tonegawa
at least the cheat they use will do much more damage than it should be
even though they can still cheat
yea competent opponents are more interesting
but he twisted their thoughts make them think it's a fucking battle royale
like he said, it could be the game of true love <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
He twisted it to the point people participate in it couldn’t think of anything but kill their lover
Is a really interesting one
The game he wrote in his book
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
like all the game he forced people to play
he just twist the intentions behind their actions to fit his own narrative
he can still read people's heart really precisely
even though Kazuya is twisted <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
kinda twisted
so by only gambling and win he can find the happiness of being superior
his desire is finding self-worth <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
It just like a kid see a new toy
Yea it’s spoiler but in P5 he actually doesn’t think Kaiji really better than anyone else
so it should be when they enter the restaurant
i think everyone said they feel uncomfortable when Kazuya show his nature
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
or die trying
if you're already on luck streak, you better ride along to heaven
his logic does sound lit tho
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
i think everyone i had a convo with all said they feel uncomfortable reading P4
there are some kind of unsettling feeling around P4
now that i think about, idk if you will find P4 good or interesting <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
oh i would still read it regardless
just don't read it <:caught:1175079388874805351>
probably not a good idea <:caught:1175079388874805351>
kinda mess up tho
but i just can't take something weak seriously after Act Age
like it's not Aka's fault
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
compare to Act Age
but when it come to character expression and how the stage play out, it's weak
really interesting
OnK's stage play acr were still entertaining, involve with behind the scene stuffs
that manga was a phenom
the world that the author see combine with the artist art style
peak of acting manga
yea Act Age
kinda unfortunate
so it came out average to me <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
a peak one actually
but i have seen a better one
normally i would enjoy it
baiting viewers into thinking Kana will be an idol for a long time and would date Aqua anytime soon
oh that's a pretty neat stopping point
which chapter did they stop with season 1?
<a:Aware:889021591776817172>
left Akane look like  her memorial pic
<@148145559897636865> new special illustration
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
reaching the end of exhibition match arc
the manga currently has 157 chapters
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
and MC's friend is a pro gamer
MC's friend asked him to help with an exhibition match upcoming so they're focusing on another game now
feel more realistic than at least 99% game novel/manga out there
now they're moving onto another game which is also cool
i do think it's kinda cool <:caught:1175079388874805351>
and while the MC bring the material to the blacksmith to forge some good stuffs, the AI immediately put out a patch fix to counter the MC cheat farming
there was a scene where MC found a way to cheat farming rare material cause the mobs there was too strong for him to solo it, he abusing it for like 10 times until ran out of MP, he used the last attempt to find a way to get the rarest material among it but got unlucky and wasted an attempt
but i guess it's easier to set it up like that for a gaming novel/manga
but i still won't buy superior AI scripting the game bit
the 1st major arc it was kinda generic but moving on from that it does feel like a game now
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
ok after my friend told me to give Shangrila Frontier another chance, i think it's decent now
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
and Aka went neat
yea it was probably Menga that wanted to draw it like that
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
that's why Hikaru killed her to feel alive
she was already shining
like not just promising one like Shiranui or Akane
yea she was a shining star
this was during the time Aqua was working on the script
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:ApuShrug:986764322430673057>
or he is just batshit insane
except for collecting stars power
but there is no better explanation for Hikaru's action neither
oh definitely not
<:pausechamp:1079371150439759892>
unless
Shiranui is 2nd
yea i think they was mentioning she would be the 1st choice
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
isn't Ai supposed to play by that dead actress
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
and Ruby has a chance to compete
what are the odds he kill that actress so that the slot for Ai is open
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
his kids
Hikaru has been watching them
yea but it show something really dangerous
Hikaru definitely brainwashed her 1 way or another
and has some connections with Hikaru
yea even though she has inferior feeling toward Ai, she also admire her, worship even
Kana gonna need 10 times her effort to portray someone like that
that Nino girl is all over the place
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
environment can change a person perspective but not their nature, they're who they're since they were born
but i guess it's just her nature
Nayuta is showing some really concerning behaviors tho
yea a great chapter <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Aka is painting out a really interesting Ai
<a:HUH:1129107980634312724>
It’s legal to marry your cousin in JP
Should be like Japan
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
Like i know for 1 thing that lolicon and incest are 2 popular tags in JP
It probably have sth to do with their culture
<a:ClearGaming:1113493455528804412>
He just addict to games
Aka definitely has the healthiest hobby
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Is that true?
“Bro, you need to trust me on this one, showing them peeing is plot relevant”
A couple days ago, i read a thread about Made in Abyss and someone said
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
Calm down
Like i get the argument of “it just fiction” but bro, their drawing are way too fucking specific
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
Or all of them are
If we’re being optimistic then half of them would still be lolicon, no?
Like there are actually a lot, and i mean really fucking a lot of loli’s manga
Yea this is what i don’t get the most about Japan
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
And he already had a wife back then
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
And he replied with “Bet, someone with huge tits is even better”
When they asked him during an interview in 2012 i think, they asked what does he think if working with a female editor
Oda is a pervert and he really consider harassment as normal
Yea a lot of mangaka have either weird hobbies or illegal hobbies even
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
But still a crime tho
Tbh i said assaulting but what he did was actually tossing their skirt while riding his bicycle
Kinda fucked up tho
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
Act Age’s author left some serious trauma for his victims but i just can’t help but keep wanting to read it
Yea that’s what i think too <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
He just has a hobby of assaulting them
Have nothing to do with his work at all
What if that author assault female highschoolers
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
I will get more specific
Assuming you really love his work too
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
What is your choice
If the author of a really great manga/novel commit crime and you can decide if he can keep doing his work or not
<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492>
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
Cause those 2 have unique trait in them
Oh i actually couldn’t care less about all unfinised manga, just Act Age and HxH specifically
I will never know the ending of Act Age and might not know the ending of HxH too
Kinda sad tho
Yea could be too, i just hope he take care more of himself <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
Sick, it was a callback to Volume 7th
but his condition must be really fucked up
he chose to reveal the unsatisfied ending mean he still think there is a chance he can make it <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
back to <#966951945103347794>
<@416445660443967491> <@516591030326525983>
he is actually dying
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
he has 3 other endings in mind but if something happen to him, the canon ending is D
Togashi reveal ending D, the ending he doesn't think is good and already left it out in the recent interview
> For the ending, I have prepared three scenarios (a, b, and c). When considering the proportional reaction from readers, ranging from satisfaction to dissatisfaction, the ending a is deemed satisfactory by 50%, and unsatisfactory by 20%. This does not necessarily imply a high rating, but for me, reaching it will be secure in a way that doesn't complicate matters with excessive criticism, in my belief.
> 
> As for ending b, opinions will be divided similarly between satisfaction and dissatisfaction. For ending c, I anticipate a satisfaction rate of 10% and dissatisfaction rate of 90%. Why do I keep it present, even with a high rate of dissatisfaction? That's because it is my personal preference, but fundamentally, I want to think to the utmost extent about an ending to the point where I might not choose any of these three and create what I find most enjoyable, which is my ideal and goal.
> 
> To give you a clearer picture, I will share scenario d, which fell out of the candidate scenarios for the ending. if fate takes me before finishing the manga, consider it the manga's ending. i would be happy if you forgive me for that.
oh about this topic
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
or Japanese's author at least
so i guess it's all in their author's nature
but they all refuse to let anyone do it for them and just instruct the person <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
Kubo was close to dying back when he was still drawing Bleach
Kishimoto is now scared to draw
and Oda is dying with how much break he took over the year
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
all of Big 3's author have their lifespan reduced just by writing their stories is kinda messed up
he drew so much to catch up with deadline before now his body refuse to draw
which is actually fucked up
and Kishimoto doesn't really have health issue, he just scared to draw
but Naruto is finished Boruto is just a sequel
The only case of letting other draw his work is probably Boruto
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
All the cases of health issues, the authors would rather die than having his work be stained by others
Like it’s not even most
<:caught:1175079388874805351>
And he definitely doesn’t have any plans to ask anyone else to draw
World Trigger’s author has genetically disease pass down from his mom and he might even not be able to live pass next 10 years
Sailor Moon’s author drawing HxH for him
Togashi would rather fucking die than let his wife
That is definitely not happening on author side
Same ending, same key events but 2 different persons will have 2 different ways to write it
Human see things differently from each other, that’s why it’s interesting to learn about other POVs, the worlds that they see
It wouldn’t be the same anw <:caught:1175079388874805351>
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Is there any authors that beast at writing about games
Like a beast
Like dude was actually used “jobbers”
And All for One was talking about being the absolute villian, one that crush both heroes and jobbers
Tomura had a flashback where he played League
Yea not even kidding
and former All for One is addicted to role-playing villian
like he was canonically a League's player
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
the current All for One was a League's player
do you know that
a League's player
even worse
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Phil's also
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
reading manga, waching anime, drink beers in her free time
imagine when they met Juiz and she is just your 9 to 5 worker
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
probably a lawyer or a police
Juiz's life
bet it's gonna be a super normal one
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
so for the last loop he wanted Juiz to have a normal life
like he knew how fragile human life can be
in his perspective maybe not <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
445 billion years of love twist his sight
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
he was trying to kill Juiz there and it work on him cause he 100% think killing her is what he live for
also it's super fucking messed up when Unjustice work on Victor
isn't it super hard to tell if people doing in on the behalf on their justice or not
yea Unjustice still feel weird to me tho <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
this panel hit too hard when you saw Mui's eyes was open <:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
Miu was about to eat and Shen's Untruth condition was fulfilled there
this part in Summer's fight was too cute <:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
Feng was a beast
hope they can finish Summer
yea it was Autumn arc <:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
so only about 20 years
oh yea it was this loop <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
wait lemme check it again <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
yea from when the earth was formed
in other sense Andy is their son
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
but the only solution is a newborn soul
Remember forced him to forget everything and Victor didn't want it so he spent 4 billion years trying to work around it
only about the error personalities that Victor was trying to make
yea 1st time was Autumn arc but not exactly Victor either
Andy just told them to rest more
but the moment they're free to move
they haven't made a move for 100 loops
we also still don't know why Andy knew about Master Rules <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
they made a bet
instead of doing it normally
but they feel so fucking bored so they make a twist around it
and creating planet, galaxy, civilization are their jobs
i would think of Sun and Luna as the first 2 Uma ever born so they have all kind of power
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
if they don't respect it no one will
they're rules themselves
make sense tho
yea they definitely have to follow some rules, him, Luna and all the Uma too
he just told his parent to walk <:HUHwtf:1032707390027595877>
like wtf man
and he got Unmove
in 100th loop, Chikara just told his parents Mom, dad, come on
bud still want to kill Chikara's parents
yea the date can be changed but the moment of their life stay the same
but he was meant to have it at that exact moment of his life
like Void's Unavoidable, he wasn't the first one to have it
unless that person die they will always receive that ability
yea that's what i noticed too <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
until she met Andy
Fuuko will always just commit suicide on every loop
yea so in the future that Sun saw
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
yea Unluck on Fuuko is also random af
actually nut
rewritten the future
the fact that Untrust was bestowed on her 100% foresight
her ability is cool too <:poggfrenn:1087713199215886377>
too much free time <:BASED:937049443579068466>
they can cut out the chapter where Fuuko draw the UDUL one shot
when Fuuko part away
Summer is best stopping point
end of Autumn would be really empty <:sajj:1067071714518892584>
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
he doesn't care if people saw him naked
he has been living for 200 years
like i get that it probably feel like a personal convo between them but Andy isn't the type to care about it <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
when Fuuko met Andy and in the restaurant after they killed Gina
but when i skim through the anime, the director keep removing the crowd
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
yea he was definitely not planning on to write a romcom ecchi at all
the author cooked so hard
101 volumes, 101 loops <:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
<:poggfrenn:1087713199215886377>
in manga he is called Kohei which stand for Fairness
Billy's Unfair was hint through his counterpart in the manga
we did from time to time but only crumbs
<:FeelsSadMan:816800787137036360>
but it's definitely Juiz saying farewell to Victor
can't really tell what the hell they're saying
we did see a bit
in the manga 1st chapter, the From me to you final chapter is Juiz saying goodbye to Victor
but this sound like anime original
this was the original ending of 100th loop
the final chapter should be Victor and Juiz
only the beginning up until Autumn
what is it? <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
oh <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
the end didn't change but Akira manage to create hope
and Sun killed them all
like in the future he saw, Fuuko died, Andy go berserk and Victor got out due to Andy no longer able to imprison him
yea the story changed, the future he saw was no longer true <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
when Fuuko part away with Union
and 2nd cour can probably get to Summer
or Billy's betrayal
so 1st cour definitely end with Chikara's farewell
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
everyone say 2 cour i think
it better some timeless classic
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
they can't even make it to Akira
but the anime S1 won't reaching the peak anytime soon
yea a lot of people also turn their back on UDUL cause Andy molested Fuuko <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
and if you're a generic one you already minus 0.5
+1 for every manga with a sense of unique
yea i got it tho, my scale is also bias <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
yea some Eng translations are like that
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
and nitpicking the one you don't like
wtf, don't fucking rate it on a scale of 10 if you ignore your favortie's flaws
oh im all about subjective opinions but my problem with people rating a manga/anime/novel work is that they're fucking full of bias
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
a gag LN is 9/10 and Shy is 7/10
<a:Aware:889021591776817172>
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
or else
it better not have JJK or MHA in it tho
if Shy is 7/10 this guy top tier list must be really fucking cracked
oh just chill, i just want to know how you feel about Kaiji's mental gymnastic when you get on it  <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
He explain it in ch.1 too
<:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
Oh when you start P4, tell me how you feel about Kaiji’s reason
like a beast she is
seeing her keep winning
so Sun and Luna must be really fucking bored
but the fact that she reduced the amount of damaged to minimum for everyone
like here it's not that Fuuko pose any threats to them yet
to make it more exciting for them
yea i think Sun and Luna only let them move when situation get dangerous <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
like all 100 loops before, 10 masters didn't show up so that Union can't have any info of them
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
and for the 101st loop, Luna and Sun let 10 masters move
Remember, G-Pen, Rebellion
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
and Luna only started giving out game changer artifacts in the last few rounds too
but Fuuko can only do what she does rn because of all the info Juiz and Union manage to gather
like people keep asking What stopping Juiz from doing what Fuuko did
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
yea but Juiz walk and crawl all the way here so Fuuko could run
<a:classic:1058849393370992650>
Shokugeki also had a unique start
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
yea a lot of things in the early can also be planned better <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
and during the interview he said that half of UDUL is planned and half is he cooked along the way
oh the author of UDUL just went New York convention with Fuuko's VA and his Editor to celebrate the success of UDUL in the West <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
we never know about her family
or her parent is the school's sponsor
maybe cause she is cute
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
but i guess you can't have white hair in JP school
that's really weird <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
isn't her promotion art also blonde
there is no way
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
i thought Chii is blonde?
probably not enough heat?
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<a:burn:998945500030054410>
yea she got cooked from the heat
but Unburn is
like he didn't make Rip's power a 24/7 one
you know sometime Sun is really fucking specific with these abilities <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
So Enjin got Unburn because Sun think that it’s fun for a passionate chef to not be able to cook
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
sick <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
what is he cooking
that's a lot <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
It’s Milk
Yea but Scarra would still go bot 4 there
<:frenn:1114114240509395005>
The 678 trio?
That’s a lot
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Or maybe
Oh probably not
Like the avatar
What if it’s blue then
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Probably depend on the skin color
Buy a kid and have house
Can he do the opposite
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
sound interesting
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
That sound really fucking generous but i hope he does leave out a good amount for his own
Wait so what is the benefit of joining his org, they don’t have salary right?
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
Does he have other teams?
Oh im talking about DSG
Him and Boxbox really make this community bigger
That’s crazy
Oh shit Toast really made an org for TFT
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
And he talk shit about them the day after
He used to do some in the past
and he is the most brand risk streamer i have seen beside Mizkif
without being in an org, he will have to start running ads and do some other stuffs for Twitch
but big bro is a sloth
yea it's definitely good for both side
but C9 probably think it's not worth for a kid game
so the contract fee need to be up by a lot to match his size
now they need to renew the contract but he is too fucking big now
he joined them when he started his streaming career, it was a 5 years contract iirc
he's probably too expensive for them now
big bro just part away with C9
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<@148145559897636865>
reddit is definitely something <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
That’s interesting
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
Yea <:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
but how the story playout were normal
it did have a sense of unique, Luffy's power was definitely interesting <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
im easy to satisfy but i won't call a title Great without a sense of unique
idk, probably cause i have been reading since i was born <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
but even then you need to do a lot of mental gymnastic to convince me that OP is the goat one
yea One Piece is definitely the better one
it doesn't have the sense of unique
not bad but i think plain
and even then the ending is just plain
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
but the author took too long to tell the story
they definitely have great arcs
like all the Big 3, idt they're good
idt OP is good if i were to be honest
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263> sick
yea CSM is a WSJ title
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
it's UDL, Akane, CSM and Blue Box, Yozakura
at least there are still 3 good series rn on Jump and 2 chill one <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
the classic like Slam Dunk, Yuyu Hakusho, Rurouni Kenshin, Houshin Engi
you would even ask how is this even possible
there were so many ideas flying around during that time
there are a lot more too
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
the golden age of WSJ
it was so fucking cracked
starting from Summon forward he moved to V Jump
yea up until the end of P1
like so many genre were alive at that time, not just action and romcom
there are a lot more
except for the Big 3 and Jojo, WSJ had YugiOh, Eyeshield 21, Toriko, Bakuman, Death Note, Nurahyon, Gantz, Majin Tantei Nero, <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
the Golden Age of Shonen Jump had cracked action, sport, romcom, mystery, horror works running
i think before it definitely more stacked and variety
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
honestly, if you're a true shonen fan, you would prefer UDUL over any of the top anime rn, im not even bias
and not just a do this for quota kind of one
yea i can see that the studio really treat UDUL carefully
<:TOOBASED:888544186578653224>
like he could just not do it but he refuse to do so
and the assistant censor it later
the author actually draw his dick
oh btw do you know that the censor part of Andy's dick
<a:Booba:1081435431540903936>
she just wear tons of clothes for people to not accidentally  touch her
yea it was always that big
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
but we're westerns, remember
yea i love her design
if you compare it to MHA or JJK
they're rough and jacked af
and Andy too
also i think Fuuko's design is not popular among the mass <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
the closet we have got is Billy and Tesla and turn out Billy has a family
so they can't even cook any fanfic <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
all the couples are canon and you can't even disrupt them
cause it doesn't have BL material
you know 1 of the reason why UDUL is not popular
yea i think it's great that they respect the pacing of manga but for new viewers they would think Bro Sukuna oneshot Jogo in 1 episode, this fucking anime man <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
they won't reach the peak of shonen
unless this studio's director really fucking love UDUL
it's kinda fucked tho
so i think season 1 will end after Chikara's arc
the UDUL anime is slower than i expected <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>

“He punch really fucking hard” and “He move too fast”
Just be like ONE and Togashi
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
The energy generate from speed of light literally can fucking wipe out a city, you just can’t use it to fucking attack people man
Bro that’s not how it work
When they bring “speed of light” into the combat
You know what’s the worst?
<a:Timeout:1157060847894544495>
What happened with “He punch a really hard one”
I actually can’t stand when the author try too fucking hard to gaslight whatever the fuck their characters just did
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Probably fine, the theme of it is still about the main couple relationship
If you can ignore world building then the relationship is the good point of it
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
Overall still a good read but the world it try to build is holding by straw, magic rules are all over the place
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
Yea it start strong but got stale quick too
always win when it matter?
so are we just gonna gamble it?
so it's a once in a lifetime experience
to get energy for her eggs
isn't female Spider eat their partner after doing the deed <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
monster waifu games ofc
it's not even exaggeration to say that 20% of monster games in JP are his works
yea the author is actually really fucking famous for monster girls
kinda cooking <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
the designs are good tho
yea Monster Musume no Iru Nichijou
and harem
it's pure ecchi
oh it's definitely not good
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
it's just half human girl and half monster/animal
i know some monster one but it's definitely not furry
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Can’t recall any
Furry?
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
<:monkaLaugh:889025778623348837>
and it's really fucked up
yea in P4 the author show a preview of Kazuya's nature
although it's just a clash of different ideology
but P4 is also really good
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
Kazuya and Kaiji gamble is on P5
He is an audience
Kaiji won’t be gaming in P4
But P4 the author taking a break for Kaiji
His explanation is actually really fucking good and in-character
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Traitors
He give them 2 goond one
<a:pepenarutorun:1081435087901556827>
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
but Kazuya also just carry 200M around like it's nothing
yea kinda overreacting <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
<:ICANT:921403877285306399>
And Muraoka’s inner thoughts when Kazuya told him to just grind it again in case he lose
That’s the highest stake so far in Kaiji
160M base bet for a gamble
It’s legit scary for him so i can understand it
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Also his reaction when the 80M round end in a draw, dude almost choke himself right there when talking with Kazuya
Kaiji almost fuck it up by let go of his
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
Yea momentum is really important, it allow you to think carefully each decision you made
They’re all belong to underground world
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Even Kaiji
What i like about P3 most is that everyone is flawed as hell
So it’s only Muraoka that have to keep dealing with increase pressure
Yea can’t get any more dead than he is rn
Fucking over
1 Yakuman and it’s 320M paid out
Fair match with 80M base bet on the line
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Fucking rat
Yea cause he has been doing that since forever
While playing advanced odd-even
50/50 gamble for 80M base bet
Like he can only act brave and confident when he still has his cheats
For a coward like Muraoka
But also the stake is too fucking high now
So Kazuya showing up there was to lend Kaiji’s money and Muraoka couldn’t give less than a fuck what gonna happen to Kaiji
His plan was to make sure he could get money from Kaiji even if Kaiji doesn’t have any cent left to play
<:monkaStop:816801542211895327>
So now he is shaking
But he didn’t think of his plan getting found out
Yea Kazuya being there is actually Muraoka’s intention
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
it would be really fucking intense
when you start the 80M round
:spyge:
oh neat
what does that do <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
the author show Muraoka's true color at the start of this round
the stake is double now next round
<:monkaStop:937735356579737610>
Kazuya just casually said to Kaiji “Yea fuck it, i will lend you as much as you want, i can take it back with your body parts anw”
So his intention were making a hand with a single wait on 8 pin
Yea he was deducing that Kaiji knew about Miyoshi and Maeda so Kaiji would never play that 1 man he need
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
you're close to it
oh Kazuya should also reveal his identity soon too
<:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
Basically the king of underground already
Hyodo is a beast at building his kingdom
It’s extreme pressure on top of a gamble match
And you just can’t get rid of the unease feeling about it
When everything you have is at stake, that 10% can always happen
Even when you are 90% sure about the info you have
I think the idea of “gamble” that the author has is what make his works amazing
It’s kinda amazing how the author can keep putting Kaiji in the most intense spot possible
He has to deduced the info that Maeda gave to Prez while trying to act like he hasn’t noticed yet
Yea the last 5 turns here is where Kaiji actually need to gamble
<:dongerJ:1113491830164701286>
Yea the 40M round only end around chapter 80
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
Did you finish 40M round yet
Or else it’s over
But now Kaiji has to do a counter attack
Yea 2 cheaters playinh against each other
if it weren't for Kaiji he would still be thinking he can make a comeback anytime soon
Muraoka keeping his act from start to finish is also kinda beasting
sick
the author also put out a hint about them betraying
yea he's a real snake <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
oh btw, tell me how you feel when it reach the turning point <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Make more sense tho

my man just fucking zoned out
i mean even after he found the missing pieces
yea and he would be too stressful to even focus on the match
<a:awaree:1087729643970371714>
losing a San Ankou
he would probably kill himself ngl
like normal human would react the same way he did
yea that part where he messed up also too relatable <a:Aware:889021591776817172>
i just finished the 40M round
oh i just ask based on my pace <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
did Kaiji mess up yet? <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>

alright i just finished writing it down
no it's peak exciting
Tai i know you're excited but you're missing the entire point of 17 steps
not normal Mahjong
that's the game keilo want to know
no you start with Riichi
<a:Aware:889021591776817172>
yea he is a real snake
Kaiji actually got grieved there so fucking hard
yea it's only a 3 4 wait
from 1m to 10m in 30 chapters
it's actually crazy how fast the stake skyrocket
<:5Head:816797515571396638>
thots on this comp?

fucking lit
<:BatChest:889018352029286421>
imagine during Worlds and someone hit Chosen TF at lv 7
i think it's better yea, reduce the variance
and being able to hit 4 cost Chosen is a huge deal this set
you can't hit 4 cost Chosen at lv 7
but it's the Chosen odd
oh i mean the odd doesn't better by a large margin
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
You’re 100% going 8th
Yea if you stuck at lv 7
cause you can't hit Chosen 4 cost at lv 7
but now you have to greed for lv 8 in set 10
you would just die
there is no way you greed for lv 8
you always roll on 7 back in set 4
with augments and stuffs
part of the problem is probably how easy it is to go lv 8/9 now too
like hitting 3* 4 cost or even 5 cost during set 4 was omega impossible
oh it's extremely hard to do so
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
it might be your only 2* frontline too
so if you want to go 3* 4 cost you need to think really hard on selling your Chosen
but you can't hit another Chosen if you already have Chosen on your board
Chosen was normal pool size
this set look really sus
yea idk, they are probably trying it out <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
He’s a great antagonist
Someone that really fucking love high stake gamble

<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
Yea take it slow
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Yea that’s niche situation
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
And it’s still intense
Simplify Mahjong that much
Fukumoto is actually a beast
Yea that’s the basic
And 3rd + 4th pay the money
So after 1 set the one with most and 2nd points win
They change seat after each round
Normal mahjong i mean
Cause Mahjong contain 4 rounds each set
When you Ron the value of Fu will generate more points
And Fu is value of melds or waits
But Han is the value of your hand
Same with Han
So a hand in 17 steps require at least 5 Han or above
5 Han is called Mangan
Han is the core of 17 steps
Only Han
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Mangan is 5 or above
Cause 1 of the rule is your hand must be Mangan above
Yea not exactly scoring but the Riichi hand
She doesn’t know 50% people search Mahjong tutorial to read Akagi and Kaiji
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
The most gambling way to play Mahjong
You can’t do anything but risk yourself to win
That’s why Prez call it Landmine Mahjong
Only win by Ron
Yea you can’t Kong
Advanced Poker
Yea it’s a game of luck, skill and courage
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
The like of Saki is not even close to how intense Akagi is
And it go absolute crazy
Yea Fukumoto’s most famous works are a 3 part series about deathmatch Mahjong
The simpliest type of Mahjong
You can only win through Riichi in 17 steps
Yea stuff like Tsumo, Pinfu also don’t matter <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
Yea they’re always in riichi

<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
like all Umas call Negators as Vessel of rules
i still wonder what do they mean by Vessel
Always <:barack:1154719413682057306>
aka Copium
she would be the vessel of Back
i mean the Uma that her ability were born from
it's never <:joever:1137708390693470270>
no matter what they will always back
so her counter is just copium, no?
i think she just put them in a place and they can't go back
just <:barack:1154719413682057306> ?
what do they even do
Back?
what kind of rule that born Unback
now that i think about it <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
yea only Andy know about Unhealthy
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
the one next to Juiz is Ruin
Chapter 168
too kind
but she is kind
which is unnecessary imo
yea Fuuko also want to save Ruin
If it’s Top we’re going to Brazil
Wonder who is next
Maybe tmr Pain show up and kill 1 of them
Never know what will happen tmr
Give Rip, Leila and Latla their happy ending
But i think it’s Fuuko idea
<a:owono:1139655504088535120>
But srs tho, what will happened if Yusai use Undraw while doing the deed
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
An eternal promise
Yea probably
It’s like asking what will happened if Yusai use Undraw on her husband
But dude just have to ask “what happened if Rip use Unrepairable on their vagina”
Oh Rip can decide if it can heal or not
Most sane UDUL redditor
Yea they have been through so much
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
Rip is proposing to both
Yea it’s a harem ending
Do you think they will pull a 3some on their first night
UDUL subreddit
<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492>
How can a manga be this peak
It’s so fucking peak
Cause the manga are getting more known
Probably only recently
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
Only 1 page, you down?
But it’s also peak
UDUL new chapter
I got spoiled again
<@148145559897636865> holy shit
Cause you will know if you want to build Shiv or Morello on stage 2 or bot
It’s really important to realize these things
Sona, Ashe, Silco
Yea
And the best Shiv holder is a 4 cost
There is no good Morello holder
And i realized 1 thing
I saw all of robin’s stream
<@148145559897636865> 
How’s the cooking going
im watching the stream and not understand shit <a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
🎷
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
You get punished for playing the game
It’s fucked
And that is the J4 you need to 2*
Then what happened if you hit Chosen J4 when you already have 2* Chosen Fiora
But if Chosen were here you would want Chosen Mordekaiser or Fiora instead
The most broken 4 cost
Like J4 this set for example
Yea but he didn’t think about 4 cost
if you already have Headliner then you can't buy another one even if you need that unit to star up
<@148145559897636865> this one will definitely be a problem
oh look more balanced than Stand United <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:dongerk:1061701790640373861>
yea Lulu was budget Yuumi
you actually go 8th for playing flex
which is sus af
set 9 is literally just flowchart TFT from start to finish
yea i don't dislike flowchart TFT, but there should be an option to win with playing flex
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
check out peak TFT
<@148145559897636865> 
that is so fucking cool
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
Obliterate
hero augment
4 lasers on 4-1
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
fucking what man
Big Data
hero augment
3 lasers on 3-1
8.5 felt even worse ngl
no counterplay, no nothing
or some fuckers hit 3* Yuumi and your game is over
what kind of TFT is that
5 streak into neutral, gotta tailor your board on 3-1 or else your game is fucked
there is no way it could be worse than Hero
set 9 and 9.5 over all i think is fine
but in low elo people can wait until stage 5 and they will never get punished
you would just die from bleeding out
can't just wait for BIS
but TF you have to see what line you're going too and know what items to slame
cause Urf enable flowchart TFT, you commit since 2-1, no need to cook
but casuals think opposite
and TF is actually the hardest
also do you know that Urf is fucking easy to play in challenger elo <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
he would make like 1000 mistakes at least
like sure there is always RNG aspect in TFT but if a challenger players do VOD review on that person
the reason why casuals or even half-ass comeptitive hate it is because they always blame it on RNG
instead of flowchart TFT
it's the only mechanic that enable you creating flex boards
yea it's so fucking good
<:PepeLaugh:1114108889198231552>
the best mechanic of TFT
this is what casuals think about Chosen
<@148145559897636865>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
if Chinese doesn't invade <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
instead of you know, saving enough to fucking get out
basically every 2 weeks dude bought a ticket and go back to surface for 1-3 days, have a luxury meal and then comeback
in his prequel he spent like a lot of money every now and then
the guy is actually addicted to being stuck in underground
oh in his prequel he's actually not, he is the squad leader cause he was there longest and bribe the blacksuit
<:sajj:1067071714518892584>
yea but being stuck in underground and losing all the money you saving for is kinda
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
cause yk, they fucking got destroyed after meeting Kaiji
their prequel
yea Ootsuki is famous for being someone that talk big and do nothing <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
each have their own spin-off when each part ended
Ootsuki is the ice cold beer guy
oh btw, do you know that Tonegawa, Ichijou and Ootsuki are popular characters in Kaiji <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
They’re special rules
Probably same case with Seal after i think it through
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
Andy is sealing the Sun and Move just open a portal to it just like that
isn't Move a little too strong for someone not a Master Rule
now that i think about it
do you think mort will commit suicide on scene if he has to do B-patch
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
cause they can't think outside of the box
but bad players hate it
like it's actually so fucking good
but Chosen was peak flex of TFT
so new gimmick in set 10 is basically a more nightmare Chosen
it's Chosen lite, instead of couting x2 trait it will you give a leader passive
<a:jamm:1113492000126271548>
oh i didn't see that one
but at least it will have more players than 9.5 rn
this one will definitely turn out to be balanced nightmare
yea it's Chosen + Debonair
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
you see what im saying?
this one is 5.5 main color them
even pro love 4.0 and 6.0
yea not even casual
this kind of color
cause they use the Academia's theme
but everyone love 6.0
and while 6.0 was good, it's nowhere near as good as 5.5
but everyone hate it cause the color theme is dark
5.5 was the most balanced set they ever created
i actually think aesthestic can carry a set
<a:duckJAM:1088508677713035356>
still feel like this set would still have same problems
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
You might be onto sth
Me
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
Just gonna end up as losing girl
Probably not
Like gaslighting them
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
Might come for Taiki’s parents first
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
gonna go full Karen in 3 chapters
what if the new girl is actually a menace and she put on the good girl facade
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
and lil miss appear to either mess up their relationship or boost it further
lil bro appear to show how much of a beast Taiki is in case readers forgot
i don't even think these 2 new valks are necessary, so far they only act as plot holder
like Do not worry mom, dad. I always have protections in my wallet
cook up a reason
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
just talk it out
it would feel dumb
yea if they ever broke up because Taiki's parents found out
this guy keep hinting this every chapters
but who let him into the kitchen tho
not everything will be positive and not everything will be negative
yea the author always cook when it come to action and consequence
Andy is chilling on the sun so at best he could only help them 1 minute each fight and other Master Rules won't be that easy to beat
and not just full of plot armor
even though we know this loop is definitely be the Ultimate Happy Ending, their struggles will still feel real
the stake is also higher too <:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
when 1st rule said he would answer anything ,he actually answer anything even if it's a crucial info
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
also we know now that they also need to play by rules
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
but Fuuko is actually Unhinged, 1 thing go wrong and she would fucking die
it would make everything less interesting
and Fuuko also knew Move wouldn't let her die
1st rule did say he really doesn't want Fuuko to act reckless like that cause it might ruin the show
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
the author went into the kitchen again
tell me when you finish Blue Box new chapter <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
no need to hear them <a:peepoTalk:888968806481928212>
yea 2 days from now
Set10 is currently scheduled to release on live patch 13.23 (Tues, Nov 21st) and on PBE 2 weeks ahead (Nov 7th)
yea could be Justice too <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
no need to hear the yapping
oh i stop watching, PBE coming out soon <a:peepoTalk:888968806481928212>
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
oh so just even out
what the hell is that
Paganini <:BatChest:1113620829578727444>
best mechanic is back
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
<:Wokege:859195243030904860>
Fair vs Unfair
his shoes has the same accessories with Billy
oh and this guy is Fair
how many blood pressure does he need for a finger to pull that off
Andy just shot a fucking finger from 148.33 million km away
this guy is more fit to be Death
because Race hate human
no wonder human hate each other
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
if Race hate human does it make him a racist
and this guy is definitely Race
4th rule is Luck
so 1st rule might not be Death <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
yea and so far only Master Rules have human form
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
what rules come by pair
their moles can't be coincidence
1st Rule and 2nd Rule are Brother and Sister
there is sth interesting
did you see their designs in latest chapter
Sick, Pain and Meaning
yea should be
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
they didn't change anything major but the director removing the crowd in episode 1 where Fuuko met Andy and the empty bar in latest episode doesn't feel right
i don't like the anime that much <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
<a:pepenarutorun:1081435087901556827>
it's time for peak fiction
Oh, no, i just talking in general with Kaiji’s mindset
<:PauseChamp:889033551276830770>
A surprised guest
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
When he show up is when the stake getting higher
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
But the thrill was still off the chart
When i first reas P3 i didn’t know shit about Mahjong
<:Evilge:1113819647381356576>
but you can still look up Mahjong Tutorial tho if you're interest in it
he will keep diving into Teiai's den because only them running underground casino with scumbag manager
he is far beyond helping
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
yea he actually addicted to the thrill, he was trying to be normal in chapter 1 but it doesn't cut out for him
<:Evilge:1113819647381356576>
real gamble
it's a game of luck and instinct
like Kaiji said, it's not a game of skill
they're playing rock paper scissors with a lot of steps
cause they're still not playing real Mahjong
it should be enough <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
You will love it when you start it
God rereading P3, i remember how much of a good for nothing Kaiji actually is
that Shangrila Frontier wasn't bad but it make me feel uncomfortable
i will read the rest online but i need to cooldown first
in Japanese tho, kinda beasting <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
yea i have Kaiji part 3 from vol.1 to vol.5
i will just reread Kaiji part 3 first, i need to remember some details too
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
after this game manga i just finished, i will probably need a real manga to cooldown first before i start Dandandan
with how big Yugioh community is
probably like 1 day
simple enough to get into and hard enough to play competitively
Fusion era was so good
oh yea, it was Fusion -> Synchro -> XYZ -> Pendulum -> Link <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
i just remember i quit after XYZ
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
can't remember
oh is it
!vanish
when they introduce Synchro next season im just like
even XYZ was already too much for me
i quit competitive YugiOh during XYZ era
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
the hell is that
Link, Synchro and Pendulumn
<:Oldge:951410911220989983>
i think Yugioh is fun but their mechanic is not fit for me
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
like a normie
i only play Yugioh, HS and MTG
i didn't look into it so idk, unfortunately <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
they have physical version too, doing really well
but yea they're good, a decent community too honestly, especially the Marvel one
yea they're all new generation
Marvel Mission Arena, One Piece TCG, Vanguard, MHA
oh there are actually a good amount of it now
that is after i work my ass off in the neighborhood
i can only buy 2 packs per expansion
but it was too fucking expensive back then for a kid <:ApuCry:969982697252466789>
the joy of opening new expansion pack is the best part
yea playing TCG irl is the best
like he actually live in that era so he know about all the meta from 1998 to the current
the author actually live through it is the best part
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263> sick even
actual sick
like the couple know each other through MTG and rival with each other
mix with romcom
it's actually a good manga about card game
about MTG
oh there is one
probably no if you think about it <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
bro do you know how to gaming
they don't fucking share info
also
that's how we gaming
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
like there would be at least thousand people trying stupid shit everyday
does the author even know how game community work
the thing pissed me off the most is the setup where the MC i will pick all this useless skills that no one ever think of or try and it randomly become the most OP combination ever
which is disgusting if you ask me
like most game manga out there are just I want to write an Isekai but it will have too many competitors so i will write a VR genre instead
i just read those for fun honestly but not exactly fun either <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
i probably won't recommend it <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
it was okay, although a lot of game elements are still there, it's still just your typical VR but actually another world kind of work
i finished Shangrila Frontier <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
the author gonna cook
well time to wait until Sunday <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
do you think the author will design them that way?
but Sex in this angle both look like man and woman
but he is hot blonde now
yea i thought he was looking like Andy
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
but instead of Andy shooting his fingers, it's Fuuko now
through a crack that also made by Move
from when Andy and Fuuko first entered Union
oh nothing really special going on, just the callback
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
you down?
but it was peak
oh it's only 1 page
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
i forgot to be upset
it was so fucking peak
yea Sunday
i was supposed to be upset but it's so fucking peak
<:ApuCry:969982697252466789>
bro i just got spoiled of UDUL new chapter
From <:joever:1137708390693470270> to <:barack:1154719413682057306>
Is that 2 parts of same title
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Which one
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
But apparently it’s a novel
My friend recommened it last week so im catching up the manga
Still has cooldown, timing and mechanic
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
A manga about VR game, solid read so far, the author doesn’t forget all game elements like other works out there
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
Probably this weekend when i finished Shangrila Frontier
but do not worry, it's easy to understand what the hell is going on once you get the hang of it<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
oh i just checked and no BR translation for P2 onward
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
idk if BR translation do the same
but in English translation they do their best to explain the rules
like you also don't need to know all textbook play of Poker to feel the intensity of it
my advice is that ignore everything you don't understand, just the character expression and dialogues are enough to tell you what is going on <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
the night is young
so just take a break and take it slow for P3 <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
the first 2 rounds of the game
but P3 can be quite hard to follow
and P5 is peak
yea P3 and P5 are real gamble <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
sound about right
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
personally i would rank each part of Kaiji like this:
-P1: the start of it all, solid survival game
-P2: race against time, half gambling and half heist
-P3: real gambling
-P4: clash of different ideology
-P5: peak gambling
I like both honestly
It does make it more intense
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
And P3 is the opposite
Yea P2 feel turbo short
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
even though same amount of chapters
P3 feel extremely long tho
yea just chill
the main game of P3, i can't say it's an interesting game but it does show what it mean to gamble <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
or else he gonna kill Asmodeus in the cruelest way possible
i hope Imuri get Father back
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
oh did you read the Exorcist fall in love new chapter
yea, man just can't help it <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
and Kaiji still got rat'ed by Endou <:o7:1147223647946293289>
yea, he did give up near the end <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
at the end of the day, it's still 50% preparations and 50% luck
even Kaiji almost lost to the final trick
yea normal people like Sakazaki never stand a chance against rigged games
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
the wind barrier is Unfair af
the machine is also full of rigged features
bro sink a whole building just to win an oversized  Pachinko
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
yea it's actually possible, especially in the 90s on JP
the 2nd trick is smurfing and the 3rd trick is actually crazy
can't blame the guy
he got played by Kaiji really hard tho <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
Or this is who he really is
Do you think Kaiji ever miss being normal
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
but you can't just Undead
yea people will eventually forget
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
imagine bud losing 700 mil
and gone for good
Tonegawa only lost 100 mil
like Tonegawa
losing Teiai's money and Hyodo will fuck him up for good
i mean he physically can't anw
yea Ichijou won't back down
Endou got gaslight real deep to follow his plans
all of his plans
the 2nd and 3rd trick is also gambling af <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
aka Japanese
yea only people play Pachinko realized it
when he cameback at the Casino to gather more info
let me check again
when Kaiji look at the tool before he got fucked up
oh that one, apparently only people that play Pachinko in JP can guess that
all of his plans are literally gambling
yea at the core of it all
he managed to gather ton of info within 2 weeks
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
show the difference between a normal person buying lottery - Sakazaki and a gambler like Kaiji
the fight with Bog is really interesting imo
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
man is lost
he would wait for another chance again
cause he's a gambler at heart
he wouldn't even off himself
the sad part is that even if he lose right here and goes back to underground
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
he was just a good for nothing 200 chapters ago
isn't that kinda messed up, if you think about
Kaiji is so fucking used to cut parts of his body
but idk, probably not
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
the pain does linger
fuck him up <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
chill <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
can you match Aqua with lv 99 cooking?
what's that
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
although it's like 50% to screw up in every single part of his plan
50%? Bet
yea he is true gambler <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
like if Kaiji doesn't come and beg him for a spot he probably think Kaiji as trash
Hyodo has king syndrome after all
i think probably no <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
at the most crucial moment of his life, Kaiji always come out on top
maybe Teiai no.2 even
gaslight Endou into lending him 60mil Yen
he could have became a professional scammer
you know if Kaiji is just 30% more of a bad person
oh just met Endou
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
bro fuck Kaiji up real good
<a:mojjcheck:1113492691288871063>
yea his name is Ichijou
<:IHaveAQuestion:1146075320332603492> Did Ichijou fuck Kaiji's fingernails up yet
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
they make out as soon as everyone left
and the time skip is 5 years
also Alpha and Hifumi is 4 years old
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
like 50 chapters ago he was still a shonen teen
it's pretty chill when seeing Taiyo is an actual dad now
not a beasting manga or anything, just chill
it's pretty chill
oh have you read this one
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
Like a beast she is
She just genderbend them and Fuuko will grope Andy’s chest?
I wonder how the fight with Sex will go
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
And they have to rely on Remember
But then 1 of the upper Master Rules show up and fucking smoke them
Yea i don’t think they will accept it at first
That’s the call for Remember
They’re still young and inexperience with their powers
Also 1 of the things i love in this chapter is how effective their attacks become when Andy tell them how to do it
Nico already losing his shit when he saw Move’s ability
Now dude look like a giant dice
Yea dude look like a fucking Space beast when he first show up
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
He is Unmove after all
No wonder Chikara is a beast
On theory it does make sense tho
You think so?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Artifacts are still creations of God
At the end of the day
It does make the cast feel more alive tho
<:sad:1117142667936137348>
But probably not
I thought for sure this guy is on Human side like Clothy
Yea when lil guy show up with Fuuko at the start
His ability is so broken
Like i was so used to see little guy helping Union
But it kinda surprised me to see Move ‘s rift
Master Rules are just born soonest and have immense power
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
Burn too
Like Info and Spoil
I think some rules does get spawn without needing to be a penalty
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
That’s probably what happened to Victor
I think it work this way, when a Negator ability were born, if Sun didn’t bestow it to anyone, it will eventually slip out and find an owner
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Just normal Uma
Doesn’t need to be Master Rules, Luck and Justice i mean
Negators are definitely dangerous to them cause it contain possibility
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Tbh at the end of the day, i have to say, Sun and Luna still playing the game fair
Yea they’re also Uma, just more beasting than normal
All the Uma did call them Vessel of Rules
When an Uma is formed, a Negator also got formed from that Rule
It’s probably like both sides of a coin
Negator is definitely sth that both Sun and Luna didn’t plan
Sun bet on Rules and created Umas
<a:classic:1058849393370992650>
Kinda a homie if she didn’t sit there doing nothing
Luna leave it all to luck
Like missions and rewards
Yea it’s all random i think
He did put Unknown in G-pen
But i think Sun also know what’s going on
A creation of Luna so Luna did in charge of it for the most parts
It’s from Apocalypse
Sick did say him confront Negators was also a quest
So 10th, 9th and 8th is still Sick, Pain and Meaning
So he is still Meaning
8th is reading a book
He is in half
10th
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
or wait, Sex
and 3rd rule is probably Genes
1st rule is definitely Death
so Andy dissapearing might have sth to do with him
look really close to Andy
the 1st seat of Master Rules
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
Did you read it
:peepohigh:
how can the author keep getting higher
the chapter is so good
<@148145559897636865>
is <a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
bro UDUL new chapter
a rigged lottery on top of that
he is buying a lottery and hope it work out
yea he is not gambling <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Bud lack information
Sakazaki’s plan is not bad but he doesn’t have backup plan
Bud banking his future on a rigged machine
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
Sakazaki sacrifice first
Oh yeah 1st round
<a:Nessie:1164016962595209306>
Did you finish 1st round of Bog
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
Can you do this irl with Agility 99
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Kaiji saw his 2 buds and know this is the game
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
Fucking beast
You need to play rigged games, with scammers to be able to exploit the rules too
Gambling under fair rules won’t net you anything
He definitely realized it during the 2nd round of Ceelo
Btw i really love this realization of him
and make it last 130+ chapters
the author cook up some of the most simple games as possible
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
yea except for P1, from P2 to P5, they only play 1 game per part
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
Bro play Pachinko for 60 chapters
The game in P2 is definitely going crazy
so like, at the end of the day, he didn't lose trust yet
<:feelsstrongman:1079371140826419270>
offer their life to save him
someone saved him
but when it matter the most
like he was betrayed in the 1st game of P1 <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
where his instinct helping him survive
he was as normal as it can be and got driven into desperate situation
in the end, he is not a cold heart gambler
but honestly,i can understand why he act like that
<:lilidrink:641644189196615680>
a free ice cold can of beer
man probably putting too much faith in the one gave him free beer <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
oh that one yea, feel a little weird
with that mindset he would just die so a mental reset is important for him
he was deadass convinced he would win if he were to have a 2nd chance against Hyodo
i think it's a good point for Kaiji being impatient at start of P2
<a:pepenarutorun:1081435087901556827>
and into the main game
for a small fry, a simple trick do the work
but overall i think the Ceelo game's ending is great, cause the dude is only a small fry compare to Kaiji, he doesn't need to show how much of a beast he is to destroy him <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
yea some rules the author only put it there for safety purpose <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
but can't really expect a mob to win against Kaiji anw
if he know Kaiji is gambling in there
yea in a sense, Tonegawa2 show up in the jail because he was definitely feeling unease
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
Tonegawa would never win against Kaiji even if they play again for 100 times
in the crucial moment, you need to be able to win
if you are Teiai no.2
i think that's what make Hyodo terrified
that's why Hyodo fuck him up
yea he is the kind of people that only know how to beat the weak
he acknowledge Kaiji
Tonegawa2 is more dangerous than Tonegawa1 <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
But the tension to set it up between them is crazy
Yea both the trick and his counter are all so simple
the main game of P2 is a really interesting one
he should get out of the jail by now <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
can you blame him?
those chicken look really delicious tho
me too
really easy to be addicted
through gambling
can't really blame him tho, he experienced the highest thrill of his life
<a:GAMBAADDICT:1088508671144759358>
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
Just because he wanted to drink a can of beer
Bud was getting baited tho
Yea it’s all simple tricks
Did you get to the 1st round of Ceelo yet
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
Isn’t tell them to work overtime the same as tell them to kill yourself
working environment is also poor af
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
not cool
like bro, illegal human labor
the author always start a new season with showing how messed up Teiai is
<:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
47 to be exact
it last for like 40 chapters
this undeground jail is just an appetizer
yea bud was eating an even better snack than me
bro having a party while in debt
he went beyond your expectation tho
bro that part was so good
bro think he is HIm
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
yea he really is pathetic right
did you start Kaiji yet <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
Wait what
:farming:
matching with them without Unfair yet
but Billy was going crazy
<:icant:1162065269611565116>
Billy the Blind
you know
oh don't forget that Sean was trying to use Unseen on Billy
and she is not stopping either
she came so far <:Life:1089579344508223558>
yea 134 chapters
she has overcame so many things to be who she is
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
yea Fuuko has the craziest character development among all heroines
need to wait for the author to cook about it
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
also Death
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
iamgine what happened if Sun didn't pick Sex as master rule
someone must be kicked for Galaxy to get in the ranking
like Sun just pick 10 rules that he thought would be fun to be Master Rules
but each loop Master Rules can be different according to Apocalypse <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Ruin mentioned it
Sick, Pain, Meaning and Galaxy
we already knew 4 of them<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
seem like Luck is also part of Master Rules
also author hint again about Luck and Death in latest chapter <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
rule > gift
but Untrust overwritten it
her foresight predict 100% the event
yea the sick part is that
it's like a natural born gift
also after new chapter, i only realized that Latla's fortune telling is not a negation ability
but if you read it in 1 go to this point it's actually amazing how much he set up everything
it's only a 8
yea if you read it before 101st loop happened
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
imagine Andy already offscreened Pain
unless Andy already offscreen the dude
next should be Pain <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Sick got a W H <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>  treatment
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
Latla also deserved happiness
do you think Rip will marry both of them in this timeline?
also Creed with weapon made from Unbreakable and Nico's technology is one hell of a boost
<:FeelsStrongMan:1015766690568618066>
it actually moved me when i saw this page
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
when Summer died and Shen keep covering Miu's eyes back and forth to make Apocalypse spill everything
yea bud is actually funny
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
that plan is actually amazingly smart
also keep using Apocalypse as a time machine
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
except Feng
and others only support her
Color did get killed by Fuuko
im not sure about this one
just the participant need to deal the finish blow
other negators can still do quest right? <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
only 4 seats iirc
i don't think so <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
they don't want her to burden everything
she wants to protect them so they also want to protect her <:Life:1089579344508223558>
but not everyone can leave her alone like that
so that make her purpose become giving everyone a happy ending
yea she saw how they can end up when fighting with Umas in previous loop
from a W H <:omegalul:1030461063197626409> to Him
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
bro is actually Him
i love how Sean literally showing up from behind and tell Chikara everything
oh you already finished Chikara's arc
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
if you think about it
Gina scaring Nico with Ghost's outfit is dark af
so is Sean
Chikara show up like 20 years too soon
tragic events would still happen
like if Fuuko didn't have G-pen
but it's crazy how the timeline of this new loop work
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
strongest human
bud getting tricked into babysit 2 orphans and now has to teach highschool kids
it's funny to see Feng keep getting tricked <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
but now instead of with Andy, she want to be Fuuko No.2 instead
Gina still has that obsessed vibe
they just encounter a different outcome from the previous self
but at the core of it all, they're still themselves
<:o7:1147223647946293289>
and now he is becoming Him
back in previous loop, he was already too selfish to expand his power
and it actually make sense too
and just in previous loop dude was nobody
Sean got one hell of character development
this loop show so much love for all the minor characters <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
don't know what is he cooking
yea he is not back yet
so she hasn't came to Juiz yet mean her role is not yet to come
Fuuko already knew about every key info of this loop <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>
but Unjustice wouldn't activate anytime soon
she was probably already born
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
and Gina forcing Sean to expand his power to sneak her into space with him is funny too
what a Negator need wasn't any intense physical training, they just need to expand their imagination with a strong heart
and young Gina traininig arc make sense, author already set it up before
she just died early because she was broken and for the plot to move
yea i love how author admit her power is strong af too
like his screentime is literally Andy atp
also i like how the focus characters of this new loop is Nico
yea he definitely planning on sth but he still has to do it by rules so he probably waiting
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
hence Untell negate it
so when he blocked the bullet, his point was to communicate with Billy through the action of getting wound up
i think the key is communication, people use words, movements, facial expression to communicate
you did it Sun
great job man
during middle of a war
and blessed him with Untell
God was <:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
if you think about it
this one is scary as hell
oh wait did you get to Billy's arc yet <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
Unseen, Unchange, Untell
now we even start learning about them
it actually keep getting better, all the minor characters from previous loop
this loop is peak fiction <a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
how are are you <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
1st loop is over
yea chill, chew it in <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
but he cook
the author could have speed run it with Remember
it's so fucking great for absolute no reason
this loop Fuuko is aiming for the ultimate happy ending
she just happened to bet on humanity
yea in the end they both view human as toys
literal chill
this panel is chill
Actual peak fiction
Keep getting better
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Like using 1 of his hair to play with ants
But isn’t it crazy that the one they fought was just an avatar of Sun
Yea eventually
Poor lil girl
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
Unback was also burnt to death
Boy still crawling his way to stop Sun
And now even when he lost his left side
Yea Chikara started out as normal as it can be
Chikara throwing his body to the ground hoping to stop Sun for even 0.1 second
The double pages when everyone tried to buy time last minute was sick
<:peepoSit:1009060765887647846>
Always
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
I think both are jerk
Playing a new one feel fresh yea
Like when you have been playing this character for 100 times
Oh yea that part, i think just cause it’s more fun
in the 1st chapter she show up yea <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
no way yea <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
but the author is really good at cooking
yea unless it's just for gag
it move me to tears when Andy said It's looping time and loop entire Earth
chill <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
yea if Andy wasn't there when Fuuko suicide, Unluck will never be discovered
because she didn't have Andy
all other loops before, Fuuko died by committing suicide
if you think about it
the strange thing of this loop is Andy and Fuuko's meeting
not Anno, tell me when you finish the chat between Juiz and Andy + Fuuko <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
that's why it went chaotic
also in this loop, something strange happened
yea in this loop they found hope <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
definitely bored
Bud be like: All right, it was fun but wrap it up, im bored
and God even showing he lost his patience for this loop so he also speed up the time flow too
<a:Timeout:1157060847894544495>
yea it was rigged
rewards and penalties doesn't really hold any meaning, they're just part of the show
like putting a show together for God's entertaiment
on the side note, at the start of this arc, i really like when Apocalypse make it clear to Fuuko that the missions are just for fun <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
even after Billy destroyed him with logic
his delusional is definitely can't be ruined
can't think of it as my body part can't be undecreased
like same case with Undecrease when he lost his hand <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
oh i don't think he can do that, he is definitely a self targeting type
yea like his body, his dream, his purpose
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
yea Ruin doesn't really regenerate, more like his body got put back together
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
Ruin i mean
he is just part of Death if you think about it
yea lil bro is just delusional
yea Billy destroy Ruin with logic
Sharing life force with them
He fused with them
Blood and Shadow
Oh it’s umas
Yea his imagination is still small
I see <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Yea but also like Andy said, a power must be polished by the owner. copying can only come so far
The Union memebrs just met Juiz before they went rouge
Everyone in this loop has been broken to the point of no return
Yea it fullfilled its purpose
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Not yet, the best part of the loop is the end of it
Part of his fun
But i think he gave her Unsleep to mess Nico’s up
God is lowkey Unhinged
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
Then god give her Unsleep
She was doing her uni research and want to sleep a lil bit
Not big spoiler so i will just spoil it anw
Oh it’s not that fucked up
You can definitely kill someone with it
Great power man
But body still got exhausted
The ability to not to sleep
Ichico has Unsleep
Yea it’s for fun
About his wife dying face, when her body got cold, her dying breath and everything
Every seconds he lives he remember about it
But it’s the torture 24/7
Yea the guilt is not as much
Yea next is Nico
The next one is also fucked up
While trying to save the love of your life
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
But imagine being a prodigy in surgery and got blessed with Unrepair
Yea even tho Rip’s killcount is only 1
It’s so great i can reread it 69 times and still amazed by how good it is
You’re getting close to the greatest part of this loop
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
I don’t know if the order hold any meaning or just randomly
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
So in that order Pain and Meaning is 8th and 9th
Sick is apparenrly the 10th rule
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Oh btw keilo, did you catch it when Ruin mention Master Rules’s names
strongest human <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
Feng is actually built diff
bro is where he is now because of his training and martial arts
but outside of that he is just that strong
his body will always be in his prime
he won't be affected by aging by any mean
Feng is Unfade
also this info is from extra chapters cause the author thought it was good to make it clear <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
like chill, your killcount is only 1
yea we saw his flashback a lot <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
wicked sick
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
there was no Galaxy but there is Moon and Sun
yea something that has always been there watching over everyone
<:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
yea the author did
isn't that sick?
in fact they already hinted God's identity in chapter 5
like he has always been watching
yea he actually <:binocularr:1127248041729065062>
Shen awaken Untruth and making his body doing the opposite
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
like their abilities awaken at the exact moment that will fuck their lives up
and everyone's backstory just show how much of a jerk God is
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
when Fuuko decided to become Billy's hostage, she only asked Andy to trust her and Andy did
also Andy's too
in the Four Seasons arc, i really like Fuuko's development  <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<a:Timeout:1157060847894544495>
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
jack of all trades
God will do this irl <a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
God still has to do it by the rules
but you know it's actually a good thing that even when he wanted to mess thing up
The original power: create stuffs
The reward power: info of this loop
The dick move: Unknown
yea the pen contain 3 powers because God wanted to be a dick <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
he is 48 now
to begin with Unno appearance didn't fit with Akira's age
<:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
but i think it's moreso the God doing it to prevent Akira from interfere further
the author explain the pen breaking down because of energy exhaustion
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
so Akira created Unno and Unno can keep using that pen to create different stuffs
it's actually sick when you think about it, you can only manifest 1 thing at a time with G-pen
Anno was just his double
oh he is 100% alive
Good one
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Yea he is legally blind, only recover his eyesight after taking Undead
Kinda cracked for a human to achieve what he was lying about
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Now that i think about it, Billy was lying about his ability so whenever he had to use his make up ability in front of others, it’s his pure skill that make it happen
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
like she doesn't think it's weird or wrong to sit like that with Andy
yea but then she was sitting like that the whole time too when they're listening
Fuuko just sit on his lap like it's the default
i love little moments like this <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
yea at first Andy look like a pervert but now their chemistry is actually top notch
sick story <a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
yea they come to term after the ediot let the author try out what he wanted
and Unavoidable got shot down in 1 panel <a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
Gina died because the plot need her to die
oh i only mean the first 8 chapters
the author waste no time for meaningless stuff
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
oh the fight isn't long, it's finish in the next chapter
oh you're not finished the fight with Autumn yet?
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
and some during 125-133
she has some screentime during chapter 54-56 iirc
with Victor
yea poor girl trying to do everything alone <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
but also keeping secrets too
i think
she was giving example <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
just based on the fact that we haven't even seen them yet
oh i think Death and Sex are definitely one of them
like 10 rules that have always been exist and be a part of human evolution
like Nirvana to Red Lotus
and 10 master rules that rule over others
oh this one is a spoiler from the recent chapter but each loop always have a fixed set of rules
like if you want to change an important anchor of event, you need to change it at the right moment
so Anno was certain he should be the only one doing it
but if that happened God might interfere again
Fuuko was supposed to be dead during the fight with Autumn so Anno writing it out mean others will become aware of it and try to change it
oh my read on is more straightforward, those 3 arcs contain info that shouldn't be known except for everyone already involved
and Negators ability are from those rules even if exist on Earth or not
like for God, there are a set of fixed rules waiting to be released into Earth
my thought on this is that Negator are above rules <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
but it's 101 loops
oh i don't know if this is a huge spoiler or no
yea they will explain it around chapter 54 i believe
bro probably Unalive himself
like locations of Unrepair and Unburn, great job bro, now what
yea the rewards are not even a real reward if you are 1 step behind <:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
that's actually sick
also the consequence of Negators around the world became easy to locate them <a:worryrun:998945496318087198>
oh this one is also a sick detail too <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
bro even if you're Undead, it's scientifically impossible
like when Victor used Deadline to wipe out the city in the book
it's fine to have cartoonish abilities imo
yea Negators are mean to bend the rules to their own version <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
if you kill the wrong Uma, it would make Earth become uninhabitable
yea isn't it kinda crazy if you think about it
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
Andy was like: Wait i thought i already killed Magma
Fuuko: Don't sweat the details
but when Fuuko kiss him some chapters later, Magma from the underground shoot straight to Andy
Andy later on kill Magma so Magma cease to exist
this one is spoiler but not a big deal
there are some other instances where Unluck can also defy the non-existing rule too <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
this one contain spoiler so i can't do anything about it <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
yea people still call them meteorites without the exist of Galaxy  <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
<a:classic:1058849393370992650>
yea it's actually smart, Galaxy wasn't exist before so the meteorites were just part of the old Earth
<:Life:1089579344508223558>
but Gina was already broken to the point of just wanting to rest
Unchange was one hell of a power
yea the amount of wordplay in this manga are off the chart
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
that's why Autumn's ability was turning people into book
also do you know that in Japanese, they have an idiom 読書の秋 = Fall is the best season for reading
<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
there are a lot of other interesting details but it contain spoilers
god writing Kanji is too fucking hard on mobile <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Tatiana = Untouchable, Tatiana =タチア= tachiana, similar to touchable =タッチャブル = tatchaburu

Chikara Shigeno = Unmove – Shigeno = 重野 Chikara = 力 contains 重 and 力, when you put then into the same kanji 動 you get the kanji for move
Shen is a Chinese name but if a Japanese read it, they will read it as Shin = Truth
a lot of it is based on how Japanese read it <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
and Fukō is misfortune
Fuuko read as Fūko and sound similar to Fukō
but only up until Unknown talk about his penname that i realized all character's names hint at their power <a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
<:ICANTTAKETHISANYMORE:1154037205082320947>
Just grab the phone and point a gun point-blank to a normal person
A good detail i like about this arc was how quick Fuko act when Unknown contact the editor
btw, i was asking how do you feel when Juiz reveal about the loop <:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
is actually too fucking cool consider their ability is literally just regeneration
oh and the fight between Andy and Victor
it show how petty God is
i really like Unknown backstory and how he struggle against it <:peepothink:1160193928834842684>
yea that one is too meta <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
tell me how you feel when you finished the next few chapters, you will know which chapters are those once you finish it <:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
yea he was cooking but not enough <:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
like when Rip cut both of Andy's arms, instead of wanting to use Undead to heal, Andy use his action as an attack to bypass Unrepair's rules
what they need is to expand their imagination
but what i like most about Negator ability is that they don't need to get stronger
yea that show how good the story is <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
so at best 30 years since then
yea but even when we assume so, they're only human
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
so 99 new rules mean only around like 7 years th
before she said that every 3 months Apocalypse will announce new missions
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
Death was among them
yea when Juiz explain about all the rules got added
wait what, how come Death only be around for 3 years
i was like that too
when i first read it
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
in the next 10 chapters
that's the neat part
<:WorryYou:1101221412817092650>
man among men <:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
and Andy was seriously pissed off cause he thought Fuko think of him as someone that can do vulgar things when he want
yea what sell Andy to me was when Fuko offered to make out because they couldn't think of a way to beat the Chinese Negator
<:DankUp:1061806229455896646>
and for some reason whenever the name of their abilities got introduced, i always have a goosebump
yea it's lit <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
that's why he and his editor were having a fight when he suddenly wanted to change the direction
<:DankReading:1118364427767525518>
just fanservice 90% of the time
yea it's not bad but for Jump standard of comedy ecchi, they pretty much don't let you tell your story
early chapters are the weakest link
it will keep getting better
<:ApuBased:991134296633004092>
but after Undead Unluck got serialized he want to draw what he truly want
yea the author said in an interview that he was advised to submit a comedy ecchi one for his first works
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>
Have you start Undead Unluck yet
<:LETCOOK:1113492243903414283>

2:07 take care and cover for laser if needed
1:35-33 burst with noah and take cover
0:35-33 (?) burst with noah and take cover [if your noah is still alive]

ps: you need to spam noah like a sniper to avoid triggering her S2 taunt skill to keep her alive for longer
i don't have any thing to level her burst

Red Hood is their frontliner so her position is upfront with confident pose 
Liliwess with the modest pose behind with her leader role
Young Snow White still inexperience following her leader
The prideful Dorothy standing in the center 
Scarlet with her samurai spirit walking just slightly behind Red Hood
And Rapunzel with the big sister personality, walking last
the art look so good, especially their positions <:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
<a:ScarletHaiyaa:1112797188142157864>
Scarlet in her old uniform look like a beast
<:FeelsDankMan:893952203742670899>
Nihilister emerged into her current form because of her wishes to be able to fly and unmatch under the sky
but could be the former
that one is still unanswered, the technology to create Rapture is still a mystery
yea Nihisliter said that Liliwess brain is the most compatible with the Queen
the current Rapture Queen
yea the one that got the head stolen
SW has been transferring bodies nonstop due to her condition during the war
Scarlet, Red Hood, Dorothy, Rapunzel, Snow White 1st body and Liliwess
<:ApuThink:888554651190968360>

Next event after School of Lock
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
Elysion doesn't look that strong
for the most powerful manufacture lore wise
or they will still be E L Y S I <:omegalul:1030461063197626409> N
will Marciana save Elysion
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
surely, yea
dw Crown will save wind
Mordernia, Alice, Drake
Fire have a lot of good valks <:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
their rates are also lower
but Pilgrim is Pilgrim
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
both 2B and A2 made it to the competitive list
but maybe Shift Up will change the schedule
most likely Red Hood next
Crown? probably no
<:Worrythinkhard:890718470092754994>
anni will be Nov 4th
both 2B and A2 are great
Tmr
i want to tickle her tummy <:ApuThink:888554651190968360>

new UI and stuffs
this event is good <a:duckass:1110867174798671944>

and i got bamboozled
or this might be fake
base and this one
2B's outfit will have 2 versions
and 2B is SR
so A2 is RL
bro the comment section
then kits
then next 2 days are 2B and A2 animations respectively
tmr is probably A2 model
Rumor is that Red Hood is in anni
Around early November
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
They buffed A2’s chest
In <#966951945103347794>
kit probably on last day before update tho
yea they will tease from the SR first
so at best will only be their artwork 2 days before update
shiftup have been more strict lately
sorry to inform you but probably never

2B doesn’t use sword like Scarlet
there will be 1 dead week
<:coolguy:1139926215357108224>

like they add the gear chest after 0.5 year anni
after each milestone they start adding QoL
that's how these games work
they will after 1 year anni
<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
i play like 10 KR mobile games and they all use this as the endgame content
stats rerolling
yea it's the KR type of endgame
because it gave max ammo 4 times in a row
i spent like 5 gems on Dorothy helmet
oh it's the usual <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
right one is rerolling current stats

i just wait until i can do the 2 of them with Scarlet and Mordernia
this one is hard, i never get to invest her to the point she can 1 shot them before <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
it's 1000% multiply with the x% value of her burst
yea correct

time to teach Liter dress code
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
she is still Mordernia tier if you put her on auto
you don't
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
It just depend on how many female players actually tell they’re female in the survey
If enough female play this game they might do it
that look like hentai artwork
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Still like Privaty portrait in this image

tmr is Story 2, time for Admire taking the stage <a:hacker:998945514894671912>

Snow White live up to lore the most
in game E L Y S I <:omegalul:1030461063197626409> N
Elysion in lore also has the strongest Nikkes
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
the other one will come home soon <:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
the bunnies buff Scarlet to heaven
it's the 40% damage taken from Blanc and ammo refund from Noir
Novel also need 4/4/10
these Nikkes eat mats like crazy
me neither, im taking it slowly <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
the SW + Maxwell is strictly boss killer
1st team : Bunnies + Scarlet
2nd team : Bunnies + Alice
3rd team : sAnis + Novel + 3 
Another 3rd team : Snow White + Maxwell
but overall she is the 3rd strongest team in term of dps
so it lower the ceiling by a little bit
she can't be used with the bunnies
but her team isn't
her damage is as craced as she is jacked
so hope they cover everything <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
there will be 3 Nier valks
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
like a beast
like if you have gears on Drake, build Drake
do not worry, just use it as the basic, no need to follow it 100% <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Drake use the same lines with Noir
you can use this as the basic <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
he is actually me

Fucking expensive
I saved skill mats for 3 weeks and can only level her skills to 10/8/6
<a:Booba:1081435431540903936>
Like her honkers
But her skill 2 and 3 deal massive damage
2 and 3 can be max later
At the very least her skill 1 should be 10
She needs like 10/10/7
Probably all you have rn
Just pair her with Scarlet like normal
sAnis is still a support
Not really
Private and Funny 😭 Privaty 😭
for dps role
seem like she only need Privaty
don't know what is going on but everyone said SAnis is on par with Scarlet

yea, Ade/K/Moran/Rumani
probably doable
2 small events to save for Nier <:hmmge:1015313814624931951>
> If that happens I'd squeeze every drop of water from Helm's shirt into my mouth.
Helm is 10/4/4 or 10/7/4 depend on if you use on electric bosses or not
Anis is probably 10/4/7
support the strongest dps in the game
Anis is definitely more important than Helm
<:pepegeHmm:906274894675869747>
oh it's Helm that counter Electric and Anis buff electric nikke
with normal buff in their kits
so both of them are Electric's type killers <:hmmnoted:1079360168875282452>

<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
yea Scarley desperately need to level up the reload speed cube
<:clueless:1079349573450989659>
slash from dusk til dawn
my Scarlet currently have 72 ammo
and she scale omegahard with OL gears
20 ammo Nikke outdps everyone and their moms
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
but dps wise she is still the best
but it will be annoying to use her on worm with only 20 ammo
Scarlet is still better than Sugar
with enough OL gears it become easy to clear QTE
before i have the bunnies, i use Dorothy Guilty Scarlet Modernia Drake for worm
then for OL gear pior it's probably gonna be
-Tetra: Alice > Sugar
-Missilis: Drake > Guilty > Maxwell > Laplace
-Elysion : <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
oh do you have the bunny duo btw?
yea with enough OL gears on everyone you will clear it easily
it will take you a long time to kill them
Worm and Train are the 2 hardest
but no need to stress
AR have an easier time to do QTE
when you have Scarlet with 40+ ammo then it's easy to stay on her
it's hard to do it on SG
i usually stay on Scarlet
<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
And 80% of my Tetra nikkes don’t even have OL gear
sAnis will be Tetra
Oh fuck i just realized
but not it's raw dps check until phase 2
save some time
if you can it's good
after you break the gears it doesn't matter if you can vulcan or not
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
yea gear first
<a:Yeehaw:999641827080675400>
<@309634550273933314> <@474176413847519242>
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
i stuck on Nihilister for like 3 weeks
Nihisliter is hard
but uhh, just wait
no kidding too
yea probably if all the OL gears are on her
like so strong that the fact she sucks on anything but boss can be forgiven
she is the strongest boss killer
she is a special case
<:suskayge:1008789461582229644>
thanks for nothing
and it's Noah
i got Pilgrim's light
<:clueless:1009089400174559294>
Ain’t no way SHelm is not meta
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Rn
I need SAnis and SHelm
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
dw eventually it will pile up
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
They’re teasing it
ideally Scarlet want to have 60 bullets at least
even just max ammu alone is better than anything
reroll all Scarlet's lines to max ammu
when you have a lot of gems later on <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Max is B7
It’s dupes after MLB yea
the one that extremely hard to gatekeep you
oh it's one of those
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
<:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
yea and the more you have to stay the more chance you just randomly die
good luck <:okk:1110244301184696360>
you have make it to lv 200
look on the bright side tho
sorry
But SHelm is already coming to save Elysion
Actually big
the wife draw the female
the husband draws the male
also even better
the artists of Nikke is a married couple
it's a married couple
the new generation Pilgrim <a:hellawicked:1090866443723223101>
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
and it's so fucked up
her stories have Crow's related info
did you read Diesel's bond story yet btw?
also the world is so grey that it actually hard to tell if there is even good people
some people don't need to be saved by the protag
also im kinda glad that Nikke doesn't try to make villians become good <:okk:1110244301184696360>
poor Yuni <:Sadge:838690139991048202>
she is just natural born psychopath
she doesn't even have a sad backstory
she is definitely pure evil <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
the only thing she needs is death
she keep crossing the line
bro Crow is actually doesn't need to be saved
all heroes have cool landing and bail out
hero syndrome <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
save up like 600 mileage tickets on standard banner and then when you're missing the last 3 copies, use them and get to lv 200
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
also wtf, you're supposed to do this as soon as you have enough
Huge update <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
also yea, Yulha bite the partner when have sex<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Hero mode activated <:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
And Sugar is 4/7/7
Drake want 7/4/7 iirc
Liter want 10/7/7
Cause Scarlet and Alice scale the hardest with OL gear
Scarlet is only a beast when she has at least 2/4
Yea sound good
wait what update is that
As an Elysion
Helm must be broken
Alrigth 3rd time the charm
New summer nikke are Anis and Helm both
<@309634550273933314> <@474176413847519242>
:yayy:
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
Me too
Mast Bikini L2D
it's just fucked
my shotgun team is just fucked <:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
bro i still don't have Drake yet
💢 💢 💢
Syuen got the correction punishment
oh shit just realized
<a:Yeehaw:999641827080675400>
the one i just sent is in the event
cause it's in the file so probably old files
yea it's old artwork
let me check the ingame model
Force everyone to have Syuen in their accounts
<a:aothatday:925647030091665438>
in next anni
maybe she will be the free Nikke like Rei
now she has to spend the rest of her life paying back for all the wrongs she did as a Nikke
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
Syuen got sentenced and strip off the right to be human
It’s chapter 24 content
You down for some hilarious story spoiler? <@309634550273933314>
Mast in bikini
Indibilia is gacha
So surely
Nihisliter and Liberalio are rehab Nikke
Modernia, Nihilister, Liberalio, Indibilia
There are 4 Heretic
<:WICKED:1005138084419080263>
Fairy Tale Model No.5 
Codename : Red Hood 
A wolf has to die at the bottom of the well
Story cutscene, when Rapi activate Fairy Tale mode fighting with Indibilia ( she just break Indibilia's weapon )
OG Red Hood and Heretic Indibilia
<@309634550273933314> <@474176413847519242>
<:Shyggers:866898576802054144>
yea
eventually a good Elysion will come out
do not worry
Summer Anis better be broken
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
For carry role
Reload = AR, SR, Shotgun 
Refund = MG, SMG
Refund scale better when you have max ammo line on Modernia
Both are good
The refund bullets or reload one
you can switch the cube to better cube now
not bad
3 broken lines too
<:pojj:1067071660081020938>
the 2 early Elysion
it's Privaty and Helm
where is good pve Elysion
the fuck
sound like pvp
yea next is thomas
defender and buffer can wait
ideally you want to prior it for nikke that actually deal damage
Dorothy boots are enough
time to reroll when you get more gems <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
what is this <:life:1001518241610485781>
not sure <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<a:LETSFUCKINGGO:1012872161763008602>
<:okk:1110244301184696360>
Like a snowball
Once you start clearing those bosses it will pile up eventually
Like Dorothy, Privaty, etc
Oh btw, nikke with Last Bullet passive must not have any max ammu line
Players bitch about the rate a lot before
That’s why they have to add the 200 frags box
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
Yea it need to be the correct manu
<:life:1001518241610485781>
It’s like half the odds of other manufacture
Pilgrim gears havr the same drop rate with their gacha rate
<a:smadging:1034847088737005628>
Zero atk stat
And her OL gear is the shoes
My Modernia is still 1/4
It’s hard to 4/4 a Pilgrim so eventually you will have to OL other nikke
Just upgrade whenever you have the crystals
As long as the line is acceptable on each piece, you can move on to another piece
Prior meta nikke first ofc
No need to lock, your goal is build OL gears on everyone
The other gears you can search for atk/crate/cdmg/max ammu
Modernia only need 1 hit rate line for permanent s2 buff
The one with “ refund 1 bullet for every 10 bullets used “
Change it to the refund one
You can swap the cube for Modernia now
Hit rate is good yea
only missing Nirvana now
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
yea, Nayuta is Myriad
but there is Nayuta so Scarlet is actually Red Lotus
i used to think Scarlet is a name from Korean folklore <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
not just nipples
Anis look like she will even pull out her poosay
oh right i forgot about Dorothy <:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
the bible squad is half here and half there <:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
Rapunzel, Snow White and Red Hood
the fairy tales Trio is complete
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
they probably only hide the model of Red Hood
Rapi's SSR is in Anni
yea they can't even leak all of it or else Shiftup will come for their asshole
<a:aworryOnFire:862940123430518814>
both swimsuits are fire tho
<a:aware:965946296236122172>
All Pilgrim still don't have skin yet except Modernia
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
it's Helm
keep it calm
no clue if Anis is skin or valk yet
<@474176413847519242> <@309634550273933314>
<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
oh there is no tip for Stormbringer
<:coolsmiley:881230841227923486>
usually any leftover dps
Euhnwa is probably better
didn't see that one
oh what <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
So hope they nerf the previous chapters
New chapter update on July 20
<:worrySniperAngry:920552131642142741>
Just aim
wait wrong channel <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Ein is <a:uooh:964118021574623243>
Hope it’s Ein
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Or Ein
Golden Ship = Mast
Sea you again = Summer Part 2
Exciting School Life = Zwei
Only have names
The what? <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
from Korean folks
 Yulha apparently was the name of a former high ranking Korean general in the past 
some names are still remain a mystery <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
Trust
Yea it’s 2B
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
clueless
<:shruge:1079371164159311982>
same go for Blacksmith
when you have Dorothy
Liter is kinda useless there
next time you fight it
try switching Liter to Drake
<a:WHAT:1083081346475376640>
and there were like 6 of those
like Counter Side collab's skin of Vtubers were $80-100 per skin
it's a big issue in a lot of other games too, Nikke is the biggest name that have this problem so it make it way to the news
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
not her first time, won't be the last neither
Nero's tone also feel like she is used to it <:life:1001518241610485781>
<:life:1001518241610485781>
Admi would be so sad
<a:worrySwingSadge:981759583779446866>
they kill the cat, what
Like Rei
Dw
On anni they will give another 3* Nikke
I stuck at 160 wall for like 2 months
Start praying
Did that guy ever get Scarlet + Modernia starter pack
<:EZ:953617687735566356>
Not really but she is good for Arena
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
That skirt is in the way
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
It go from 3% crit dmg to 6% at lv 10
The increase is non-existence
Bad scaling yea
Liter is just better in canpaign
Dorothy can’t be a beast until boss fight
Prior Modernia > Liter > Dorothy
Scarlet is done
After Modernia + Scarlet + Dorothy + Liter
4 is enough if you have spare mats
It will always block exact 1 hit no matter the damage
Yea the shield HP is irrelevant
1/1 for now
Centi is not a raid nikke
This is for raid only but you can look at the dps skill prior
Use this as a reference
You can use the reset
Yea for Centi lv 7 is more than enough
But they also have idol culture so not really a surprise
Yea pyramid skin in KR games are expensive af for no reason
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
Yea Mast is whatever
Where is Crown <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
For no reason
There is Chime model in the event files
Chime show up in Golden Ship event
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
Need that Summer Liter tho
probably Summer Anis
Nier collab coming with the whole squad <:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
Sea you again is Summer Event part 2
Golden ship is Mast
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:HUH:975882565095399454>
fuck me
Nikke is pull out the 24 hours MT
need Crown and Ade <:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
looking good for Arena
still PG 13 tho <:copiumdealer:1124772498999889920>
my Scarlet is still not 4/4 after half a year farming
the one you need to pray is getting Manufacture gear
just more base stats but won't affect anything in the long run
no worry, it actually does not matter
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
for Train it's just wait until you get gears from other 4 bosses
Break the core -> Don't shoot wings ( destroy bomb ) -> Reapeating until you have enough damage to kill her
all of your nikke will focus on shooting the core
in the cutscene, wait til you see Modernia then skip it
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
Imagine getting choked by those thighs
low quality
<a:UsagiAlice:1099633230178689084>
<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
This close <:KusaSmol:1013665199422709760>
nice typo <:omegalul:1030461063197626409>
nice, free Rapi's swimsuit
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Not yet
KR and JP are built different <:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
other KR games pyramid skin are like 70-100 on avg
and somehow pyramid skin that price is actually the norm
yea i think it's too high too but then i research about it on KR market <:BorryWeird:951404789290401822>
<:Deadge:916024193567559710>
i still don't have Drake tho
like 50 on avg i think, it received a lot of complaints too so hope they tune down it this time  <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
need to wait
they said each pyramid skin price will be different
pyramid skin <:Deadge:916024193567559710>
<a:Yeehaw:999641827080675400>
<@309634550273933314>
In that shop
Best core to buy is probably Sugar > Drake > Maxwell
all the good stuffs aren't in there
even Alice is not in there
in fact
they don't
<:FeelsOkayestMan:888208022348918784>
Yea sure, when im home
usually 1 team is for clearing mob and the other team is to solve puzzle or enabling other helping machines
and 1 nikke in the other
oh you put 5 nikke in 1 team
just saying
she better be fucking cracked
she did get buff
<:Sadge:838690139991048202>
seem like 3 will win <:okk:1110244301184696360>
2 look too much like Helm's skin
vote will online on June 29th

<a:hacker:998945514894671912>

just like me <a:aware:965946296236122172>
eventually <:ok:1088133019455467560>
it's gear beyond T9
<:Binoculars:943798474699309116>
Healer usually only need lv 4
Probably 4/4/4 is enough
And bond level are based on limit break yea
Snow White is a boss killer only
Don’t upgrade her, she is a pvp nikke
and manual to aim for his rocket launcher
yea when he jump if Centi's shield isn't up yet you need to hide
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
oh Drake is good then
or Helm for more buff
Alice is fine
Bombers is soft dps check
the only strat is keep trying after every 1k BP upgrade
everyone stuck at those stages too
Bomber <:kmshappy:994809253770575882>
<:ok:1088133019455467560>
around 4GB
Tie with Dorothy

<a:uooh:964118021574623243>
She also hide some great assets under that coat
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>

<:ddx:1011889803144478761>
