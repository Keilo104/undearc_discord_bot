Does Kalpas also know how to do Water Boarding?
How's the Swarm?
Gotta catch up
But I'm touching too much grass at the moment
I also think I should sell my second account too
Probably reaching Trailblaze 50
I think 1.1 is already too big for my phone unless I delete arknights
Crit Issue
Yeah, Flats
What is the most useless substat
I haven't doing much activity in HSR
Or maybe Hoyo just wants to Livestream three servers at the same time but the former is more logical
GBL, KR and JP seems to share the same coding for Livestream, so yeah, technical issues
It's the Earthquake that hit Japan
Well actually
Do you know why the EN Livestream got delayed?
Fall Guys in Star rail when
I hope they follow the tradition of Honkai 3rd variety of events
aint complaining though
Minigame events mostly
well
if there is
its probably already leaked by now
bummer
or they just hid it
doesnt seem like it
is it gonna be this patch?
I'm more excited about the next Trailblazer's path
whatever
Tycoon main event type of thing
Not much of an fighting events right?
currently, I dont have a single multi since I tried to get Sushang with a multi and I did
I risked it and got what I want
how many pulls you guys currently got?
well, shes gonna be extra-ordinary if theres Seele
Im going to probably go Destruction path next since my Preservation Path is just all about shielding till the enemy dies
Shes gonna be good if you have SEELE
Hes literally Vampire Lifestyle type character that never dies
Just save Blade if you wanna solo fight with him
Memory Of Tragedy
well then
Memory of Chaos
and
Memory Hall
We can relax for a while
its 12 a day right?
Farming Calyx are painfull
I think
seems more than Genshin
how many events we got?
probably going to save for Blade or Fu xuan
Not pulling for this patch
I wonder if thats the case for every patch
another 10 pulls login event is always nice
Man
Imagine Missing that one relic piece
I'm too broke
Building Seele is hard
Met 
Ruan Mei
It Worked <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
NOWAY
I lack DPS
Literally
My team is literally full of Preservation + Clara

I'm waiting for Sus to appear and Seele give mercy on me
Luofu*
It's fine
Not in loufo
Also take it slow or you'll get burnt by side tracking within the main quests
So it's complete
Best to wait for the next patch
She has that giraffe neck <:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
Quick sketch for a good luck
Gimme Seele I Beg Of You Game <:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
I accidentally have her Lightcone
I'm that desperate
Copium
I'll get there
Still 2 days
I'm broke af
I'm begging
Whale for me
Keilo
I'm a student
Fine, in an hour
It's not updated yet
I've pulled earlier
<@148145559897636865>
It's insane
I'll show you the records later
Believe me
Story of my life
Now I'm hitting hard pity again to get guarantee
I hit hard pity just to lose 50/50
Something is definitely wrong
Literally around 178 pulls currently
I feel like...
I'm hitting hard pity to get Seele
I also spent all my shop currencies for the tickets
I'm this close Speedrunning all quest just for the pulls
I'm at my limit
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
70 currently now
Am I going to get Hard Pitied again? <:Dead:998259390605971496>
The game doesn't want me to get Seele
I think this game got a curse
now I got Bailu again
I got 2 Bailu's
you spent your luck into another Gacha
Enjoy then
It is what it is then
Did you drew your card?
tch
you got multiple stuffs while not hitting the hard pity
that aint bad
you said it was all dupes
I really want Seele so bad, the game wont let me
and it's Gepard
I cant escape him
hey, I hit hard pity with it
?
well, atleast that's still something than hitting hard pity then losing 50/50 eh
atleast you got something
while having her weapon
hitting hard pity and losing 50/50 on seele
atleast better than me
Fire MC, Clara, Gepard and March 7th Team I guess
I walk into the path of Preservation
in my hoyoaccount
how
I just got Gepard from standard banner
aaaaint no way
you love to see it
Ahh Luofu sidetracking in main quest
well, I guess figure it out for yourself
Ill recommend to bring a single strong attacker or just throw every weakness break in world 4
World 4 incoming
World 3 heh
you get what I mean
I know its world building and all
but why In the main quest that has nothing to do with the main quest
tiring i mean
To be honest, the sidetracking in Luofu is taxing to do
My Trailblazer needs more Def
Welt is Da Wei's Self Insert
Muh self insert

Even though the illusion of choice
Honkai Favorite Child with Animation Tradition
Or
The Listen...

With Trailblazer and Kafka
Also an Achievement when you use Himeko, March, Dan, and Welt together

Happy Big Family
Some spicy drama
This is just amusing and pathetic at the same time

The comments I mean

And I chose replace all of my curio in the end of the run with the replace curio
I got the Insane Curio set up with the Lotto Ticket Curio
Ever tried getting this?
That's luck Issue
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396> 🔥<:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
I have 2 accounts
They're both LV30
Fr fr
Luck Issue
Since you have Clara as well
Preservation
Why hunt? 
Have you tried abundance?
Should I buy it <:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
They have sword umbrella as well for $10
It's only $5
Check this out
Tachi Umbrella
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
With 10 pulls
I have her Lightcone
Yeah
The difference is that I have Gepard, but don't have Seele

I also have Tingyun
Change account with me
It's fine if they keep it themselves, however they push their Ships and Headcanons to someone or to argue that this thing is 'Canon' 
It gets tiring
Just take Abundance or Preservation
But the moment they push their headcannons to you

Not so cool now
But that's when you stop paying attention
I think some people... are out of bounds
Stop playing with it then
Yada yada
It's pretty much for everything

Common Interaction = OMG,  they're so in love with each other
Because someone is interacting with the same gender, it's automatically they're inlove in each other

I'm pretty sure those people never really interact with real people

Although it's pretty common and normal to stick with someone the same gender and have personal close interactions

Do people nowadays don't learn about these kind of things?
You shouldve gone for Hunt since you have Seele
tsk
No Sampo as well
Nihility for that Stacked Damage Over Time is good as well
The Nameless(The Express) hates them
The Garden Of Recollection is interesting as well
Then how about the dialogue of Kafka from the start How much she/he remember'?
Reincarnation
And how Himeko knows that Trailblazer was special the moment they met
I wonder when is it going to be released, early 2025?
I stil want that FPS game though
GGZ is still alive somehow, not just in GBL
I think beta will be months away since its a bad decision to have a beta besides a game thats only been released
Also waiting for that ZZZ news
I wonder when they are going to make that money back
proabably some of them are saving for Kafka and Blade
Jingyuan is still not out yet
Id feel like HSR  will only reach 100M - 150M
and to be fair, the launch of most games are the time where they earn the most
do you have a higher res
you better stay with HSR Humor
800% value
Pog
buy*
Did you her a shoe yet?
Did Clara got her shoes yet?
Aoen of Erudition is creepy
If they go even begond
The Trailblazer's past before the point they got 3D printed is still unknown
What if Akivili, whatever their name is 
Is the Trailblazer reincarnated <:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
I mean, I think they got reincarnated /s <:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
I'm intrigued about the upcoming aeons
Well, there is still the nameless
Finality <:suswokege:966623262912163850>
There's also the Aeon of Finality <:sussge:968897150249484389>
Hold up
In the recent PV
There's more Aeons that was revealed
That means theres going to be more elements?
It's from Ruan Mei
Ain't no Herta displayed on it
I mean, we are talking about All
0.1% of Encountering Probably
Okay, what in the world.
Def + HP as added stats
I'm gonna farm in my Hoyo lab for a while, time to Speedrun it anyways
Ah, I suck at dancing
Discussion before that
Level 30 Elibirium
Ah whatever they are called, world Level
Don't let the Gacha bind you
Touch some grass and play other games Eli <:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
Skill Issue
I'm managing two accounts sob<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
Im a rhythm player Baban <:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
Reflex
It's unbelievable, but I did
When I also already have Seele light on accident
Better than me hitting hard pity and losing 50/50
Better than nothing
I guess pretty much
Except they will only add more stuffs
Simulated Universe? Ofcourse
It's an endgame content
It's been only 5 days
Yeah yeah, I'm just messing around
And it's our PE, I don't want to dance, we got Dance Sport <:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
Oh wait
I'm already in the school grounds
Need to hurry as well
Ah I thought that
What?
Ah okay
Having your month then?
Are you bleeding?
Anyways, I can finish pretty much the Simulated Universe with only the Counter Attack Preservation Team
I'm sleep deprived, don't put it on me
Oh wait is it?
Oh, Bailu
5* Star Healer
+ MVP  Svarog
Preservation Team kinda insane

Fire MC + Clara + March + Baizhu is unkillable
He's pretty easy
Why do we have to fight in such a small Cage
Is this MMA?
<:Terismol:994096001197543444>
There's going to be one to be sure when the game constantly updates
We waiting for the The Land of The Rising Planet
I wonder what designs they could make up

Still waiting for that Kevin Expy though
Or the other blue woman
I'm betting 30% of shields that she's a yandere
Isn't it interesting to think of a strategy of how to help a character suffering from mentally deranged mind and way of thinking?
By the way
My answer about Yandere character topic
Blue Eyes and Red eyes
Is this the new version of Alter Ego? <:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
Who? <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Who?
Yanqing from Honkai?
Okay
Time to switch and Jarillo-IV in my HoyoLab account with Sushang And Tingyun squad
If I lose 50/50 again
Then I'd go full Preservation Team
My dreams are shattered, time to switch to my HoyoLab account
I just hit the hard pity and....
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
It's feels like an eternity
Ive done 60+ pulls so far in the Limited and I still got nothing out of it
What's wrong with it? <:Terismol:994096001197543444>
What? <:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
How about a 7/11 meme?
I can fix her <:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
Waiting for a Yandere character to pull <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
It's gonna be awkward when you fight something that supposed to end the world and you go away after finishing it
Then just coming back after <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
You know
I'm definitely finishing all stuffs in that planet before moving to another planet

Also, finishing all stuffs before doing the final part
I'm just <:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
<:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
Finishing all side content in that area before moving to another area?
Is anyone the same as me that
Also
I'm taking my name playing the game
In 1 month
Nah, just suffering
In Star rail
Is her name Fuxuan?
If so, I'm going to pull for her
I wonder what do Pink Girl do
Ples <:FelisDerpy:1047083097264500777>
I just want to not feel tired man <:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
I should change my mindset that they're just Pixels so I wouldn't waste resources
I'm tempted
Too many skins
I think I'm gonna go broke in 4th anniversary if I'm still around by then
How many OP do you think I would get if I clear all challenges of all stages and clear all side story levels?
And I don't care enough to produce originum
I just did not too long ago when my base is filled with shining bars
I have 9999+ Gold Bars
Help me
How nice to spend resources to level up operators more than Level 60
I don't know if I should pull Pink Rat, what was her name again? Lin
I know she's not meta
Don't be like me who is sleep deprived with he flavor of Insomia
<:FelisOk:1047083219587182682>
<:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
The new mats
The mats for Texas
How many do we need again?
Stainless is not limited

And Texas Alt will do wonders in the future contents
Pretty much you can do it every time since red redeployment just reach in time
You can stun him every time when he does the charge attack
I don't remember
The only problem with the steamknight is his One shot attack
Just bring Red
Bringing Red here made the stage 10x easier
And yeah
The blue guy Free Healer 6* Star
And the stalling strategy I thought of work wonders
My Lungmen and Saria are doing work just fine
Ah, I just outheal those ballistas
I think we know that's to be expected
Hard Difficulty ain't that hard actually
Piece of Cake
Yeah
My plan is
If I don't get Seele in the other account
I'll just switch to the other account and do the things all over again
Is it a reroll if I'm playing both accounts?
I didn't reroll, kind off
I just switched accounts
Smh
I've been pulling in my Google Account
If I lost 50/50
I'll play my Hoyo Account
<:FelisGrass:1047083038179344454>
I don't want my Hoyo Account since I got Gepard
I don't know how I am getting the broken 4* star in my Hoyo Account (Tingyun and Sushang)
While my Google account is dying
Can't wait to experience the pain again in World 6
Bruteforcing is my speciality
And you'll fight alot of robots
Serval since she's going to be more useful when fighting the robots
If you have March and Fire MC in the same team that is
For the Level 30 Fellows out there
Have you seen the sun when the game first came out?
It's been only 4 days Nini.
And I'll jinx you harder
Bet
You jinxed it now
Westerners smh
Log out and log in again
And it requires to be Trailblaze Level 10
Wait until you go to World 6 of Simulated Universe <:worryweird:987958026071834634>
It's been only 3 Days.
You gotta touch grass for real man
Don't leave the little girl hanging in Rivet Town
Ain't no way
I accidentally did a 10x pull in the Light Cone Banner because I was clumsy and...
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
The launch is so smooth that there's no apotickets <:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Even so
Male MC VA is kinda decent <:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
He has a cool ending pose
Male Fire MC is Fire
I did
Go teleport
Can somebody trade the account to me?
Ugh, I got Gepard
Damn
Already Speedrunning when I'm just slow
Well, whatever since I'm a beta tester
Nice map system and overview <:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
If I remember correctly, it's like Simulated Universe Level 4+ above in the CBT?
Simulated Universe
Let me inspect every pebble
Even so, it's interesting
The game kicks you out and then if you log in again, it doesn't let you have the option to stay behind again
If you decide to decline Himeko's offfer to get into the train
They go without you and they died
Well, it doesn't matter, you're just a researcher in the space station anyways, since Herta eventually lost interest in you
There's an alternative ending if you decide to stay behind
Not deported yet? They've been harassing alot of people for a long time now
Is it out now?
Can't be that bad
What fanservice? Two characters hugging each other? Do we play the same game, HI3 has been a fanservice from a start <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Huh, people are complaining about Captain verse now? Can you let just two straight people hug and be a couple for once <:SirinAngy:1130475728895483934>
Just enjoy ya life for now
The Pacific will be catching those metal packed explosions soon enough, as if it's not getting enough
The war conflict tensity just keeps bumping each passing day
Who knows, maybe next day you'll be sent a draft notice
Seriously? Can they just give it to someone else
This gameplay footage was not even played on the new build of the game
Even so, if it does have good gameplay, it got Netease, it got a high chance to go anywhere down to gutter with it's monetization
Also, did they like, shoe the whole plot in the trailer lmao
So now
*I pretend I do not see*
Well, trailer and cinematic gameplay doesn't really show anything
I'll have opinions on it when there's actually a beta available
I'm not trusting anything unless there's actually a gameplay footage, not those with fake UIs as well
So many addition and those parry are so satisfying and nice

Here, things I've picked up from the trailer
ZZZ Trailer Stuff

•Character Hangouts/Dates
•QTE Dodging
•Arcade System/Minigames
•Parrying/Blocking
Have you seen the trailer?
After March
So, April - June
I'm about to graduate, I'll be just be more busier from now on
Mhm yeah, I've been not engaging online alot these past few weeks, I've spending less time online.
I've been busy as well, lot of things to go through
From CN TapTap Store <:SirinAngy:1130475728895483934>
Greetings
It's seems like ZZZ release date got leaked
2024 Q2 <:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Beta when smh
I'm going to take a break from arknights for a little while <:Terismol:994096001197543444>
I don't want to stress my mind about this further, I've been sick for more than a week, it just keeps coming back 
<:FelisGrass:1047083038179344454>
What if a new app pops up like Kick to Twitch 💀
Well, who knows where will they scatter after Twitter dies
Yoimiya having prosthetic as well 💀
But it's not worth it since it's Twitter
I mean, you can easily search <:slayjj:1120092406012989451>
Greetings Lumi
Do you remember the days when they thought Dehya has prosthetic limbs when it's just armor lol
It's not like, the distance when hes reading is far also
If he can read that far, ain't no way he can't distinguish the two items 💀
Nah, GITWT doesn't just have that comprehension and analysis 💀
If he's partially blind and can't see that far, how does he know where the handle when rotating it 💀
GITWT are ones that's blind Fr Fr <:terium:973796767793569802> 🗿
Ahem, excuse me, I have another counter argument

His eyes is closed when trying to grab his coffee but when he felt touched the drink the girl placed, he opened his eyes since it's not his coffee, and then he smiled at her for trying to give him the same drink thus teasing then he sees his coffee and immediately turns it so he can grab the handle and drink
I did not search for that long but I'm leaving, I'm not deep in the ocean
I don't know, but... Just take this..
💀💀💀
It's starting 💀
My sanity is diminishing, give me grass water <:slayjj:1120092406012989451>
*cough* *cough* Nahida x Alhaitham *cough* *cough*
💀
As I said, it's a different case for different characters in GITwT however.. I wouldn't be surprised if I see someone ship them in Twitter...
I'm just bored and tired okay? <:FelisGrass:1047083038179344454>
The friendship thing is a different case, it's just when a character having a brief interaction with each like complimenting or doing what a friend does
TWT goes instantly to Ship them
•First thing first
The moment ago, he was reading
-But partially blind people can read if they can focus,etc
•The thing is that, we don't know how small or big the font, he was reading 2 stacks of paper smh, and uuh, moving on, I don't have much to say about this one however
•When the girl tries to give him a drink, you can see him smile when he's trying to hover the two items, tapping it, and doing a jebait or a little bit of trolling or literally Teasing
•Also, the fact he's not really looking over, like literally the corner of his eyes.
•Even so, he could literally look straight over the two drinks, even you're partially blind, you can see a difference between two different items with different shapes and color literally like, infront of you, if you can read papers that close, you can clearly tell a difference
•Ofcourse when he is trying to feel the items and goes to the cup, you can see him rotate it so he could handle in an instant
•The point, he's just trying to teasing the girl people, no need to come up with mental gymnastics which I did right now with this copy pasta lol

TLDR: He's just trying to tease the girl bruh 💀
Okay, let me write this long  counter claim
Do Genshin fans knows the concept of Friendship or Teasing 💀
Just Zeus'ed A Hag to Oblivion

Time to rest up and finish the game tomorrow
<:yippee:1002596802656223274>
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
💀
Please let it answer my math
Is that guy still around... Or alive atleast
That's disturbing
*Hears New of Honkai ArtBook Vol. 2*

Free pulls
Unless

13k Orundum
300 OP
Unlike me

You stopped when you hit the jackpot
78 Pulls
3 6* Stars
Suffering from success
Got Texas Pot1
However, too bad I won the Gacha in 30 Pulls
<@447218009749061632> My classmate and I tried to pull again for Penance
Even so I'm bored down to the bone
I don't have any motivation to do anything as well
I feel such like a hollow shell
I better sleep it off
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
Ah, no idea what to do
I'm so fcking bored as hell
I will deliver, the most terrible news or em all


C'mon, I mean it can be an accident in their Twitter feed
We have Mei And Kiana At Home
Imagine having 10 Keys for pinging orbs
Try pinging those orbs in PC
Did Baban left?
UnderWater
Get ready for 300 Hydroculi
Under Water Expansion I see
Even the water is boiling
It's still hot as hell

its like Twitter
Seems like they have seen some things
They just released a new song mv recently
And TUYU ofcourse
I like the Nameless
It's a good decision that my school decided to make the other days just Asynchronous classes
I'm already soaked wet from this heat
Goodness, that's what I'm experiencing right now
There's not much air to breath in or for air to come in
<:Dead:998259390605971496>
Have you
Ever experience being inside tight packed train like you're squeezed in like sardines
But when you're in a enclosed or crowded places
It's 40°C 🔥🔥<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396> 🔥🔥
36°C+ 🔥<:Terismol:994096001197543444> 🔥
As well
It's so hot that I feel like the sunlight is tearing my skin off
Aah dammit
I've been pushing myself, been getting only 3 hours of sleep everyday recently
Should've stop that before it get worse
I should download it by today's evening
I guess I should fix it
I'm exhausted as hell
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Probably fix her whole body first
Just focus on the doll
You shouldn't.
I'm relieved then
Please don't
I don't want to get turned in a voodoo doll
Have a KitKat
Take a break
The struggles are definitely in there
Damn okay
Good luck with it
You're already done more art than I am, an art student <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
That's cool
Is it going to be an original or a pre-existing one?
Are you doing the clothes as well?
I thought so
It's going to be a tough one
Huh
Just art stuffs Heki
Oooh I see
Can I know what are you doing with it?
Uh, sure
Why did you insert a tweezer
Oh good thing you can save money since you wouldn't need a protection because that thing won't even reach there
Oh well
How big is it for mobile?
I'm either Impossible Love, Acquaintance or Never Met
That I usually get <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
Ive been getting a lot of that lately
That tells something
Great.
I better get going to then
You guys are surely unhinged today
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
Do we have a channel that's available to everyone?
Okay, let's put chat on the life support once again
Aster is the admin of the server?
Let's go
.late <@726672158151147521>
Double the the
In the the parallel world, we all got isekai
Whos the father
<@375625398542925825> I think there's a problem with you
Best ending I'd say
Wow, I an the same person
.fate Aoi
Same, I've been so busy lately
Well, we all did because the pandemic was over and all
This is the one time I saw this server be so alive again <:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
Kinda nostalgic <:yippee:1002596802656223274>
Heki.
What's tero?
I'm just randomly tapping Emotes because, I don't know, I'm busy eating <:sajj:1067071714518892584>
It's nice to enjoy simple things once in a while
<:Tero1:1011268662478524416>
Not Blood Related I hope because I ain't sharing
No way
Nah
And what's wrong with that?
Yep <:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
I'm just eating good
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062> <:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Tet got that Rizz build
You guys are something
I'm eating Ice Cream <:FelisDerpy:1047083097264500777>
<:Discord:1007897636327669780>
Damn
Tet
stop marrying people
You guys have no ounce of dignity
Cheating left and right <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
I rather enjoy my life single <:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
Wheres the divorce papers?
Damn, too many sussy people here
Good Ending
I'm too busy eating my Ham and Cheese, also gaming to participate <:FelisCarv:1047082942368841728>
Oh
Here we go again are we?
Don't worry, it doesn't have value when it's coming from me <:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
Buy it yourself, you rich <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Hmm
I also, should I join giveaway more? I just stuffs
Smh, Privilege users
Way too big for my table though <:Terismol:994096001197543444>
And it's a huge Mouse mat
The other merch I've won just arrived
I think my family is... cursed?
Huh
But my game is telling me to update it to 2GB
Did PJ Sekai just got an update?
$2.50
Huh
I was texting my dad and I have a moment that I asked if my sister is free on a day
I asked it twice but never got a reply for that matter
Something's Odd
Finally <:Terismol:994096001197543444>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Where the fck is my ArtBook <:meiMad:997543209221750834>
Where is my ArtBook <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
Where in the void is my ArtBook <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
My ArtBook still haven't arrived <:yippee:1002596802656223274>
Mine still haven't arrived <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
It's been in Delivery Office since yesterday
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
My classmate's brother already got theirs too
So it must be near right?
Alright thanks
Wait
You can't track your package with the package code?
Mine haven't left Delivery Office yet
What's does the Package Tracker say?
Mine haven't arrived <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Just within my Budget <:yippee:1002596802656223274>
At least it's already Friday so I wouldn't worry spending money
RIPBOZO <:yippee:1002596802656223274> <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Uuuh
I wonder wheres mine
ArtBook Update anyone in SEA?
Tomorrow copium
Hope It arrives around Saturday though
What? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
And after that
Next year
It would be my last year of School <:yippee:1002596802656223274> <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
We still have another semester after exam <:yippee:1002596802656223274>
Unfortunately
Exam soon 💀
I just slept <:yippee:1002596802656223274>
Must be nice to be somewhere- vacation <:Terismol:994096001197543444>
Would they be still trying deliver at this hour?
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
If there's going to be a shipping
I'll be broke
And Im afraid that none of my relatives to receive when it arrives
I have school tomorrow <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Mine says it's still April 18+
Hmm
What did your tracker say?
Is it far way from the main city?
Province?
You received it already?
Oh
Country?
I remember reading one 
But I forgor the name
I've been reading Dark Gathering 

And just waiting for the new chapters
Reading SuperNatural Horror about myths and legends are kind of amusing

You never know, somebody, you might encounter one of em
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
1 hour for episode 1
It's amazing
Yeah
Slimey
Or your neck will break in half
Better not use it that much
Your throat is being funky huh
But I don't feel like buying anything
Our school is currently doing a school bazaar
Mhm
Same goes to you
Take care Aster
Nevermind, Arcade Rhythm games have weird character designs sometimes
Wait, that's kind of
Odd
Well
It reminds me of Boss Tracks of Sound Vortex where there's literally a boss that changes the playground of the song
Anything different from usual tracks?
Boss songs?
I remember those times
Yeah
I can imagine changing speed can hinder your Rhythm and reaction speed when it suddenly changes to a slower one
I hate those charts/songs that tricks your eyes with the notes
Recent Charts are way more harder and unique
I can't even reach 32+ Charts so I wouldn't know
Not seeing the notes and twisting your fingers
Chart 32+ are the extra two fingers territory
Data dies
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Arcaea
For example
To be fair
Some Rhythm games are not designed for phones
*It does*
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
To be fair
Sekai is designed to be played with *2* fingers
I don't have that privilege anymore <:yippee:1002596802656223274>
Me when I don't upgrade skill Mastery:
Well
Having a small screen have its pros
Like, when you're traveling
You could always play on it whenever
Wait, let me look that up
Oh Yeah
Sometimes level 2 modules have effects
Well
From my experience
Having a bigger screen makes you perform better
Unless you're traveling
Having a bigger screen is a huge advantage
Ignore Dodge
But when will it be useful again? <:Terismol:994096001197543444>
But like
Pozzy is the only useful Module in my current roster
I'm still contemplating if I should level up my 6* non limited operators to level E2 L60
I messed killing the last boat when it was 1 hit away
I couldve manage to make it to the Top 20 when I didn't messed up and playing around <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Way too humble
I was planning to change thy name to mine but I think that would result in the change of luck of the account
You're Inhumane in terms of skills
Oh
Baban
So I'm just waiting outside
I woke up late
My alarm clocks didn't do their jobs
I missed my 1st class period
Actually
Or kill off time
I just play whenever I commute
I just reached my school building as we
100 Expert Yay <:yippee:1002596802656223274>
<:yippee:1002596802656223274>
Forgot to turn off my notifications
Now my combo got broken
Reminds  me that we have to make our cosplay next month <:Terismol:994096001197543444>
You like that Itchy and tingly feeling all over your body?<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Late April Fool's Joke?
Ugh
I hate my hair getting cut short
Yes
Please
You require a psychiatrist
<:yippee:1002596802656223274>
*Meanwhile wearing a jacket to protect my skin <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>*
It's so hot
<:Dead:998259390605971496>
Im getting fried
Evenin
Lungs
Diseases

However it's more hard to hide your body that way
Vaping bad 
Smoking bad
<:Terismol:994096001197543444>
Let em rest 

I'll be praying for em
So I can go into a deep slumber <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Finally
I'll be replaceable
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
As usual
Mhm
Nah, just quite recently
Unfortunately
Seems like everyone is back to normal
I sometimes chat in there thinking it's general
I'm still confused between two channels of this one and <#966951945103347794>
Take care as always
Well
It's nice talking to you again Aster
Gotta go to take care of some matters
Sadly
That's also one reason why
JP is ahead
I used to play there but

Since you don't really need to read in rhythm game in JP
Unless you really wanted the story
It's just throws you off guard
Yeah
But I hate it more when it's alternating between other type of notes and flickers
I mean
What if
Ines is like Cantabile but bonkers damage <:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
A hay of flickers really ruins someone's day huh
And that's an achievement
It means your reflexes and reaction speed are faster
Well
It does though
Keep it up
You're really good huh
And yeah, what speed are you play on?
It puts me to sleep
It's a shame that it's not the full song
Literally playing anything below lv.27 will bore the hell out of me that I will miss a note because it's not intense enough
And Master
Expert
Identity and Hated By Life Itself probably
Or literally Nightcord and Vivid Squad tracks
Hmm
That's a good question
I just play for the Rhythm game <:Terismol:994096001197543444>
Still, I don't really manage gathering resources well
Well, as it should be
I took many breaks in between
And I lost my first account so yeah
JP
It's been already a Year
And, I've been trying to beat Difficulty 31 songs without revives
Same
At least I have 6 4* cards as of now
Doing Well in Project Sekai?
Morning, Rise and Shine
She also deals alot of damage? <:clueless:973756617109676032>
Those swords designs
Surely nothing suspicious
<:clueless:973756617109676032> <:clueless:973756617109676032>
Overpowering BagPipe? <:clueless:973756617109676032>
She's an Agent right?
Something dubious is going to happen
That E2 Art?
Also
Did you know
Ines also have the same art kind of pose with Surtr and Mlynar?
<:yippee:1002596802656223274>
I know
But that's not my kind of style
Even if it's damage
So, healing ain't for me <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
I'm more of an offense guy
She's cool
Not my type though
The NPC became playable
Yet
Ines
Oh yeah
New branch of Guards
Destruction <:yippee:1002596802656223274>
I dream someday of that kind of caliber but also hurts his teammates in return as well
I kinda like Liberator kind of thing
She's nice <:Terismol:994096001197543444> 






Me when I haven't used Fiametta for ages: 
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
But well
Even though she isn't as strong as Newspaper Uncle
Sem <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
You can always switch to It back
So no biggie
Also, copium for a skin <:Terismol:994096001197543444>
Need that Pink Hair Squad
Even tho
Priority
Texas Alter > Lin > Penance > Yato Alter
Wanted the first 3 tho <:Terismol:994096001197543444>
Yeah, but I guess I'll just try my luck
Texas Alt, Penance, Lin and Yato Alt
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
Saving for whom?
Alters?
I'm broke <:Terismol:994096001197543444>
<@447218009749061632> <:Terismol:994096001197543444>
50 Pulls
At least I won the Rate Up <:yippee:1002596802656223274>
Oh look

22 Days <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
How so
You're a weird one aren't you? <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
ArtBook Lost In The Backrooms V.1 <:yippee:1002596802656223274>
Anyways, I'm within the school grounds, adios
Why not?
And eat it
I will steal it
The Great SEA Art Book Depression <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Fun
It's so humid as well
Fans ain't gonna help you with that
It's so hot <:yippee:1002596802656223274> 
Welp, wearing a sweater doesn't help me either
I'm not social as I'm used to be
Well, in real life, not really

Probs, Internet, alot
It's April 26
place holder My arse
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
April 26 Release Date Kekw
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Thanks
I'll check it out
Wait, how do you track yours?
Cool
Is it 7:30pm Asian time?
Tomorrow is the Livestream right?
My shadow
And I wore this vampire cape the whole day because I could untie it
I look odd because of it
It's just a lot of water and dust accumulated
I ran alot
SEA except of Viet and Thai are still waiting
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
Devouring this after a long day
How?
A thriller or some sort
A horror film
My shoes took a beating tho
We are done filming for our group project
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
And so, I gotta go
Enough rest for me
Gotta go back doing school stuffs <:yippee:1002596802656223274>
<:dejj:1067071941367824474>
Also, I need to get rid of this Insomnia and short term memory of mine
Imma need a year or so
Transition to another year eh?
A week of vacation ain't enough for me to recover from all of this <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
I have a tablet that can connect to my phone and PC 
But I ain't getting that out infront of a lecture
Well, you have to get used and learn it 

But where's the time for that? <:clueless:973756617109676032>
But drawing in digital? I can find time to do so
Traditional is easy to set and you can do on a piece of paper anywhere
So yeah, it's easy to do so
I hope I can arrive to that day
Drawing is hard nowadays
The AI stuffs and don't have motivation to do so because sometimes, lack of time
I think that is a sign when I don't find games fun anymore when it was like my total hobby in the past
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Like games and drawing
The worse thing is
I don't find fun to the things I used to have fun
My body and mind just gives socializing like it does not see any point on it anymore
I'm probably just exhausted at this point
I'm starting to derail from relationships (friends) and staying away from them as I can
Probably education made it worse
I can do that years ago
But today
Nah, Climate Change <:clueless:973756617109676032>
Maybe I'm already crashing down
It's been years since that started
It's also getting hot

The point I can't wear jackets anymore or I'll be swimming in my sweat
I've been losing my focus lately as well <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
I'm slowly losing my will<:yippee:1002596802656223274>
<:Terismol:994096001197543444>
And you know what that means
Today is White Day
Principal be watching us <:despair:1041873430821228604>
We are having a demo today
-Water
I am cooking
I think ArtBook SEA is having a captainverse session
<:Hmmge:1002519669569228831> <:HonamiSleeping1:1066682113606307880> <:HonamiSleeping2:1066682135160819733> <:HonamiSleeping3:1066682159294861374>
Imagine APHO 3 with it <a:Aware:925809726300782592> <a:NAHHH:1055138437344284722> <a:deadass:1055138470810624070>

Mobile Users: <a:Aware:925809726300782592>
The song is too <a:Aware:925809726300782592>
<:TeriCopium:969281688414875728>
Good
<:TeriStare:904396538736967760>
Give em
I'm going to spend my weekends in torment
And I just got sick
Great <:despair:1041873430821228604>
Man, I've got to do 20KM everyday, then I have to wake early in the morning and go home late very tired while I need to do homeworks
I've barely have time to do anything <:BlitzSmile:826566618322436116>
Being an Arts student is <:Clueless:927309020413440010>
I mean, those who attends the training
We are getting some level 1 certification from Adobe hmm
Who would've guessed
That wall tho
Because it is? <:TeriStare:904396538736967760>
I don't care
I want another character to play with
<:despair:1041873430821228604>
If you want, that is
Just do whatever it feels better for you, it'll probably take down time however
If you can't decide, you can just tell us what are the names and we'll decide it for you
How does Share Invitation work?
When there's no available Valkyries for 2 Crystal S+ Errands <:Despairge:998260595440767046>
...Nevermind
<:BlitzSmile:826566618322436116>
Gold or Silver
<:Terismol:994096001197543444> A-B-C-D-E-F-G
I can barely move
I'm hella exhausted
Hey, the world ain't ending that soon
I think I can't do anything tonight
I'll just fall asleep
Finally, a long day
I'm in the beta and don't even have time for it
Can't even play
Good for you
I want to take my time and savor
What's the point if I won't enjoy it and provide feedback for the game
I haven't made progress for days <:GoldenglowSad:1054179910379376741>
Oh I mean
In our school <:HigoDumb:895020666271694858>
<:DuduStare:895774481996460054>
Currently in an event
Pom-Pom Lore where <:bonkuhodo:1042153464341479566>
It's up to you <a:vibe:1063840196111634432>
I mean
We are the one asking for pictures
And I did the thumbs up first and they did a heart <:MeiStare:897153385051095131>
I am held hostage
Where <:bonkuhodo:1042153464341479566>
There was no S in She
It's just marketing ploy/gimmick <:DuduStare:895774481996460054>
I mean
We would still get the Pre-registration rewards even it didn't reach
Hey
Wanna see something
So yeah
It's basically Elysian Realm system
Not a problem for me

Short-Term Memory innit
Well, we still gone playthrough blind
I see
Weekends maybe

There would events soon right?
I haven't played for 3 days
Since, school, yeah
March 7th is such a saving grace
I'm doing okay so far using the OG3 + Bailu through the content
Ah, another pain
Unless it's a spear bow heh
March 7th already have it though
Nevermind
I think that would work better for the AoE class
A Gigantic Greatsword would be nice to see though
Eh, already have a Lance
Well, it's going to be definitely an offense weapon
That would be fun
I wonder what weapon will be used
The Hunt MC when <:DuduStare:895774481996460054>
I'm surprised you just got it now

It was leaked and posted early in bilibili as well but yeah whatever <:DuduStare:895774481996460054>
Happy Valentine's
Good Day
L<:DuduStare:895774481996460054>
Take A Look Of This Image and Everything Explains Itself
That's the part you need to figure out maybe? <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
Too much red and pink here
So far
I'm very unlucky with the gacha
Game keeps giving me Pela and Serval
Aight, that's it for today
Just finished Svarog boss fight
Just finished answering the survey
I'm taking my time since I have to do something tomorrow
Can't pull an all nighter

<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
Record
Level 19
Proceeding to Level 20
Just spend it all on what you need
It doesn't matter yet
Did you do the daily quest and stuffs?
And spent your stamina?
I just finished the first part where Seele appears
Need to be lvl 14 to continue
That's it for today
Feels like many people got her
I've got Bailu
Wonder why <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
Blade too
Time to install <:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
Still no updates who got it
Ui's pretty good
90% Almost
You have to manually claim it everyone
26% now
Percentage now?
92%
I'm in
I guess that's possible
Pre-registration will start on February 10 and then
That doesn't seem right
Compressed files <:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
Well
It's now -3 hours (minus)
<@503044914016419840> they changed the time
UTC+8
It's 10:00 am now
Aight, thanks
Oh
UTC+8 is 1:00PM
So plus an hour
Make sense
Is it?
Great
Gotta be ready by then
Gotta put up multiple streams just in case
It's 1:00PM for JP right?
Get your guns ready for tomorrow
It's a race then
Good evening as well
Yeah, that's what I'm hoping for that they could've added as well
It was really cool pulling teammates into you to revive them 
Its a cool thing to save your teammates when they're downed in the open
That's cool
I hope like in mobile, he can grapple his teammates when they're downed to revive them
Finally
Pathfinder buff I hope
Oh
The classes, that's neat
They revamping the game?
Too many stuffs happening in Twitter recently
I mean, that's basically just everyday but it's more wild than the other days
Oh here we go
Tighnari VA controversy
At least Netflix got bullied to back out
It was a disaster.
Oh
Did you know that there's a Squid Game reality show?
I guess that explains it
Welp
Why so?
Alice in Borderland
Keep it up
I got 2 supports
And they summon tanks to support
Well
As if I have free time when the beta goes live
Accomplished, Near fail at the End
Rhythm Arcade machines surely lack here
A view.
It gets boring for a while as well
Well, I'm not the target demographic in the first place so eh
1 time I played it in JP
1 time I played it in Global, made it to level 6 and quit because of how laggy/delayed/buggy the menu is
Repeat 2
I uninstalled Blue Archive 6 times now because how unoptimized it is
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
Someone's addicted to milk tea
Yeah, everything is turning gray
The world has withered since then but I don't think it's going heal as well

Star Rail Event
How's y'all second draws?
Sickening
Same
It stopped on the character set <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
I see
For what? <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
Official Star Rail site
They added them
New char description and VA
Thanks
Gmail?
How do you get/give your Google play account?
Poster?
Which candy?
What's worrying about that?
The Star Rail Event
I guess I just got lucky
Time to wait for half a year to receive it
Oh okay
Semester Exam coming out soon
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
But you didn't say anything about still playing the game
Yes
And the 7th
March probably
Yeah
Now you point it out
Yet
But sadly there's no quest marker popping out
I'm sure he's just around
Want me to merge you with someone?
I'm not with good sewing though
Give me some Modafinil
Homework
And Al Haitam quest
He does some voice acting work now
Yes
What?
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
Bring us a souvenir when you get back
How is it so far?
And done.
It just might be an interesting concept
But maybe crossdressing and standing out will do the job
It's an performance for our Exam if you want extra points
Should I join my class' fashion show and cross dress?
On the other hand though
I'm trying to draw an One Pager with my focus on Fanaticism
Well
It's from TUYU
I just made a poster based on the song because we need to find a song related about 'Status Quo' and critic it
For some school activity stuffs
Anymore
It's not stealing
Good thing they're taking action
Oh
The Traced by Traced Plagiarism with Amiya's Guard Animation
TLDR <:Hmmge:1002519669569228831>
Probably? <:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
(Arknights)
Is 134 pulls for 4 6* Stars good enough?
Should be fine since Art Book is not that expensive
Still hope not
I heard some countries have some threshold to be items from overseas to be taxed
And how much it is
I was wondering about that too
Cool
Still gotta wait for a month or so
Are you supposed to be sleeping by now?
Just use it to buy La Pluma skin or whatever
Or below
18 OP outfits only
I think something I'm fairly exhausted
Time to save for Texas and Penance
I'm sure with Mylnar though
I also got Pozëmka potential <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
No BALANSE <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
<@447218009749061632> here goes another life savings
Hmm
And this bag is killing my shoulders
I had to wake up 4-5am everyday for 2 hours preparation and traveling
Smh
My school is like 20KM distance from my home
Ugh, I just missed the first period of our class
Was the sandwich that good?
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
Except for a few exceptions (Irene, SkadiAlter, Nearl, Surtr, etc)
Just look at my Skill Masteries
Barely any of them have any Mastery
Eh, I'm not that try hard to be honest
Oh yeah wait
Surtr's skin
To give them a module
I only level 60 Limited Operators
And there she goes
For the celebration for Anniversary alright
I don't have the new vanguard though
And pull again when it's almost over
I'm just be patient and let the free Pulls do the pulling
Yeah
I'm gonna hold on spending resources for pulling for now
I'm baffled
Fiametta, Horn, Irena and Pozy etc
Remember when I said in going to target and try these operators patches ago?
Basically
Free Pulls
19 Pulls
..Yeah
I guess it took 19 Pulls?
I mean...
Uh
Just
Don't be mad
What I just got right now?
Wanna know?
Just did
I
<@447218009749061632>
Oh
The time is upon us
Something just gone wrong and spent it mindlessly
And yeah, currently doing something right now

Also I don't know about that last part chief
And as you should too
I already got her before that
I spent all of my OP in Spalter Banner
I've got 45k Orumdumdum, 55OP and 30 Tickets I guess?
Currently in school rn <:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862> 

Anyways, how many pulls you've got right now?
Including that she's very Popular
In her Alter that is
Till this day
She doesn't have a skin yet
<:clueless:973756617109676032>
It's pretty stacked for up rates
Gavial, Pozy and Chen
Imagine getting none of the up rates <:clueless:973756617109676032>
There's too much going on
We just did a festival yesterday and now I'm reporting for a project
I need to comply for missing works
1st Semester will end this month
I need Originate Prime
Nah
Got too much school worth
I barely started Act 2 Challenge Stages<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
Still nothing to this
What is
Oh
Hmm
I'm not dead yet
Happy New Year
Still waiting for that Art Book
road.
Sure bud, the future is a long
Hmm
I mean
Still, getting moved outside alone is surely something
It's SFW doujins btw
Yup

Keep grinding
<@503044914016419840> I got news for you
I see
Calories got hands
That was last year.
Do anyone have their own resolution?
25 hours left for another year's end
We almost burned the school down
Thank you
We burnt an outlet in the process because one of my classmates left a soldering iron on it
We did it that in 6 hours work time
Group Effort.
School Project
Why do my cat sleep like that
Well you could trade the knife for an Apple
Says alot
You sell the knife for an Apple ya dummies <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
How about the other one's answer?
Interesting
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
Only 6% of the people aka all bunker can solve this riddle. How can you split these 2 apples with 3 people equally by using the knife only once?
Explain Status Quo That a Dummy like me can understand
Hmm
Oh, it's almost year's end
I have no sleep...
Dedge
2-3 pages for an introduction with 11 size font

I'm consuming too much sugar right now
It's cold
Maybe should the snow keeps falling forever? I wonder
Probably
I got a resolution for the next passing year
How about you?
Waiting for a new beginning
<:mafuyusmiley:1046422671895838862>
An atom
Barely.
Merry Christmas.
January, maybe.
Also imagine it's holidays
But you're still busy
Smh
Someobe you would meet in a hidden paradise
Resolutions would be nice ain't it?
Isn't it almost Christmas and New Years?
I just ate.
Hmm
More sugar overload
Our Year's End Party is tommorow, after that, I can finally sleep and not worry anything for 2 weeks
Until January
Finally
Vacation for 2 weeks
Ain't that much

<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
<:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
I took photos with myself in it which is like once in a blue moon but hey, you gotta do what gotta do
We will be doing something like this next year anyway
Made by students and they only did it in a week
There was an art exhibition in my school
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
Eh, that's still something entertaining to keep you at night
What's up?
Yeah <:mafuyuunamused:1046422673149923418>
Any news or updates regarding the Honkai Art Book?
Too Needy
And probably while being overdosed
Ahh, so busy nowadays, this semester is already exhausting
<:FelisOho:1047083363263074304>
Skol <:FelisOk:1047083219587182682>
I only have 2 games and the other one is a rhythm game when I don't have any internet connection or data <:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
What other games? <:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
Im not going to be able to get Gladia Pot 6 just like I did not got Lumen Pot 5 🗿
Or I don't at all
I'm with my classmates right now
Just hanging out while speaking really minimally<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
You're 3 patches late
<:FelisBread:1047083302365966396>
And I only feel like that's a sadder way to go with it
Yes
Time to Mald
<:Terismol:994096001197543444>
Bedge
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Let's consider this
I got a Nanaka dupe
In a 10x pull with another character
In the advance banner
A unit that I already have
Is a unit that's selectable to buy

Got A Dupe <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
What.are.the.odds
I can't totally believe it
Who I wonder <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
I found a dropped phone
-Difficulty Down
Penance seems nice too
You pulling on Texas Alter Banner?
<:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Preferred Pozy
I guess W ain't really coming
Man
What are the hella chances of that?
And owned operator
The shop character
A current banner
Not a rate up
Not a limited
And the possibilities
With a free pull
I bought her the moment she came into the shop
And the game just slaps me on the face with this
One
I just bought Surtr not to long ago <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Ain't no way it's free pull in limited
What are
The chances
<@447218009749061632> come see this abomination
There is just no way
This game is really guilt tripping me 
Seriously
What?
It's decided then
Nyx
First of All
It's not enough to unlock an Elf
Second, I am a pleb, free to play pleb
Oi
Look who are you talking to
Hmm
What to spend on
LMD and Battle Records Crisis begins once again
Now I Have Blue Woman, Red Woman, Well, Maybe not WaterGun Woman
Bought her
So not a jump scare <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Well..
Sold out within an hour
Meanwhile JP and SEA are zoomin
Oh
SEA still have 3k books left?
That's a surprise
As long as your body can
So do I
I've been on edge the whole time
Why so so?
So
Anyone else got the book here?
You'll be lucky if theres a book left this hour
Should be just around 1k this hour
Watching the limited purchase slowly go to it's limit really made me more tired
I have to spend a total of 4 hours to catch up
Anyways
I am 111% worn out of this week of school
I barely have a total of 15 hours of sleep <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
Surtr Shop <:Terismol:994096001197543444>
I am off to eat and bed after it's done
I am waiting for this damned Video to upload
It's taking too long and I am hungry and sleepy <:Teririp:1005466940128628756>
That's still a pity at least
It's so hot so early in the morning
Sniper Knights
Same <:Terismol:994096001197543444>
I'll pull next Limited Banner
Hopefully I have enough for a pity by then
What's the Pull Income per Update?
Back to 0 Pulls <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Yeah, kinda feel bad after I finally got better
And Irene Dupe
It's processing
8k and 150 OP I believe?
Buuut
I basically lost 60 Pulls
Lesson Learned
Don't play Gacha Games when Sick
I think I was kind of sick and something gotten into to me spent all of my Orundum and Originate Prime
I don't know what really happened
In a blink I lost all of gacha resources
I don't know what happened... But...
Baban
You here?
I did
But at what cost?
But should I?
I think I should refrain from pulling further
I got Irene And Mudrock within 20 Pulls
Ain't no fcking way
Being sick for 4 days straight and while in class is surely a pain
School Lunch is almost over
It's Class'in Time
Probably
But yeah, I'm mostly vibin in my grave most of the time
Too busy with school
Meanwhile me currently in class
Morning fellas
Too Busy With School Works.

EZ
Honkai stuck on updating settings
Nothing new
Okay
It's settled
Time to get back on Honkai

And realize I don't have enough storage
If you missed one day
You messed up totally
Well, the problem in the first place is that
If I even have a storage for it
The thing is though
I'm not going to do well in Abyss or MA
It's an Art Work
That thing is worth some value
But you have to be fast
I might get back
A week, did it only just get started?
How do you get the tokens?
Oh shoot
How many is left?
Wait, it's not guaranteed? A raffle or something?
How hard it is to get?
How do you get it?
How do you get the tokens?
But I know I spent a quite sum
Probably
And around 70 for Skins
I am not just spending anything it at all
But maybe I just spent over 50 OP for Stamina <:Terismol:994096001197543444>
Currently, doing good in general, just finished New Chapter Last in Adverse Environment
I literally don't have challenges cleared at all yet
311
Live2D Skins
Rosmontis, NearlAlter, W Skin, and Passenger
I think Im saving my OP
3.5 with Texas Alter update seems very broken
Irene or W would be nice
I saw W and Skadi Alter on it
W is on the banner too right?
Oh
You're getting both?
Killing SeaBorns
Baban
How many pulls do you have for next week?
We are getting fed in Arknights This Week and Next Week
<:Terismol:994096001197543444>
Hmmge
Imagine going around your school make your classmates to roll for you in a Gacha
Texas Alter too

The 3.5 Banner screams BALANS
with being the free 6* star operator too
Also
Whole Terra vs The Demons?
Collaboration
Arknights x Monster Hunter
November 3
Does anyone have me as their friend in Honkai (SEA)?
Not Ufotable
Definitely not the Anime
EN
That didn't came out for me

<:Terismol:994096001197543444>
Just a Short Story
Not the anime
Wait, nevermind
The Genshin Anime Trailer is out
<:Terismol:994096001197543444>
And since I've just E2'ed Ceobe
It'll take a while to E2 Horn
Who doesn't like a swordmaster that wields a Gun
Yup
I guess I'll have to use my Originite Prime
Oh, I guess it's Stultiffera Navis update
Well, the next banner is the Anniversary Right?
But, was it worth the value?
Actually
I did it in our classroom, letting my classmates pull for me
Exactly
Around 40 pulls
I lied.
.
<@447218009749061632>
Around 30 Pulls
Happy Birthday Aster
May the another year ahead will be in your favour
Just a 10 pull? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:Terismol:994096001197543444>
Atleast it's 50/50 now without Saria getting in the mix
Ain't no way I'm using Medic tag again without Support tag
But the fact I got a new OP by only using Top Operator Tag works out
Oh, Kay could fill a role into my Casters since GoldenGlow is doing a work
I'll probably pass
And Horn?
Smile
I am both pulling in Limited Banners
I am.
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>

12mins for another Qiqi perhaps
Quite these days isnt it?
Hah, Can't relate, I can't believe I manage to complete it my low star units coming up with my own Strategy too
<:Bedge:990510746238611527>
You can debuff those Elite Enemies by using the Boss black field if they're in it
The boss is not completely the problem
The Enemies that comes after the Boss are the problem
Not yet, I'm trying to utilize the dominion to debuff the Enemies
Copium
Time Runner not having a rerun
with the moonbase being added, that's another hit to the total storage
When is the next honkai update coming in?
Evening
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Same for me too, I'd pass
Hi there

Pulling The Horns?
Babab
Of course
Nokia is always superior in such departments
There's no such thing as perfect for the most part
It all comes down to preference or what kind of thing you're going to use it for
That's all there is to it
Pretty much Restrictions and Management sucks alot for IOS
Then why are you buying a Gaming Phone for that taking pictures in the first place?
Again, that a game Issue for the most part of the Game
When it comes to android, there's brands that specialized in certain aspects like ASUS ROG for Gaming
That a Game Issue
You're not running Warzone in it
What it's even considered as Heavy Games
Android can also run heavy games nowadays you know?
It's the variety of games/apps
That's not the point
Still, if you're ever going to use Iphone for gaming, you can only download certain apps/games
Unless you break it's warranty and jailbreak
If I'm going to ever get an Iphone or Ipad again, I'll just make it to a Drawing device
But that's what suits my needs, and Android fulfills that
Though, I prefer android because it gives you more freedom than a block of brick of an apple is
Don't know what you're talking about
With minimal damage at all
It sure is
It's 3 years old
Nah, Android
Great
Hmm, how big is it now?
Kind of want to play Honkai again but that's no Bueno because Honkai is waaaaay too big for 32GB storage phone now
Surtr Shop Guaranteed I Hope
I haven't read anything but, the answer is like we aren't planning any endgame content like Abyss not We aren't planning any endgame content?

Just the background and floating crystals/mirrors left <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
That was fun.
Get Pinged.
If I go for Medic, it's Shining or Nightingale
If I go for sniper, It's Exu Schwarz
I feel like I'm taking 50/50 for both
What should I pick?
Eh?
Uuuh
As it should be
Yeah, they should've just keep their face hidden
Doctor is Self Insert
But it would makes sense that they sound/look to be more experienced when they're literally unknown years old
If she's going to be a She
She should have thag Matured Voice, not that a 15 years old
Nah
It's Gender Neutral
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
I expected the Doktah to have a deep distorted voice or even muffled
But, Round Eyes and High Young Pitch Voice <:huh:966619839307321394> 
That would make sense if the Doktah is young and all
But No
Just why? 
<:huh:966619839307321394>
...
I'm kind of... Conflicted
<@447218009749061632> what's your thoughts about Anime Doktah, The Voice and The Eyes
Fenri
Remember that Honkek GBL is 1 patch behind
So is the Revenue Updates
That +140% in CN was the Herrscher Patch
The GBL doesn't have HoEgo yet
No idea
Red = Positive
Green =Negative
Ask CN
Every Month in CN
It just goes down in Half
Can't wait to watch those GBL Revenue Drop
HoEgo/Human in CN
Or watch this video
For Mobile games
Or Sensor Tower

*Alive And Well*
I wouldn't be saying Stop Right There if I'm meaning something else
Stop Right There
Hmm
I wonder who should I draw next..
Yes, there was no sht
Shampoo tastes bitter as ever
Seems like I need to change the shading for the power part
What kind of dance is it with Someone's Opposite Gender's Birthday
Even being more difficult because it's 1 on 1 Duo
I have no experience so
Yeah
It's somewhat worrying and nerve wracking
It's somewhat a tradition I think?
I have to attend someone's birthday and dance with them
Yabai Yabai Yabai
Just for this one
Nevermind 

Well... Yeah, for majority of what I draw
Thank you, it's just a sketch, but it'll probably could've been alot better, also not just using 3 Brushes
I could do that buti dont have enough time and to be seen edgy in school ya know
A Minutes Sketch when I had nothing to do in School

I think my Classmates are weirded out because I speak English in conversations <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
We surely have enough time
Uhhh.. we got 5 days to complete our assignments A week to finish and present 3 Groups Presentation
2 Weeks to finish and present a class project for one subject

No public transport available currently..
So much to do
Oh Lord
We have so many assignments and projects that is so time consuming with tight deadline
Geez
The Tokyo Game Show Is Tomorrow Right?
My phone got a tiny crack, sadge
Speaking from experiences from others
Well, it's a requirement really, happy or not, you must do it
If not, you'll just get yourself more trouble down the line
As you should be.
For Aster's Situation
It's better to deal with it
It's the last thing to do before school ends, you just have to attend and do it, at least you have a record
If you didn't, you might just get in trouble for later, alot of it
You can stay at home if you have a good enough excuse like having a fever or sht like that, well, that's all
PeepoLeave
Give good advice Challenge (impossible)
Heki being a bad example down to earth
Have A Read

Where's the Concert <:clueless:973756617109676032>
Oh
I see
How long was the First Anniversary?
Nah, it'll be longer
It's the Anniversary right?
Oh, Nevermind
3rd or 4th though
Shes Zoomin PauseChamp?
...
Imagine not having an assignment because no one added you in the group chat
My class is surely a chaos of a personality
Seems like I'll be a little bit late huh
Fed
UIs
Rice Shower Is Literally one of the hardest Characters to finish the game with
But this chance don't come often, I will never when I will get her
So yeah, Rice Shower It is
Rice Shower...
Let me
<@180679257851166721>
First... Pull?
You should see the Gacha Animation
First Race and I already more than 10 already in a spam of a minute
Drink a shot whenever the caster mentions your Horse when she is winning
Juan
Hmm
I think that's why there's no EN Version
Seems like they're not really good at managing
The usual then
Hmm
Does Guts skill sucks
And Supports are still overpowered?
What happened
Literally why it's like one of the most popular game in JP
Alot of people find it entertaining ya know
It's Rougelike
You just watch the Race
But you have train your Horse beforehand
Alot of Preparation..
Your Horse Race
Stories that I will never read because not nihongo jozu
Probably Models and Voiceovers I guess too?
How's this Game 8GB? huh
Genshin Switch aha
Just Bash Your Head Into The Wall until it works
But with Anime Girls
Do you Like Horse Racing?
Time to play this game out
Base Color Done I Suppose
Maybe I have enough time to save, just maybe
Speculation she will come out in shop in Nov?
She will come out
Copium
Surtr?
But then, who should I target for with Yellow Certificate
Oh okay
Also maybe I should buy Eyja now too
Better Schwarz
Whatever, just want to see Fiammetta raining down hell
One of Those hmm
Also, AFK Setup too perhaps
I mean, kinda want to commit Arson Bombardment to the enemies
Wha
But I'm surely going all out when Gavial Alter and Russian Girl Banner comes out
I surely want to do a 10x in Fiammetta Banner though
Better than getting another Shining
I mean, Saria is not that bad
Nice
I have Saria instead
Oh
Well
NG?
Ethan tho
Hmm
Ambushers I guess
Just be lucky with Arts Dodge smh
In general
They're pain to deal with
And those Fireball enemy thingy thingy
Whatever, they have the same mechanics
I know, Don't want to call them Lazurites Trained Armorless Union
Damn Lazurites
Defender Dies

Everyone Dies
I don't have time to try different things because School, so busy, that's why I only finished CC yesterday dedge
I Tried SA/Thorns/Surtr Core, didn't worked with my current arrangement of operators or I didn't tried hard enough
I mean, it's up to you because it's literally up to you how difficulty you want it to get
This is where most players looks forward into
It's Contingency Contact, Literally the Most Anticipated Event Series where you spent your sanity away
Poor Fried Ptilo and Myrtle
I forgot to count of how many times this happened now
I guess it's time to add more security 'prevention' measures
Hmm
Got it back?
It's surely way easier than the last CC South Prison
<@447218009749061632> finished the new Annihilation
I'm sure it'll be easy to take back if it's connected to something, most successful with phone I guess
Do something about it now
If you can't reset your password)
/Claim your account by any means 
Contact CS
Well, that's literally the selling point of the game.
Think
If you can't finish PvZ
You're in for hell in Arknights
ReBoot Doesn't Want To Get Mald Than They're Already is
Fenri
It's Twitter
When do you think a small kind of thing will go pass by without a little bit of drama
Heck, even non-existent kind of stuffs even get dramas in Twitter
I'll just go back to sleep
2 Hours Of Sleep eh
Morning
But I heard from the rumors that it's only a reveal of the new area
Anyone placing bets if Tokyo Game Show will reveal Star Rail's release date?
Hmm
March 7th Looks, Elysia..
March 7th Powers, ...
Are you sure you really need HELP?
Check Again
Baban's?
Tet saw Diluc's Magical Girl Transformation
911 on dial.
But there's an accomplishment
No celebrations, no food, no gift
Nothing at all
Well, nothing really special happened
It's like any other day
But it's still quite an Omen isn't it?
Yeah, you're right
All Im going to say that I share it with The World Trade Center, aka Twin Towers
I've been hinting my birthday these past few days shake my head
But still, Quite A Thank You, made my night to have a comfortable sleep
I'm quite disappointed that no one noticed
If I didn't said anything at all guess I'll never get any birthday greetings
It was yesterday
Not quite the date, it's too late
Oh, I'm 17 now, quite my name and my favorite number I guess
Tokyo Game Show in 3 Days
They're very independent

They have nothing to do with another one's development or progress
To each to their own
Different teams for that
Traveler seems to care less and less now
It's More World Building than Character Developing/Building
Aranara Story Quest is Lore Flavored Fillings
When Story Focused Games Have Too Much Story:
Another day will soon pass, oh well
Ack, my cat is not letting me do anything geez, leave me alone for awhile
Maybe not
It seems like my body hasn't recovered yet
Alright, I'll take that instead
I wonder if it's a bad idea to workout today if my whole body is going to be in pain and sore when it's the day of school again
What a petty thing to do in a some petty kind of game
Is there any evidence?
How is it rigged
Elysian is M...
I don't know if I can show up either
Then it's tonight for me
Sep 11 or Sep 12
Just say the date smh
Tomorrow or Today?
So
What now
<@468680026162724864> I thought you asked where I am
You never said for me to hop on
I interpret it normally
Hold up
When. was it again Fenri
Ahem
Hmm
Did you pinged me?
When was that?
What a way to ruin my non special day
Don't even make arrangements if isn't going to happen in the first place
Disappointedge
There's no need for that
You failed my expectation
Nothing
Fen
ri
12 Subjects to pass
Going to be tough year
To add into that
If I fail one subject
It's literally failing the whole school year
Ouch
For our school year

We are going to do statistics...

And Alot of, Essays
Literally the specialization of one the subject
My wound is kind of feeling uuuh, heavy? Don't know how to describe it
He only said later this night
But oh well
He didn't even pinged if he even started
Aaw, I was kinda looking forward to it
Oh
Fenri didn't do the karaoke today correct?
Kind of a little bit of cringe when I read whenever I wrote on that thing
This is what I drew for my Class Activity eh

The Topic Is Uuh, The Story of Our Life As An Artist Until Now If I remember correctly
Hmm, I don't know if posted it here before but
Seems like you're not getting that 8 hours of sleep too
It is Sunday
Another Day For Me I Suppose
New Age Of Mine
Oh
I think it's just my lack of sleep
I think
My memory is horrendous anyways
But I felt like I posted it like the same before

Hmm

Maybe I just forgot
Felt like you've said that 6 times now whenever I post that image 
Stare
Though, I'll redraw it again in the base line layer
But hey, it's at least better
After
Eyes
Before:
Yeah, after this, I'm going to analyze my drawing when I finished and see what things I should focus or improve, then I'll get into pen pressure
What's the use of pen pressure if you can't draw anyways
Before starting with pen pressure, I need to figure out how to draw basic objects first dedge
Yeah, I know about that
I'm still practicing with my pen pressure to achieve that kind of thing
But first, I'll go with flat lines first and not involve pen pressure, I don't have to worry about that, if I do, it's going to take so much longer, so I'm learning piece by piece
For now, I'm just practicing drawing a character with basic tools
Sure thing
Still need to add minor line details tho
Base Line Layer Done
You didn't even pinged me shake my head
Letting us down
Geez Fenri
Just drawing
Is Fenri out of the rain yet?
I can only do 3 songs probably
Sure, guess I'll make an exception
I can only join around this time if we are going do it today
<@468680026162724864> still out?
I see
Oh, Greetings There Remmyyy
Uh, I don't know what im talking about, I'm just too tired I guess
Weirdly enough, people have different interpretation I guess
I don't know though
I didn't know that U Up have a hidden meaning huh
Well, some people sometimes can't sleep, they seek a company at night sometimes to kill time and make themselves fall asleep
Eeeh, whatever
Isn't that normal?
You Lazurites..
...
Sure
It's also beneficial I guess
If so, I'm down I suppose
You wanna do VC karaoke again?
I just remembered how bad I was when I need to present in our class with 2 hours of sleep
My Brain was not working at all
Its so bad..
3-6 weeks at best before I can run heh
It's not bad now
I still feel like sht tho
And my body feels it doesn't have that much strength anymore
Accident and my Toe got fcked
But if I still did sudden moves it still kind of stings
Thank goodness
I can walk minimally now
So My second choice is Warriors
I also would like to choose Spurs but, I remember Cat Furs stick out more with colors like that under the sunlight
Pain
But... Remember
Cat Furs
Which one do you think would suit me?
Cope, Hope and Pray that it doesn't evolve
When you realize that you were not that young anymore and you're not going to experience being young again soon enough and it's been washed because of the pandemic
 sad
Are you ready for a potential chapter 2?

MonkeyPox
Sure is
Damn
I'm 17 soon
I was 13-14 when the pandemic happened 
Huh
*World Trade Center Complex*
I don't want to spend my birthday bedridden I hope
It's even more crazy because it's almost my anniversary too
What misfortune awaits me
This day is quite unlucky for me
And it was mother death anniversary
Well that's something
And what a coincidence..
I can feel my body collapsing after that adrenaline wears off...
Or I'll be bedridden for weeks
It may at least feel a little bit better tomorrow I hope
Like whenever I even lift this off the ground
It hurts so much
Luckily, it's strained, not broken
I think I have to
I need to go to school or I'll be doomed for sure
But 20KM is quite a tough one
I maybe able to walk next week but... Not normally
Yeah... 3-6 weeks...
But my foot... Is not throbbing in pain whenever I move it
I got into an accident when I was going home from school
Yeah
I maybe not able to walk for several days...
Yeah, getting out of an accident alive is pretty emo dontcha think?
Just a really bad day of school heh
Nah, just me and my sister
We are trying to aid it now
Welp...
Well
It got that bad with even jeans on
It's not that bad right?
Oh, not spoilerd
I think first aid can patch this
Oh that's bad
It's.. severe than I thought
Nope...
Oh...
Oh...
Just bruises I guess?
And the part under knee was also got hit
Hey, at least my toe nail isn't ripped off, don't want to deal with blood
And hope it heals soon enough maybe
No
Just walk it off
It's concerning
I can't move my Toe that much anymore
Just what a fantastic day
Had 2 Hours Of Sleep
Very Fatigue 
My white shirt got splashed on with wet dirt whilst going to school 
Almost lost one of most important school grading document while breaking my toe in the process and I have to walk back home with it..
Not really..
This is one hella of a day..
Kind of...
I just got into an accident...
What a great day..
Maybe not
But it's Called Territory Battle
If I remember correctly
I have listened to the song before, just the whole song, no visuals
But I don't remember where
But it's out there
Importantly this one
Eh
Not that
6 months probably
But there's a few songs that was in the trailer that haven't released yet
Is it only Album exclusive I wonder
Just have to wait for months for the next month
Alright, have a good rest or it will turn into a jelly
Yeah, I do that too
When I told myself I'm going to sleep around 9pm
Later, I found myself still awake
4am
Hey, that's better than waking up in the morning
Can you help with mine
Just fixed my computer once again
And it brak again next week
Ah..
I can feel the fatigue accumulating and it's taking a noticable toll on me
My year is a few days away, maybe I'll do a resolution
Though, I pretty much need to sacrifice my free time but hey, no pain no gain I guess
That's pretty interesting for such a mini market
They even did a Collab with Bandori and Hololive
Oh, this mini-market also does alot of Collab
It's pretty old
School Supplies I Think
Being Senior Student surely have your work increase tenfold
When you're too successful that your games will take the Top 3 Spots but the Judges Said No <:clueless:973756617109676032>
I feel I was just 14 not too long ago hah..
Hey, it's almost another year again
Time surely does fly by 
The more it comes true the older you get
Most Topics posts are either irrelevant or just straight up borderline nude
You know 
Twitter recommendation and algorithm is garbage at most
My bad
Was it tasty?
Or my memory is just really that bad as always
I feel like I've never seen Carv talk here ever before
Carv I see
So uh, since the Most Sane Person is no longer here in the server, who do you think would inherit it?
I just bent my spoon like it's in it's 90's cause of how tough this chicken is
I'm really slow ugh
I'm trying to make the lines clean and sharp after this rough sketch, but it's taking me forever, I might be only able to able to finish artwork within a week
I guess it is clean and smooth enough?
Interesting enough
Being Simple is not that bad in some situations I suppose
Just finished coloring it
Going to do the base drawing tomorrow
I just finished the sketch color, hmm, the eye surely looks off
Now is uuh, a tough time because you'll be playing CC8, which is one of the most hardest event series out there, well remembering you haven't gone that far into the game yet, I'm sure you'll be fine and geared up for the next event
Yeah, Maybe
I see, planning to get back into it?
Cat
Oh, my bad, my memory is a piece of dirt
You've played before
Just a word of warning
Brain Usage Required
But it'll be useless when the Strategist itself is no brainer
Difficulty Down- Unlocked
My whole body is Spain without the S
80k more LMD to able to E2 Thorns
-50% DP Regen, Deployment Limit and Corruption Crossbowmen feelin be like fun
Chen can't kill Candle Knight and Blood Knight in time, what tarnation is this
I... Risk 18..
I'm done with sketching, time to <:Despairge:1002519666050211941> tomorrow
Hmmge
I also sprained my foot
My way back home is surely enjoyable
Look what I found when I was going home
Risk 18 mhm
Why is it so hot early in the morning
I'm trying
Dedge
Ah yeah, Today is Miku's Celebration
All I know it's just a witty banter, and that's all there is
There's no need to apologize, if it makes your worries go away, I'll accept it heartedly
Who don't like the feeling of Beating a Unique/Hard Boss, wait, that's just Souls series at this point

Well, I somehow understand if you need to defeat it in daily basis
Well, I'm the type of person who likes to have more such things like Nihilus Husk
But Husk's Heels Wheels tho
A Good Kind of Abomination That Is
I wonder if I should buy a Body Pillow
His concept and physical design is fantastic
But they took too far with his Combat Capabilities
It's more like a Habbit now
But I still like hugging pillows when laying down though
It might sound weird or childish
Also I've been trying to ask this question for a long time but it just leaves my mind after
If he's going outside or does that everyday, yeah, it's questionable, but if he's only staying at home,I guess it's totally fine to give him a pass
Importantly if you're going to use soap and shampoo akot
Yeah, Showering alot can actually do bad than good
People who don't shower for a day if they're aren't going outside anyways 
Well, it's a different matter if you're sweating alot tho, I guess it only works in chill weather
Actually, I want to ask your opinion about this
Baban and Aster
It might be just Culture Difference after all
Correct?
I mean, Comfort Room is technically correct
Because you really feel Discomfort when you're about piss or sht
Comfort Room is where you unload yourself right?
Why are shtting in the Bath-Room
Bath
What's so weird about that
People who uses Comfort Room and doesn't wash their Hands be like
Can you bring in some
I'm just saying that Feces is more disgusting
You Comparing Feces to A Greasy face is tame
Yes, did you assume that I'm pointing out that Feces is less hygienic than armpit and a greasy face?
Feces is still different tho
Such privilege to get a time like that
I'm in my opinion
Still better
Don't tell me your comfort room is a size of a closet
After using Bidet, use Toilet Paper to swipe off the moist or just use heated seat if you're that privilege
Yeah, Exactly
I know people have a shelf for soap and a container for water
Uuh
Imagine dumping and you have to wait to shower to wash it off
You need to see yourself out and get a Bidet
Baban
Enough
But I remember CC doesn't give LMD
Also, I just need 250k LMD to E2 Thorns ugh
Baban, have you done the CC yet?
Diabozo forgetting that It's playing a thing called a Game
Despairge
Gone
I'm just gonna take my hours of sleep back
When that happens, the Other Spectrum of Twitter will now throw a tantrum
I think it's existed even before /hmmge
There's only 2 Human Skin Colors In Tevyat you know /'clueless'
But if you're going to commission someone/tailor it for you
It's going to cost you alot
Fenri
Most Cosplayers don't buy their cosplays

They make it themselves
Say Hi
Huh
I think it's a You Problem Skill Issue Epi
Epi, I think that's not how it works
If this goes on for years
We are toast
It's blazing hot as hell
I'll just hope I don't fall asleep while going home
I feel like I would collapse going home
Yup, 4 hours of sleep really helped me alot to cease my function
Peaceful isnt it?
But my class starts in 30 minutes
I don't hella know
This is such incompetence
We are piling up here outside the school gate
Banban
Such Curse does she have
She doesn't have a module even in CN yet
Poor GoldenGlow Tho
Yeah, is Nearl's module upgrade that Worth it
<@447218009749061632> Is Nearl Alter's Module worth it?
Traveling makes me dizzy, motion Sickness Innit
Come and get rest after you hit 88
Grats on 1 Valk Revive
Grats on 1/4 of a pull Tet
I think Travelling makes me feel motion Sickness for a bit
Tommorow Is A Painful Dawn
Morning
I think 4 hours of sleep and no lunch will be coming to bite me throughout this day
It's so bad that I have a test tommorow
Today, I'll get non-existent hours of sleep
Social Interactions
We Seekin Dawn
Whatever
Going to get busy again
It's. Monday
I'm just saying Night the hell
*Oyasumi*
Twitter's at it again
Well, I'll be more surprised if there's no drama for a day
Hmm
Done For This Page
I don't know if I fixed the shape correctly but oh well
Shaded it anyways
The random lines are to separate the muscles
It didn't download ugh
Wait, I'll send a clear version
Doing some shading
What does the code gave?
That was it
Well, thought there would be a special sneak peak
Well, that was fantastic
Twitch

Honkai Concert is now in 15min Countdown
There I go
Tet
Where's Tet
Who knows
Were you disappointed?
I guess it's turns out positive

But I'll guess she need to wait until I get enough LMD and EXP
*Sigh*
...
I see, here we go
I'm waiting for Baban to make an input
I haven't made a decision yet
So..
Or I YOLO it with only Top OP
Nightingale, Saria or Shining
Uuh..
Yeah, now, be prepared next patch, because I'm sure it'll only get bigger
The underground sections that is
When you thought Sumeru is small

Genshin have another Voicelines now in co-op when your ally have low HP and the first thing you hear from Xiao is Weak
I don't know whether I can do something
Uuuh
We are going to do something related art this afternoon
Eh, by the way, it's already this hot first thing in the morning
Man
Maybe next time fen
Don't do anything weird will you
I'm In public
Don't have the time
Maybe I should treat myself a little bit better
I'm in a public transport right now
Summer
Such privilege
Wow
Bet
Fun
I only got 4 hours anyways
And more Dendro ticks
If I remember correctly
Traveler does like 2000% with Electro Infused Burst
Also Dendro Traveler is decent and Useful
Yeah
Yeah
You also get Collei when you start the quest
I left since Enkanomiya
Maybe
Or *Su*
You should just save for cyno tet
Yeah
Imagine
Do you ever travel 10km first thing in the morning
When's the update again In Arknights
That still exists
Oh
What raid?
Morning Baban
Computer Doesn't Feel Too Good
Do you know that Dendro Traveler Electro Infused Burst Deals 2000% Damage
It's to see how much electro got stronger with aggravate
It's not about how long does it take to take down
It basically buffs Electro/Dendro vice versa
Also

Dendro Traveler is actually decent
Watch/Try and See

Mhm, it certainly does make Electro characters more stronger

Now Baal will just get more stronger too
Yeah
Aggravate is somewhat broken
Buff Electro to Oblivion
But there's multiple underground sections.. alot of it

*Despair?*
Oh
Hope so
But right now, I'm just doing the story 
There's really not much to do until you progress eh
Exact-ly
But there's a problem
Hey, that's a nice offrate atleast
So tightly
My cat is gripping me, aah
Heh
I mean

Try
Play it
<@803575968374849536> have you played integrated strategies yet?
I'd say pretty niche
But if used right, it will be marvelous
But it's 3k True Damage in exchange
50atk% and 50+ASPD for S3 if I remember correctly
If your teammates survives, they will get the buff
Friendly Fire Button
Let me put it this way
...
I think Art means I'm just away playing AK
Feels like someone summoned me
<@213811388546678794> First Free Pull 5* Freebie
Interesting
Anything interesting?
Everyone seems busy than ever
Maybe Drills or something like that, that's just my guess
Thanks, will look into it later
Good one
Traffic
Alot of it
Well if isn't it Tuesday
I gotta sleep as well or my remaining 4 hours of sleep will only get shorter each passing seco-

..what?
Oh? Isn't it COTE Monday
Bedge
G'nigh't
Huh
This pal sleeps on top of the oven
Fen, how was the Event?
But, you must
Let's say if you got a cut/paper cut and it bled for an hour

Do you think you should start worrying if you got hemophilia
No idea what you're on about
Hah?
Hmm
1 brush
Im doing muscles and faces first before any other type
Need to understand the hell is anatomy before hand
Just doing what K-Sensei is teaching
There was no words indicating that I'm even defending
All I know is that, it's a work of fiction, it can take any amount of inspiration and make it to their own, that happened numerous counts now, even most of it indicating/disclaiming that it's not related to actual people, events, groups or organization as said above
For me, as an individual, I really do no care about these issues, to be accurately represented or not, I do not. Give a Fuck.
Thinking that I should wake you 4 hours early to workout, shower, prepare, travel and relax
When I thought I already got used to it
So
Wait
Oh, I need to wake up early
I don't have any time to take a debate right now because my hands are full for literally weeks right now
Okay, I'm going to give one of my laziest take, now, Explain FGO or Honkai Stigmatas
Also, people seems to forget about this
Isn't this the Dendro Icon?
Did something went wrong or she just controls sand like water
There's only 3 Models in Genshin
Kid, Teen and Adult
If I remember correctly?
You meant Teen Model?
Whatever I'll just mind my own business, it doesn't affect either way, I have too much on my plate to mind
First
Which/Who/What is the main source of income
How about in Business Perspective/Standpoint
Twitter HellHole You Go
I'd say that The Desert Area isn't even fully done yet
Or even... FGO
You could say the same with Honkai Stigmatas
Eh, what I am talking about, I don't even play the game anymore
I don't think it's Based
But more of Inspired
Seems like there's a Drama Content in the neighborhood
Done
Yeah
Wait
...
That's a month
8/25
I'm going to look myself
How long until it ends-
Yes, upto Baal Boss Fight
Okay, opening up epic seven
Just like I Solo Traveler all Story in Genshin
May slowly climb out in PvP, quite tough
Well she is, but you see, the player is the Doctor
Same goes for, The Traveler
Im not really interested FMAC, so, if the character is Gacha, I may have to pass
Oh, cool but yeah
Do you know what's the next banner?
Sad, shouldve played when the Collab came out
I see
I didn't really use Amiya that much

If Doctor, You the player, if playable
Thats that.
Valid enough or it'll be broken
Not really

If it was the Doctor ofcourse, what I meant the character you're playing as, yeah, let's put it that way
Oh, is it per attack or hit?
Seems good enough when facing enemies with AoE or multi hits
Does enemy AoE have more chance triggering her counter?
As an Immersion Player as I am
I always use Story characters in story missions, importantly, The main character must be in the party at all times
Maybe that should've gone into other luck department
I used Rem as a support earlier and the counter got activated 3 times in a row
Sadly I missed it
Theyre seem useful and cool enough
I could've chosen other heroes but forced to choose sigret instead because of Wyvern
Do you have Re:zero collabs chars?
Wait, wrong reply
Oh well
I'm already in Chapter 4
Building for Wyvern be like:
Will
Global
I don't know when will I do the story challenges
Well, I don't know
I also started playing epic seven
I guess I'll build Warfarin soon
Her S1 seems good enough to stay in E1 for awhile
Yeah, I saw the runs with her
Whom shall I thou grant thy build upon after Thorns
Hellagur or Pallas
Banban
..What?
It's Torture
Anyways, does anyone find waking up around 4:30 *Fun*
You just ate your own words
I see
What kind?
An Event?
*Watch carefully, this is the Destreza of Iberia!*
You know what

I'm going to make my brain more active than before, time to play Epic Seven
I want my thick hair back eh..
The more I despise it
The more I think about it
I don't have a choice I'd say
Kinda hate it
Nah, my hair just cut very short and thin
Stupid rules..
I'm slowly regretting having my hair cut
Why is it too cold suddenly
My cut has been bleeding for the past 20 minutes with applied pressure.. that's worrying
Uuuuh... I can't stop bleeding
I just got an haircut, only to realize I'm quite fond of my thick hair
And 2 Dogs
Yeah
Yeah.. but how about taking care of 16 Cats Instead?
Maybe I should clean their eyes tommorow
Also... There's more of them.
They know that if you're eating the food with spoon and forks, means, it's for yourself
But the moment you touch the food your own bare hands, they know that you're going to give it to them
Well, every cat in the household right now knows that
She knows
Chillin
I have like, 2 Cats infront of my plates right now, they won't do anything unless I give it to them
Oh... They do
Not that baseball kind of throw
I didn't do anything that can severely harm
Cats can make themselves land on their feet
Also, even I threw it, it's kind of more kind than you think
But dont abuse it will you?
You're lucky that we still even let you in and tolerate for alot of times
I love my cats, but that kind of pissed me off
Literally stealing my food in front of me
The stray cat even stole a whole fish my relative supposed to cook
I've been tolerating it and holding back for... How many times now?
It was the stray cat we are letting in the house, take shelter and whatnot, even food

But if you stole a food, in front of what I'm eating

You will know the price

Don't bite the hand that feeds You.
I just threw a cat across a Wall
Game Really giving me Operators that have Self-Sustain
So many new useful operators but sunk in resources...
Please make her stop or I'll make her mute
Be Hitting LVL 60 Real Soon
But as always, Ling with her... Lines
Sad Cat and Pink Cat English Voicelines
Hmm
Guard Operators..
Now I have too much Guards in Arknights
But my Relative surely have a poor taste for choosing it anyways
I don't know whose idea and design this is for a Case
My relative bought me a case and this is the case he bought..

But a new condition case in good shape is still better than a beat down case
Who would even willing to wash mountain of dirty plates with a toothpick size of water coming out of the faucet
Damn this climate
Is that normal
And I feel kinda off when I drank that cold water
The sun is literally above us
Well technically it's half of my fault for wearing long sleeves
It's so blazing hot
My New School once again

Need to check my schedules and suchs
10KM away
I should get used to this soon
Again.
Going Somewhere
But that's no fun
I know
Might just save for Chen Alter
If I'm feeling something, might pull Horn, even maybe Irene, or Gavial, Or that Other Pink Girl

And Chen Alter
Nah
Fiametta, I can't memorize her name but, Arson Bombardment Latereno Girl
Hmm, how's that?
I spent 24 Tickets and 47k Orundum
60 Pulls
Ofcourse

She's Home
That's all
After
Before

Ugh
<@447218009749061632> <@881369538946531338> 
My Friends
My Barbecue for dinner was kind of burnt, oh well
Uhuh
Sure
Some unfair Ice cream shop's don't fill it
Nice, but Cones
Yeah
2GB update huh
It already did 40 minutes ago
You know what did I do instead?
I can't climb back because well, the float was too thick and I'm quite young
When I was quite along, we gone to a resort with floating islands, you know those, and me quite alone in that part, I slipped through a gap and got stuck in there for like a minute or two just hanging tightly
Geez, what triggered it for me to remember
Haah, just got a memory of me almost drowning alone
HoDeath and HoB Sleeping
EX Kosma when then?
Oh
There will be a day that will come with SSS Kosma waiting for you in Memorial Arena
Genshin x Pizza Hut huh
Yeah.. Her Artist has gone crazy now.. 0 Sanity feeling
Tommorow's The Day, 9 Hours
You can List the reasons why
GoldenGlow is really cursed
Yeah, Many though she was a dog?
Yeah..
Their Ears Yeah
Isn't GoldenGlow supposed to be a Scottish Cat?
Losing 50/50 4 Times in a Row
Yikes
300 Pulls
But only 1 GoldenGlow, that's... On another level
The Character's Artist is pulling for the character she drew, and the Game's is not giving her anything at all just 1
Well this is painful
But when that happened, the devastation will hit rock bottom
Maybe heh
Or any Games, or even in everything
I guess it can be used in Gacha Games does it?
Desire Sensor means that the game will detect the you really want something but in result, the game will not give you the thing you desire until you forget about it or no long have interest in it
Maybe
What Do You All Think of Desire Sensor
Yep yep
But seems like I don't have enough resources to build Pink Cat and Him until then...
There is no luck

It's just A Feature yep
I forgot Skadi's S1 Exists
By Using Amiya and Nearl to finish off Talulah's 2nd face quickly before the cores pops up
The FireBalls were really a pain, Ling's Summons did help tanking it
Yup
No LMD and EXP
Sadly
The FireBalls too
The Ignites were such a pain
*None*
No
NG?
Guess who
Sure Thing
And there it goes
Awake
Pink Cat Dorime

I think you need atleast 500k LMD For Pink Cat E2, but there is no major source of LMD with her release
I don't have a single LMD and EXP because of this Donke-
Hmn
Finally... But what did it cost..? My LMD
You can see how moist my palm is because of travelling under the blazing sun
Anyways, Got back from home
Mhm
What is it?
Who knows, I'm just going to my old school again
Going somewhere again
Then Godspeed Baban, Godspeed
Have a proper rest and treatment after you get home, don't do anything reckless to make it worse I guess
Let's see
Blood Knight
Candle Knight
Corruption Fuc-
Drunk Knights
And The Darkness mechanic
But Hey, That Chen Tile Looking Sweet Tho
Guess The Next CC will be a Pain... Really
So, in summarize, A Light Spark in Darkness and CC will run side by side?
Meanwhile, I cannot move on until I get Amiya to promotion 2, I have no LMD, those 700k really just got spent in a few days
I don't remember, where is this again?
And there is no major source for LMD until the next CC
I have 1k LMD, but I need 500k+ LMD to get an Operator to promotion 2...
Broke
By non-clothed individuals, I mean, slightly, I want to find who still have their undergarments on
Yeah, I can't really see through it because of the clothes
I guess I should do with non-clothed individuals first
This one
Left side I guess
Despair
Well, I'm basically making it too hard for myself for choosing this image to work with
Does the arm looks big now
Got it
Aight
Deadge
It's so hard to find to base the anatomy on this guy with full of clothes
I'm just trying to baseline an anatomy of a picture
I'll try to fix it
Knee hmmge
Oh, it's Heki
I know something's off
Sure, I'm just practicing Anatomy for like, 4 days, I welcome it
Hmmmmmge
Hmmge
That's a thick worm
I think
It has English Voices, so, yeah
Remember the Teaser Site with the TV?
Hmm, I just thought of this just now, but I'm 75% sure ZZZ will have EN Voicelines
Baban, I Am Now Broke Once Again
That's an ancient fossil way of thinking 

I'm referring to those people y'all referring to
Alright, got some of my supplies
Another Live2D Into The Collection
I'll rest for tommorow, I have many things I have to do ahead of me

Child, rest when you feel like it, but don't burden your body and mind too much

Night and Take Care, Everyone
People have different way of learning things, yes, it's troublesome
So you have to teach someone who have the same learning pace as you are

If there is one
Then I'll Try To Get The Authorities Involved (?)
Ofcourse (Not Obviously), it must be always in Moral Standards
They Asked

Then They Shall Get The Answer They Seek For
Babysitting A Cat Or A Dog

Although if it will leave me some scratch and bite marks
Being Vague is also a safer way to do so
I mean, what's your Dominant Arm then?
It's okay to present things if it's in educational term don't you think?
We.?
Dominant or Subjective?
Something like that?
Refilling The Water Containers can get pretty messy though
I don't know, I just do it and life it with an arm
I can lift a Gallon of Water with no problem, but I guess that's normal
When did you got that impression from?
I think
I'm fairly sure I'm 5'4 by now
Did someone forgot to bring their Coat uh?
The Stiff One
After Thorns, who do you think I should buy when I have enough Gold Certs again?
Thorns will make alot of things easier
Surely?
Ah yeah, it was a pain to get all timings right
How SOON are we talking about?
?
EG-1
The 180 Gold Certs are ready
If Thorns ever appear in shop
Where else
People say this is the hardest secret ending to achieve

That means I will surely face other secret endings with ease... Right?
<@447218009749061632> I managed to keep them alive
Having a high grade and having awards helps you in the future, like Jobs and such
I luckily just slip pass being An Honorary Student, that's all
I need to go to my Old School to get my Award soon
Cool I Guess
A Year.
Who knows, we just have to wait a year and see
Then if it ever comes, I guess I'll try to get one of them
Baban, what do you think of Gavial Alter and Pink Bow Woman?
If it's within the possibility of Luck, we just have to try
Also Aiming For Flametta and Irene after
Cool
Yeah, it's quite noticable up close
I wonder who's the other Operator along with her Banner or only her?
Do they have alot of white hair?
<@447218009749061632> Pink Cat Pink Cat Pink Cat Pink Cat
Well, my bangs can reach the tip of my nose now
What does 6 Months of Not Cutting your hair looks like
After that, I'll draw muscles one by one
I tried to do a whole body in one go
Thanks, more reference
I only started practicing Anatomy 3 Days Ago
<@781539392039682058> Do you have any advice to give for Human Anatomy?
Eh, well then
That or You Puking because of it
I don't know which one is weirder
Baban, I Have Beaten Secret Ending 2
Elysia or Lee
Time to learn about Legs
Yet
RIP Bozo?
It's Back
It Just Ended
Not again..
3.0 Livestream Is Now Starting. . .
<@881369538946531338> By The Way, I'm going for all Secret Endings
I never actually took a screenshot of my resources before I pulled Ling
But all I know it only took 28 Pulls
Wait, wrong one
Ready For Pink Cat
Anatomy uwah
Pien
Tch
Well, The Torture Begins
Sure I guess
What?
What.
<50% Health
Finally
Cmon
Take Care, Time To Do My Daily Practice
It's time to reignite the flame once more
Welp
Meanwhile me, losing interest playing games
Just gotta keep grinding doing digital art
Oh dear indeed, but it's up to you whether you want to play or not
You can still play it however you want, just be informed what happened in the past and the current
But atleast, don't spend any money on it, that's my take on this
Alright then

Uhuh
But I guess I shouldn't send it
Just Got The Documents and A Thread Of Everything ToF Did
Go Ahead, I think your device can handle it
Anyways, Have Fun With The Queue, well, it's going to disappear soon enough
You start from zero
No
Mei Going Back To Real Kevin After Elysian Realm:
Ofcourse
...
And Done.
Thanks
Pink (Cat) Doggo Soon
I already have a module for Ling, I'm just wondering where I can upgrade it
But it seems like it's not available for Global yet
Ah, when will it be available?
Oh, it's not available for Ling Yet I see
Baban, how do I upgrade thy Modules?
Wait-
Ah yeah, NearAlter
Should I E2 her now?
The one who can Helidrop
I have the materials ready to E2... What's her name again?
Morning Baban
Here that is
25 More Minutes
Can't sleep yet
I don't know what to say why did you decide to spend on this game..
Guess, it's time to get some of my energy and spirits back
I guess I shouldn't do things when sleep deprived, it will get me nowhere and my brain wouldn't process the information and knowledge
I guess it will take some time
Learning Anatomy with Newbie Simple Shapes
-
I have long lost interest on it since the volley of fire of dramas back then
Just practicing doing digital arts
Not here obviously
Her Modules came in handy, that's for sure
Finally beaten the Event with Ling
Old Operators who doesn't have a skin:
Oh well, Take Care then
The latter huh, well, those costumes have bad quality, so they were hoping for childrens to take pictures with them and pay for it
Are they performing or just there standing there hoping anyone to take pictures?
I'll just mind myself
It's just whatever at this point
It's exhausting to this point
They can't be reasoned with
Not at all

Well some of them are, but they're aren't that open minded, they're stuck in the past
Specially the Elders
That's alot of problem when almost of your entire relatives are
Or whatever, Phones
They will always lead it to something religious or spiritual
It's just like talking a wall when explaining things to them
Skipping Lunch doesn't affect you that much they it can make you crazy
Mental Health doesn't exists, it's just bad spirits speaking to you
It's because of that Phone's fault
Elders, what a bunch of exhausting people
What alot of nonsense I am hearing right now
That's a very decayed excuse you got right there
Internal Clock Activated
I basically need to wake up 4:30 AM everyday soon
I'm just making my body get used to it again
Close Thy Eyes
Oh well
That's impressive if you have that much
I'm tired
Time to enter my 5 hours of slumber
What do we have here?
I also got a message containing that I was selected for a Family Beneficiary not too long ago
Anyways, I'm drawing my own Bangboo
Huh
You're Reflecting
I mean you're technically putting the pieces back together to see yourself with the mirror
A week is all you need to complete it
It's right there
Below
That's A Glass Baban
Here's a piece of mine
But your Account still have the most growth
Ah, oh well, but it was in a sleep slumber that was woken up months ago
I guess that's a mark
Arknights.
Today's something else
Do you know why?
Oh Hello There Baban
I remember Honkai Valkyrie enemies also Evade you and slow you down too

I hope they use that much often
That would a perfect recipe for cool fights and Malding
I play mostly for the Weapon

Not the Character

We aren't the Same
Gotta wait until a proper Huge Sword Character comes out
Soldier Blaze Through Their Armor and Flesh
Anton is the one who's in Shambles right now
I also like how Corin plays, it's feels satisfying to see your enemies grind to pieces and run through them for eternity
Trying out the game that is
We all do
The current test right now is not a Beta, it's a test of how the game runs

So that means there's another Beta not Faraway
That means...
ZZZ Tuning Test is for Performance, Delays, Netcode, etc, its usually done before doing a Beta
Or is it?
I wonder, Beta usually last longer than that
I guess it's not really a beta? Seems like it's a Test for combat and performance
4 Days I see, it's Tuning Test After All

His Attacks feels off, but he may perform well if the player itself is not braindead
It's kind of interesting that when you choose the MC you want, the opposite gets most of the Screentime instead
Hoyo sure loves them
She doesn't look like Kiana at all unless you're basing on the one common thing they have, white hair
Forget her name already
I mean, that's based on your preferences no?
I found a hectic amount of people who found her interesting and cute
80% Damage Reduction, ATK Buffed based on base attack, Crowd Control and Damage Dealer
Say all you want 

She's the most broken Unit
A Butler
Nicole, Anby, Billy and Nekomata
Their Faction
I wonder if you can consider this a bad thing
Well, they already did so
I wonder how much they can stretch it
I wonder how much flexibility they can do that the game is considered 16+
I will try to make myself utter causal vocabulary then
I guess I am being too formal to your liking?
Could you please elaborate what's so Emo about that- ah I see
For Example, Nicole has 2 Special Animations with her Energy Attack
Anyways, I have found out that ZZZ Agents have some hidden animations, it can be played when you met the timings
Ah my apologies
I am doing it without my attention
That was I was saying, it's too amusing they are like this
But well whatever, I'm not in loss with their sparse of existing braincells
It tiring seriously, but I guess that's how humanity will forever go
Nah, just seeing people being biased, closed minded, ignorant, or many other flaws way too much

It's not worth arguing with them, heck, even waste a single second on them, you won't change their mind, their head is so hard to penetrate as bedrock
People are very desperate nowadays, it's even worse they have a way for the world to see it
Yes and Now Rest
Whatever, I need to live my life hearing I have to get serious now and We're counting on you again, little apple every stage without any others
And there's no options yet for Ling and the others
I have the whole EN Voicepack
Yeah, I'm Using EN Voicelines, it's lighter for my phone
I mean, if the voicepack is ready, why it isn't with the Update from the get go
That's not convenient is it?
Because I can't find it at all
Huh, I wonder why it doesn't appear, did it arrive since the update?
Does Ling, Dusk, Nian and other operators EN Voicelines in game yet
Ah, that reminds me when I was the Ring Bearer in my Uncle's wedding
A Question
Well whatever, it's none of my business now

Now I'm floating away wandering when will ZZZ release, maybe I'll try to get in when there's another Beta with Android comes around
Middle of The Night
Holy, ZZZ looks awesome
Guess I'll need to get used to this, earlier the better
You hate that moment when you're forced out of your sleep and wish you have more time to do so
I hate waking up early importantly if it's dawn
So, I'll need to wake up around 5:00 and go around 6:00
Our class starts at 7am
And the travel time to go there is an hour if there's no traffic
I guess it's just me because I've been less active
Yeah Aster, you've been staying up late quite lately
I wonder why I feel so bothered after I assist/help someone
Huh, that's weird
How did it go
I'm getting some weird messages
I wonder how long until I break
For A Year, maybe, 2 Years
Doing it 5 Days A Week, what is there to imagine
Going to my School And Going Back Home is already quite tiring
I don't think Great is right word of it
Going Somewhere Again
Wrong One
My Bad
I have something to say
Nah, maybe
Ofcourse I would still try it, after all, I need to satisfy and get rid of this boredom even if it's a short while
Well, The main selling point of the game is the Fanservice, I think that's what they call it?
It's going to get stale after some time, well, I guess Destiny Child is still alive tho
I'm bored, I want something to play, but what game should I play
Blue Woman
Yup
Nothing Changed That Much
Yeah, I'm baffled
All luck is gone
I also got Ling with 28 Pulls, uwah
Ah, yeah
This is the first time I ever pulled after you gave me the account eh
I currently have 45K Orundum
25 Card
200 OP
It will be a miracle if I get them both under 80k
Seriously
GoldenGlow and Fia
Yeah
Who don't want a Guard Operator whom uses a Gun
The next limited OP Specter Alter, I don't know if I will pull her to get her
Permanent Account Damage
Luck is temporarily anyways
Well, we'll see about that, it will run out at some point
I'm bored out of my mind, I need something else to play
Well, you will get it after the Whale blasted your eardrums
Whales? Heh, you want peace and quiet but you got a point
My Guards are in Shambles
If I have a leeway to do so before Pink Cat Appears
I'm E2ing Near Alter
Just like how we all got Schwartz
I bet
Skadi eh
Unless you want me to pull for the next Joint Operation Banner
Well, I am not interested in any other banners after that
Still waiting for Thorns to appear in Shop
Hmm, Flametta?
Then what should I do after GoldenGlow?
If I get her that is
Sure, We all Love GoldenGlow
What is Yours
Yeah, I feel like pulling her
What is the next banner, Golden Glow?
That's like the total earnings the account have right now
48k and 108k
That's alot
You must be very Lucky
Huh
An opportunity for wasted Originite Prime
It's Live2D, what an opportunity
I don't
I also bought Nian's
Because she is the same person anyways?
Sadly I don't
If I only have the skin
Nevermind, I just did
I wonder if I should buy Shamere
Hmm
Hey
My one of my nicest sleep just got interrupted.. ugh..
Background Pain
I finished doing my Geo Slime
I'm currently drawing a geo slime
Ah.. my cat is being noisy

She's apparently finding a mate
School Art Audition
Now that I know I actually passed
Now, I have a reason to actually get better at this
Actually, I only recognize 2 names, feels like I heard it before
Huh, some past classmates
Wait... I recognize some names..
Now I rather feel conflicted
Huh..
19 Students passed including me
But I guess here we are
I actually didn't expect to pass
Thanks
Heh, not this one
I have to travel 20kilometers everyday for a year from now on
The Bad News Is
I actually can't believe that I passed the audition
The Good News is
Bad News And Good News Ofcourse
I have a News
Apparently, you can get unreleased operators like GoldenGlow as Temporary Recruitment in EN
Haah
Pain
Ugh..
Solo'ing The Event with Only Ling
Oh well
Just some entertainment don't you think?
When was the Hoyoverse Account system was added
If he really persistent, then I'll be a little bit harsh
I met this person years ago
Just saying some excuses
But I'm not saying it directly
That's what I'm directing at
Huh
Have no idea what he's talking about
I guess I'll just send the screenshot
Anyone here
Mhm
<@82358863155703808> Neko, I got Ling within 26 Pulls
Yes? It's Live2D
She can basically Solo 70% of The Stages
Broken and Fun Operator
Does having 237 OP Is nice huh
I'm just not doing much and content with the operators I have
Oh
It's Live2D? Well then, it's a decision
Oh well
That's why I said if I should go for other sisters
I'm planning to if I get her
Or operator I don't have
The past Outfits were mid
Oh, I didn't spend that much
OP?
Some Stuffs
I see, then I'll just depends with the free pulls
I wonder if I should go for the Other Sisters
Some New Ops
I know, I feel bad
26 Pulls, Fortunate Huh
Night, Take Care as Usual
Show me tommorow if you want, but don't back off with your words now
Haven't able to do that since last week
Anyways, I need to get some proper rest now
Yeah, that's no good
I guess that's a compliment? Thanks then
You can just imagine it's the typical thick hair, I don't know which one
It's unnecessary anyways
Quite embarrassing to do a face reveal
Some says it rather fits me
My Hair is quite thick no?
I'm always wearing a jacket/hoodie
As I said
Yeah, I can't believe it
Files ofcourse
Ofcourse I need to cover some private information
Sure, if you say so
Because my face wasn't shown
Too bad I wouldn't be recognized
And posted it in public
I didn't know that they took a picture of me while doing the audition
I don't know
I didn't expect to see myself to be advertised in public
I...
No way...
Hold on...
Maybe it's already in a secret Test Run/Beta and none of us are lucky or unfortunate enough to be invited
6 More Days Until ZZZ, want some entertainment already
Even though it's already 29 of July
It's unfortunate that I still to sleep 2 nights to actually pull
<@447218009749061632> ah yes
I also need to start eating some recent amount of food again, I've been lacking on it
I also didn't expect to have my life expectancy to be scrapped off that much
I see
Or it's your school in it?
You were involved?
Whats the deal?
Well, I can't really form an opinion because I only managed to finish the Kalpas fight
One thing I don't like about ER is how you progress the story
Mhm, you be you
Is there a chance you would say the name?
Damn, my eyebags are too notifiable now..
Ah.
Go To Sleep Or I'll Tape Your Beak
But, if that's what you want
*Sighs*
I just said there's not else behind those words in particular
So I can't complain
I've been having 3-4 hours of sleep since last week
That's kind of hard to accomplish
I'm not saying anything particular, just noticed
Yeah, I've noticed that you've been staying up more late usual
I'm so tired
Well, I really can't think of anything
Eeh, maybe something more different, but that's also a welcome one, but she already moves like one
Skin Ideas for the New 'ol Elysia?
Amazing ArtWork As Always

Yes
Right?
Then, Don't let it get to You.
No, don't take it seriously
I'm just kidding

I'm just bored as usual
Is that

One way to interpret it?
They're nice to you because you're Gay, but not as a Decent Human Being
Is there any other meaning?
Is there any interesting Mangas/Manhwas/Manhuas? Read? I just finished Sweet Home and Shotgun Boy
Mhm
What a turn out
Anyways, I can't make myself play games anymore
I feel off
I don't get what you meant
Im just being realistic, would you rather see me boasting and being so confident about it even it's not worth the value
If I even manage to get in
I guess I need to do that everyday
It was exhausted going back home
I feel like I would collapse any moment
I am a slow drawer and I am rusted
Resulting in unfortunate results
They only gave us an Hour
I guess the rest depends on my luck now
...I have a small glimpse of hope
That's why I drew that
The Topic was Human & Nature
The Audition was too sudden and my Tablet arrived yet
I think I am not able to make it..
I've seen other people's art there
You can, but I don't really know when it's comes from me
I am rusted and not able to grasp digital yet
I only started drawing back and digitally a week ago
Is that genuine?
Anyways, it will posted whenever, I don't know
I feel like a fool
I did some digital art, they only gave me an hour
I am, Physically and Mentally Exhausted
Anyways, I am able to finish my audition
Oh, the message was not sent an hour earlier
I just finished my audition
*COME ON, Take it And Leave*

-
*If There Was An EndPoint*
*End Up Being Too Rash Like Me*
*I Just Didn't Want You To*
*Because I'm Having Regrets*
*I Want You To Accept My Tears*
*Then...*
*Why Not, It's A ####### Offer*
*Would You Like To Accompany ### To The Other World?*
Morning
But don't be at ease that I will not bite back heh
There's no room for apologies
It shouldn't have a room for something like this
It has... Many deep meanings
And
References to the other songs
Came from the same people
Ah..
Hmm
Uh huh
*Would You Take The Bus With Her To The Other World?*
Have A Seat
Have a Listen For Yourself 

Cool Wallpaper Materials tho
Don't want to explain difficulties of life
Yeah..

I'll just stay silent
Mhm, what a song
It is a Diabetes Fuel
Cliff Hangers at best
Tommorow's the Day, For Sure, No More Delays
But I'll make sure to not let it overtake me
This is consuming me
Resolve is my Responsibility After All
Then I'll be preparing
Well, I'm trying to get in an Arts Talent Audition, basically if I get in, I can learn it for free, if not, then I'll learn Computer Stuffs instead
Being put under immense pressure, nervousness, and anxiety that feels like it'll blow your body to pieces because of something that will change your future dramatically if you manage to succeed it or not
What a Feeling
I feel like my mind and lungs getting crushed
Here I Go 
I think
Time to Stay Up All Night and Practice
Don't you worry
I already drowned it and beheaded it, gotta make sure
Give me your thought after 
Thank you for your consideration
I don't have any Genre at particular
As long it's a good one
It's one of my favorite piece, there's even days that I listened to it 3 days straight nonstop
Have you listened to Snooze SHIKi by Wotaku before?
TUYU is just that good
Give it a Listen Everyone

It is, just absolutely amazing
I'm glad they're able to produce music again once more
This was their old Artist

It is, even so it's a new artist
Cool

The Clown of the Class usually
I guess you need someone like that to make a fun atmosphere
Seems to be a fun one
If you don't want to gather much attention and gather more informations around your surroundings
It has its own benefits
I see, then i'm usually in the far back
Where?
Front, Middle, or Back
Those who are interested answering
Where do you sit most of the time
When it comes to interactions
They're, Climsy, Clingy, Alot of Teasing and other things just to let out a reaction from me
The majority of my friends are Males

But when it comes to Females, things get weird occasionally
Come to think of it, even I don't really socialize or have many friends back then to call them a Friend, they're still in Acquaintance Category, even so, I managed to work with them get things done under any circumstances
It doesn't matter if I know them or not, as long it gets the job done
Well, it can't be helped
It is up to you to recover your forthcomings
The time and experience was definitely, I'm more at ease because I'm able to work alone, as long I'm finish the requirements that's passed to me, but then, I also learned the knowledge was just leaving my mind the moment it reached my ears, it might just me, but no, the data and statistics that was gathered, says a different thing otherwise

Human's are more active if it's physical
The physical sensation of holding books and turning the pages gives us extra sensory input compared to a digital device, and this helps us retain more info
That's all
I guess I have to explain some insights I have
Very well
Let me ask you

But did

You Learned Anything?
I thought School was Hell

until College and Adulthood got introduced to my life
I think that's not a school system that's a problem
But the people managing that school
But take this heavily, but it might also how you just see things and your own
If you thought Online School is heaven
It'll only be counter productive
I honestly think you don't want that
1st year, 2nd year, 3rd year
Something like that
Basically K-12 System
Kindergarten/Elementary/Junior/Senior I think that's how it works?
But it might be around when I was 6
I don't remember when was the age I started going to school
My 4TH Grade wasnt that bad, I think so
Hmm?
Heavier
When you reach this point
You'll know the burden, if you think you're having a hard time right now, it'll only get more and more and more
That's why you have to enjoy it
I understand
I know why everyone thinks High school is the golden time of their life
That's what my mindset before but now I reached its point
I think that's not something to be sad about, you rather enjoy it until it reached it's point
Even so, I preferred having an Art Background, but just to safeguard my future, I need another one that interest me, and that is Computer Science
I need to practice all night just to prepare something
It's exactly tommorow morning
I'm way too paranoid about it
Ugh.. I think I really don't believe I'll pass the Talent Audition
That is to be expected ofcourse
I'm not in the college part yet, but I'm not that far off really, just 2 more years to be exact
But then, my times for shredded that I need to go tommorow now
I thought I would be going there on 29th
I need to have a safety net
If I failed, I'll take Computer Science
But thanks everyone
I can't even draw that much now
I've gotten very rusty
I'm not prepared for that
Yikes
...
Basically, I need to draw there in person
It's too far from success but I'll try
I only started practicing Digital arts just 3 days ago, and I gotten rusty in drawing.. *sigh*
Uwah.. I need to go tommorow for the talent audition.. Im not that prepared yet
Just recently published?
Is that a real law?
Imagine still playing Games
*sighs*
Play Minesweeper
Why not Quit Both
So it was cancelled?
Looks good and refreshing
Ugh... What a Blunder
2 Days..
I'm basically in a tough spot right now
Oh well, I need to put everything into a consideration, if I fail, that would also put my future under a miserable life
How wonderful how such entity full under the pressure of immense stress and anxiety
Everyday
1 Hour To Go There
And
1 Hour to Go Back
I guess it's not really that bad because I only need to ride 2 Public Transportation Back To Back
Hmm
Public Transportation
How long it would be?
What do you think of 20 Kilometers if youre going to travel that far?
Haven't seen Keilo for quite a while
Anything the matter?
Indeed it is
That's unusual
Time to Pirate Clip Studio Paint
Yikes, I actually have 4... Days
I have 5 days for the application...
I see
I do Annihilation while I'm in they midst of something, I have alot of time for that, also, Split Screen comes in handy
Once Again
I wonder if someone can win such Gamble
Seems like my Sister have something great happened to her, basically a big success to her life career, I hope it goes well
According To Google
Blood Type O Tastes The Best
It also depends on your Blood Type
I think they meant Elysian Realm
Anyways, I'm currently focusing reading the Novel right now because things get more interesting
I don't want to use my time with something like that
I see, well, i'm quite lazy when it comes to pirating
Looking back, it's slowly making more sense and the pieces are getting connected each by each
It's quite interesting, even becoming more interesting since some plots have been revealed, it's quite mind blowing
What's your opinion on it?
The Tags is quite amusing
Quite a Rating, 40+ chapters is still not translated
I guess I'll go back reading the Novel it has 300 Chapters currently, it takes 20+ minutes to finish a chapter
I'm enjoying my time I guess
It's quite complicated
The plot is interesting though
The MC has been like that until now
Rather than That
I think it's more hurtful to get told by like this
Atleast
But not that Gory
It's quite a Graphic
Well Close Enough
Quite a Page
But the Girl is trying hardly though... For quite 180+ chapters now?
The MC cares about Food and Bath rather than Girls
Let's say
Well, The Romance part though..
Seriously..
It's Happened alot to me for the past few months
Yeah, it's saddening that sometimes the series you follow got axed or stopped getting translated
The MC is quite cold but dense, not that Idiot Dense, but a Don't Care Dense
Seems like he's more Cold and Uncaring in the Web Novel 
Well, that's quite what you get from always living in the edge of survival and getting manipulated all the time
It literally escalated quickly there
The Manga Adaption Is quite good but it follows the LN, so I can quite get what the LN has to offer through the Manga, but, the stories separates around chapter 76 resulting in a character living in 1 Version but Died instead in the other version
I wish the same
Theres so many series I've been following and that has been axed or have a slow translation process
I'm currently reading the Web Novel Version, I found out too late that it has different story and plot between the LN and WN, but I'm currently 200 Chapters deep, and 100 Chapters to catch up, even so ive been informed, the Web Novel is more twister and darker than the original
Rebuild World, An Apocalyptic Genre
Well, it has A Light Novel, Web Novel Version which have different plots and A Manga Adaption
Hmmmmn, I don't think I can recognize it as one
Hmm, Light Novel
Guess I'll go back to reading to my Novels
Who's Faction do you think will be introduced next?
August 5 for The Test
Hmm, want to see some of it already
Seems like everyone is having their own fun
202
The Manga is following the Light Novel though, I guess that's one of my way to follow the LN
Just have to wait 5+ years for it
I found out that the Series I am currently reading have different stories and plot in Light Novel and Web Novel, I am currently reading the Web Novel and it's more of a darker than the Light Novel it seems
I'll become more busier than I expected because I need really need to put efforts into
Because of that situation, I'll be more inactive than I used to be, I might be there, just lurking more than ever
So there's no need for such worries
Take care of yourself as usual everyone
It's been nice knowing everyone
I guess it's time for me too then huh
I'm going to live differently what I used to be
Next Month for sure
When Ive basically reading Light Novels instead
I guess I'm slowly losing interest in games that much
It's also having a toll in my storage capacity
Before that though
I need to change my account and set it to that I've left
I thought of selling it
But it think it's useless and worthless
It's been 4-5+ years, I guess I need to let go of Honkai
Even so I'm not playing the game anymore, I would still follow what's happening all around
I'm getting more responsibilities and busy, also I'm slowly burning out
Thinking of dropping Honkai for good
I see, I've been not playing my games quite a bit now
Just earlier?
Ah just asking, does Abyss Resets today?
If you take a screenshot of the Desert Area, no one would guess it's Genshin that easily
Sumeru's Desert area looks very nice
As if the feeling that it's not the same game
Was planning to do something tonight
I guess I'll do it tomorrow instead
Mood changes quickly
Oh Well
Hmmn
I need to travel 10 KM to get to my School
...
It's 20x more times I need to travel to get to my next School..
Oh...
My School for that is 2 Cities away heh..
I'll be taking Art and Design for my Senior Years
I have Pixiv, no worries
Mhm, that also could count
I'll try drawing Anatomy with reference
I know who to go to
I'll try that
I still need to get used using a drawing tablet
It's Art and Design in general
I'm still starting
My sister told me with Anatomy
I'm thinking of things that can be accepted to a course
Currently practicing Digital Art
I wonder where should I get started
Eeh
You think
Hmmmn
Hmn
I have my own straw at home
There's many types out there eh
Oh well
That already exists everywhere
My hair is getting thicker, I wonder if I should cut it when studying starts
August 5 will be start of ZZZ's Tuning Test, Interesting
Hmm
I guess we'll see
*Sigh*
It's not a problem but my expenses
I have 3 Options to what I can choose that's meets my interest, The route for being Graphic Designer is far, because I need to go and attend A School thats way further
Seems like I need to get started to drawing tommorow
For College
I guess it's time to make a choice that would change my life
Rebuild World
Just reading a new light novel I've discovered
Seems like I planned to eat too late that I ran out of food to eat, ah, whatever, I'll just wait for the dinner
Next time, it's going to be colder than usual, can't wait
What do you mean by Revert? I think that it's the same like any other day

Anyways, it's getting hotter than usual, still doing fine over there?
<:nothing:990283279032803338>
I
I'm
As if you can trigger the bear with it's letter
Cool, now do the bear
Good for you
Also
What's your point?
Anyways gotta rest and force myself to sleep, might need to wake up early

Take care as usual everyone
I don't have to doubt you Fenri
Hey, better deepen that fear so it leaves a deep cut that it wouldn't fade isn't it
The Rooftop Scene
Well, not yet, there's still One Scene yet to be Revealed in this season
<@447218009749061632> just to let you know, COTE is one of the most top selling Light Novels, as myself who has been up to date with the volumes, I can confidently say it's pretty good
It's just one of the most fascinating scenes
Probably
Thats the point
Mhm
The Light Novel COTE is honestly what made me go read Light Novels
The Sexual Assault doesn't really happen, it's just to strike fear and make her break down
Blackmail is the word you're looking for
A very long wait it is
Well, seems like I need to wait another 4 months for the next volume
This is interesting seeing other's people reaction to this without context
I've been busy innit
Just the newest chapter
And do well in Abyss to Retain in Agony 3 I guess
Uwah, if I ever want to have a guaranteed 7TR, I need to speedrun the main story and complete all of my ER Valks Run
<@244423082045997057> ... ... ... ... ...
<@244423082045997057> Tell me a fact
Cool, you said that 3 times now
<@244423082045997057> Tell me a Shower Thought
<@244423082045997057> do you have a sister?
See?
Anyways, CleverBot is more Clever than <@244423082045997057> I heard
Reminds me of the new movie
<@244423082045997057> So what if I am
<@244423082045997057> then what is your name
Uh oh
<@244423082045997057> What is your life lesson
I am not that humourous enough for that
Hmm
<@244423082045997057> You
<@244423082045997057> My Pleasure
<@244423082045997057> Don't Oh me

<@244423082045997057> Motivate Me
Surely
There it is
<@244423082045997057> Give me money
Hmm
Took you long enough
Good
<@244423082045997057> what is the power house of the cell
Sad equals dumb
By Sheepbot
Oh
<@244423082045997057> Are you a Bully?
Oh, whatever, it doesn't have that knowledge
<@244423082045997057> What is my Game Class
<@244423082045997057> what is my class
Really pinged myself
Huh
<@244423082045997057> What is my RPG Class
Which ones?
I'm no different, I literally couldn't fall asleep for 2 hours yesterday and fell asleep around 3:30am
Someone is having a hard time to fall asleep
Oh dear
There's alot of Delinquents out there I heard
I guess I'll just leave it up to you what are the weird things are
Sometimes your physical body is faster than your brain to even process
Autocorrect and fast typing definitely go well
I had a feeling
Knew it
...
Weird stuffs like
Sleep well
I also heard from last school year classmates that school is kind of.. definitely not normal I'd say, weird things goes around there
It's because my last school don't have what I need
I'm also transferring to another school which is pretty far I'd say
Yeah, I'm literally going to get really really busy in August
I have my fair share of going outside, so does my relatives that literally go everyday, I'm still surprised none of us got covid
I'll start drawing digital art tommorow
Need to grasp alot of things and Alot to learn, need to bring out the references, videos, setups and software for it
We don't exist
We just have to accept that
Greetings, just keep chatting away
This conversations is surely entertaining to watch and read
I hope it lives up to it
Oh, cool, that game looks fantastic
No, Go to Taco Bell instead so you shift to another problem instead and ignore the other
There's still alot to do though
It cost me around $25
Now, time to test if this works in OSU
Cool
This pen has pen pressure
I'm having a hard time setting this tablet up
Now, I should set it up for my phone too
Cool, I got working it in my PC
Installing the Drivers
My Tablet has just arrived
Well, you gotta boast about yourself ofcourse, of how Broad-minded, Open-hearted, and Selfless You are
There's no rule that it could be another person
Well, better than school shootings Mondays
Have fun
Asian Schools is it?
They do realize that everyone doesn't have a peaceful background
It just feels suffocating
Why do you have to involve other people in this?
I got asked What is the Purpose Of Your Life
Like, seriously?
They still do this in highschool
I never did this kind of things, I just ignore, I don't care doing those
Ah yes.. The School Learning System Questions
The YouTube Comment Section Bots is getting messy each passing day, it stinks down there
Nah, pass on that +27 HP or something
I was flipping a coin with that Combination
Or that 5* Star Pusher
Glaucus or Firewatch I guess
I did Nuker + CC + Slow
Anyways
Imagine still not getting anything out of those..
Why those tags showed up all the same time..
<@447218009749061632>
No idea anymore
Fall asleep
I just woke, I feel
Terrible
It's so terrible that I couldn't fall asleep for 2 hours, drinking milk doesn't help
Oh well, This is going to be Fun
All Copium
But she may have a chance to join the crew and get a new battlesuit
All your cope they she will appear again is I'm CaptainVerse Universe where she is still alive
I didn't even won a thing, even crystals
Merch Lottery back again, it's quite a Gamble
Has anyone won something back then?
I would probably leave after this patch, but seeing the Merch Gamble once again, it made me think twice
How long it has been? Delta?
Since when we last got an Augment
That might be nice
Hmm
Mech Hershey?
Disgusting
Ugh
Can anyone spare some dimes? I just got Ely's weapon from it
Captain haven't made it back to Luna Kindred yet
You mean Luna Kindred?
I wonder who's next
Not yet atleast
She is in CaptainVerse story lines ofcourse she appears
But not part of the Crew
Guess
Must be that person who likes skipping those event dialogues
Nini doesn't know anything at all
<@180679257851166721> seems like Nini doesn't know about Captainve- yup
Example are Fallen Rosemary, Delta, Haxxor, etc
Valks that came from the Captain Verse Universe
Anyways, Poor Seele
Didn't made it
Then who's going to join the crew next?
It's been so long
Sickening
Can finally start doing things
Oh well
My Tablet should arrive tommorow
Did you got head split open?
I can tolerate people drinking alcohol if it's a happy celebration or a good cause

But a person that's not in the right state of mind you should definitely avoid drinking alcohol
Well, ofcourse, but if someone has a function brain and system, can adapt, learn, and improvise
It's better to encourage someone to learn things early for the future and watch over them
But being alone, learning things by yourself is also a skill a person have, but that doesn't mean you have to risk your health for it
But it's up to you what you consider Better, Efficient and Safer Way in your own circumstances
Everyone has their own ways, but surely there's a better, efficient, and safer way
Youre Saved
I'm pulling GoldenGlow if I have any leftovers from Ling
I'm trying to unlock as many collectables as I can, but ignore the hard mode, that's on another level
Oh The Author
And for the item?
<@82358863155703808> How many runs did it took?
Bear
Mhm
Huh
Ahem Leader Squad
Huh
Hmm
As long he dies
But hey
The game didn't gave me any medic vouchers at all
Here we go again
Also the Item that cuts Bear's HP Regen
Nah, Both
You need a perfect comp for it
It's literally too much
Nearly
Heh
Lucia Blood Diamond
Phantom
I'd like to think that, The Bear is harder than CC
But the Bear is another way of Hell
Passenger so good that he SpawnCamped Lucia
Yeah, Right will be useless for Range Ops
So Universal -20% for Enemies does the job I guess
Choices
Forget it
Yeah
Ah, yeah
When?
<@881369538946531338>
You again, better meet your demise once again
Or Wine
Luxury Champagne
But did it taste good in the end?
A friend forced me to eat it so, I can't escape
Yeah, same, which in my case, I didn't knew
I'm Available
It Tastes Like Fe
How Great
Above 40°C
As many succumbs to the heat wave
Europe is surely having Fun in there
It's time for your daily dose of balding
Morning
Another Run in IS I go
Miserable Indeed
Yeah
Me, I Revealed Thy Self
<@468680026162724864> yeah Fenri, I did a reveal
Intriguing
Too busy with other matters
My Body Hurts more than it should have been
<@803575968374849536> A Toast
No
Idea
No Idea
We don't need more headaches in the world
<@468680026162724864> Your Country will become like China, or worse, North Korea, but I hope not
IndoNet
As long the rooting old hags/bastards sit in there
Do you think there would be any miracle?
Government cares about it's Citizens? That's getting old
Think Fenri, Think
Think about the Indo VTubers Fenri
Also Yes
Yes
Think how depressing it is
<@447218009749061632> isn't it that sad that Fenri can no longer visit X sites in 5 days?
She
There is
I'll be skipping GoldenGlow if
It
I Will

Think about
Yes Baban?
I'll pass on that

Oops, better not put some oil into the fire
It's July 17 Already? How fast the days went by
Cool
How lively this place have become
Mhm
Look who's here now
Interesting things going around here
Define Regularly
You sure have alot of knowledge about those
No, im referring to something else
Let have her fun
That there's an Iceberg in the way?
Hmm
I wonder what will happen
Okay then
Here it is

<@468680026162724864> I guess you don't have to hear it now
Don't want to ruin your fun
Art
Could you deliver it instead?
I'm sure Fenri already heard about it Right? Fenri
I don't care if you're also addicted to VTubers
But in 5 Days
My body hurts
I don't know how can you call someone Addicted
He does
Specifically in Indo Branch
30 minutes late you are
Interesting things going around, just decided to check it out
Oh, someone's VTuber Debut
Oh well that sucks
My 4th run
Pass
Let's see with that
You said so
Multiple times
That's what Baban told me
How helpful
And put her friends out of their misery
Guess I'll be taking her
Even it will haunt and cause you in need of help instead?
I wonder who should I E2 next
Ah, yeah, I only accept the trade if I have 3 ingots
Where?
What Mats?
The most basic basic mats?
I guess I used my resources for 3* stars to bring them in IS
Literally barely Basic Resources at all
I guess, time for another IS run
But it was fine, just bring 4 Healers
Alot of stalling to wait for Chen for her to skill to become active
They're like only E1 LVL30 that time
Its only Chen
Even so, I need to choose and where the place other ops correctly to make it work
Yeah, this one
Hmm
Let me find the screenshot again then
I'm sure you still remember
Meanwhile me beating Patriot
Yeah, I need to get over it quickly to do IS
Should I buy Honeyberry?
Anyways, I need a Therapist
Mhm
Done
Yeah, her Bind is useful
Until this stage when everything crumbles
I mean, she helped alot in the run
I mean, it's free
There's no why
It's what the game gave me
Indigo
Yup
Going to be fun to use 1 hour of your day just to-
Then do it next time
You can't unlock things in easy
What's the point then?
<@447218009749061632> now, do the normal
You won, can I see the credits?
Going to spam you with the AOE
Have fun with that
See what he left behind?
Yes
Go get em
Now go
Mhm
I believe
Yep, The End Of Your Run
Oh, right, oh well
Well, can't say it
But you should've read it carefully
Oooh, Lost all of your ingots for a collectible
Then where does 53 ingots go
Yikes
Did you Gamble?
Yeah, that's what you think
Have Fun
Oh, that's sad to hear
Anyways, Do you have a Passenger?
Pretty long
That's your time
Yeah, 1+ Hour If you reach the Boss Stage
I reached the Boss Stages 5 Timed now, all succeeded in Failure
1 Hour is the average Run
I didn't count, but, 5-6 Floors
Massacred Once Again
Oh dear.. once again, I'm here
This will be no different
We've seen how people do things now
Will cause an Uproar
I wonder what will Fenri say about this
A functioning society uses the internet like a necessity
Don't refer it like
We're not a different species Art kek
Not Internet People, The Masses
Sooner or Later, we would probably going to see some action
As a consumer/user, you're in for a shtshow
Google, Twitter, every single websites out there
And their Register system doesn't even work
But, Millions of Website
No Internet is an exaggeration, but it's close, you need to register to their Register thing they have to make your Site available to the masses
Taking it away from people whom adapted and live their lives with it
Is seriously going to cause an uproar
Internet is literally part of our life now
It's not 6 Days of No Internet
It's In 6 Days, You will no longer have access to the internet
You're getting it wrong
Well, I could tolerate 6 days of no internet, I'll take it as a break
Oh well
In 6 Days, You will have no access to the internet from now on
Wrong
It's quite a similar situation

I don't know how people in Indonesia will take this 
It's kind of devastating in every way
I guess that should explain it
Let's say, Like China/North Korea
That's what I understand
If you're a user or consumer, you will not access to those sites
Literally, no access to the internet
Everyone needs to register websites like google, Twitter, etc, millions of millions of websites to their Register thingy which doesn't work
This is worse that I thought
Its going to end so badly
I can't imagine how will I ever deal with this disaster
I really can't pass that
It doesn't really matter now I guess
Phantom
What a pain
Nevermind
Help me Plan Baban
Time to Lose The Final Step
Collector Mindset
Phantom is such a pain to deal with
Atleast hes not invisible
Oh my
You'll get it back in no time
Time to do my Integrated Strategies
Because they're Tears of Themis Characters?
Anyways
It's time
Alright, it's fun, until the moment you don't have that particular operator type, you're gone so
Do you think I can pass Phantom with this?
<@447218009749061632> Whatcha Think?
Yeah..
Just for that -10% enemy hp
Oh well
Oh, didn't expected that
Hmm, I see
I'll take the risk then
Not worth the time
That's all?
What rewards for beating the sht out of her accomplices?
It's a bait is it?
How Fishy
Server seems quite these past few days
What a terrible day it is
What a bunch of misfortunes
How about the other servers hmm?
No one here got it yet? 7TR that is.
Tch
For me, I haven't
Well, I'm not really interested
I know, how Emo right?
Interesting
Have fun Heki
Time to win nothing once again
Another one huh, interesting, it's coming closer
I guess that'll be useful
I have the most basic knowledge about rotations
I have 150k Asterites in store
Can't be problem
I've used her in the past
I'll take note
The Bronya's?
I'll be leaving Honkai again, it can't take my phone anymore, too huge storage requirement
I don't really bother now
My account's such a mess, and I can't bother to fix it 
My account have the curse of Weapon Duplicates
Just additional Damage I guess
I don't have that much Fire Support
So I guess I'll just place her in for Ignite
That's an old one that I don't bother to change
Ignore that
Yes
Bless
It's not like I run the team like that every abyss
Here's my preset
Don't get the wrong idea
Think of it
I only have 3-5 4/4 Valk (HoT) if I remember correctly
That's what I'd like to think
Hey, don't call me out
I do them from time to time
I'm the most casual player out there
Atleast
Actually, I tried doing HoT, Fischl, FR first
But I'm too lazy to do the rotations or don't know at all
It did worked
Just didn't finished the stage in time so it didn't count
I mean, look again
It worked
Just not in time
Let's say we have 2 DPS in the field
Yes
Well, do you want me to put Marco Polo there instead?
It worked
Almost
Yes

BruteForce
What do you think?
But hey, I put up a good fight considering my enemy uses..
Didn't made it in time
I'll pass
Don't want to be a pyromaniac heh
Unless you want those to turn into crisp and ashes
It's already dead Neko
No need
It turns out to be bunch of dead cockroaches
Interesting
Whatcha think?
So, I just walked by
I don't want to be a weirdo taking pictures of cockroaches
Maybe, you know what?
I'll take a picture
I want to go back and take a picture of it but it seems like a waste of time

Also, I also saw 2 kindergarten kids showing a direct affection to each other..?
What a day really this is.
I just saw like Dozen of cockroaches gathering in one spot near my place, I couldn't see why 
But it's interesting
Cool I guess?
Oh well, seems like I'm going to get busy from now on
Greeting There
I'm Off
Yeah
Dad Jokes.
At it again?
This is really going to be a long day, going somewhere Faraway
Oh How Mighty Benares have fallen from it's glory
It's going to be a long day
Need to go somewhere tommorow, some important matters
30 pulls at best then
7TR in what days again?
It's a drag
I only put my SP Valks in SS, there's no need to for SSS
I wish I could
Having 150k+ Asterites saved only for the purpose of time capsules, oh well
I just got a news that the manga I was reading weeks ago that was dropped, Is now continuing once again, that's a good they changed their mind but... It's monthly, but hey, better than nothing, right?
Lost
Well, I didn't expect it to come pouring that sudden and heavy
The rain got me badly
I am
I am soaked..
Even I overstayed my night, atleast I also overslept
I am still waiting
Might be, but it's inspired what my body feels at the moment
I am, but a slow process over time
I don't mind
I prefer you go at it
My throat feels tight, my cheeks feels numb, my leg aches, my back craves for comfort and eyes are heavy.
Cool
I don't really mind or care enough for it
I do not think so
there is a subtle difference
Greetings Baban
As usual
Fenri and Taihen trying their best
Applause their efforts
Have fun to those two
Cool, have fun to everyone participating
PTSD Stream Session?
Oyasumi
Hmm
Dizzy
Stigma buff copium
Hmm think
>Experimented On Kids
>Clones Himself
>Wants Destruction
Otto = The Doctor?
That's literally Otto's Soul to the right
Appreciate it for cleaning the spaces
You can retract and remove No HoS quotes away directed at me
Oh Fenri, I just remembered something
Who's going to be the next Extremely
You can let the heat go towards me
Maybe 3 hours ahead of you I don't know
Really? Afternoon?
Youve been struck with Emotional Damage too much my pal
Wanna hunt some warden
Have to type it manually
I'll crush your cricopharyngeus
Let's do it
Wanna see whom will pass out first?
<@468680026162724864> let's see, I don't really have any favorite VTubers but if I go to what covers/song I'll likely to listen to
Are, Mori, Suisei, AmaLee, Rachie, (I don't know if I should include Mafumafu) and others I guess
It's been showing grandpa
Okay okay, I'll try not to trigger your trauma
They just don't want to acknowledge some things, it's inevitable
Ah poor you
Seems like you got a PTSD from Evn and Reboot huh
Cheers
I don't see a difference between a VTuber or a FleshTuber, if they can provide an entertainment I enjoy, I will gladly support them
Funny enough
Well I guess that's what hits you
I see
Mhm mhm, I hear you
Do you even know, That Parasocial Relationships just doesn't apply to partner?
Youve been hit like a bullseye in a dart board
But hey, it's working
The Humongously Parasocial Relationship Youve Been Having
Let's rephrase that
Fenri and his VTubers
You'll know soon
It's kind of weird, my throat is kind of tightening
I want to try Will Stetson's Rap Cover
Might as well practice rapping
I kind of want to sing Hated by Life Itself/Life Hate Us Now but it's kind of too fast for me
That's a bad idea
I'll try practicing Romeo & Cinderella
Hmm?
Then how many people told you so?
Who told you so
That's one side to it
I don't get to use my voice alot often nowadays
So I don't know what vibe should I go for
I'm still figuring that out
*Enthusiastic*
Is what I can describe Citrine's voice
Ah, I don't feel like talking actually
Get lost with your sugarcoated dusted words
What another abomination is that?
Too bad Fenri
Don't actually stuff it in your pockets tho
Pocket Size Pizza
It's very nice
Always order Stuffed Crust
Anyone?
Stuffed Crust is also a welcome one
Just additional jelly texture
It is
Can't disagree
Pineapple Pizza will never get old
I guess being Curious has it's own ups and downs
After that
What then?
I don't know, I'm trying to process things right now
I just finished doing an errand
Sometimes people just live it off with stereotypes and memes
Or pulls?
Dollars?
Oooh
How much money did you spent?
It's just, too much sweet is too much for my liking
I see that alrey many tiimes and I might still missing some context on it
Yeah I know that but, that's what I'm feeling right now
Haven't yet
I just feel getting diabetes by just taking a sip from it
They may have added too much sugar in this drink
Oh
You may want to retract and throw it in the bin right now
What's this?
Consuming Shaved Ice right now
Already seeing Harbingers artworks everywhere
The artists are sure fast
The one behind
The one from the left side to 2nd is nice
Who?
If Evil
Why Hot?
The Harbingers are cool, I'll give them that
Good Grief
Or
What to do I guess
How to get up from the bed
Thinking
Body aches
Resting
It got worse
Oh no
I don't care


As long anyone who works hard for it for thy good cause

They deserve it
Cool, Congrats To Her
Wait
I forgot to do my Abyss
Did you got the answer you're looking for?
Answering people's question, they would answer you with no exceptions
No?
But they are helping
We've been having multiple conversations all the time
There's no problem, just excuse yourself
We've been doing that right?
Why not?
What's the matter?
The void gapes me deeper
They both act as a tank and a dps
They can cover each other, elemental or physical, sadly why durandal took the beating because she was in the middle
Hard Carrying
Well, yeah, you have a point, I also have been busy, maybe once a month interaction is enough to make reassure that everything's fine
Well, there's benefits accepting another Cadet unless it's one of those who will be probably go offline again for I don't know how long
I have a spot left for any cadets, I don't know if I should accept or recruit someones
I'm not mad, I never made any word that made me look mad, stop with assumptions
I don't really care either, do whatever they want, but it's unexpected that she comes back alive ingame, it's just intriguing
Then a past friend
But a friend is still a friend, No?
To no end
And ghosted you
Do you still consider someone a friend if they've been gone for 6 months
Yes
Friend
One of mine, was/is a Friend that's been my Cadet, unexpectedly came back
Carole who?
Ready to be disappointed again
That's all I guess
What other things we should look forward for in this patch except for 7TR
Aster lives in an upside down country
Then you experiment with it
And apply that knowledge to the one you're Currently rigging
Maybe you should try having a VTuber model first, I mean, a free model
Understandable
Wht did you even jumped in without knowledge
Have fun Rigging with no experiences, it's one hell of a ride
Anyways, time to fix my room
I can't relate but from the knowledge I know, it's very painful to deal with, literally
Yeah, below 8 seems like there's a problem
Yes, early stage
I guess it's lower than that, 9 maybe?
Wait, nevermind
And hope your wisdom tooth is not in the wrong position
Enjoy your time until then
You didn't even hit your puberty phase yet, perhaps
Wisdom Tooth can erupt around the age 17 - 25
You will Experience it sooner and later, it's almost your time
It kind of hurts if I press my mouth to closely hardly
My gums on it are kind of swollen but I don't have any problems moving my mouth
It didn't came out yet, just 80% of it
Yeah, even my right wisdom tooth didn't caused any problems and became the 3rd molar
Maybe it'll be fine tomorrow
It just hurts because I've been touching it yesterday with tongue alot
Yes
But my other wisdom tooth erupted just fine and caused no problems
One of my wisdom tooth is erupting and my gums are kind of in pain
Do any of you still have your wisdom tooth?
Same
Heh 
Too much brain capacity needed
I'm surprised you didn't know Aster's gender at all
<@82358863155703808> Hi
You spent
But what did you got from it?
Hmph
I haven't Honkai for a long time, I've just hoped back in a week ago
I haven't seen it yet
My bad
I thought y'all referring to the first one
Wait, Pardo getting a new skin?
If I remember correctly, Pardo's skin was bought with spending event currency or I'm currently getting baited right now
Wait, what's going on?
Ofcourse, if the character doesn't like a generic NPC they will be playable :Clueless:
Plot Twist
He's 14
It's kind of haunting
Look at those same face syndrome characters
Such a nice comp
I'm here
And 
Life is Bold
Rita haven't even changed her Victory Pose Since Then
There's always the 3rd wheel you know
Perhaps
What type of artist?
Oh, my condolences
Well, I shouldn't be talking because I don't know anything about Furries
Dum
How do you know it's expensive?
Am I Wrong?
I mean, it's just a suit that you can buy
Yes
Just wear a cat ear headband or headphones or something
Fursuits doesn't have any effort
Do you want to bring out the Furry Chart?
Let's say another word for Cunning is Deceitful
Atleast
Not yet
No
The new volume was a good read 
Unfortunately, I have to wait for exactly 4 months for the next one
It is what it is
I mean, I'm still here after all
It's once in a while, it's not like I do it every single day, maybe.
I mean, Midnight is free, so why not take advantage of it?
What? You don't want me to become a functioning member of society?
What?
Yes
Which is good
Because I've been busy and not showing up lately
Am I the The Whole Body Aches type of Headache?
Interesting
Finally slept after finishing a single Light Novel Volume that took 8 hours to complete
I guess thats it for today, I didn't even finished it yet
I didn't noticed that time went by so fast
Reading Light Novels for 5 hours straight was nice
Not the brightest
The Moon
How's the Sky?
His name is literally Art
As usual
How sweet
I don't
We're all just a medium
Who is it again?
Can't escape the Gacha, so Heki graves for more Gacha
Heki wants to depends his life choices with RNG Numbers
<@244423082045997057> What is the news of the day?
Cool
That happens like once a week for me
Thought youre stuck on 99% or something
Cool
It is past 10% now?
How it is going Heki?
Well, I guess you can shove the new version out of the way and download the one that the server uses I guess
0.2 kbls really?
I don't know if it matters but I just want to add it in
Also don't forget the Minecraft Version
It's just easy as it is Heki
What makes sense?
What?
Impressive Baban
Ah Yes Fenri
We Understand
Greetings
I don't know if Shinzo Abe is dead yet until further confirmation but he's showing no vital signs
The Handmade Gun
With a shotgun.
Getting shot in the back twice almost 3 meters, it's a miracle if you're still alive after that
If seems like he got shot with a handmade sawn-off shotgun
Former Prime Minister of Japan Abe Shinzo was shot dead
Hmm
I'll pass on carbohydrated drinks
Anyways, night
I guess that's why Sora likes to go Karaoke's all the time
That was wonderful
Do you want to stuffed in a body bag?
Yes
I'm going to fall asleep in minutes
Neko must be put down
Neko knows something Neko shouldn't now
..Really?
I have some muscles ya know, it's just the jacket
Hey
(─.─）
Meany
Now, find my location with that image
Here
I run now
Nah, an image year ago
Interested?
What?
I kind of want to do a body reveal
I guess I hit the spot
<@468680026162724864> here's your Isekai Bozo
Fenri said that I sound like a depressed Isekai Protag, I did an attempting in my wardrobe
Do you wanna hear my attempt?
Yup
I never heard Fenri's deep voice
Could you record something with your deeper voice?
Okay, let's see
I think
Or, my connection's bad
Being sht
Oh, I guess it's just discord
Anyways, was that recording different from the Discord voice earlier?
Yeah, it sounds clear
Wow, that's xxxth time I've been called depressed
<@447218009749061632> is this microphone quality different from the Discord microphone earlier
Testing
<@468680026162724864>
That was a refreshing bath
Maybe I'll finish in an hour
Hmm
Wall Reveal then
What reveal?
That's a no then
<@468680026162724864> want some reveal because I can't make it?
You know that I would take more than hour in the bath right?
Im taking a bath
Oh cool
America? Smile
I mean, Continent
What state are you in right now?
Because I don't have a face that would be smiling
Still no luck?
Ugh, but I'm not good with dealing with other people
Ah yeah, I also have to find a part time job soon
I would have been living a less stress free life right now
Maybe if I have better RNG at Birth
It's not my choice you know
You can touch the highest grass
Isn't it that fun?
You got Co2 everywhere
What? You want to go Mountain Hiking?
Urban City here I guess
Rest well
Yes
Oh I almsot forgot
 Big Day Tommorow
We haven't gone in the beach for years since pandemic happened
Waiting for another Deco*27
Oh, atleast you know your limits now isn't it?
Great
Have fainted before?
Steady Sailing
The more you listen to Romeo and Cinderella when you are growing up, the slowly you realize the meaning of the lyrics and the song.
*Suffocating, Strangling, You Left Me Hanging*
There was a person following me
Roomba, grats
Aka, Pet Toy
Ah, Found my Custom Profile
I don't have a clue
Then im exactly the same height as Fenri
That was my weight years ago
Why are you digging that message from weeks ago?
Not Based
I don't know how Fenri can do anything under 6 minutes
Must've dipped himself In sulfuric acid
You know what the other part of the body is
I have, 1 for my hair, 1 for my body, 1 for the other part of the body
...3?
Lets just say Fenri is that kind of person who has only 1 towel for his whole body
Meanwhile me taking an hour before getting out of the bath
Oh, I missed that little buddy
Something interesting happening in chat?
Well, you can pirate it with TLauncher like we did
Yes
Play in the Minecraft server then Baban
I can't tell who's sane or not anymore
Also, I need 500 exp to reach lvl 88 ugh
And I've done everyone
How so?
I wonder if we will ever get an Operator that needs 50+ DP for first deployment
DP Eaters are missing
<@447218009749061632> isn't that funny now that we can rotate furnitures in dorms now
How many banners before Ling?
Mhm
*Hehehe*

That's right
Here
The Humans Team
Not that much but it's an honest work
Tommorow, Surely-
Hmmmm
Did anyone here received a Snack Box last year?
I would generally fall asleep around 1am
Its so bad
You think that would help alot? But I'll try
I don't know what I might have insomnia
It shows that I need an hour to fall asleep
It's been like a week since I've been feeling that
Oh, well, I'm just feeling uncomfortable, it's like, something in your mind you can't get out
I would like to be involved something digital though
Tell me that when I'm still way too young and haven't cleared his mind what to choose in my Senior Year
I can't guess or know what is Remy's thinking
Too much exposure of Remy messing around so I can't tell when she is not messing around
I have a temptation to freeze myself I don't know why
I'm feeling burnt out day by day, ugh, I feel so uncomfortable
Shameless
I'm still not sure what to choose in my Senior Year..
Yeah
Just kidding, I know the grasp of it
I still haven't got a clear clarification what does that meant
It's just quite interesting
Sent it
Just Wood.
Literally, wood.
No, the Wood Weapons
But the way, Sumeru's 4* star weapon is quite interesting heh
Cmon, reveal already
6.0v soon
Oh, that skin was the free one from the captain verse event
So by then, I'll be deleting Honkai again 
Can't wait it to be 20GB minimum on mobile devices
About to reach level 88 by tommorow
Hi there
Yes.
There's no other choice.
I also refuse to believe but...
Would you believe it that I use Dickens on HoS
I wonder if they're going to give out stuffs again for max level captains just like last time
Soon
I haven't touched physical mirage at all,.well kind of
Ooh, you can't team up if you haven't cleared it with your own yet
You should, or you'll never see it again after 10 patches
I'm pretty the game is just going to give me another duplicate at that point
For Grieso's Gear by the way
Anyways, should I get the 10 pulls pity if I'm 3 pulls away from it?
I should have 20 pulls by then
7TR week 3 isn't it?
Save it by yourself
Kidding, I still have it
I already used it
Oh
Okay, it is then
I already have M
I can only use one from the box
Ragna T or B
Heki
Disappearance Of Hatsune Miku Expert FC and I'll give you-
And more apps to delete
Diavoros Alter?
Interesting conversation we have here
We?
What's... Going on?
Give me money then
Even so, this phone is 3+ years old and still in good condition, no screen cracks and the performance is still in good condition
It ain't broke, so why change?
Maybe when I get 7TR, I will put down Honkai again, it's eating my storage, I don't even have storage left anymore
Anyways, going to rest because it'll take me hours to fall asleep
Take care everyone
Importantly, board up your doors and windows Heki
Ill torture you in Project Sekai if I ever have space to play it again
Chapter 2
It's not even the hard part of the game yet
Then, what chapter you left on?
I bet you didn't even pass Chapter 1
Wow Heki
Maybe you shouldve keep playing and keep your neurons active
Heh
Heki didn't even last a week
Your brain can't handle it huh
Also Heki, how's Arknights progress so far?
What do you think of the next standard banner?
Morning
Mhm
I want to buy this Sound Voltex Controller but it's too expensive, $169 for the default one without customization, want to play Sound Voltex at home
The Night Is Young

The Ice Cream was Great
Save some for me
Is it Fun when you get calls when you're in the bathroom
How about the *Sacred Ancient Language Welsh*
What.
I just recommend how cleaners clean a one's home place when someone perished in the room, it's sad, but it's quite interesting to know about the process and circumstances about it 
I must watch
Uuuuh
You can officially say if you're [X] Nationality if you have the Citizen card, hah.
Wikipedia might have a way or another but it's just whatever
Alright
Must be tough
But I guess I am the same
Uh-huh
I guess Google is being vague about it
Oh, I see, I never thought it have such deep meaning
Wait, you're not?
Isn't it Aussie just refers people from Australia? Hmm
What's so weird about that?
Aster is an Aussie
Asians
Pensive
Aoiyagi and Nightcord Miku
yeah
Do any of you have Custom Profile Layout?
Oh, it's JP version
Yeah, it's Profile, there's a copy button for it
Wait, is it? Or was it Friend Tab
Well, it's only the place you need to check
Profile
Oh
Cool, wait, what was the prize for it again?
Interesting, by how much?
By the way, who won in the event? Western or Eastern?
Well, the grind is real in events, you have to play nonstop, im still having flashbacks to my Bandori times
I mean, you have to be so unfortunate to hit guarantee
That doesn't make it any better..
But something is missing tho
Hmm, I'll just think I'll just forget about it or it'll just bother me
Like, Menhera kind of stuff
Gurokawa
Thats what it is
Ooooh
Oh right, kind of like that, other word for is Macabre
It starts with M
For example, it's cute but bloody, gory, kind of like that
Okay
I don't know, it's itching my brain that I forget what it is called
Like uuh, kind of bloody and depressing art? Kind of?
I'm trying to dig my brain out looking for that word
I don't remember the term for uuh
Ah yes, The Times I played Azur Lane and left after a week
Most of the issue Is about the Hoyoverse account already having something logged/bind/linked into it
I wonder how many people lost/can't access their account and still haven't recovered it yet
What?
Hmm
Guess what level they are
I have 100k score on Dragon Slaying Houdou
Kallen, BKE, The Healer and Raven
I guess
I'm just using Human Cards heh
Imagine if I get HoR instead..
Don't judge me but I'm buying Valkyries from the shop so I can pull an AE in Dorms
Ancient Willpower down the drain
Anime EXPO heh
Classroom Of The Elite Season 2 Episode 1 Has Officially Premiered
I kind of want to see Benares- I mean, Kurikara in Humanoid Form
This computer is like 5+ years old
It's not a Laptop Fenri
Ugh... Seems like I need to fix my computer, it's having troubles quite lately very slow, might take a week
6.0 When
No, for 6.0v too
Who's the Next ER Valk I wonder
Bring Back Octopus Again
30 Minutes Elysian Realm Run Enjoyer
Agreed
If Jizo's became a boss in Elysian Realm 
Hmm
Nice
Too far to be irrelevant
Casuals exists tho
The Artifact Sets/Bonuses
Also, World Level is exactly the same, even the description
When Wuthering Waves is copying everything, literally copy & paste from Genshin but don'tcha worry, it's just a prototype *Wink Wink*
I would like to have a Portable Sound Voltex
Just a few more hours
I hope it reruns more frequently so we can waste our crystals more quicker
Also Night Baban
Oh, I didn't saw it because I already have it, but why only one ugh
Speaking of skins, I don't remember if Time Runner and HoS's Summer skin ever appeared again?
Why is there no Skin that can be brought with Asterites in Time Capsule this time?
Well I've been doing that for all the Time Capsuled that appeared
I just spent it and bought some Stigmas I will never use in Time Capsule heh
*No Asterites?*
200k Asterites feels so heaven right now
Im going to eat my lunch, I'm immensely low on energy
But who and who?
Like, trading a character to be playable in both games
It'll be cool if Honkai and PGR collabs
As if Tweeter is not a hell of a mess enough
My rougelike where
Its been months, wheres our ZZZ news?/Beta
But, I'll just step aside and enjoy
It'll be interesting to watch them fight
That's what I want to avoid the most
It'll be interesting how WW will be in Final Product
Seems good so far for A Technical Test
It's not a poetry
A life for a life
But torturing them for an eternity seems better
Don't let them have an easy way out
Texas
That's just Genshin to an extent
It's technical tests
Here we go again
I can't even understand what Fenri is saying, doing, thinking 99.9% of the time
Its not my point
I just have such a pale skin
I don't want immortality, what a way to torture yourself
Canada
As they say, im a vampire 
I can't agree or disagree
I have a fair body, kind of, I'm just way too pale and-
I don't know
Is it even normal or not in there
Don't elaborate it
Insert Weirdge
When did I ever said I lived there
What is so good about that
Atleast I'm not in America I guess
I live in the Far East, South or North or Whatever
Missing the important ingredients for lunch
Smh Fenri
Where is the soysauce and salt?
Yes.
Fenri has been saying Okay Go Off these past few days ya know?
Anyways, Wuthering Waves have technical tests live
Well that's is nice I don't have mobuis, so I really don't have to agonize getting her skin
Miserable, now I have to get 7TR
Yeah, good job to my non-existent luck, 10 pulls before pity
Oh, by the way, yesterday
How. Great.
It can take me to 1-3 hours to finally fall asleep
...and I'm pretty pretty sure that my sleep is totally messed up
My body seems to twitch suddenly sometimes out of nowhere, I notice it more when I'm trying to sleep
I know that for sure that I lack sugar.. alot
Be sure to brush Everytime then now
Even it's sugar free
Oh, hows your situation with your nails been?
But Tea tho
I don't consume neither
See?
Well Heki said it's too edgy
Eh, it's just insights I got, want me to sugarcoat it?
You'll never

See them

Again
After you get home

It's where it hits
You know, because they're already gone and you can't do anything
You might feel empty and can't cry in the funeral
But after they're buried and cannot see them
Well, it's interesting as the same time 
But yeah, it's just depressing
The feeling of emptiness, the devoid of emotions, interesting, isn't it?
Something along the lines of that
I don't know how to put it.. when a person cries, but they really don't feel anything
But basically yes
If you've been following what Happ
Ahem

Mikeneko
Mhm
I've been called... A person who shed tears but is it really tears coming from his eyes something like that, just made it poetic
Well basically.. hard to explain, I cannot ask my uncle for him to elaborate that
Don't hide it
Ive been there, well, I still am
They will stop caring at some point you know
The one who got used to it or.. you know it
-But there are exceptions
No one's want to be yelled at neither
Not letting the opportunities pass away I see
Aster, are you supposedly be sleeping
Did you said 3 Nights already?
Nothing's really changed
This is her Vshojo Model
Oh well, don't want to explain it
It's a very very long story
Its interesting you didn't knew about this
Ring a bell?
Okay
Ahem..

*Rushia*
Hmm, maybe not
Are you serious?
So is Mikeneko
Kson's part of the VShojo now, did you heard?
Ikurru Kamijou for his Japanese name
Surprising
Josh
*Yawn*
What do you mean soon enough
Whom we blaming?
Not an excuse heh
The kid's chain's has been broken
Run for your life
It's been downhill so hard since Aster got nitro
Interesting weird Fet-
Josh The Manga Lad is it?
I just thought and realized that I...
Never did Team's rotations ever in Honkai eh..
The Star Rail Section
Oh, it didn't saved, I don't have storage
Probably a Moth
Cockroaches doesn't have wings like that
Oh
A moth?
Hmn
Rest to the both of you
You're both suffering, have a great rest
Always has been Heki
You sure this kid's totally sane?
Heki
Hmm..
Hang in there
Until next month again
I can make my spine pop off
It's must be really tough eh..
Great, my skin on my foot has been ripped off
Yeah, the new effects is not really noticeable
My Front page/Feed is now full of Diluc's New Skin Artworks
Mhm, okay then
How did it turn out?
But, cool, where from
I am
It's not that impressive because it's already connected to my old account
Ah, it's tommorow
Interesting~
Mhm, the opening song is a good one

But it's up most of the time
That's why I said if it's available
I guess that 1 second is important eh
I mean, you can just do this
I think I just do charge attack first then ultimate right after if it's available
Your reputation ehh? By who?
For me... I don't have any idea
Im still starting chapter 3
Delta's nice in ER
...just don't fight Elysia with her
Oh.. I remember I need silk touch to get the specific blocks.
Time to continue building my place then..
Is this another bad omen day of the month again?
I broke a glass today, great
Cremation or Burial?
Now what should I put on her.. stigmata
Last 10 before the pity, seriously, how Hard To Get Senti is.. stubborn as ever
*Sighs*
Seriously...
What? Something else crossed your mind?
Lost
That's the word.
Atleast my house is almsot done.. just the house, there's more I wanted to plan but I feel
I'm still disappointed I lost my 12 diamonds and Alot of building materials
Just say you need some time alone
My Father was something terrible back then, but now, I'm at peace from it finally
It's not like I'm doing it everyday
This is like once in a blue moon
Because I didn't ate lunch yesterday and slept for 3 hours heh..
Cool, I'm very used up and empty too
I just spent my morning building my house, uh..
Building a House in MC is surely rough
I feel progressively empty everyday, is this aging?
Just bear with it
Don't consume anything then, it might give the final push
Cool
Atleast you're not going to stink badly
How humid is it there?
I'm pretty confident to say it's not something special or to be saddened over
Dig and and place a block above with 1 block gap
Hmm, used to it because of school eh
Holding it in?
Tiring..
I also have to go back and forth
But it's going to take too long
Harvesting materials is sure tough
I'm not like, building a big building on it, just a small cabin and mining place, and a gate, nothing more
Im planning to build like a fort or a wall for that big gap
Tunnel, which side to what side?
Anyways, is there any planning in here?
It could use more greenery
1 for two
I did twice

I even planted some inside the base
And planted 10 spruce seeds after it
I actually took down 5 trees
Yes, that is the truth
Kidding, it was the forest outside the base
Well, it doesn't matter if it's far away right? It's not within your territory
Hmmm, I forgot
Alot has happened
Maybe I should hit the max level, I'm halfway there, then I could finally put down Honkai for good
Oh, well, too bad, I already spent too much in SEA
As long I'm the last/recent message, I'm not backing down, unless it's something like a small business
It's just satire.. I really never ghosted anyone.. I would be preferable be ghosted instead
And that is?
Something the matter?
If I ever ghost someone that is..
Gotta use this more for surely
Well, it will be like Adam situation
But hey, better than nothing isn't it?
So, don't be saddened
Well, the one you sent is quicker to understand and saves time
Just like Adam I guess
Huh? What was that?
Hmhmm..
Hungry..
Hmm..

Woah
It ended
Back again
Ended
Back again
Ended
Again
Again
Again
It's back
It ended
Again
Someone's is going to be fired today and you know it
What's going on with the stream
Woah
Heh, the EN stream
Oh, Right
What they're saying?
It does because of lag
Something happened within the stream
What should I do tonight..
I'm completely devoid of emotions right now, don't know what to do up to this point than waiting
Maybe it's been 3-4 years
Ah, time really goes fast huh
I don't remember the last time I have nosebleeds
When the Modern Solider Slaughter Medieval Soldiers
You know what's the True Isekai?

Gate
Isekai is like I was born in another world in EP1
Then it just became a normal JRPG Anime and forget everything
Also, Like Rezero, they still acknowledge the world Subaru came from with the Parent's Arc
Most Isekai is just normal fantasies with extra steps
Ugh..
Isekai
...
Read.
She's the only boss I can fight because I haven't played for several months tsk tsk
Elysia is so annoying to fight
Oh well, time for my daily suffering
I bruteforced the stages using HoT
Ooh, forgot to mention, I'm still climbing within Agony 1
Maybe, I will, through bruteforce
Do you think I can rank up in Agony with using SN to fight Jizo?
Hmm
Maybe I can win a max level prize
Literally boosted my level with level and a half
This was great
How many levels did you level up with offline exp?
By the way, I'm almost level 88
If that isn't easy to get within 3 pulls
I'm going for 10, and I'm really done
My pain is miserable and it's agonizing
It's easy, it's just Russian roulette, search in the internet, download and spin the roulette If you will get malwares or not
Let's put it with another term

Pirate It
It's all over now
Everything got leaked already
I give up
No more.
One more, and I'll give up
If it's the game's will
Then I shall follow and Target another
Good
Hmm, everything is not working out
If I only have 660 B-chips
And bite me in the end
No matter close I am
It will just end up to be my demise
I wish
I will give up tommorow
And save up for 7TR instead
Should I take it or not
Seems like the game have other plans for me
I'm getting tired..
I'm running out of storage to make these 2 games to run (Honkai & Arknights) one more update and I'm gone
Right
I guess one of the most annoying and remarkable boss in Arknights history?
Or she doesn't clear it if it's already in use
Clears all SP seems more brutal for Ops Like Eyja
I wonder how much worse it is in the challenge stages
Oh, that's why she seems familiar
Black Knight?
What's her name?
Does she stall alot or go to the exit ahead
If I can figure out Patriot myself, I'll do the same, don't want my brain to braindead for the rest
It's the most time consuming after all
I just watch Kyo for Annihilations to save time
I actually need to not use support for autos
I see, thanks
I wonder how will I do
Any remarkable mobs?
Because the boss have too many mechanics
Seems like more frustrating
Harder than Blood Knight or Not?
Geez
Seems tough
Fast redeploys
Now more reason to block
Ah I see, you need to keep your distance and block it at the same time or just nuke it
How many tiles?
All nearby ops you say?
I see now why it's frustrating
Oh
Why I ask?
Oh, I remember where I got this
From CC
Skins... Nope, I guess I will not buy anything
I couldn't yesterday night because it was maintenance until 1am
I just woke up hmm
I miscalculated
Well, it's actually 8
Seems reasonable?
Just for that
Skadi Alter Live2D
I wonder too
I'm really short on very basic materials that I can't even level my operator's skill
I don't know
I don't remember
What is it?
Ah
What?
Ah, the one who pushes the enemies away
Who's that again?
40 Pulls in storage
I guess you want me to Target Ling
Okay then
Hey
I wonder if I should pull a 10 on Gnosis
Or bald through ER to get every crystals
7TR is also coming too, seems like I really need to depend on luck
Gotta hit the pity for that, for the first time
Yeah..
Literally.
Yes and I got this within 3 pulls
Also, Arknights EN Voicepack, it's interesting
Not at all
Except when did I need to recover my account when I lost my email, I just contacted CS to let me in the account to unbind and bind another email with the my phone number as evidence, that's I guess what happened
I just contacted CS with my phone number as evidence when it still exists as a login
Good for you, they even warned us months back prior for that
But seems like one of the problems is similar to Heki when you can't unbind an account from the Hoyoverse account or whatever
Seems like alot of people are having problems with their account because of the removable of other logins
Did Heki recovered his account?
Oh well, I have to rest
Hope you get it back Heki
Then what went wrong?
Its not that far off
After all
When you still have the chance and got warned several weeks ahead but yet you didn't do it
Heki
Hope you get it back
I guess
Please excuse myself
*What not to learn from me*
You
Haven't learned anything?

You're the one who said that
So who's person lost their account hmm?
English Voicepack is now available in Arknights
Looks like I will hit the Pity for the first time, what a shame
Is this where all my Gacha luck gone to?
My heavens, why did you forsaken me
Guess I'll be getting HoS to fill in my Needs of Physical Damage issue
I forgot I have this beauty
Does this work for HoS too I wonder?
Tch
These 3 Fenghuang Downs is rotting heavily down here
Why do you think I'm pulling to check if grab a hold of her
Within the sad reality
I guess everything I earned now will be saves for 7TR
Unfortunate
I have 3 of those
Does Fenghuang Down Works For Senti?
I guess that's really out of the window
You know what? Throw everything out of the window
It's just 10 pulls
Because I'm tempted to do a single 10x pull for Greiso's Gear Banner
That's fine, everyone has limits with the knowledge they can carry or want to carry
Thanks, how about the second question I have?
How important is Greiso's weapon for her to work?
What week is 7TR again? Could you please let me know?
SEA Privilege

My PC is running so slow
I know that but, it's better be safe than sorry
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Hmm
But can you explain the recent increasing attacks of pitbulls?
Preference to live within the edge
Get Mauled Instead
Also, Those dogs are more adorable <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
Yeah, but like, there's so many many dog breeds out there that's more easier to train and safe
Shiba, Husky, Golden Retriever, etc
You have so many options 
Yet, why Pitbulls <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Pitbulls are the most dangerous breeds
Nah, still, no matter it is
We don't have Pitbulls around here
People know the dangers of that breed
Internet
Just came across
Yes.
A cat minding it's own business while a stupid owner and 2 pitbulls attack the cat while the owner doesn't have any urgency at all
I just watched a cat getting mauled by pitbulls..
There's been so many cases of Pitbulls attacks and yet stupid people also exists
What a worse combination
In 16 Hours <:wokege:966623232918712331>
I'm just mindlessly farming for the base <:felissad:987316204286922784>

Better check your inside your walls tonight
That just makes me want it to do it with creepy tone
I'm waiting <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Fcked up stuffs means, horror, thriller, etc, something similar
Well, I've been reading some fcked up stuffs these days, maybe I could learn a thing or two from it
What do you want me to say?
Thanks for the compliment
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Maybe because I am one of those scary people <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
That's an exaggeration but it's close
My voice somehow triggers Aster's PTSD <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>

That's not harsh isn't it

Ah.. cold drink is nice
Better get going
Oh, night as well
Maybe I shouldn't have wore a Blazer and a Hoodie at the same time under the heat of the sun
Don't forget her makeup
If it doesn't work or fit
I guess you can just leave it out
I don't know
Anyways
Need to go outside
Take care
Enjoy it
Looking great
Because it's Yunjin? <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Ah... Need to go to school to get something for my graduation
•w•
Done
But oh well
Not my business now
Going to wash my clothes
Her cousin I think
Are you sure the password is not like Roblox1234
Huh
It's just all a bluff
I see
Now, try getting into the email
Huh, I guess things changed
Baban just confirmed it
You can't transfer robux directly to another person
You can either just spend it or buy robux for another person
You can't
Hey Baban, can you confirm?
If I remember correctly, do you need an email to create a Roblox account?
How about email
Imagine all of this for nothing and a little mistake
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
<@964806731471405086> before believing them, ask them for screenshots if they're seriously having problem/changed
Yeah, but
Whar?
Don't ask
children
😔
*sigh*
I just said it..
Kids and Elders... So hard to deal with <:ninondisgust:963351549445304361>
They slll have the email/Google account or whatever
You know what? They did forgot the password?
If they did do the forgot password and reset it
Was it the hacker?
So you are
It's just kids bluffing/lying most of the time about hacking your account sort of stuffs..
Whatever
Do the hackers really have the account?
Whatever it's connected to
Try to get it back
You still have your/cousins email whatever
Seriously?
Wait, do they really have the account?
Just experience dealing with these bunch of shts <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
If that person already know
Sending and telling it to you doesn't make a difference, it just you know that person really has the IP address
If you the person doesn't give the IP address
They're lying
If that person really has your Cousin's IP Address
Tell the IP Address
To know what?
Troll the troll back
Kids.... They tend to be fool around and make up lies all the time
We sure we already know about this
Say, do you believe that is the case?
Kids... Do you think they're really capable of doing that?
That person is probably lying/trolling about the IP address/scam site or
Can you give me a summary?
So, it's Roblox
Hmm
Let me backread
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Oh 
I see
Just woke up and cleaned myself
Okay
Oh, trying to scam you huh
Hah, you met an incel
Wow, did you already created the commission and waiting for a payment or not yet?
Alot
<:heh:964926244447723560>
Former classmates
I don't think I am that remarkable to be remembered
Yeah, my classroom was the highest floor
I know
But it's just a bunch of classroom of vague faces of people I know in the past
Maybe if it wasn't a school that's 50+ floor high
Got chased and harassed by a person, got chased by 2 abomination till the end of the earth and some weird school
I guess this is the result of stuffs I am reading
Great
What a bunch of series of nightmares... What a hella of a night
Night
Anyways
That was way back up to get a reply from that
Perfect
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
You forgot something
Have A Çōlà
Would be cool to give it as a reward after you finish the main story <:holothink:963352118855626753>
The last bridge theme would be in a spaceship in space and it's facing the [REDACTED] Moon <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Tried and downloaded bunch of malwares instead
Yet it's age restrictied 😔
<:ninondisgust:963351549445304361>
If I remember correctly, I made a skin for myself out of boredom like few years ago, I dont know where it is now but I surely lost it because I didn't saved it <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>

How can you get a Wither skull if you can't even enter nether in the server
Or, not in the server? <:sussge:968897150249484389>
<:HuDisgusting:966924145902370866>
Kill a Wither and get a nether star to craft a beacon already you balders <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
I've been rereading Oyasumi Punpun because why the hell not <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Interesting
Meanwhile me, won't stop reading bitter, horror, thriller and fk up shts <:deadge:975652771082698782> <:wokege:966623232918712331>
What book.
What book?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
If I'm very already busy in Highschool, it's only going to get worse
It's relentless
Loads of school works as a senior
I'll say Farewell to my free time very very soon <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I'll be 10x busy when I did
Becoming a Senior
😔
Geez, I'll be graduating soon
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
You'll give in eventually Baban
An opportunity is an opportunity
And a part of it
<:heh:964926244447723560>
And I'm going to take advantage of it Everytime
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Nah, it feels like you're being too kind, saying that I am a demon feels like a have power on something
Hmmm, that feels like a compliment and an insult at the same time <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Baban's need-
Baban doesn't need a vacation
You're missing yourself out
You're part of it
Heki
Do you agree as well right?
You meant pentagram?
How that makes me a whore you <:ninondisgust:963351549445304361>
I'm stealing Heki
<:HuDisgusting:966924145902370866>
What? Jealous much?
Guaranteed you'll be in the freezer the next day
Want to sleep together?
Coward <:ninondisgust:963351549445304361>
I've been reading horror mangas these past few days
Help <:wokege:966623232918712331>
Sure is
5 Sides of Headaches aren't we?
No
But you're guaranteed to die with oripathy one way or another <:heh:964926244447723560>
Grats on guaranteed a protected blue box
Oh well, What a sweet release isn't it?
Good Ending
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
And change it again when Skalter gets her outfit <:heh:964926244447723560>
Scary
Already bought it and used it
I don't have a expedited plan, guess I'll wait
I guess
Time to recruit the tags
I guess targeting for Ptilopis and Warfarin then
Not that long that I got another senior tag and yes
<@447218009749061632> Anything?
No Way
Another One?
Night
N.i.g.h.t
I need it <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Also cool
It's going to get spicy

M.o.r.n.i.n.g
Ba-ban
Guess I'll have to do wash my clothes later or tommorow, need alot of rest
Going to be busy next month
Night
What? <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Banana
Mor-ning.
<:concern:966623298639261746>
Wow
As I said before, it's only for school work and business matters PC
That's the only chance that I could play with my PC
It depends when my relative go to work too
Expect me to see me once in the server
I won't be playing much
Family, School, and such
I'll see you then in the server
I already got experience with it
Yeah
TLauncher
I guess I have to pirate it if I want to play
I don't have money for buying a $30 game
I'll try to join
But not that often than you think
I only have such small time to play
What made you brought up that question dear cata? <:senkosmuggy:969401013930983444>
Well, busy guy huh
<:heh:964926244447723560>
It's understandable
Fenri doesn't show up here that often
My mind has been feeling empty and solely for the past few days
I guess something is happening
<:heh:964926244447723560>
*Let's Keep It Balanced Shall We*
Can't agree more
My part? <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
What did I do to achieve such feat?
That's not such a bad role isn't it?
Am I the cause of the development Arc of the characters?
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Oh atleast I can affect something in the movie itself
What am I then?
An NPC?
<:ninondisgust:963351549445304361>
Hey, whats that look for?
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
It's around 12 of midnight isn't it?
No
It's not that deep
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Yeah yeah yeah
Sleep well, the eyebags doesn't look good on anyone
It's fancier
Mayhe I should call you that instead
Musa paradisiaca Linn
How long are you planning to stay awake?
I'll take that gladly
It's a fair ground
Don't you think?
Hey, I don't take that as a bad thing you know?
What a slip up Tet
I've been saying morning/night to everyone when I'm around 
You make me feel so bad <:senkosmuggy:969401013930983444>
How cute~
You're asking for too much
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
What is the definition of Kind to you?
Say Baban
Oh?
You're longing for that?,
I guess I have to make it more obvious do I?
You're being too kind
Interesting that I start on the fair/0 ground than everyone else
Yes
Correct
Up to you
But that's already obviously isn't it
I could take that you know?
What would you want to see?
How fast can I reach the numbers go fly high?
Or plummet down to the abyss below?
<:heh:964926244447723560>
Just make a social credit system in this place at this point
I haven't yet
My bladder is not that bad
Congratulations then
But how many cycles?
Oh sorry
My auto-correct 
My bad
Want me to highlight it for you Banana?
You just did

Minutes ago
Sleep well
You said that Epi would beat me for the worst ranking place
What happened?
Ugh, how should I put it
My mind has been in the blank for the few days
Anyways, what happened in the short amount of time that Im in the same ranking with Epi now than Heki(old) the last time?
Oh
How touching
Well then
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Could you elaborate more on that?
This is the ranking regarding to Banana
<:nothing:990283279032803338> 
<:nothing:990283279032803338> 
<:nothing:990283279032803338>
You see this?
This is how I feel
<:nothing:990283279032803338>
I need to stand my ground or completely get removed from it
But I wonder
I'm the worst one in the 4th
Baban said it
But I can't deny
This is fun <:heh:964926244447723560>
There we go
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Keilo has an I?
Could it be?
I'm just proving it right now you know?
<:heh:964926244447723560>
Baban?
Yourself?
Then whom?
Sure
<:ninondisgust:963351549445304361>
Just make your mind
Don't take me in and out of it
It's tiring to be pushed around
Heki
Also put some sugar into your words
<:heh:964926244447723560>
Also
You wish
Huh? You can still be a girl, but not as cute to be referred as such a perfect doll
You people
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Ugh..
See?
I guess she wants something else
Be grateful
It's not 99%
It's already afternoon here but

If it is there
Morning
Did I woke you up?
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
I know They exists
But I don't really use it unless I'm really referring to only 1 person

Ugh, English is such a hassle
Some people might take it the wrong way, they might see as they're an object/or a thing
So, the safer way to do it is just refer with their name Everytime, but yeah, I'm not consistent with that
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
To be honest im still not sure or refer to people
I sometimes just use their name or IT, but I guess it may seem disrespectful
Heki's sabotaging it's own account
He chose...
..Mayers from the selector
Oh yeah, Baban
Did you know what Heki did?
Oh Hi

I haven't started Chapter 8 yet
I have to max E1 my ops first to lessen my suffering
I'm really short on LMD and EXP cards eeeh
I hope the event can provide enough
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Me beating 7-18 <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
I beat 7-18 again just to record it <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
I'll just record it then
Isnt it nice?
Account's going nicely
Isn't it that
Something else right?
But yeah, it's not ever yet
2 more Bosses to go
Yeah?
And I manage to beat it
How 
Is 
It 
Scary?
How?
Alright
I guess I have to progress through chapter 8
Want me to show you how I did It then?
That was
Intense
I need every thing to be perfect
Also the RNG for the Dodge and Chen's ammo
The timing is tight
Good News

I Beat Patriot
I Used a Support Operator
Bad news or Good News
Would you like to hear the bad news or good news first?
<@447218009749061632>
Let's do it again
I'll guess I have to beat it with a support after all
I guess beating without a support would be more than such an achievement
Butimunderleveledsotheresnoshameforit
Why?
<@447218009749061632> Almost
I'll tell you if I make progress
I guess 1 will do
Slow
I don't have a good one for it
Let's try that
I probably burrowed Mudrock alot in this chapter
I also wonder

If Chen'Alter can do well here
Yes, I guess so that counts
But the support would also be useless if I don't chose and think with other factors too
Too much trial and error
<@447218009749061632> you know how I beat other stages?
Oh
I know
Hmm
Ugh
How about I try with a support?
Well
That hurts to watch isn't it?
Let me try again
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Well, they died so quickly
Yeah
Breaking the system
That's why
Oh
Wait
Oh my
*sigh*
Let me restart it
It's scared of you
It won't open
Here I suffer then
Cool
Is it showing now?
Discord mobile so scuffed
Its not letting me share screen again
Here we go then
Let me do something first so I will not dox myself
Sure?
Hmm
Anyways
Time to test the waters
We'll find out
I said I'll beat it alone with my own Operators
Nope
Time for RNG
For the Eldritch Horror
Skadi Alter?
Keep the tradition?
Yes
Of course
Yeah, I was wondering, whos 6* star I should E2 first?
She's good for defending
Don't worry, I'll not E2 her again
I need someone to stall okay?
Yeah, I wonder
But I'll try
I see, Glady then
Hmm
You want me to beat it without help of other support ops?
I can bring a Surtr Support ya know
Let's Get It
Ah, here it is
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
You will no longer feel your whole arm anymore after that
You can only do it once ya know
Oh wait

That's Twitter
Nevermind
I'm sure that's a troll <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Woke up, cleaned my place, saw dried blood on my arm, clean it, got into an argument with my sister

Now I feel empty

Every time I finish a series
I just feel empty
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Oh her
I guess she's useful if you have the brain to use her
Some manga I guess
.
Mayers?

Of course
Cool, have fun getting duplicates of her <:heh:964926244447723560>
Why would they do this <:felissad:987316204286922784>
<:MonkaS:966624721925976094>
I can't describe it specifically
But, it seems I cannot get something out of my mind
My mind feels so empty.. it's disturbing me
I can't, I don't know what's wrong
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Morning
Going to face Patriot..
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
The last episode was surely a little bit confusing but <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
No <:heh:964926244447723560>
Bruteforcing
Zero Arts Damage Dealer
Squad <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Finally
Beating Chapter 7 With Thes Operators
I wonder how would I beat it eh
Time to finish where I've left off
Part 2 <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
I don't know what's that but it looks like a messed up chess piece with an alien face
Still sleep deprived
And woke up at my usual time
I slept alot this tine
Ah, Morning
I still memorized my phone ya know
I just woke up like a minute ago
I can barely see anything
Can't ope my eyes
I am just.. going to rest my eyes for a little while..
Night and take care. Everyone
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
What a way to go
When you're really invested on it and ready to read the next chapter
But you see Return To Main Page/No Next Chapter
Just to search up again a little bit deeper and find out that it has been *Discontinued*
That reminds me..
The manga I was reading was discontinued
How disappointing, my day has been ruined
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Agreed
I mean
What?
He does?
<:heh:964926244447723560>
It wouldn't take long
You'll eventually get there when you are forced to think and live up to regret your actions
<@781539392039682058>  
How is your Arknights going?
What an old game that is
I see
Oh 
I should craft Divine Keys right?
Oh need to login into Honkai
I haven't done anything today..
I feel so lost
Adding up that I lost 5 hours trying to set up a horror game to stream and everything was not working out
I'm so done I give up <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Keep track carefully next time and taoe care as usual
Want me to block it's flow?
Thanks, atleast it was not the original roast I intended to <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Also, I apologise for earlier
I know, it was so mean of me
Sorry
Fair
Anything?
<:senkosmuggy:969401013930983444>
Right now
Check the corners and under your bed
If there is a web
There is
Those little spiders with long legs
They are creating too much webs
There has been some pesky rising up suddenly
Ah I see
Taking care of your room much?
Don't let the dust and webs rot in there
<@309634550273933314> what was your symptom again? And the cause of it?
<:heh:964926244447723560>
Guess I have to forward this
But it's not enough of an excuse
Night Heki
Contain your sanity so it don't leak out again
When was I
Huh?
But are you getting enough sleep?
I don't want to be harsh to someone's already broken <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Almost
Recover that bit back
Oh, sorry, im not good tracking time
Feeling well now?
How was you last week?
Hope you have been taking care
I wouldnt last that much
I know
I inherited everything from my mother
But... Im not able to gain that much weight
4 years ago I guess
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
I'm around 45KG last 1-2 years ago
Youre way too generous
Please <:seele:963352407365017640>
I've done it now
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
So is you losing weight-
As I've said before
If Heki's Mid
I'm Undercooked
Bottom of the Bottomless Pit it is
Must stop
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Would-
You
Tet <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
<:seele:963352407365017640>
Roast me
Nah
That's not fun
So, I wouldn't feel that bad
Do it first
Roast me back at this point
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
But I would be hated for it
I still cannot let go 
I want to pour the fuel and light it up so badly
I'm not rushing it
To go over that quickly
I'm not that harsh
Would you rather get your skin burnt beyond recogniziom or some broken bones?
You can still survive 
It's just some physical trauma
I've still got muscles ya know
Been working out these few weeks <:heh:964926244447723560>
Even I'm not buff
Im still skinny but body has build within it
I can't let it burst and burn you to crisp
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
<:heh:964926244447723560>
Holding the flamethrower in
I'm not that far off <:heh:964926244447723560>
It's better that way
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Want to roast you so bad but I've going to hold myself back because it's too harsh
Kinda struck the first time I read it

I guess I've been in the similar situation
But not sinking in the ocean though
Want the last one? <:senkosmuggy:969401013930983444>
Just going to dump some manga panels
Surely
I wonder
Ah, cool
You've grown with it huh
Nitro privilege
Another Reminder For Tonight
Panel was so good
Yeah
A YouTube Intro
What? I don't not know
It's an artist original work
I would send the artist name though if you want
No one

Internet's dying
Is it telling me to sleep?
I feel miserable
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Ugh..
Eeh
Need to rejoin to see that voice channel
Don't mind me
Ugh.. my earphone also broke.. can't also be loud
I'm drained and exhausted.. ugh..
I'm here
Be awake with us then
Was okay
I ate barbeque for Dinner
Need to wash the dishes and charge it before it dies
Add that I'm going to be sleep deprived too
I just feel a little bit down
So, I would say sorry in advance if I'm going to be harsh Tonight
Cool
What was it?
...just, very muffled
I heard you before
I don't see why I would say no
That's the way
Embrace and improve on it
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
A day has passed... And it was not a good day
It's fine and all
Hmm
Just use your precious currency for sanity eh
Eh
You'll get in there I'm a day
I mean
It applies to every Construct between their A and S right?
I mean... Every construct changed so much after they got made into a construct..
Well, you be you
Or
For you?
Elaborate Perfectly Sized
I'm.. tired
Nevermind
I do not think so
Alot just happened
My bad
Oh
We're you streaming Lee earlier?
Is that Lee
So
When will you invite Diavoros for the surprise party?
Don't go back crying on us again
Atleast I managed to change my Discord account for something
I just can't believe I wasted 5 hours my life for nothing
Would you join it to make it a little brighter?
*sigh*
Whatever
I give up..
It can't stand streaming.. ugh
My computer is dying for what I am doing
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I'll play this instead
I'll just give up
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
So scuffed
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Discord being a btch
Also, less spooky
This is the only way I can stream
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Watch me Heki
Ugh
Guess I'll do it this way
Why running a game is so Difficult
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I just wasted my time
Everything
Everything
I can't even fix my sht
This is so scuffed
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
Is it laggy?
Heh
This is such a hassle
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
<@129446145314258945> do you mind?
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
I hate my life
Ive been trying for 4 hours to stream this game..
Do you mind If I join too?
Oh someone is already streaming
What an idiot I am
It took 4 hours to set up something
Tsk
Guess I have to dox myself to stream
Well... That's a bummer
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
Test
I didnt got it back
It's my account
Whatever
I'm tired to play around
<@726672158151147521> Fuck you
What in the world I came back into
<:huh:966619839307321394>
What the fck
Hold the fck up
Wait
Ugh
So hard
Cry
I'm trying to run this goddamn game
Cool
Nice
What does he do?
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
My computer is so slow
Is just shows a dark screen
It's getting late
I'll try
Discord really doesn't want me to stream sht
😔
Why does the game only shows a black screen
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Time to fix stuffs again huh
Is it even showing?
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
<@468680026162724864> hey join
It's a 2013 game
It's a bit cluncky
But that's what I like
My computer couldn't handle that much
Want to get spooked?
<@309634550273933314> if you're still awake and here
I'm on
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Horror Game Time
Such entertainment <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
This Genshin Newbie 
Hah
The channel is going to be interesting for a while
Time to spooky Myself at midnight
So
Uh
I'm going to stream a horror game
Don't know <:heh:964926244447723560>
Maybe
Xiao?
Eh
What?
<:kyoukaconcern:967581142641430580>
It's downloading so slow
Or the sea
If would like
And send her off by the river
Bury her now
I think I just bricked my computer
My computer won't work <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
I just froze my whole computer
My steam broke
Heh
One side of my headphones doesn't work
You know what's worse when playing a horror game?
Cope
Cope Heki
Not yet
I'm still downloading it
It's from 2013
Want to to see through it more?
<@309634550273933314> Tet, I'm going to play a Horror Game
😔
Sheesh
You seeing this?
That image?
Nothing
Hello
Umm
Come here for a bit
Hey
Anyone want to watch one song?
Fixing..
I have 24pp
Fixed
It's. Nothing. Darkness
I can do only 4X Osu Mania
Such a shame
Oh my..
I haven't able to play Osu for so long..
Yeah, I don't know if you could shape it into roses/flowers
Seems hard
I cant
Do it then
No one's stopping you
And
Good luck on it
Yours?
I would like to remind you fully
Herrscher Of Sentience
Get HoS
What?
I do not know if I will have OSU
Is it lagging?
I do not know
Better
It's tracking me
Oh..
Why does my character looks so sad?
Whatever it's still good
Like, having hands, remove watermark, etc etc
VTube Studio
It's free
But you need to pay for most of the features
I am just testing stuffs with it
A VTuber Model
Yes
I know you can have hands
It was so hard to set up
Now what?
It's working now
Hey
Look
Tet
Can you see the preview in my stream?
Just broke my computer
Great
Ah
Broke it
Don't mind me testing how VTuber works again
Oh it's working now
This is much harder to set up now
I'm trying to set up the VTuber avatar to work
Setting this up is so difficult
I didn't touch my steaam account at all
I wonder if should stream and play Cry of Fear
You also gotta move ya know?
Taking care of elders is so exhausting..
Tch
<:ninondisgust:963351549445304361>
I've been reading this manga for too long just to found that it has been discontinued
I'm also bitter and disappointed right now
Or would you like to eat some onions
None
And im kind of lazy and undetermined to cook right now
Yeah, but the someone I've been taking care of haven't eaten lunch yet
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Help me make afternoon lunch
Well, that was disappointing
I'm... 
Aaaah, such a shame
Wow, that's, something else
I've been struck..
Damn...
Night and Take Care
Don't drown in your sleep
Myself
Nothing
Dammi-
I'll be staying up again this night
But I already feel my body collapsing
It's weak
Aster is perfect on its own, it's fine
It doesn't need a change
Eh, I'm not doing anything
Alot of people already calls me that you know..
I wouldn't mind
You can always call me like

*AoIdiotic Kori*
Mhm, guess so
But you can always exaggerate it
It's normal
Roblox lobbies are just like that
See who have a tougher skin and last
We bite and tear each other
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
You call me names
Don't be surprised if I bite back
It suits you
Thanks, Night and Take Care Banana
Forget it
I'm just way to absorbed to with the media I'm consuming right now
Up to your interpretation

But I know what I said idiotic and doesn't make any sense <:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
Or

Are you
You're way to sentimental to have a word with that
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
Oh this reminds me
How is it been about your nail biting addiction situation?
-w-
Hey, how do I stop snapping my fingers
Or save it for scores
You can use it to remove bullets
The meter is the bonus score
It's bugged
I can't join the VC chat
I'm grateful
Oh cool
It's the game I like
It's becoming such a hindrance
But it's too humid and I sweat a little bit faster
Steady going
What's the difference when you're out in the wild?
I guess I just read a manga too much <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
You take and harvest everything in the wild

You think, it might came from other non-sentient creatures, and there hard work isn't it
But you leech to the world itself no?
If it's a game that would have consequences, of course I would think it through more
You can just take it and plant it again
As it should be
Well, it wouldn't affect them or me one way another
There's no consequences
But your consciousness says a different thing otherwise
That's what the game intended it to be
Not anymore if they are gone
<:senkosmuggy:969401013930983444>
You can always burn it down after stealing everything they own ya know?
I just find a village and make my own place near it
Saves alot of hassle, time and resources
If you were to build a house in MC, are you that person to build a place in a mountain/cave/underground/villager house/or make your own above the ground?
And you don't need to do that anymore
That's in the late game
Saves the fuel and time
So the Food is cooked, fantastic isn't it?
I craft a Flint & Steel and Burn The Animals with it
You know what do I need to get my hunger back faster in MC?
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
The steak is raw
<:heh:964926244447723560>
Like a true caveman
Then you shall forbid
The green book next to it peasant
Use the damn book/guide
You can't make tools with it
You need to make it into a bar first
Hacker
I don't know
I don't play Minecraft
Just some random knowledge
You can make lighting rod out of it to make it somewhat a use
Its invaluable
Interesting isn't it
I saw that
<:heh:964926244447723560>
Copper
I'm trying my best
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
?
Why not? It'll be fun shooting you
Upside is
You can shoot Furries in-game <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
It's free, but whatever
*shrug*
You can play this Instead

Pass on it
APEX, battle royale shooter
🍿
Just gonna grind in my Gacha games
You're level 143
I doubt it
You can get a guaranteed heirloom pack every 500 Packs if I remember correctly
<:heh:964926244447723560>
Wait
Is that a guaranteed?
Now suffer
Nice Heirloom, grats
Get that Graze <:heh:964926244447723560>
I personally like this one
Moriyashrine
Touhou Danmaku Festival
It's free in the Touhou site
I don't remember what's the game called again
Ripoff <:HuDisgusting:966924145902370866>
My friend Pedro?
Mobile legends eww
League ew
I used to play APEX, but I only lasted for one season <:heh:964926244447723560>
Balorant <:terium:973796767793569802>
What a shame <:ninondisgust:963351549445304361>
<:senkosmuggy:969401013930983444>
Why? You scared because it's dark in there?
Play Horror games, I will
Just, what the hell is going on with APEX
Make Caustic Toxic Again <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Also, A shame for Lifeline too, buff when?
Season 13, theres no turning point 😔
Too many Wallhacks Legends
Yeah, but still a shame
My boi Pathfinder 😔
Yeah
That's why APEX is falling down from it's Glory
Rampage yay <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Just use Rampage and Volt smh
They even buffed helmets that you can't even 1 hit headshot with a Kraber anymore, what a hella shame
<:heh:964926244447723560>
Yeah, APEX is such a mess right now
APEX has truly fallen down since Season 12
<:ninondisgust:963351549445304361>
<:HuDisgusting:966924145902370866>
I think it reduces bullet drop
What
Are
Babbling about?
Is it way too satisfying to hit a few headshots and see your enemy crawling to the ground in the hopes they would survive-
If I cannot get a hold of it
Longbow w/ Skullpiercer then
Kraber
...There's no next chapter, how long I need to wait for it be finished 
What a pain it is
That's before the system got messy and fcked
<:heh:964926244447723560>
Enjoy getting to Diamond or Master whatever
Even Public matches has been messy too
Oh, forgot to tell you, APEX Ranked has been messy this past few months eh
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Tsk
Why not? I like it that way, I am
Morning
But I'm already awake several hours ago.. I've been just spending my time alone reading some stuffs
It's chilly
🙃
Heh
You didn't fool me, just speaking my take on the Young Girl Controversy, whatever you call it
But.. what's the thing that supposed to fool us <:sussge:968897150249484389>
Did I just woke and chose violence? <:wokege:966623232918712331>
It's like, cutting the same bread in half
But it still doesn't change whatever it is
It's still the same bread
If you separate one to each other
It's still there, but not whole
But if you think it of it, aka Loli is just not about the age, its about it's own appearance and mentality/age
A wise person told me
If age is just a number
The jail is just a room
So is the knife as cutting tool
Ah..
Take care
I will.
Ah, have to sleep, I was enjoying reading a manga, I managed to find something interesting than I anticipated, but sleep comes first after all...
... 
Night everyone
And a Glock
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Tet
Grab a spray and spray it everywhere
Tet, that's not worse than a mosquito
Eat it
Nightbath is so refreshing <:slacc:963350438940397588>
Time for bath
Cool
I am <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Interesting
I'll try that
I want to •u•••n• k••• ••o• ••s••••s <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Oh
My relative gave me a snicker
Cool
That's, interesting
But if you get lucky <:heh:964926244447723560>
Definitely A Second Before Time Runner for Me
Same <:deadge:975652771082698782>
The effects are a step up
Mobuis Skin is definitely one of the best skins holy <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
What..? Cool


No, I'm talking about my only SSS Valk that is Valkyrie Gloria, such mere coincidence <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
VG 😔
Me with my only SSS Valk That is Fire Duck <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
I already have almost 4k crystals just in 3 days.. tired
Autocorrect my bad
Anyways
Time to take my crystals in ER
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
About that...
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
How many runs you need to do to max a valk in ER? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
*That's a good argument Tet, but how would you like to back it up with a source!?*
Female Diavoros? <:MonkaS:966624721925976094>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
0 <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
90% of them are untouched <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Oh ho
Let's say, 30 pulls then
Welp, time to get it
With level up Bonus?
How many crystals do you think is rotting there?
*Oh The Misery*
Would like to see something Agonizing?
Discord has been having problems since the other day
Cool, some are looking forward it
Aight, take care
When will you run a Jackbox Session again?
Oh
ReBoot, can I ask a question?
Hmm
Nah

I'm just going to make something to fully wake me up
Nyam
<@244423082045997057> who do you like the most here?
Yawn...
There is still other limbs for that
I am fine,, I'll go back again having 10+ hours again after this, I rarely stay up overnight, once or twice a month
Also, it's so humid, who would go back to sleep for that?
I'm fine, don't worry about it
No, I can't, once I'm awake, I can't, it's already soon to be noon
I just slept with 3 hours just the other day ago
Yeah, not ba
To be exact, I overslept 3 hours I'm supposed to wake up..
4 Hours?
..Yes Baban
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
💤
An hour..
Bedge
But.. I would take an hour nap instead..
I guess a Tea could carry me through the day
Seems familiar
Not~?
May-be?
Uuh
Cool and uuuhm..
Slept well?
Morning, great start to a day huh?
Yeah.. I'm dum <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
Don't know which one tho
Oh, I should upgrade those? <:holothink:963352118855626753>
I'm too casual for this <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
DKs stands for? <:holothink:963352118855626753>
What do I use this for again? Cubes?
*Nods Nods*
*Nods*
But Jeez <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
Not really
They're majority in S Rank and few of them within SS Rank
Don't ask about my SP Valks
That's all
<@351080331824332813> When is the next Time Capsule? :bog:
I need to max my dorm <:felissad:987316204286922784>

Baam

I would like to do some briish accents now
I'm trying to process what's happening right now <:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>

Morning
And it's 5am already.. I wonder what should I do
Well, I didn't last long with Elysia, I manage to put her down to 12x health bar tho
I thought I'm done but yeah.. I remember this exists
Oh 
It's 4am, I guess my mind is just not.. in it's Norma functioning state
But, I'll mald in ER <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Lets go fail Floor 8 here I go <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Clock
I don't know who to trust
Then, I'll fight HoD then? <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Okay
Clock
I can always skip the reviving phase of Clock with HoT's ult anyways
So
Which is less agonizing with HoT
Clock or HoD
Choose <:TeriGun:973793149992435752>
I haven't unlocked her Signet yet <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
I thought it's Mech <:terium:973796767793569802>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
HoT <:PikaXD:966624196564242432> 😔
Is HoD more easier than Clock in ER? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Yeah, I'm exactly *Going Numb*
Uh huh..
I guess you got a point right
<:felissad:987316204286922784>

<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Oh
Don't mislead <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Maybe I should pull her

Oh Vill-V is Fire?
Whatever
<@148145559897636865> Cup Size <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
What? It's Hoyo, you never expect it, but I guess you can predict it
Fine, Cup Size <:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
*Assets* you know what I'm talking about
I mean.. if it's Ely Herrscher tho <:holothink:963352118855626753>
So
Anyone wanna bet if the Valkyrie Assets is bigger than Vill-V?
Maybe
That would make sense
Whom?
Still
Greatsword <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Oh
Right
Greatsword <:deadge:975652771082698782>

<:Griseostare:976641888998293584> <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Until you pull again
Save the 4 5* star selector next time
Pick Nearl already geez
Not emotionless
Physically <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Ah, my heart
It's tightening again

Cool
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
Patience
2-3 Days or So
<:HuDisgusting:966924145902370866>
Don't
Use
That
For
Pulls
Why No E2 Ora Ora? <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Then, we can decide
Do another 10x pull again
We Hang Mountain?
You need to care
Atleast know what in the world you need to do with her <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
She's a Defender Healer if you want to know what she do <@781539392039682058>  <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
No worries
What..
<:HuDisgusting:966924145902370866>
I see
Wait for another 10x pull in the Beginner Banner before choosing
Operator Tab you dummy <:slapbaka:974814370817273876>
Shut it
Take care and Recover Well <:TeriGun:973793149992435752>

If Heki's Mid
I'm undercooked <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
Oh
Keep it up Champ <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
You're *Okay* Heki
Yeah
Agree so
I would agree to keep
Wactha think Baban or Taihen?
Battery for Apple Pie?
Cool
Unless you really want Daddy SilverAsh
You're good to go
Yes
No
Every valk they released I mean <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Does it keep getting bigger?
No wrong

Stranger's Support units are based on your Doctor's level
It doesn't apply for Friend's Supports
That message is for Stranger's support level
Except for Friend's Support Unit <:heh:964926244447723560>
But-
I'm way to sleepy (excuse)
My bad
Oh
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Mountain/Eyja/Mudrock/Thorns/Surtr/Chalter
Is enough to carry me, also they're E2 Lvl 80+
Ack-
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Yeah
Exactly
Chalter E2 Lvl 90 looking tasty for that CC Medal
I haven't unlocked the Training Center yet <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Eh
I think Myrtle was the only good choice to E2
And, I'm desperate for that Medal, because Myrtle already have 80% of the Materials needed for E2
I made a promise to someone <:felissad:987316204286922784>
I know
But preferably better than Cuora isn't it? <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Global Passive Healing
As soon as possible to get that CC medal
I mean
I speedran Myrtle to getting E2 <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Yeah, need that AOE universal heal
Heki it's only 5 mins I betcha <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
I already invested for Perfumer for AoE Heal <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
SilverAsh or Apple Pie
It's worthless
Go
Sorry
Your luck still lingers 😔
But, I have Shining tho
Silence
It's only 5 mins to reroll
Also <@881369538946531338>, take care and recover well <:felissad:987316204286922784>
Reroll
Heki Colourblind
Reroll
Uuh, that's-
Who did you got Heki? <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Why are you saying damn?
It's yours? <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
Wait
What?
You get 2?
2 Surely
Executor/Blitz/Red/La Pluma/Specter/AshLock/WaaiFu/Corro/Flint/Akafuyu/Savage/CliffHeart/Grani
I guess that's it
Ah, okay, let's see
Pray to get SilverAsh
No <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324> 
Do the starter or you'll get nothing
Still don't know whom to get 
I'm split between, Manticore/Skyfire/Warfarin but I have Shining already
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
I miss that place
Fake Minecraft Launcher?
Oh
TLauncher
Heard pirating MC seems hard nowadays
Okay, Take care
Anyways, Im not able to join the MC server unless I pirate
😔
I will not stop bothering you until I return to normal <:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
<@482139585355448333> If you want
I'll get Skyfire in the Selector <:PepeSmile:966629532943650836>
<@482139585355448333> but then again I wouldnt want to invest Gitano or Lava
I would preferably wait to get a better one till then
Ahem
*SEA Server*
I'm the Heki of Asia
I'm just a drowsy person
No come back <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
She wouldn't 😔
<@482139585355448333> I survived the Nearl Event and beat all stages without using much AoE Casters 
But fck Blood Knight
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
I mean
I did fine in my old account without mostly using AoE casters
That S1 Executor looking fresh though <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
I know game gives you 10x pull right off the bat
Just enough for 10
Starter
By using Thorns/Chalter/Mudrock as support <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
To the way to Chapter 7
I just did
I'm already in Chapter 6
Bruteforce everything <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
I don't want to damn Invest in Gitano <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Executor <:PepeSmile:966629532943650836>
<@781539392039682058> Use 2X speed Heki <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Also
I still have this OP Selector <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
I am Baban <:TeriMald:973795215045455872> 
That you just added
Just bruteforce your way through it
I think Executor is enough
<:HuDisgusting:966924145902370866>
I'm trying but
No luck with recruitment
I'm going to promote Click next surely <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Don't you see it? <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
I do <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
I know
But that def shred tho <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Also
I lack Arts damage
So I use Executor to compensate for it
I'm going to promote them as soon I get LMD <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I think Nearl is enough to do it <:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Too much Guards <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:senkosmuggy:969401013930983444>
Limited OP
Too bad
9th Day Progress I Guess
Now reroll and cry <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Account something button main screen
That's all
Start a new one <:TeriGun:973793149992435752>
Now
Cool
The previous account

Done
Viola
Just do it
Add both
My Kal'tsit 😔
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Yeah
Bind it first 
Before leaving it
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Did you bind it with something else Heki?
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
...
Add Babans
Just 
I think you preferably don't want to delete it
Just in case
Or actually your pull?
Is this yours?
I mean
5* 5 stars? <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Oh
Cool
Well
I guess your team wouldn't die anyways
Shining 😔
Baban
Would you do the honors?
Shining <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
So, no need to worry about that
All people are just in 1 server
Nevermind
It might be a dead weak? I don't know
Event just ended
Oh cool
Update's is in 24 hour mark
The what?
Hmm 
Dunno?
<@447218009749061632> When will reBoot will do a Jackbox Session again? Many people are anticipating to join so
Just going to clean myself before staying up again for extra 3 hours 🛁
I think it's the good time to do so or you're going to miss this one
Hey Heki
When are you starting Arknights <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Don't mind my drowsiness <:kianalicc:963697526685442068>
Share <:TeriGun:973793149992435752>
Share <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
I still use Diluc as Dps to this day
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
I'm into

😔
Maybe if could go back in time and start all over again on Honkai
I'm going to be that player to pull every only Gacha Valks and none of their weapon at all <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
I also did <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Impossible, kind of
Maybe
Me wondering if Honkai they will add a final battlesuit/enemy type <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I will get a Herrscher if she's a universal support or physical... Maybe
Delta and SN is the only dps I have <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Does Choco Coin Works? <:HMM:966625453194485760>
One thing I did
I caught him with a Deez Nutz Joke
That was enough for me <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Diavoros <:HelloFbi:977468843884691456>
Typing/Grammar Issue Me
I Am
No Shame
Just slap everyone
Equality at it's best
You've got Grass?
That's better already jeez
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
That's not really far off
That's like a step above a 100 steps ladder
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
Maybe
I am the Heki of the SEA server <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Emote Fail <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Atleast Honkai is getting more attention now making the Devs make game changing improvements
That's a win situation
Just don't mind the Toxic players getting in the way
They liked the game that much 😔
I mean
If the S-Ranks have fun/unique mechanics/gameplay
No doubt it working 😔
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
The next question
What would be the Next Arc after Elysian Realm Arc has finished?
Ke🇧in Arc? <:terium:973796767793569802>
It's free nor BP <:terium:973796767793569802>
Oh
She turns to the Blue theme to match her partner Kev-
*ahem*
Unless it's free
Then we are talking
Hmm
No Hard Feeling one way or Another
It's whatever
<:heh:964926244447723560>
Not for her Assets tho
Imagine <:KekPat:966625000339668993> <:terium:973796767793569802>
Then AE got Abyss Flower/Seven Thunders Treatment <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Since AE has been thriving for many patches now
I would play it safe by saving for the New AE killer instead
Imagine 4/4 AE then just got slapped with the new AE <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
I hope they rerun those more frequently
Also, Add in the Bridge Theme/Background
Time Runner and HoS Summer Skin Rerun to make Captains go broke with Herrscher Patch
Me getting Turgs off rates than my desired Verne
6.0 Herrscher matching with Elysian Realm Arc
Oh, I wonder who would it be <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Dammit
I guess I'll give up getting her
7T and Herrscher is top priority
I like her gameplay style
I hope
Vill-V is like FR or Ely
S rank but farmable/buyable
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Sh-
Wrong server
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
What Captain level does unlock APHO next patch again?
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
So humid again
You know what you should do?
Full Refine all variety of weapons and lock it
Throw everything else in the bin for a bit of Mora 

That's what I did <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Good Ending
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Herrscher <:terium:973796767793569802> or Vill-V <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:holothink:963352118855626753> 🍵
Few hours for me is 1 - 3 hours <:holothink:963352118855626753>
I am
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
<@447218009749061632> I have a stacked friendlist
:Madge:
Are you implying I roll for Horni? <:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
I don't really care about Abyss and MA, I just do it, whatever score I get, I'm fine with it, I'm just, whatever
Anyways, I'm that Waifu/Husbando/Gameplay over Meta Player
Literally me
Of course it do, but I wouldn't give it to other people other than you, the former <:felissad:987316204286922784>
Don't worry
I'm not really a competitive player
I became a casual now
I mean, if you want to take it back <:felissad:987316204286922784>
I mean, I've just came back as a returnee after 6 months
You want it back?
Sure
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
F2P BTW
No HoS
No AE 
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Not when I bruteforce SSS Jizo with SN
Forever above 15% as F2P <:sirincheer:963698336462934027>
I think I can't pass below 15% <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Yeah
Hellmaru isn't really that hard because Hellmaru doesn't have some special mechanics
Just true bruteforce
MA <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
What's your percentage Baban?
Anyways
Finally in Chapter 6
Time to experience it again :despair:
Morning
I worked out at 2am to damn force myself to collapse and fall asleep
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Bingo
What do you think I did do? <:senkosmuggy:969401013930983444>
I still feel so bad till this day, I should've thanked her instead, I will when I met her again <:felissad:987316204286922784>
And i exhausted myself to force myself to sleep <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Having that memory in my head from middle school certainly ruin my night and kept me awake for 2 hours <:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>

Noon
Night
Finally fell asleep
And awake
Morning
Anyways

Server is extra quite today
Heki

😔
Until I got into the basement
Atleast I've got more years to live
Correct
Then again
You're busy saying deldough <:holothink:963352118855626753>
You just noticed that till now?
Let me rephrase it
Took you long enough <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Most Scuffed PardoCat Build ever

Yeah, knew it 😔
Isn't it? <:heh:964926244447723560>
Its just basically
I may have a guess
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
I know
Oh
Is it <:holothink:963352118855626753>
What is it?
Once you witness it
You can't stop looking away from it
That's a lame excuse bruh <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
<:concern:966623298639261746>

<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
😔
I'm too lazy to search it and I prefer it that way
But I know it's something <:sussge:968897150249484389>
I don't know neither
Umm
If you don't mind, I may add another friend here that y'all don't know <:TeriStare:973793234096648202> 
Be kind
Voice acting 😔
ProZD yes
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
*Don't hit the notification bell*
You forgot one thing
Why one ER Run takes 30 minutes to finish
Is it Skill Issue? <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<@516591030326525983> Don't worry
The enemies aren't that bad <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Emotional Fear Issue  <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>

Roblox
How many crypto currency I can get <:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:HuDisgusting:966924145902370866>
Also
It's also free and low Specs Friendly-
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
He
😔
So uuh
Anyone would like to play this game?
It's a 4 coop campaign shooter
Actually spooky, also kind of hard if you have skill issue
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
I could buy 25 ice creams with that
😔
It's $29.99 specially<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Minecraft - $30
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
If anyone enjoys shooting monsters
I would like to play Cry Of Fear
It seems fun <:holothink:963352118855626753>
I'm also broke
Vanilla <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Rent a server

<@309634550273933314> Let's Play A Horror Game 
But idk
Or You could play The Forest
It's good
Survival/Horror Game
Can also have alot of people too
Low Specs Friendly
Pacify?
The one with the last is free
Also, it's Paid
But, Easy Difficulty I guess <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Yes
But that's hard without team coordination/cooperation
Multiplayer Horror Games <:holothink:963352118855626753>
ReBoot has the Jackbox package <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Next Jackbox Session When?
<:kyoukaconcern:967581142641430580>
Don't worry
She joined that server because of the *Emotes*
It's so sad Keilo perished because of Ligma 😔 
Keilo's sacrifice will not be in vain 😔
Like Ligma?
<:holothink:963352118855626753> 🐟 🥗
I wonder <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Who do you think will get the next Abyss Flower/7T Treatment?
😔
Bring the Delta Regime Back <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Me who just forged her last piece yesterday
Oh
That's unfortunate
Can't skill issue you in Abyss
Heki what server are you on again?
Ugh, my neck has been really stiffed since this morning <:felissad:987316204286922784>
*I choose Waifu/Husbando over Meta Player*
<:terium:973796767793569802>
I mean, I got far enough
Maybe, if I turned on Buffed Mode and DP
I could make it
I'm a Level 86 Captain with a mind of a Casual Player <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Nah
Impossible
Or maybe I should bruteforce it with Delta <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Oh

I'll try again with her
DP? <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Celestial Teri is buried in the underground prison
Without Buffed Mode?

Nope, Not A Chance
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
Whatever let's see
I think I can clear it but
Not much
Buut I guess it helps
Oh
Lowers the score
I don't even know what's that <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
I think I'm too Free2Playz to beat SSS
Also, No HoS <:PardoCaught:969639185826848848>
I think I just saved my account few days before it got banished
I believe in Bruteforcing <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Do it
Everyone said good night
I think this is true <:holothink:963352118855626753>
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
Night
...

Don't
Do you think I will get 7T?
I think every thing I desire avoid me and give me another good thing I don't want <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
I can't believe that 90% of my Asterite are gone to buying skins in Time Capsule
Me and My SP Valks dusting in S Rank
Money Cat too OP in ER <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
I woke very late that it's Afternoon now Great
So, I can't say morning, sadness
😔
Damn
Skill issue
Using a controller feels more smoother and safer for this
You died?
<:heh:964926244447723560>
I already beat this game like
3 years ago?
SMH weak
SMH
Already got hit
But fine
I'll accompany you bozo
The grind never stops even when you're eating
That's the issue
I'm playing Arknights while at it
12AM Gang
I'm eating my dinner
I think there's nothing to suck to
I'm A Level 86 Captain
And I still haven't know the meaning of it <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
What does SP Valkyrie stand for again?

Time to do EE Cat Run
Thanks U Again <:felissad:987316204286922784>

<@385655541248163840> Nini? <:felissad:987316204286922784>
Where is your imaginary friend at?
I'm doing ER with my cat pardo
Thanks u
What is the free redeem codes? <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Old <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Oh yeah
You have more flesh than me
Mhm
Seems like I'm taller than you <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Anyways
Take care whatever
Laying down is not necessary
Not enough space for 5 feet distance for both of us
Time to take my night bath
Yeah, I know why
And
Weird texture, as you expect
It just... Very salty
You can even buy those edible bugs/insects in a packet
That's very tame
Of course there is

People have no bounds creating such things
Is there such thing as Sour Chocolate?
Oh, yeah, I've consumed these before when I was younger
Let me search that
We have those ball candies that packs a punch <:holothink:963352118855626753>
As long it's not something vile
Cool <:HMM:966625453194485760>
I see <:HMM:966625453194485760>
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
How do you know that?
Lime is good <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Taco Bell or Eat Something Related To Carolina Reaper
Choose Your Own Misery
Hot Wheels <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
That chicken is coated with sauce <:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
Thomas the Engine is also on fire <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Well, it's dough tho
Understandable <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
You digest those? <:holothink:963352118855626753>
One bite at a time for efficiency
Just remembered a story from that <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Just eat human flesh instead
Return to Undead Gang
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
There's a slim chance that my friend may join here <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Oh
Next Thursday
Like, 2-3 days?
Sorry
I have a memory of a gold fish
June 30 is the update right?
I guess thats a bad decision
I only Pri a weapon of a character if they're 4/4
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
They bite me most of the time

Not that bite that tears your skin off
All I get are scratches from my cats <:felissad:987316204286922784> 

They're marking me too much
Hope the rabbits and felines situation don't happen ever again <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
😔
Australia is wild when it comes to wildlife <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Don't step on em Urchins <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Low-key looks cool
It looks very out of place for some reason but <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Where Thou Banana float 😔
Yeah
She doesn't use her actual weapon type
Also, The skin is missing this hair accessory trail which is very good <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
😔
Well, atleast it's not bad as this when you can see 2 big contrast of colors
Well, in this case, the original costume is matched with the weapon
But, this is a paid skin the color of theme of said character <:felissad:987316204286922784>
It's a paid skin
So, no excuse 😔
The skin is very off-putting
Why is the weapon not colored with it <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Why you can't switch to veliona 😔
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Discord just got obliterated the past few mins
I see
Oh <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Wait
Which continent are you in again when that happened?
Best Answer
Scary
How long youve both known each other?
Surely didn't met people like her <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Huh
Already have such obsessive obsession at such young age <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912> <:concern:966623298639261746>
How old was she again?
Can you tell what time was it? Make this current time as a mark
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
How many people was there?
And I'm not able to join <:felissad:987316204286922784>
Those are my favorite one
We can play it next time when other people are free to join

But, there's other packs/games thats more interesting like Trivia Murder Party or Whiplash
<@375625398542925825> just to clarify again
The Jackbox game/party game is played with wrong intention and wrong description
I already played it with my online friends and we had good laughs trying to make the person laugh or interest the person with conversation like Are Thou Part of Thigh Religion? As a starter
Damn, fun memories, kinda want to play it again <:felissad:987316204286922784>
I see 
Now that's obsessive
Yeah, I understand that
That wouldn't be weird, but well, the person have another intention so
And taking advantage of the mechanics of said game
She's mistaking the purpose of the game
Not that
It's not really dating
As in like Tinder or something
But the game's purpose is not really for Dating? Don't know how to put it, it just a mechanic for the game and to have fun
But I guess that person took that on another level
The Halloween one <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Oh, that Jackbox
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Account Issue
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
This dorm chance for new Valks is very devasting
And
Anime Season 2 as for July 4 <:holothink:963352118855626753>

Death Palette is one of my favorite indie games <:felissad:987316204286922784>

Oh my

Imagine not having pets who eats insects in daily basis
ZZZ announcement when already <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Or removing their limbs
Ya Bird?
Cockroaches can really survive under the water for along time unless you drown them in soap dishwasher instead

Oh, I'm tired all of the sudden..
I think I just experienced adrenaline out of nowhere <:wokege:966623232918712331>
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
I don't feel... So tired anymore

I feel like I just snapped back to reality
My spirit feels so alive all the sudden
Fu-

My consciousness just woken the hell up
..night <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>

<:felissad:987316204286922784>
I'm just drunk with sleepiness
My bad
Thank You Everyone
Importantly Both Of You
Me not sleeping at 4am
I might.. say or do something <:suswokege:966623262912163850> 

So, don't trust it
Okay
Anyways
Don't trust me beyond this point until I finally feel sleepy and fell asleep
I kinda feel bad now
My... Function as a sane human is Deteriorating <:felissad:987316204286922784>

There's no doubt of it
Don't even try

Middle/Bottom Left Side
Y'all don't really see the face huh? 😔
Nah, I think thats before
That was her previous username before she went to impersonate someone
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
That was Mount Fuji (Remmy Original Name)
I was referring to this freak <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Wait?
You don't really know?
It's... Suspiciously dark
*You*
Are
Not
*Alone*
<@781539392039682058> You Are Not Alone...
Yes
In the peak of Mount Fuji
You're not alone...
Yes
You're not Remmy after all
I know
I thought you'd go play along with it? 
😔
😔
Yeah
Damn
<:holothink:963352118855626753>
Hmm
When you view into the image and adjust it's settings
You can see that there's some light source from the outside
Really? That is considered Emo? <:holothink:963352118855626753>
I sleep with no such light at all
Just my usual evening
Pitch black
You wanna know how dark my room is?
What if... It's not such people?
My body got into a fight mode
Laying down on your bed while in a room with no natural light with just your phone as a light source
And everything stops working and everything became quite
That blackout is, something else
I feel like I'm not.. alone now
That was.. strange
I'll be right back
My brain and my gut are telling me that something is... Not quite right
Something doesn't feel right
There has been a blackout
...

And make him do 
The Dripping Machine
Tie Him Up
As for the Title
I thought of
*The Scarlet Radiance In The Snowy Plains*
I don't know
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
*Kōri*
I'm done
*Standing Here, I realized, I hella hardlocked myself*
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Dark Souls Time
Get Hit and Die <:felissad:987316204286922784>
Stuck on 400 HP
<:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
Got it
Time to not pass Floor 7
HoT
Also, it took me 5 minutes to beat stage 4
Fcking nihilus seeds going in the opposite of the map
And HoT doesn't have iframe when she's doing her Evade attack and Ultimate <:felissad:987316204286922784>
Which one again?
The bottom one?
Anyways
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Are you trying to end my run? <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
Lighting Empress?
Who should I pick beside AE?
This is my first ER for a long time
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
Got it
Starting the run now
Thanks
Not a chance
With cracked affixes
4/4
Yeah
So, whomst signet's I should choose?
Kevin, Eden and Hua?
For ely that is
I don't have any 3 star <:felissad:987316204286922784>
HoT
Maybe it's just 1% increase
This thing is such a scam
I don't know if should use this <:sussge:968897150249484389>
Bonus stages already took me 3 minutes
Will be time consuming for sure
2.75 <:Griseostare:976641888998293584>
I can't do this with this can I?
I know
Shes basically very vulnerable all the time
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
Maybe I should do Runs with SN
 But I only have 1 piece of her stigma
Yeah
I'm lazy
How so you know? <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Cool

Wheres the background? <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Time to mald in ER
Nothing
I don't know what to upgrade <:felissad:987316204286922784>
I will get 453 Torus if I open the box and chose Torus, and I currently have 204 Torus
So, I will have a total of 657 Torus
How many upgrades is that? 6? <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
I'm doing math to know how many Torus I will get when I used all of my boxes
Torus very tasty
I haven't used my Boxes yet

<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Damn, skill issue then
It's taking me 3 minutes to do bonus stages
Seems like, it's not her patch until her new weapon comes
Is HoT even viable in ER?
Dammit
I'll take the bullet
*Your Voice Is Weird*
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
This is only proof I have when I was below lvl 80
If I reached a tough bracket in the past
I'll do it again
SEA
One step at a time
Time to meet some fellows captains up there
Reaching Level 86 Today

Real <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
This Stage Got Hands
Well, I'm actually gaining more muscles now because I've been grinding for the past few weeks
In exchange for it, working out while the body aches
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Meanwhile
I'm Underweight <:holothink:963352118855626753>
Don't worry, I just ate some... Also fortune cookies
It gave me luck <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Cake is more valuable
It's timeless
Oi, Your wallet/credit card got hurt by that
Hey, atleast you can't get tired with it
Just need some oil or fuel or something
But eh, that's expensive nowadays
Would like to replace it Fen?
Right..
It's not just, people are increasing becoming toxic/dumber, it's just that, people can easily can access megaphones now that they can easily shout their whatever on their mind without consequences
Welcome to the internet my friend
Anyways
Just gonna run an errand
That's my cat's job
Exactly
Slap it as fast as lighting
My cats are not fast enough to kill flies
So, I'll do it myself <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
I'll just keep my mouth shut 

While killing flies

Don't think about it now
You're Baban after all
I'm sure you can compensate for it
Say Farewell to it
Sleep Tight
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Yeah, but that's like 1/4 of 10x pulls
Yeah
It's better that way
Nighty night
Say goodbye to the free 2k Orundums from Annihilations
I don't know what I can do in your account
I might mess up something <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>

I think this server is enough
And my other server <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Yeah
I learned my lesson yesterday after that <:felissad:987316204286922784>
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
I was just boasting you for giving me this account <:felissad:987316204286922784>

I was...

Really?

An administrator warned me in the Discord server <:holothink:963352118855626753>
I also think we could get in trouble for passing account <:felissad:987316204286922784>
Yours?
Just leave it when you're doing something <:felissad:987316204286922784>

Did someone mentioned me?
Most Dare Leads to =
Dance/Sing/Etc that may be more embarrassing
Yeah
It's rigged
<:heh:964926244447723560>
I don't know
But Dare is more worse than Truth
Because in Truth, you can even lie or bend it
They wouldn't know
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
I'll just play along
Mostly
My tolerance is very high
You have to try very hard enough to break it <:heh:964926244447723560>

You don't want to go that deep
If I can only talk comfortably <:felissad:987316204286922784>

You doesn't seem to dislike it
Spoil Heki
<:heh:964926244447723560>
Why not?
Seems like a win win situation don't you think for both of them?
Better than nothing
Atleast you're still on the line
As long Heki pass the test and get one of the positive outcomes, it's all good in the end
Maybe, Ace'ing could have a surplus result
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Just don't fail
Have a good one
It couldn't be more wholesome if not for that 😔

When you tab out like this and see that option

How can a drowning a child can help saving a life? 
This is not some Jigsaw stuff <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Unless it's self defense
Yeah
Mean
I mean, I rarely does anything
Cats do 100% of the insect Killing

I killed cockroaches by throwing them up in the air and hitting it with something blunt

Hi Sora The Degen <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
How long is your bangs Fenri?
I don't know if I should get my bangs cut
I need to make her go outside the room shell bother me nonstop
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
🙏 RIP Mice 🙏
I'd like to show an example
Or

They will be vored
This household is safe against insects
Cool
She play with it, and eats it when it's dead
She eats it
I have this one cat who eats everything that moves
So, Huh
Is it normal for House Cats to eat Flies, Cockroaches and Mice raw? <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Well, that's understandable
I do not know what to say with that one
That short? Can you even still call that short anymore? Hmmge
Are you...
Do you not have clothes on enabled?
Literally making a fall out
Ten Nukes is already enough to destory the whole planet

Wonderland reminds of Alice in Borderland Season 2 by Netflix, I'm looking forward to it
The tests told me that I slightly have more autistic traits than world's average 
Well, I guess I'll take it with some salt until I'm diagnosed correctly <:heh:964926244447723560>
It all goes downhill when one of your parents is gone, and growing up, without one
Unfortunate heh
I haven't been in a hospital/Check-ups for almost 8 years
Great.
As long it's minimal and not weird
Equal Rights
Equal Fights
Almost got in trouble for defending myself against a girl in elementary
That's your excuse?
For me
I don't care as long it doesn't have anything to do with me, you be you, do what you want to do, mind your business, I'll mind mine own business
It's, basically, whatever for me
I just prefer not to say anything
Probably needs someone close to them to feel comfort
I don't see anything wrong with that
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
😔

I wanna see some fresh leeks too
Also the people who let their hair over the seat

Not really

Do you close your tabs Heki
Poor Floor
<:felissad:987316204286922784>
Wheres your gaming Chair Fenri
I'll use it until it completely breaks 😔
I'm not going to end this cable's misery
Go ahead, if it's available, why not
That RAM Tho 😔
This humidity still sucks anyways
Can't be bothered
I don't use my PC for games that Much 😔
Well, I guess so, this phone is like 2 years old, same as the case
It's expensive to order a custom one
It's such a hassle to find a phone case thats designed for your Devices
And, I didn't do anything to my phone case
Strange, its not pure light if I remember correctly
It's been 2 years
No, that color's been like that
I'm right here Heki
Why are you calling me out 😔
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
I don't really care about decorating my phone that much, this case helped my phone survived multiple falls and my phone didn't took any damage
So, I fixed it with tapes.. if it's still viable and can be salvaged, why not.
All of my cousins near me are all girls...
While the boys are Faraway... It's lonely 😔
I fixed my phone case with tapes
If it works, it works
😔
Poor Birds

<:felissad:987316204286922784>
But game gave me 2 Fenghuang Down And A Turg instead
I need a 2nd piece stigma
Of course I do
She's my Bridge Valk since <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
I don't have... AE
Wheres my Nyx Stigma
<:felissad:987316204286922784>

What should I do with these duplicates?
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614> Mah Boi <:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
<:FelisPowah:987144732897603614>
Oh Hi and Morning
Got News

Dunno what to buy <:felissad:987316204286922784>
Whatever

I just came back and what I see the moment I open the lights... Are my stuffs scattered across the floor..

<@781539392039682058> carry one 😔
😔
Heki
Did you see my Fenghuang Downs?
It broke
That's not portable anymore isn't it?
It's a computer at this point
Yes
😔
Tower of Fantasy
Probably play in the server that you belong or you're going to have a hard time with Latency
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Play in the same server when ToF comes out then
But I lost my accounts remember?
I'm in Both
You love to see it...
I don't know what to do with these duplicates
But whatever, in the bin they go
For sale 😔 🔫
Get her weapon
Now get her weapon
Nice
She looks so <:catblush:963351912235810826> on this one
Bianka's Rita Sandwich
Is something else
The results of getting offrates
You love to see it
Stuffs
Great
Just got another Homo Chest
I just spent 200 crystals on dorm right now
How many days you need to earn a total of 2.8k Crystals
If there's a chance
It will happen again
You'll just get one of the Bronya's S Rank battlesuit
Atleast 1 crystal will do
Buy it from me
Anyways
Anyone would like a Fenghuang Down?
I don't know
Thought it's another level of Pri-arm <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
Cool
Well, I guess I should save for it
Hey
Is HoT's new weapon gacha?
Atleast my Haxxor got accidentally got built with offrates
Fantastic
What's with me and weapon duplicates?
Never
Again
I despise this banner
Never again
Please <:cryge:966624721611403294>
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Please
Pls
Just
1 nyx stigma for 2pc set
Oh my go-
Or a blessing?
Is this a curse?
They gave me good stuffs that I don't want
I need another Nyx's stigma to make her do something
Seriousl-
Nyx gear
I don't have 
AE
And this is my 2nd Fenghuang Down
Why
Why
Why
For fu- sake
Another 1x pull
Anyone would like some cookies?
I guess masks doesn't help much?
It's just, your whole identity is within it
Maybe they can add you another role perhaps
No, you have to keep your current
Well, if it's craftable, I guess I should go for it
By the way, should I craft the last Allan Poe piece for my SN?
Don't really tweak with some stuffs in your device unless you really know what you're doing and the results you're going for
I almost accidentally bricked my computer a year ago heh
Im still in the Chapter 1 of Elysian Relam Story Progression
I'm so behind huh
Careful not to brick your new Laptop
Take care
Eating my Lunch
My muscles is still very sore, I guess it's not a good idea to workout again when it's still sore
And also, Hi.
Can't wait for Resident Evil 4 Remake
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Nevermind 
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
When will the New Skadi skin will come?
Yes Sir
Also, I'm going to get the highest risk I can get in CC
Maybe I'll E2 Myrtle than Cuora instead this time <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
Getting to lvl 10 is slower than I anticipated 😔
It's 50% or all nothing
<:HMM:966625453194485760>
This account's luck will negates the chances of getting Schwartz or Saga
<@447218009749061632> Should I do a 10x pull in the JO5 Banner, let's test the limits of this account's luck <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
I just E2'ed her
Baban's cracked account
<@881369538946531338> ahem
Atleast, it's filling the gap from the squad
That's also from the Beginner Banner
Hey, that's better than nothing
I mean, You got another 6* star again
And I got another 6* star again
Yup
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>

You know what banner it is?
<@447218009749061632>
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
Hey, don't go shaming on that
Well, nevermind, I should never trust myself with my weird short term memory
I'm confused now <:wokege:966623232918712331>
Yeah, 2019
When was the original kingdom wars again?
I'm supposed to be around 2017-2018
The captain first logged onto Hyperion is bugged
Hold up
Wait
Not that much
I even have the original Honkai Kingdom Wars Frame
I'm proud of it because we won <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
2019 Captain innit
Oh
Hiya
It's snakes
Maybe Heki can get some inspiration from it
Face your fears Heki
From the victim's body?
Where else do you think they extract the venom?
Of course
Well, it can't be helped
Heki
Snakes can still survive around an hour after the snakes got their cut off because of their muscles can still contract
Cutting their heads off might be more a worse idea
That's not the norm that's for sure, for sure..
Maybe they're saving it for the future
Ice the Snake?
There's always worse Heki
Unless like a gigantic cobras we see in the movies
But I think, there's always something bigger of those species
Makes you an animal war veteran
Maybe something along the lines like that
How big? About the average of a belt
I think
The snake? A little bit
No one was hurt
Something, I guess, it was interesting
I lived in a country side when I was younger
My neighbors caught 2 snakes and seeing it unfold is
Saves time for the preparation I guess
Why not? Even several of fishes, and stock it inside the fridge
I'd stop gutting a fish
It'll be messy if I do that part
I guess, that's better than having fish scales inside your stomach
<:wokege:966623232918712331>
Yeah, brushing works
But your arm may come tired after that, but hey, free exercise/workout
Well, it's something
The skin might be useful
Perhaps
That's a Vietnamese one by the way
Even the sight of it
Is something to behold
Are we?
Centipede seems more worse after hearing that
Maybe because of its appearance
Even a sip of it can hit you like a truck
Even it can kill
Heard that it's very strong
Yeah, that one, you can physically see the snake in the jar
Heard there's even a Snake Wine
Its going to take alot of years to save it from extinction
Heard and read that Gigantic Tortoises are very delicious, even than beef, chicken/pig meat, would you like to have a bite someday when they're no longer extinct
Such a good news that Gigantic Tortoises found alive, not extinct anymore
Hope they can mass breed it and not eat it right away
Kanji <:wokege:966623232918712331>
We doing a witch Hunt or something?
Dual Personality
Go for it
More than 1 apparently
dont worry, cat's have nines lives, except, Pardofelis is not fully a cat <:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
It's time to go home
Feeling Solemn while taking a solely walk with the sun visible slowly disappearing from my sight until the darkness of our everlasting moon paint over the night sky pitch black
*visible disgust*
Roleplay...
Sadge
Coitus
PayPal gives out $5 for free sometimes and I spent it Everytime
Feeling your thighs's muscle burn every step you take is unbearable, at the same time your stomach ignites with every bend you take that's makes you gasp for air
But in mobile, for casuals, you can't tap 3 notes at the same time unless you're hardcore
Yeah, Controller users are screaming in Agony right now
They made it actually Hard huh
Don't want to get morbed, I'll pass
Wonder how long is it going to take
Oh, there is no emergency thingy for that?
Is everything fine?
Your daily dose of horn meds Tet
World Chat #1 being weird as usual
Ah, my non-so-existent cadets
Its so painful to play without sounds effects, it's so agonizing
I guess I have to stick with it
With no sounds effects
This is the 5th time I'm downloading Honkai
Yep, Broke it
Umm
I'm trying to delete the ingame files (videos) to free some space and it seems to backfire instead
Downloading Honkai for the 4th Time
I'll just sell my computer Instead and buy Linux
It's a Mac, specially
I don't have a laptop anymore
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
I am broke
I cannot buy upgrades
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
I don't know, I'm not using it right now
I need it for school stuffs
I don't have a full time job yet Fenri
I'll download more RAM later
I forgot, short term memory sucks isn't it?
I just use it
I don't know, I don't look for it
Win 10
Stop right there
I will not play Apex Legends with you
You can only comeback
Or work
I do have a PC
But as I said, it's only for Study purposes
I don't know how can I fit Arknights and Honkai in my phone at same time
If I did, I can only play Honkai with no sounds available
Yes, I'm progressing
I can add you now
Giving me back what belongs to me
Well, not morning anymore, Good Afternoon
Morning
I will play the hell out of it after I woke
Once again, I'm very grateful
Good Night <:M7_Cry:969057814460915732>

<@447218009749061632> Nevermind, I cannot lvl 10 it this hour, it's literally midnight, I already broke a promise
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
I already have a Yostar account for this new gmail
I'll cherish it then, I will write the password physically so I won't lost it
Final?
Seriously?
Geez Fine
Are you sure?
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
It's the only way
I'll take a bullet then
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Stop it, too much
You're making me feel more bad for it
What..?
What level is it?
I feel Complicated
I feel so bad 
My consciousness won't let me
It's too generous
I still feel bad taking it away from you
Oh well, that's just 50 days of Arknights lost
And my Kal'tsit and Nearl Alter lost, the only Value
I cannot provide this
But hey at least, I managed to save my Honkai account
Yeah, there's no way I can recover my Arknights account Baban
Morning Baban
They're thrashing on Lee
Poor Lee
Unforgivable
Wheres S Lee?
Awful Build
I know
I don't know what happened to these pulls
Cool
Is Greiso Free?
Ahem
But 
Raven and Teri
Welt, Ragna and Turg.. ungraded
I guess so- wait
When did I got this?
Already have her
What can I do with this?
I'll just buy craftable stuffs with it
Too much duplicates for a man
Also 200 leftovers
Delicious Torus
It was 200k before I spent it all to acquire Golden Diva and Pardofelis and Outfits, but you don't have to believe me
I'm too F2P for this
What Torus?
Oops, I just dropped my resources, I'm clumsy
Also? Whats interesting here?
Maybe I'll craft the last piece of Allan Poe I'm missing
What I should I buy I wonder
Time to climb up the Ladderless
Cool Aramda you all got by the way
Oh
I've got no use for it anyways
Oh
Returnee by the way
Oh, anyone wants the juicy 100 crystal code?
I guess ill just camp in Agony
Sadly
Does Delta Weather still exists?
And Delta is not so useful anymore
Even so, I have a huge disadvantage, because my Valks are so old
If you are in SEA
Expect to face me in Exalted Abyss soon enough

Here's Mi-
Oh
My aunt owns 2 white dogs, we own 2 white dogs and 4 white cats
I have 8 Pure White Pets
Cool Cat, don't step on the cat when it's light out
I don't have a single warn
After all
Maybe it's just for Banned Accounts
Even I lost it, I still contact them physically
It's connected to my Phone Number
Don't worry about my LINE account
Thanks but, I can handle it, I just need to wait 3 days to join WFP again, but, maybe they'll consider it breaking the Alt rule, well, I can just tell them the my old account was unusable now
Also, I can maybe recover my throwaway account
And I don't know what should I do with the person that contacted me though WFP
I can contact one of my friends back when the streamer they're moderating goes live so I can whisper to them
11 for the new stray
I told you already, we have 10 cats
Cats
Basically, Bruteforcing
I'll smack my head into a wall until it breaks, or my skull did
If there's a will
There's a way
Except for 3FA
Well, I guess so
But
Surely..
I'm sure I can contact back my Discord friends
My passwords are 20+ long Heki
I'll just buy a notebook that has padlock feature and tie it to myself, incase if I ever forgotten the password of the lock, I can bruteforce it
Might as well swallow the password itself and rip the body open in case it was forgotten
Going to be great
Then I also magically lost it
I guess
I'll buy a small personal physical notebook to write everything
At least I still have you all
That 6+ years was fun
Oh well
I made everything to tightly secured and it biten me back
Both
It's 3FA
Heki
There's no Try Another Different Option/Question
I might leave Arknights entirely
And all I heard is bad stories about it
They don't help with account recovery
Yeah, I guess that's all
I'm just gonna move on

Nothing value was lost anyways..
I tried everything
Google 3FA?
Ever heard
Heki
Don't sweat it, Its nothing, also to kill time
Lesson Learned, I must physically write everything down, I just payed 6+ years of my internet life for it
Yeah, it's entirely my fault
Because it's all wiped down with the data
Including the recovery
Every account
I lost everything
I just said
Morning/Evening
Hi there Remmy
I just lost 6+ Gmail accounts, some sorts
Not an essay but a statement
Did you even read my very long essay, it's all there
It's not lost like that or deleted from existence
Its lost, endless of data you cannot access, but it's still right there, in front of you
I lost it, I lost everything after the Factory Reset/Data Wipe
I can no longer access all of my accounts that I created in the past and spent time with
A simple mistake, made me put myself into a paradox, a wall I cannot bypass. Making myself live on, back to Zero

Well, basically, I need to access to my Gmail account to access my password manager which have mostly my password for everything including my main Gmail, but to access my password manager, I need to do a 2fa that includes sending an email to the Gmail I'm trying to recover, even if I tried resetting the password, I need to pass the 3FA, I need to verify my phone, leading it to another verification to the email I'm trying to recover. All is said and done, I cannot do anything else about it.
The Beginning Of The End
My friend gave me an advice that, having an In-game purchase receipt can help you alot with account recovery
So, I guess ill do that every now and then with the games I'm willing to spend my time on
Lovely as ever
Yeah, at least it's the Game that I spent several years with and part of it
Arknights Account CS? Failure to provide Twitter evidences that I own it
Genshin Account? Haven't tried at all
Customer Service/AI-Chan was very helpful
And yes, I officially lost everything within the past +6 years, so, I am starting back from scratch with everything, everything.
Luckily, I managed to salvage my Honkai account and save it from the incoming removal of 3rd Party Logins
Hello there
Morning/Evening
Yes, it's officially deceased, but I would to pledge to not throw it to the incinerator, I may need it's history for future issues

Thanks
I also need to blend the colors more, it feels something, but I can't provide, I'll see what I can do
Yeah, it stands out more, I guess I need to make it a little lighter, well, I was making it yesterday midnight, I just draw, no Think
I'll try making some adjustments today
I appreciate it if I receive so, don't hold yourself
I will accept it and use it for improvements
Also, I can also say my thought process
Geo Slime Within It's Habitat
Just a Geo Slime
Oh, it's not sent out yet
Oh, I didn't get in
Unless they do something like star Rail where you get a beta by watching in twitch, that's doable
And I'm very certain I'm ain't getting it
I signed twice
Hope I get in the Beta cope
Would be nice as a skin yeah, but broke <:SirinAngy:1130475728895483934>

Also, The Pallete again
She's the only kind at this point

<:yippee:1002596802656223274>
ArtBook Bedge
It kinda be a heavy topic since They're basically Prisoners, and they are Murderers, their Music Video and Voice Dramas(Interrogation) are used to uncover their thoughts, and their sins about the crime they committed, additionally it changes depending on the events and votes that has been made.
Since they're all Murderers, they are all GUILTY, however, the vote is there whether you should FORGIVE/UNFORGIVEN their crimes
I gotten hook up since I'm pretty interested in these kind of things, mystery, analyzing and interpreting.
Also how the results of the vote changes the characters and their songs
How much do you know about it?
I just discovered it yesterday and already caught up to the current timeline, I haven't listened to all voice dramas though
Well, it's gotten interesting
How you've been
I'm wondering if you know about the Milgram Project made by Deco*27
Greetings Aster, haven't seen you for so long
I'm not really familiar with that
All I know that it's painful and affects one's emotions during that alot

Guess I'll excuse myself then
But, hope you get through it???
Oh
I mean, are you fine now?
You good?
