<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
or maybe thats why they added the new StarDust Type
sounds disgusting, now im worried for my Garuda Hua or whichever suit coming before Part 2 getting powercrept early because of them <:deadge:975652771082698782>

Fuckmonster?
<:huh:966619839307321394>
truly a coincidence
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I like this one's hair
I hate this
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
GGZ Himeko fight was just her dashing to you with her greatsword and slapping you
But for Honkai, yea, she really felt like a random character til ch 9
Tbh, I liked GGZ Himeko
Grand Blue
it was so out of pocket
I remember YT giving me a YT Short where someone cuts a pair of Booba Implant that was defective <:wheeze:833318723565649950> only reason I remember
<:eek:765359367524188161>
isn't booba surgery just like breast implants? It was either Silicone or something along that line
<:huh:966619839307321394>
what a convo I backtrack and read
<:derp:724856219600289853>
gives new buff, Ignite and Bleed Breach <:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Bleed Garuda that Ignites
If it gotten itself a PRI, it would break the game
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
Came out in the OG days while still being relevant til this very day
Judah chan best weapon
Even though I don’t even have HoRb for an actual Dps route
So rn for me, Brick >>>>>>> Luna
Doesn’t help when im shown that base Judah chan can basically compete against Luna PRI <:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Honestly, my interest in her would’ve been higher if Judah chan got a PRI
<a:shotobongotap:1135611530356981911>
True, it will just be Keb
Nah, its just gonna be Kebin, no need for extra inia
I 100% Agree there, I want to use my UR with all her skins, I miss using her
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
There are soooooo many Old Valks who can be yeeted to ER and Mihole just said no
noice
Kosma Buff once again
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
<:shxtouKek:1013233704170176603>
Her PRI would truly break the game
Judah chan too strong, first Mobius, now for Teri
<:A_WheezeTao:793919527208484924>
Boobresa?
can you tell the difference?
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
This was all I processed
ngl, when I was looking at the list of IMG Characters on the Wiki because I was too lazy to get n Hi3rd
I have so many near me… McDonald, In N Out, Chick Fil A, Taco Bell, KFC (I don’t even bother going there), and prob some others
My Taco Bell is under renovation, thankfully idc about it, my brother likes it though
I don’t remember any Jollibee near me, or at least ica about it
it was b4 Raven Shards were on sale in ER
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Pepega internet
This was a screenshot from 2022
Prob not, maybe like my original 300 fragments
<:OMEGALUL:788545079223517184>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
it prob didn't help that I only got PE Dudu like a year later after her release
<:derpostasis:834561554858770513>
gacha brain
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I knew there was an A Rank IMG Char first, then S Rank, forgot the existence of my SSS Raven (600+ Shard Excess)... and I the next IMG A Rank was Pardo, so I assumed Pardo because PE was S Rank
I just forgot about Raven, so my brain just jumped to the 2nd A Rank IMG Valk <:wheeze:833318723565649950> which was Pardo
lmao
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I had her at like SSS with like 600 excess shards
oh yea, she was
I think
she one one of my SSS Rank Valk too
I honestly erased Raven from my memory
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I mean Raven
Because if Griseo is our first Stardust Character, then she would be SP/A-Rank since they need give f2p something first <a:NodBb:561613076844249130> kinda like how Raven was our first IMG Character and Seele was our first QUA A Rank b4 getting the S rank one
<:shxtouCopium:1013233700261072916>
Hua first S Rank Stardust character
As Carv stated, most definitely Griseo first
No, not really, don’t think you miss any other than the SP you get for just actually attacking with the characters
They still haven’t fixed QUA Valk in any meaningful way and they decided to add a brand new one
A New scuffed Type… POG
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
*sigh*
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
dugtrio?
lol
im skiping LB, I just wanted my Judah chan PRI, no Judah chan, no Luna Teri <:Sadge:842131939607183360>
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>
thank you Carv, ima go cry now because im going to miss using the Senti PRI (long replaced by Neb PRI) and her Stig
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
So is HoS getting new Stigs or something? all I know is that shes getting the Brick DK
<a:PattingSkippy:731400933094719569>
<a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620>
Galaxia Hua
<:shut:885303431978430504>
I have no funds for Luna, only have funds for Hua and Judah PRI
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
stupid Ele Resistance Shield
but thats because Bella forces you onto that route
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
We have Judah chan, Judah chan Sakura, soon we’ll get Judah chan - Kira (Idol)
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
I need my Judah chan PRI
Upgraded Blood Embrace
<:shxtouMagnify:1013233705780785152>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Sirin is a mahou shoujo, so she indeed is a child
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Ngl, I forgot, its prob because all the other characters lately just had their breast inflated to where any smaller one just made me forget
Im just reading all the convo <:KekPat:966625000339668993> my brain just reorganized everything and the only thing I got out of this is that I dont want Griseo to be another Boobya, Luna, Aponia, etc characters 

I would rather get another Carole Model or Hua model instead, gib me back my flat chest characters <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Gacha Gamer do be like that
<:shxtouKek:1013233704170176603>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
The Brick is like the Chancla
Thank you <a:hugd:748431565453000784>
Still a fun meme
Made up numbers for funsies
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Occasional case where the bottom are actually switch which is just the remaining 20%
True
Same, not the latter though

Honestly I think it went from switch to bottom <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
I just zone out and spend 95% if my time gaming
<:PepePoint:857792708479680552>
Grind PNG Relationship instead
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Lmao, no thanks
Ngl, a lot of people are prob autistic, they just dont bother to get themselves diagnosed for it (including myself)
I know, Im just saying I do similar similar things so even if I do want a relationship, I know it aint gonna ever be happening
<:A_WheezeTao:793919527208484924>
I just hate having relationships and would rather grind 24/7 so Im the same way
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Im happy with not having one
I just woke up
....
I didn't see that message, thank you Ruby
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
I see it now
<:TeriGun:973793149992435752>
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Use my eyes for what?
????
Because their model 9/10 times makes them look like teens or giant babies
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Tbh, I just assume most Genshin characters are children except for like a few
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
wao, thank you
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I do remember it
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Also, why are they making Ice sp expensive essentially
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Im still coping for Hua
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Rigged ass boss, im so happy im moving onto HSR
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Ngl, I slept this patch
Yea, and I did call it with Dudu skin being free <:KekPat:966625000339668993> but I didnt expect it to be free because it was for VG Dudu
Same Tai, really, I only care about Bastet T but I have everything but HoFin in Foca 1… while Foca 2 its just Ely Stig… neither of which I would care to pull for rn because I know I aint getting them and would have to cope with 2p set if I do
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Cuz Susannah was Quicksand so I didnt know where the HN was from <:KekPat:966625000339668993> ty for telling me
That was why I was so confused
Oh, <:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
I forgot what HN was for? Sussanah?
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
We’re not so far off from 9S MA
Now its just Valks that dont even last for more than 2-3 patches because Mihole decided to add in new shills
I miss the time when everything wasnt so aids, was just Herrscher of the Year and everyone else, you just get if you feel like it
Well, more like me no have her PRI maxed out
Me no have her, coping with PE/Bkek instead rn
2 waves + pepega mechanics… like this bleed one is Susannah or suffer… now its gonna be Hare or die
True, but lately, its been more aids
Phys bosses lately have been Aids i see….
Yea, 2 and 3 definitely better
I have Bkek and AE so im good ig... might pull Prom's gear but thats about it ig
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Stun been useless for a long time tbh, especially for MA where you want time fractures from Evasion
whats next? we get Abyss Flower DK, Spear Edition?
Hare using new weapon type <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:Copium:849740782583021598>
Kiana will inherit Kebin noodle cooking technique and be able to make noodles
I didnt even bother about the weather the moment I saw QUA mobs
^^^ same
No Judah, no Fu Hua, easy patch for me
I love all of them, but yea, the current one is nice for Spring theme

3rd and 4th feels too similar to her base outfit in terms of color palette which im fine with but then it would feel more like a Spending Event/B-chip/Bingo outfit more than a pyramid one
it changes nothing much in RL cuz you still brute force it, but in Nirvana, it becomes more annoying
of course, RL players wont be affected too badly but Nirvana? rip everyone there
what kind of Trio shill buff is that
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
yep, so not only does breaking the shield when certain Element Dmg is up makes him take less damage from it, but every 20 second, he does it anyways
fucking hell
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I heard they added something new to his shield where he forces his state every 20 sec
CN and HoTr does help a lot now too for HoF… my HoH still lacking so who knows
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Aint as bad as Dehya’s at least since it tells you something than nothing and then says shes working as intended with all the new bugs you find out about her everyday
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
Big L

<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Ohio…yikes forever
Yeee
Cali
Here it is again
Yea, i even posted it in <#977584145142259782> when I got it
I got mine yesterday, ishoke
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
let me cope that the more time they had, the more they can properly design their character <:deadge:975652771082698782> tbh, Kiana im ok with only because of Time Runner, but HoO, i still hate with a passion and cant wait for a new skin so that I can immediately replace the current one
There were quite a few characters they couldve made playable too because they have the models for them <:KekPat:966625000339668993> Nagatsume, Tesla, Sin Mal, Einstein, Alvitr, etc, 

maybe spacing the characters wouldve done them good too when it comes HoFin and HoO character design <:despairge:1045736540875280465> still salty over their looks, mainly just HoO because I actually use her
true
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
if you are talking about Tuna, that yea, Solo looks 100x cooler than Co-op Ult tbh, but its so much worse and im so sad about that... why wont they let us have the option to pick the Ult Animation but have the dmg be the Trio Ult
Who are the chibi characters?
Only Thicc Shield in Abyss, he shield in MA is relatively ok
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I miss NS, but yea, they seem to be prioritizing S rank into ER first
NS would be nice
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I love Kosma but god do I hate fighting him... tbh, fighting any QUA bosses tend to be aids
yep
and then you have to wait til next year for the next chance
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
frustrating but not like Kosma where you attack by accident when you meant to evade for the QUA
yea
Fighting Bella is just seeing how tanky she is, fighting Kosma is coping for evasion to proc to break his QUA shield
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
^^^ same way as HoTR, none until you get all the gacha one first and then use the selector for the missing piece
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
they've been doing those last minute balance changes recently often afterall
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
me who doesnt understand cn but still watching it anyways
BESTOSHAM?
The powercreep is really getting way too out of hand nowadays… with APHO prob coming next, ill be even more poor if its Teri and Judah PRI
My poor Mobi
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
My poor Zhenyi and Linn stig
<a:hugd:748431565453000784>
actually, the third one is the cutest face
very cute
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
it looks like a planet with a giant impact in the middle
now its just a crack into a crack...
thats sad
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
shut up, Hua will never die out
HoFin Frame, its really nice ngl
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
just give her Bkek treatment where Bkek just doesn't want to die
I want G4 Fire Stig to raise AE back from the dead
the amount of supports just using Turg because I dont have their support Set Bonuses
me with all 3 Ice dps and their max PRI, I hate it <:kekpalm:901574024830791690>
too bad JK is gonna be extra expensive again with her discount going away for that patch
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
actually, they will just release a new Awaken Battlesuit version of Bkek, Bkek v2
Bkek is the one that will randomly get a new PRI along with new stig to make her even more broken again
<:RozaScout:1007088922054103091>
they gavethe snap to replace the stretching, be weird for them to just have her snap on both her combos ig since that just seem more lazy <:KekPat:966625000339668993> 

tbh for v1, i dont like the stretching only because its feel strange to have her stretch randomly before doing a random slash, v2 sword combo is nice... but I did like the HoV win pose snap for v1
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Soon it will be 3 SSS boss and SS bosses goes extinct
But anyways, they really want me to just skip both patches, maybe pull for HoTr and thats about it… trying to fund for 3 S rank is just hell as well as getting them… the fact that we have like 4 PRI doesnt help either… HoFin, HoO, HoTr, Eden… theres Ai Chan PRI this patch which is normal but yea…
The reason why HoO Mei looks ugly is so that they can sell a skin with more drip later with Spending Event/Pyramid <:Copium:834822065231364156>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Dead resources
We even getting Eden PRI
3 PRI in a row, and 4th if you include Ai-chan PRI
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<a:StabbyDed:576647937371668486>
We have Shieldbreak, Bleed, only Stun is left
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Nah, next SP Phys Valk gonna be Stun Trauma Valk
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Quantum Phys, replacing SN
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Legit after Pardo became the Fire Support while also being Ice support, Mihole decided to go a step further with HoTR being the S rank version
True
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
She did unironically because Fire had no SP Valk til this patch
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Our last A rank Valk was like Raven and that was sad
We do, but now the age of SP Valk
My Bkek is sad too cuz no Jizo
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im fine with it, let me cope with my 4/4 PE longer
Like PE ig
I dont want another Phys support, but knowing Mihole, its gonna be a SP Stun Trauma Phys support
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
I wonder who’s the next A rank/SP Valk gonna be after those Trio Hershey 

Susannah? A new Raven suit that isnt scuffed? Augment Suit actually coming back? Copium Collab?
Yea, they will prob rerun her anyways, Im skipping her because I dont wanna cope with another 1/4 or 0/4 S rank anymore like with PE, Mobius, SN, etc, cuz it feels so bad/scuffed to do so…

Even worse when you are missing the most important piece or last piece for their stig too
Lmao
Noice
I still have AE so I can still cope for the most part… i might go for HoTr like maybe 1-2 multi at most but that really depends on my xtals
I was prob reading the other’s oc, since I need to backread more
Not yet, I think I was skimming through some of it but didnt get enough time to do so
What happened?
I was gonna say the reason why i am skipping HoTR is because no xtal and also coping with AE

So i just gonna go for Tuna instead and wait another time for HoTR rerun… depending on how the patch goes
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
My internet just died
Thank you
Yee
sounds about right
not even braided or anything either
but why is it that literally there is like 4-5 of them
like if it was only few, fine, that works
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
for me, I dont like the green whale skin, well, I like it, but I got hate the hair tie part on the edge of her hair... idk why but for the model it just looks like a really fat paint brush hair
good luck there
k, ty
<@846910913118601226> could me get private leeks role?
<:kekhands:993771590275846245>
If Mihoyo wants to really be mean, they will add in Weapon Skin next
shes a fist user so not like you actually see her gauntlet either
Sus skin does look nice, hopefully her sword changes to red too
SN got so many skins now lmao
but yea, I would assume: 
HoHE Pyramid
Susang B-chip or Bingo
Tuna - Spending
FR - Free
SN - Free
or like a student during an anime School festival arc
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
SN looks like shes one of those Idol fans during concerts or something
FR skin good
for Tuna skin, ill prob not use it, or use it for like a patch or two before going back to Time Runner... its a really good skin and I really like the cape, but I still am biased towards Time Runner cuz its my Pyramid Skin and its ~~Time/Clock Related~~ and cuz I like Tuna Ponytail
<@846910913118601226> can i get the private leek role pls
<:cattoblush:675924852598636544>
budget of 2.8k xtal
even if i pull HoTR, no weapon and only 1-2 stig seems too cope for me, especially when i have to pull for Kiana/Mei right after
<a:StabbyDed:576647937371668486>
...
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
no no, i have no xtal left for HoTR, especially when i need to pull for Tuna Mei stuff too
ima have to skip HoTR anyways, dont have enough for her anyways
and they are also IMA
same, i know shes important but not like i have enough xtal anytime soon for her anyways with Kiana/Mei coming right after
im pulling for Kiana/Mei gears at least... ima ignore Bronya for a bit
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
rip all xtals at that point
but still, Mei/Kiana combo and then a combo if you have all 3
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
triple IMA S rank
but still
Kiana is like another Time Runner skin and I am happy about that
cant afford for all 3
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
still gonna skip HoTR though
Kiana has the best design of the 3 so far and i am happy
I like Tuna suit
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
i forgot to ask for the leak role too
lmao
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Kiana 6.4? so 3 S rank in a row still though
???
4th one reminds me of a worse version of Noelle from Jenshin Impacto, so I dont like it, I like all the other ones though
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
nah, not even SP lightning, they gonna make her an S rank so that they dont have to give her SP skills
yay, even less reason for me to pull HoTr and keep my AE from dying for a few more patches
still decent quality nothinless
thank you for the close up though
sadge
any more but with better quality at least for Kosma?
They all do be cute though like Kebin whos so expressive unlike current Kebin
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
Anyways, I got my new Pfp now thanks to that so yay, Christmas Kosma
The Can Snowman her her yea
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
me with S3 HoT still because I havent been able to farm ER
ill show you in <#977584145142259782>
literally what it means, a Spray <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Ely and Pardo are skins
Susannah gonna be a throwback to Chariot and do what she does in the story when she gathered all the enemies
I can show you GGZ collab stuff... Aponia is a Spray and Mobi is a cross
I hope more collabs, I like Gun Girl Z because of how much collabs they have
I wonder what we will get after Mei/Tuna...

since ig we still have APHO 3, and I forgot what else
<:slapbaka:974814370817273876>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
and then Fire HoTr
Lightning HoTr
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
I know
let is be Mei so that my Flame Tuna live for 1 patch longer pls Mihole
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
tbh, we can always wait and see the next unit too
CN is a safer investment for me than HoTr anyways since she'll be more consistent for my rotation
yea, im just a Nirvana bouncer anyways who usualy sometime stays in top 2% for slacc NA MA
i cant because CN is essential for my team
it doesnt matter since im gonna be poor going for CN anyways since using HoFs felt so scuffed without instant ignite
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
first Pardo, now Bronya
yea, sounds like my AE gonna be living for way longer for now
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
ye, ill skip her entirely, i dont want another SS SW trauma
then ill still cope
oh, is she the same as SW?
same with PE Dudu, got like 4 of her weapon and like T piece... which the next piece was a dupe T stig
its possible, i got the cat weapon and not a single piece of her stig b4
Anyways, for HoTr, how big of a difference will she have with her Stig and without it?

Like would a fully geared AE still be better than a HoTr with only her weapon because its not like I have enough resources to get her gears (especially with my SS SW trauma)
Then add in her Idol version
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
Everything, obviously evolve into Judah chan
By the time you get full gear for the Valk, a new one would be out already to be a direct powercreep as yours just dies out
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
When I was still coping for Judah PRI, though I still am… wished every new Valk wasnt just almost a direct powercreep of each other

But also wished they werent like SW who I have at SS and had been dead useless ever since, barely only got to use her like what? 2-3 patches before shes already dead from Aponia, HoT, and HoHe
her max PRI could be used for HB, but Sushang is out now so its gonna be hard to use HB outside of certain situation where your Sushang isnt SS yet
99% of her content is stolen by HoHe or Aponia... or just stolen by HoT with her PRI
SW is just so dead, like I have nowhere to actually use her
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I just hope this Bronya is just another bait tbh, I cant with another Bronya... I dont wanna max or get another Canon PRI, its too much for me
Only Ice Breach to herself, ig cuz Sushang already does that for Ice
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Way better than the summer one for me when it comes to sfx tbh
Its so good
I just hope its not hard to get
1 Ult per phase
3 Phase
just insta kill the seed for each phase
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
triple IMA Herrshey team with each providing Ele Breach to each other and Ele Breach only to themselves do seem normal enough
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
HoTr is just Kallen Sundenjager Battlesuit but not useless edition
That must mean Judah PRI soon
Shieldbreak Kallen with a Special Judah Phase
yay
AE lives yet again
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
so good looking but ill rarely ever use her because I hate her playstyle
Raven Halloween Skin
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
SSS Bella
Fck Raven gameplay, I just hate the feeling of playing it
GG
I can replace Raven now
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Thank god, imagine if she didnt have Ignite Support ability, I wouldve been coping so hard
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I really hope she has Ignite in her kit, my internet is dead so I couldnt check anything
Does she have Ignite Support capability at least
Same, i hate her gameplay, also, why did no one pinged me for this, XD, i was too busy with school so i need the pings when new Valk gets revealed
SSS ER Kallen one shotting everyone
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
thats just ER Kallen
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Kallen forever dead
thats how you bring them back to life
soon SSS Heimdall
because they were bored
soon gonna be V3SEX+
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
so its my own fault
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
i just woke up
same
you just need her gacha gears
Sushang is Ice HoS, but shes also Ice FR, so basically free to farm
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
is it even in the off rates?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<@218762069338619906> would Liu Qi M be better than Welt M for SW?

since I have BroNEX TB but rn Welt M on her, so idk how good Liu Qi M will be compared to Welt M, since while M piece has higher Ice Dmg and TDM while Welt has the Ice Dmg Taken
oh, Memento
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
who's UA?
we will get a new Fire SP Ignite Support Valk, new G4 Stigmata for Fire, new Stigmata for Ignite Support

and then we get Kebin Shamash ELF as the new Fire ELF
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
correct, it basically give the same stat as Ana, but higher multiplier and even some unique effect like Increase Ice Dmg Taken, SP regen too, though we have to wait for V2 and V3
its oriented toward Burst Mode Ice char, so rip SW, though ig thats good for me because I already have SW Stig
so never
when we get our first SP Fire Ignite Support
though Handel received more supportive potential
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
both as crafting mats and stats
like literal direct upgrade
^^^ its basically a direct upgrade to Ana
yea, since Liu Qi will most likely be the 2nd BiS Set for 99% of Ice dps, like how Handel is similar in the same way
:eek:
Para Nihilus
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
even though it would prob receive more value changes later on
how cope would the new G4 Stig be for Herrscher Ely compared to her gacha stig
since she can at least still cope with the 10%
well, part of 3p
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
SW cant use 3p either since you need at least 100 Sp
Combo and no Burst Mode either
^^^
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
wow, 12 Sp gain on 2 sec cd
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but at 66 pity for the counter, I can cope
I allowed myself to get scammed by the Pardo Banner... so I only have like 1k xtal
Its bait til I run out of Xtal and fail to get full set
once you fight Kosma in the story which will be unlocked later, so same with Vill-V
<:YEP:802850856118517790>
I got 1.86% last week
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
For me, its week 2 and 5… if it wasnt for Parv, I wouldve said Week 4 too
Week 1-4 is gonna make me puke for MA

While 1-3 for Abyss is disgusting QUA weathers
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Oh yea… its 2 SSS Bosses now
<:PepePoint:857792708479680552>
so im extra poor
I have to aim for Mobimaid and Herrscher Ely
since Hua seems like the free one
B-chips i would say
^^^
at least usually not with spending event around
yea, but they never done back to back pyramid skin
yea, Time Runner was 5.3
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
its 1-2  new Pyramid skin a year
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
Aponia pyramid does not make sense, we just had Mobius for the year
<:sussge:968897150249484389> werent the 30k spending skin usually S rank Valks?
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
prob next patch, who knows
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
nah, there are a lot more than that, since Mihole always do multiple skin, at least minimum of 1 whale skin
HoT rank up, pog
<a:YEPJAM:871530521220489226>
Kebin shy
lmao
Kebin is hidding really well
T - 4 FC
M  - 4 FC
B - 3 Noticeable FC, and maybe a hidden Kebin
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
 since we cant see sht with all these text in the way
I think we mean the stig art
<:yep:833766933685076029>
circle it for those of us who are blind please
still free though
sorry about that
wait, i mean the same event as Taixuan theme
7 day log in event btw
lmao
but yea, only Kebin is missing
iirc, Griseo got the crystal from Aponia, and Su got his from Kebin, i forgot if Hua received one too
so yea, the T piece represent the FC with the physical item they are attached too... M represent the Animal FC <:yep:833766933685076029> and B is just the successor
yea, its too blurry but it does look like Vill-V pocket watch
I cant see but that should be Hua next to Griseo
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
its just blocked by the CN text
B has Hua iirc
T - Kosma Harmonica, Kalpas Mask, and Eden's Wine Glass
M - Aponia Butterfly, Mobius Snek, Pardo's Can-chan, and Yae's fox
B - Su, Griseo and 1 more i cant see
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I just noticed the butterfly
M piece has Aponia too
harmonica, you got it right the 2nd time
B is Su and Griseo, cant see the other but yea
T is Kalpas, Eden and Kosma
her M piece showed Can (Pardo), Snek (mobi) and a Fox (Yae), while T was like Kalpas Mask
all of Ely Stig have the FC in them too
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>
the rest is just a Symbolism of their death
only Kosma is the only one where you can see his dead body
yep
you can see them all die
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>
yea
<:cryge:966624721611403294> <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I only have 6k for Mobimaid and Mermaid Ely
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
better than me with 0k xtal after I use the 9k on Mobimaid
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
when <#973924771727290399> became chaotic mess
:eek:
btw, Herrscher form is bare feet
plus, the heels are imaginary
smh, better than Genshin impact
the short is for the segg appeal
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
shes like cupid and then fish
Acrylic stands are still nice, I have like some Fu Hua one
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
thats how she comes back to life
:yep
SA Zither PRI = 11th PRI + Griseo PRI
<:terium:973796767793569802>
Judah PRI when APHO Teri gets released
Judah PRI
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
if i dont have Ice Epi, how can i get her PRI in the first place
Frozen Naraki is the PRI
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Ice Epi
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I have Meme but no epi
should be ER only like Eden and most other
Playing Vill V is like playing a tower defense game lmao
Its nice
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
90% Discount
Wait, Pardo Signet 2 sounds OP ngl
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
anyways, i dont see any fur anyways, just his cloak and the usual depression
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
lemme cope god damn it
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I know, im just saying he looks like a dragon, like how Ely looks like an Elf
that looked more like a piece of his clothing in the back, while his horn seems to be growing a third blue horn attached to his other horn
wheres the fur? all I see is scales like a dragon since its Kosma
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
The power of love, copium, and simp and sadge makes anything possible
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
Who says we cant?
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Gotta keep Sirin for being the only Ignite ELF cuz fire team still no Ignite Support
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
New ELF reserved for Ely
Played Rpg Grinding game on Roblox kekw
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Im sleeping, Roblox was nice when I was playing a mmorpg grinding game
Then sleep on Herrscher patch unless they give me enough xtal
Im just gonna pull 7T and Mobius skin
Staph, ishoke, you’re just not coping hard enough
Lemme cope
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Aponia and Elie and Kosma wont let Griseo get hurt b4 theh are dead first
Same, i dont like baldin against SSS bosses
Same
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Tf
2 SSS boss and 1 SS qua?
Awkward Child

Never, only in their spin off like HSR

Anyways, night
Skip til next Herrscher, Elysia not good
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
Dudu trash
Im on mobile so i cant change back
Same
Oh noes
Someone turned me into Dia
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
Dia, when were you here? What happened to Keilo
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Logical conclusion is depression
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Shut up
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Let my child be
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Hes just protecting Griseo
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
I dont want to kill Kosma
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
For instance HB skin changed her P90 but her canon is still the same
Weapon on screen =/= their actual weapon
Would you say that Flame Tuna Claymore is her main weapon you equip?
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Thats not her weapon
Both never got changed, her screen for the bullets changed but thats from her own innate kit, completely unrelated to her weapon and weapon active
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Anyways, ig I get 7T DK cuz key buff and then save for Mobi skin, then cope for good Herrscher Reward during Ely patch
The screen is not from her weap active
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
SW never got it, her weapon active is the black hole
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Lmao
Nopers
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Kosma boss? Nani?!?!
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Then its Mobius Shill with FR support
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
how ironic would it be if she was the Ignite Support
<:concern:966623298639261746>
Did they?
Different roles
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Its meta for coping without Griseo stig
2:3:
Dead™️
thanks
™️
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
what about the TM
its fine, i vibe too
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Mobile...
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
how do you do that for discord btw? i forgotten how
True, typing
I know, since shes def still the queen for ER too
I'll still be coping with Mobius though... but ig getting a new DK wont be bad since I can use Handel for HoT as a good coping stigs
summoning and finisher
time stop to both skill too
yea, definitely, SSS Bkek is out again too
god how cringe and op would that be
DEA new PRI, add time stop to all of her Combo attack + Ult
now we have 3 SP active leaderskill batteries, Flame Tuna, HoT, and LE
cuz I just got her this BP so that the outfit wont be dead useless
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
gives me a reason to use her again too
yep, definitely 2nd spring in MA
The off rates is gonna be horrendious
<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
Mei though, ill prob have to get the DK for the buffs and cuz MA... cuz even if its just for SS MA, time stop is just too good, especially for the SP spammer too
Aponia easy skip
my SS SW easily replaces Aponia anyways
I just wasted too much for that last Linn piece anyways <:yaboyrSigh:879457736386027610> 20k xtal for a single piece
ye
Aponia followed by HoT buff
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Aponia truly bait
How much would that affect Mobius hmmm... i know Mobi isnt MA material but Abyss should be something
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Watch Mihole fck over Fire teams again by not letting Griseo have Ignite Trauma
feelsbadman
Raven feels so scuffed but i dont want to replace her cuz i bought her skin and have her at SSS... and AE is my char i simp for too
then again, i hope to just use her and cope for MA only for SSS Parvati
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I want Griseo to actually have ignite trauma and be a good support but at the same time, I feel really bad for my AE and SSS Raven too
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>
Captainverse ending?
Dating so that 17+ can start dating children and become child predator, who thought this was a good idea

Carv should get the typewriter role at this point
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Is Carv the Ely typerwriter now that just summarizes everything for us
…
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
didnt have to deal with dia either
honestly, i dont miss wfp because im happy here
im just there, but not actually there
thank god im no longer active there
0% x 4
we really do appreciate your TLs like how we appreciate the Spoiler-Sussy-Baka stuff
Carv, you know the people here are degen, weird, all of the above, or something related to that...
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
literally
so im just dead
I have like 1-2 weeks before my Finals
i havent even started once I got my book
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I have to get to school tmr in like 5 hours afterall
I should prob sleep soon
<:huh:966619839307321394>
night
anyways, summer event so there were things i wanted to farm
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
true, just gachaing for cosmetics
so im just doing the usual gacha hell
MMO game with gacha
night though, also, I only decided to play it for the nostalgia but it had gacha
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
ive been busy grinding a MMO game so i havent done the story
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
it tried to give the Mei extra personality treatment to Hua but failed miserably
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Hua had really high honkai adaptability, so WoH sent a Herrscher conscious and it tried taking over her body but got bodied by her memories
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
HoC was always a virus both in CE and PE so whatever
with some exception of course
iirc, for CE, it was a mix of both Honkai Adaptability and Negative Emotion
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
its been too long for me
well, wasnt there PE Himeko though, did she hate humanity back then?
well, 2 animated shorts one that is ^
we have like 2 so far, HoV vs HoT and HoFs vs HDom
a Herrscher vs Herrscher fight gonna be fun
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
I still believe Eden will also die
Fuck
the only consistent Ignite Support is Sirin
Mihole is just fucking with Fire Teams right now
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I know, and I hate it
I just hope Ice Elie is a support
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
anyways, shes an easy skip for me, love her, but I just want an Ignite Support god damn it... plus, I still have my Flame Tuna, though ig it wont be bad to cope with 2 fire team in MA later
but from her gameplay, it looks like dps
if shes a support, it better have Ignite god damn it
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Vill-V being S rank Fire
I called it
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540> she stop HoC, its fine
I want Yae to end HoC like how she stopped HoC in Pe
Real Plot Twist, Ely used HoC power and reverts back the change bringing everyone back to life
my internet been dead afterall
though thats prob cuz i need to play the story
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
what I want to know is what happened to Kosma and Eden
<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
they do be at a disadvantage
yea, Flame Chaser vs Herrscher of Corruption but they are all in the sim world
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I hope Sakura stops HoC?
we saw her shadow at the end of the cg though
yall posted the cg already?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Even Rondo is Igniteless, she can only proc Ignite QTE but can’t actually apply ignite unless you Ult, but Ult is Burst Mode like SK so you just lose all your SP slowly and can barely do it once or twice at most
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Raven couldve been a good Ignite support but nope, gotta make her igniteless so people whale for Sirin for Ignite
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Prob have to wait til Eternal Elysian is all done first b4 they allow it
Unless they do something like Aponia where they release 2 chat at once
Considering we just had Griseo who is A rank, Vill V being S rank is like 99% base S for me
yea, kinda saw that coming, since it was already said that her sim is the most special out of all the flame chaser for its fragileness
knew it
she found out how her sister died?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
idk what happened to sakura since i havent caught up to the story
but yaoyao is just dendro loli, Dendro Archon being Dendro Loli means shes a legal loli, the loli hag
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
i hope its a dendro loli to make twitter mald
prob revealed in 5.9 trailer, but Hua, Ely, Kal, Griseo, Sakura, Kevin
yep, from 5.8 trailer + exact order,

Snek died 1st, then Cat, so now its Eden and Kosma next right after
Sakura death will def break me too
then Kosma last
Eden 1st
Eden and Kosma are next btw
ye
hewwo
we have a lot of good male char, even if they arent playable doesnt mean they dont have good story
no playable male char but the male char themselves as long as they arent the self-insert protag tend to be well written
~~Welt~~
~~Otto~~
~~Kevin~~
2:5 ratio
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
dendro archon can support my wallet, still annoyed that its gonna be a female archon... cuz dendro archon was the only archon so far whose trailer was shown to be vague... cuz all the other archons are confirmed female body type by dainslef afterall
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Ive been there since day 1 and GGZ era, i know the pain
True, their side/characters story can be pretty nice, but their main story are just kinda shit, to the point where its better if they had just had the story been multiple chapters like with ER or Honkai story instead
Dainslef
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
The tediuos side quest
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Excluding Event side quests
We had the mini version which was Dragonspine
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
We never actually get to properly know any of the Genshin characters for a good ampunt of time until the next one replaces them… then the occasional rerun which for some like Albedo + Dragonspine, can be pretty good, then the other kinda eh
Anyone who said ER story is worse that Genshin is automatically trolling for me, Genshin story can sometimes be pretty good, but it aint gonna reach ER level at all in terms of In game dialogue and atory along with texture lore
Sounds about right
for me, Aponia or the other Flame Chaser will end her
Mobius killed Mobius just to die again
Ana and Owl couldve been good but their chapter was too short, unlike ER where we got to know them over multiple patches
Let her fulfill her wish first
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
I just want Eden to sing her final song to Elie before dying
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
 watching the trailer again, its fcking showing the order for their deaths too...

Mobius, then Pardo... so now Eden is next with Kosma being the last to die
i dont want Sakura to die... she already has enough tragedies
my child
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Kosma...
i fucking hate it
yep
Ahhhhhhhhh
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Even though we knew Flame Chaser are dead, they are legit being killed for a second time now
Im depressed now
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Fuck
<:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294>
Eden better not die before she get to sing the last song
I want my cat and snek and singer back
Sakura situation
Ye
Design
<:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294>
People disliked Aponia, now Vill-V just became the bew hated Flame Chaser
<:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294>
From what Carv showed, Eden, Kosma, Pardo and Mobisus died first, so most likely Kosma died protecting Griseo
<:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294>
Fuck… Ahhhhhhhhhh…. Kosma… Eden… <:cryge:966624721611403294> why does Snek has to die too, we didnt even get her pink outfit, FUCK
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
The Elie picture book, showed us everything…
<:sussge:968897150249484389> <:cryge:966624721611403294>
V
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Cat gone
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Have some depresso too
Depression
lmao
congrats
<:Sadge:842131939607183360>
my JY now yippe... I did try to do one more but I didn't have any good pieces so this was how it rolled in the image below
<:depresso:1159828653413249086>
Last piece for the day
now heres the next one
1/4
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
YIPPE, finally
<:pepepray:773373711751315466>
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
None of my classmates, including the Professor are even happy about it either
Thanks Eli, I had to wake up at 6 AM for this Final
So i cant even get to watch sadge
<:depresso:1159828653413249086>
I have my finals during that time
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Nowhere near close to that part of the story
Me whos too busy with Finals to even do Propagation SU
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
Basically rule for thee but not for me
<:draculaT:814619077489852448>
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
So basically, respect their weakness and ~~abuse~~ *cough* I mean defend it
looks good until it isn't
thats all of mine
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
<:depresso:1159828653413249086>
me who still have yet to get Ruan Mei event
The person in the picture is cute
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
One had like Dominoes Pizza as the collab place
Its just different region gets different collab food and places
Its the KFC Collab basically
Yea
So yea, if I only bought 1, I prob could've asked for the Dan Heng one if they had opened the box with them
but only selected places have that <:deadge:975652771082698782> but everywhere else will still give you the Tickets that has the Code
I gave the Pom Pom Pin to my friend
if you take a photo of yourself and upload it, you get a free Pom Pom Pin
I got 2 because I bought 2, one for myself and 1 for my friend... since if you buy 2, they also give you the March and Dan Heng Standee
well, 1 if you only buy 1 iirc
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Oh no, normally, they would give both the March and Dan Heng together, but they only opened the box with March, so everyone who went today could only get the March 7th Ticket
sowwy Lumi, maybe next time, or sometime in December
so they only had March until tmr which was rude
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I might get another code later this month too because I want to go back and buy the Dan Heng Tickets... I only got the March Tickets because the employees didn't open the Box with Dan Heng
Aight, I'll DM you it since its first come first serve
<:shxtouEhe:1013233702622462034>
So I have an extra code
my other friend who went with me doesn't play HSR
I have 2, so 1 is for myself
Anyone the Food Collab Code
Nvm, I still had to go down there because only the Standee and Badge is from this event
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
Then I arrive and found out the one in LA which was closet to where I live was also doing it
I went all the way to Buena Park because on the event, that was one of the only location they said was doing the event
Wanna know what was cringe
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
Yep
Im not though
<:draculaT:814619077489852448>
Well, you can buy 1, but buying you gives you the Standee
Cuz you have to buy 2
Its like 50$ so if you’re gonna get them, get them with a friend
For US its Pelicana Chicken
I’d have to come back tomorrow if I wanted Dan Heng
Not me getting cucked twice by March
Heres March if anyone cared about that
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
if its not 100%, its 50/50
but even with Numby at 49% Crate, I crit very often
if it was QQ, it would've made sense if she doesn't crit even with 70-90% Crate cuz QQ is gamba
imagine not critting with Numby
Its still free healing but Energy Recharge is just too nice to have
^
I swear that bitch Stun is like unavoidable... you might be able to resist the mark, but you ain't resisting the stun that comes from it proc-ing...
and so he couldn't heal my QQ and she died
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Luocha with 70% CC Res + Effect Res from LC and Substats... and still got clapped by CC
I had the most crippled run too
I honestly, I thought the enemies were going to be the same like last rotation til I saw Nini posting that Bronya + Stunlock Boss
ty
cuz new buff and all
hopefully I can do mine later and see how mine goes
congrats
I kinda started liking her Gambling Playstyle
She doesnt crit and I do 12k dmg… crit and it goes to 48-60k… with E4, it spikes to another 20-40k dmg
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
The real hell was my QQ with 70% Crate not critting 90% of her attacks
Your welcome… 2nd Half should do better than mine

Cuz instead of Fu Xuan, I had use Lulucha so I could’ve died from insta kill… but I did have cleanse so… if necessary, you can prob replace Tingyun for like Natasha if you need the cleanse
1st Team
Clara, LynxDD, Asta, Flex Slot

2nd Team prob
Fu Xuan, Bronya, QQ, Tingyun
forgot all about it
god that was close
3 min left til reset
Luocha is only 3 Speed off from 150
<:derpostasis:834561554858770513>
150 Speed Gaming
Well, I might pull for someone someone else too but dunno who I want it to be
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Hua… pls…
Im at like I think 250-270 pulls now
I had no reason to pull
I completely skipped her
Bladie
get #1
max roll everything
perfect set, mainstat and substats
still copium <:deadge:975652771082698782> gotta min-max it like Nini's Blade
isn't that Hp%?
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
I know <:KEK:1024468566835204137> I just got numbed by seeing so many speedyun
seems normal, wasn't there one breaking 200 speed?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Like Slash, Sea Splits is fine, but wtf is with Swing, Skies Squashed
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
some of them are nice, but it does sound dumb with the direct translation
the fact that Caelus and Stelle already talks more than Genshin MC makes me happy
^^^
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
oh, it was W7 then, or I just misremembered who knows tbh, cuz I don't remember ever fighting the lower tier Deer after beating the 1st difficulty
World 7?
Which world was the Effect Res one, the one with the Deer
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Wasn't that already been there since like World 6
???
<:WeltAngy_Antliaelacaille:1100434141490729073>
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
Heki's building pity again
L
or all the good one are locked behind people's Patreon which mean you actually have to actively look for it
<:Sadge:842131939607183360>
genshin also has a lot of skins mods, but its hard to find good one depending on the characters... most of the female one are cringe nsfw, while for male characters, depending on which one you look for, its either nonexistent or cringe
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
yea, I only discuss them if they are already known, so common stuff like kit and what it prob means with Mihole confusing translations
and ig one Genshin one but in a diff Genshin server that has a leak channels to discuss leaks
I at most post leaks in 1 other channel, but its more like leaks already known on twt, so just hsr leaks
same
because then this server would also get nuked as part of collateral dmg
which seems very unlikely
<:susPepe:880473139086241812>
theres no risk unless one of us decided to be a narc
ishoke, as long as we aren't caught, we're good
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
wild ass frog skin, I love it
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Like there are some that are really funny like Geppy Frog Skin and lmao, Clara with Shoes
<:eek:765359367524188161>
yea... its sad, like if you're gonna do nsfw skins, at least make them good or something... but nope, its just horny... nothing great about them, like where's my beach skin, etc
because all the other one are kinda cringe skins
yea, def one of the way better mods than the one in HSR rn
got it
ah
or does it toggle off for all characters
can we toggle it off for 1 specific character then?
ty, yea, I saw all the individual one and thought the one that had all of them didn't exist
oh
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
oh god, I have to download each one individually
like in the old days with Hi3rd
ngl, I wished HSR would do that for April Fools or something
wtf
its so cute
ty
omg, I want it, send me the link to the UI mod, I dun wanna look for it on the site
Its such a mood sometimes
I love the localization for HSR
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I need to go unlock it and start grinding it ig
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
I forgot it came out
Fuck
Oh, is that the new set?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I am staying strong... saving
I have Luocha so I have no reason to pull for her sadly
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
its more consistent than Bailu, which is a good upgrade
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
exclusive 4p set for Nini's blade
its called Nini's Blade Set
next patch, we're getting a new set
not worth it anyways
if speed is at x/y, dmg increase by x/y
prob not cuz its speed
how is she?
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
Ah yes, the game where you cant even talk or touch or make a vibration to your mic because it will pick it up and you die
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Honestly, HuoHuo CN VA is a chad, she should play more Horror Games instead
waiting for new sets <:despairge:1045736540875280465>
thankfully, I have nothing to farm for rn except for Traces ig
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
unironically, they basically swapped Hooks and Arlan's role... went from being super weak to super strong while the latter got nerfed to oblivion
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
honestly, the Follow-up Dmg one is prob better
Cdmg for Healers... Dmg Bonus for Support of same Element
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
ah yes, the New World I have to farm for the new set
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Im skipping him, im back to savings
Oh, I should’ve gone for S3 and S1…
Cdmg and if you have E4 QQ can also make use of the Follow-up Dmg
Yes you can
I wished I pulled for S6 though, S5 for Midyuan and an extra one for QQ
Same
Unless its Eurudition LC, there are always good LC Alternatives to most characters
ty
how do you check your unit exact speed btw
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
She's basically just a better Bailu, AoE Heal, AoE ER, AoE Regen too... and Cleanse
then we all be forced to use your Gigichad Arlan instead
<@385655541248163840> Nini Nini ^^^ Tet recommended this
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I just grab Nini's Blade yea <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I didn't expected it to hit that hard
it did
for me, I like that its not time gated... then I get to finish it all 24 hours before the event ended
I forgot Pre install came out lol
Having someone die with Fu Xuan on their team is wild for me
smh
L, they didn't make her Elation for Trolling
And I still dunno what classes I want because its only Electives left
Its ok, Exams were also kicking my ass too so I understand that… rn, I still need to find like 4 more classes to sign up for too

Registration opened like 3 days ago too
more entertaining than my own reaction to horror
I enjoy watching people scream in horror
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Thats actually very adorable
you should've seen it from yesterday
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I had 3 QUA Speed Boots with double crit... all of them only rolled 1-2 times into either Crate or Cdmg, and then avoided it for the rest of the upgrades
the game gave me good substats just to proceed to roll like shit on them all
For me, I already have Topaz's stuff so im good.. even if those stuff were actually Himeko's... I gave up on Mid Yuan though... farming for his gear is hell... and farming for QQ gears made me cry even more
its why I still wished for Yae to be better in Genshin... I know they fixed her random Totem to targetting the nearest enemy... 

but like why can't it be like Furina's <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> especially when targeting nearest makes it counterintuitive with her C2 that buffs her Totem Attack Range <:derp:724856219600289853> ... tbh, I wished for a lot of Genshin to not feel so scuffed in combat
since Numby has a cute personality <a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620> can act by itself without being like a puppet
For me, I like that Numby can act by itself even if Topaz gets CC... its more like I wished it was the same with JY where LL can act even if JY is CC
a lot of content rn are mostly 1-3 target fights too <:despairge:1045736540875280465> so maybe once the meta shifts to 5 target AoE, it be more useful... but the doompost is quite insane when Mid Yuan was our only Euritdition Character and the game just decided to release 3 Destruction Character every patch
but yea, for Argenti, it prob didn't help when in the Livestream, they say his Ult does AoE Dmg.... and if it consumes more energy, it deals additional dmg to a **random** target... which is kinda depressing, you can't even have it target the enemy you want it to<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
especially since a lot of Destruction characters really like inflating their stats (i.e Crit, Dmg Bonus, Atk)

QQ also inflates her Atk and Dmg Bonus
tbh, QQ is actually just another Destruction Character disguised as a Euridition Character <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> 

the only thing AoE about her Kit is her Ult, the rest is just Enhanced Basic Attack/Blast Attack which is basically 90% of our Destruction Character rn
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
wtf
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Somehow even worse
Round 2...
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I knew it
oh, nice
<:KekPat:966625000339668993> I'll take the Elation, because I use Mid Yuan and Topass
Hmmm...
I should start catching up in HSR before Penacunny Planet then <:despairge:1045736540875280465> I still have yet to start on Swarm Disaster too
oh, well thats 1 purple per run, so that makes sense... I still need that kind of luck
I need that kind of luck
wow
I didn't even know this was possible wtf
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
me with no Propagation because I was busy with exams
oh nice, I just like Asta because shes free and feels more consistent
<:derp:724856219600289853>
oh, she can? I thought she only shoot one bullet and not a laser
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Asta can Laser multiple of them at once
Bronya is only 1 at a time though
cuz like obv Jingliu, Kafka and whatnot has their AoE Tec, but you'll have to use that compared to just spamming Asta basic attack
<:kek:809950280258945024>
Yea, but them running is sadge <:despairge:1045736540875280465> I like having bugs that makes my life easier... back to Asta I go ig cuz shes the only one so far that can attack multiple Trotters while being outside of their range, thus prevent them from running away
smh
wait what? they removing that? rigged
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
HuoHuo Banner is just pure copium 4*
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
soon
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I hate that my Topaz already has better gears than my Mid Yuan
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
gib
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im sorry to have to say that, but truly is, just like how its a skill issue when luck is shit
Thats a skill issue
Congrats
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I need all the gacha currency I need
I legit went full hard pity pulling for 1 Luke Card in ToT
nu
<a:guildieshake:1135611665380032542>
if I did decided to pull, I would've wanted Bladie or Daniel
but yea, so far, I pulled for Jing Yuan, Luocha and Topaz, everyone, I just skipped to save
lemme check actually, I did some pulls for Topaz since I said I would go for her (cuz for the Hua VA), won 50/50 so I was happy with that
I'll occasionally roll when I feel bored, but other than that, yea, im skipping everything
I hate it because non of them are ever going to the Standard banner and will rerun once every full moon
Im saving for Hua and Kosma
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
soon the ratio is just gonna be like 100 5* and only like 50 4 stars
all I know is that they are releasing too many 5* and not enough 4*... 2 5 stars, 1 4 stars when it should've been the other way around...
well, im prob skipping all of this patch too
same
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I just hope his model isn’t as copium though
Mei yea
I just want more 4* wtf Mihole
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Disgusting
Fuck, hes also 5*
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
5* Ice Harmony
Wao
<:shxtouComfy:892987460219457568>
I mean Bladie
Pepega AI priorities similar to how Tingyun is hard coded to always use her Ult on Baldie
Wow, all of these blessing this time seems very strong
same, the only reason why I lasted this long is because of my hoarding habit and savings... also gambling addiction
that one is both long and tedious
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
better than Genshin at least
<:derp:724856219600289853>
actually, all 3, Atk, Speed, and Dmg Bonus if you have her LC
I remember that Asta Atk Buff will help Topaz Atk issue anyways
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
oh, nice
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I tested out your Topaz, pretty solid, 17k Skill and 22k Numby (non Ult)
alright... I have to test out my Topaz too though
can't wait to import my history too
yea, I was thinking the same thing
cuz I am also running Jing Yuan with them
im not sure if I am gonna run Asta or Tingyun with Topaz
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
deadge useless
Bailu is basically Qiqi at this point
Nice, I might decide to run an Atk% Boots instead of Speed for her, what do you think is better Gres <@416445660443967491>
I only needed E0, S0, because I have to save for my Hua and Kosma copium
then I can give Tingyun to my QQ

so like Geppy, JY, Topaz, Asta

Luocha, Bronya, Ting, QQ
ngl, I should prob build up Asta
was this by herself as your dps? or is she's a support dps like how I am using her for my JY team lol
nice
numbed*
I don't I just got dulled by how strong it is
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
my QQ is still going solo
but its pretty good considering I was using my Topaz with JY and Tingyun
yea, unironically, I thought 10k was low because im so used to seeing QQ, JY or Nini's Blade doing so much dmg per screenshot
converts Skill 1 into Follow-up Attack
that 1st passive really help her skill point economy and dmg a lot
yea, its unironically really good, though she can also be pretty skill point efficient if you want her to
So unless you crit with every single hit of her Skill, it will always guarantee her crit buff
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Fun fact ig, when you use her Skill, if she fails to crit even 1 of that attack, she'll automatically get the Crate Buff
Oh yea, who are the Yanqing LC user here that uses it with Topaz?
enough for lvl 70
now im at 194 pulls saved up
Ty Neko
Got E2 Guin, yay
anyways, I'm prob stopping on the first 5*, and I think I am very close to pity
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I just started, accidentally streamed it on the wrong server for the first Multi
<:derp:724856219600289853>
anyone want to watch me stream my pulls?
I forgot shes out today
lmao
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Horror Anime too ig been on decline for me to notice
I just rarely watch horror movies or movies in general so I forgot they existed
oh, yea, sorry, I meant anything Horror, so not just Horror Game
Fighting game gore is eh
For Horror Game only, only time ill be fine with Gore, anywhere else, prob not
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Prob can see it when you open my profile
But it was too long so I shortened it
Because my username used to be about a character from another anime
Hardgore
<:Razorwao_devonxy:1006146274069839872>
HgAlao
<a:pat:717159864891342848>
ishoke
way better combination than like Alicelao... I need to find a better way to add dalao to my name
<a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620>
Like Keilao
but dalao is a compliment
well, I might need her only for Mid Yuan and because CN seiyuu
probably not? I'll pull and see if i'll get her or not
Ooooo very pretty
For me, im not afraid of burning the food, I like it a bit burnt <:KekPat:966625000339668993> im more afraid of forgetting that I was cooking food so I would just forgot all about it til things start smoking
any other food, just pray I don't burned anything to oblivion
I can make rice ig
cooking im assuming
Idk what I just read
...
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Ngl, I would mod Genshin too but sadly I am very attached to all of my accounts
He’s just scuffed, but still solid at least
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Except for Mid Yuan
ngl, stage 9 was harder for me than stage 10
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
QQ  Clutched this one lmao, my 1st half took forever to kill the Training Summoner Btch
QQ stays winning too because when she enters her Enhanced Basic Attack state, that counted as getting an extra turn
I thought I would hate the buff because it only works with characters acting consecutively, but then realized using Ult counts as taking a bonus action
Im doing the new MoC
thats still a waste
congrats
ye, its not even the animated one
for what? Hua scenes, I still miss her and need a new battlesuit for her
Heki is just horny
oh, mine isn't using ERR Rope, so I have 4.1k Def instead
Speed Boots and Belo set?
<a:guildieshake:1135611665380032542>
<a:Classic:1102006776540434542>
I still need 1 more copy for E6
rude
...
lol
they know their playerbase well, morbid curiosity and degens
<:depresso:1159828653413249086>
Good morning
PT8TF72MQ93X
New codes ig
congrats Baban
I win
*throws at cherry*
🥔
Smh, just save for Hua
Re Zero moment where those are all just Tet's bodies
all of them
I wished that exist in Cali
Lmao
anyways, forgive me <@704867526877904908> <a:pat:969402615538520064> I gave proper context
As fanart and whatnot, I love it, but I rather not see it actually in game because then its just kinda awkward <:deadge:975652771082698782>
but then I keep remembering that Hoyo recently (though I say recent, its been going on for over a year now) just love to just remove their female characters pants in some way or form
Her hair does combine to make a good muskeeter kind of vibe
Clorinde was ok, I like her hat and gun the most
lmao
lmao
I never got to Fontaine to see it
whats Arle 3d model?
yea, wished they gave him some muscle like they did with Al Haithem
oh, lmao
especially for the Miko dress... legit basically her coochie is out
But I don't like her model either...
ngl, I got her to C6 and she'll prob be my only Expy character in Genshin I went for C6... I hate her gameplay for the most part though because it just felt like a worse Fischl/Albedo in terms of using her skills
its why I said they were tempting, but not enough for me to pull for <:deadge:975652771082698782>
which is usually how it is anyways
but for in-game models, its not good enough for me to pull for
Like artwise, hes very cute and handsome
I'll prob do like 1 multi on Topaz's banner or whatnot
> But yea, im skipping Blade and IL, they are cute but at most they are temptations, not enough for me to pull for...
> 
> Tempted for Blade just now cuz of the stupid Apes

Was my quote
<:eek:765359367524188161>
I said that I was skipping them back in July too
what, hes handsome, not cute enough, theres a difference
He's not cute enough
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
I don't want him, I even said I was skipping them
thats enough men, Im saving my love for Hua and Kosma expy
Shut up, I use Midyuan, Luocha, Geppy, and Welt
I haven't used any Destruction characters in forever
if you have it and isn't already using it on someone like Blade
Honestly, I rather just use Arlan LC over Moles Welcome You
Warp tracker?
what did you use for this?
<:huh:966619839307321394>
ty
good thing I don't know them
Oh, I need to start the bew Spiral Abuse and Memory of Cringe
Mainly Hakase
Klein and Hakase is still my favs
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Hook got a big buff instead though
So yea, Destructionless, and Arlan wouldve been pretty good had they not hard nerfed him to oblivion
Not anymore after I swapped to Fmc
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I don’t use it though, I used Arlan’s LC, and I dont even actually have any Destruction Characters built either
Yea, I legit just gave him all my Sushang stuff minus the Dmg Bonus Globe and he unironically did well
Well, I have 2 Clara Lightcone but no Clara either
Don’t worry, but yea, if you’re running into too much Wind Weakness like me, 4* Dan is pretty decent, I gave him Sushang gears and he did pretty well
Its good for Welt, ishoke
Sampoo is useless and deadge outside of DoT teams, though as a shield breaker, hes pretty good
Having either of those 2 will usually help him a lot more
Hes a pretty solid dps and E2 is good, mine is like also E2 when I built him, but do you have Bronya? 

Considering how his passive work, Bronya would be best for him, well, same with Welt
I do yes, built him specifically to bully the stupid Ape even though I could’ve just built QQ lol
She’s arriving after my suffering with exams
10 days? Thats fast
Lmao
Or was that someone else
<:draculaT:814619077489852448>
Congrats on getting Geppy, didn’t you want him before? Because you kept getting the childrens
<:yay:777473946710179850>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
tbh, they aren't wrong either
ah, don't worry, any under 6 ft is short, so Im short

forgot how tall I am though, but im like 5'6, so im like 167 cm
I assume this is like 155 cm?
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
I guess, they also made Luocha also smell a flower but it wasnt a rose
I would love to pull for him but I don't need another erudition character
<a:Clap:1084236159498072105>
Congratulations
I can clear it, I just couldn’t find time to place into the game
<:draculaT:814619077489852448>
Me who still has yet to start on Swarm Disaster
<:shxtouBlush:892987460219457566>
Same with Genshin pepega Abyss
In like 7 days
<a:shotobongotap:1135611530356981911>
Don’t worry, you’ll get adopted back
<:JingYuan_Pat:1084670032518332508>
<:shotolurk:892985948382576740>
Third place? For what?
<:MeiranSigh:686732581319868489>
*sigh*
…
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Ita the same one they did for Genshin, bait you into thinking the Expedition would be relevant event but it was same ol send them for 8-24 hours and they give better rewards and im like…
<:A_HuTaoDerp:791552140912492595>
I decided to waste mt exp mats
building Relics for a level 40 Himeko
It prob will entertain me for 5 minutes
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Send it here, I want to watch your struggles
for me, its like Himeko/Bronya > Welt > Clara/Bailu/Yanqing > Geppy
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
The Himeko one is great, actually, most of them unironically is a good edit
lmao
and turn that E2 into Hua/Kosma luck
I just need E0
I want to refund my E2 JY too, I love him, but his pfp is good enough for me
wao
lmao
for me, it went build Sushang > kick her out for Dan Heng > kick hiim out for QQ
great time for you to send me that as I am eating my lunch
Mine has like Speed Boots too so same, I build her for speed with Cdmg on the side
should be Fu Xuan since we don't have a single Ambundance Herta Shop LC yet
didn't get him either
happened to me trying to get Luka
Lmao
Heki…
I’d love to watch if I wasn’t going to class
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Wow they suck ass
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I love how I delay building QQ and the moment I built her, shes already way better than my Dan Heng and Sushang
nice lmao
while LC over here getting clapped by multiple mobs <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
originally like 45k with f2p LC + Bronya... went to 45k with JY LC without Bronya... went to like 72k with Bronya... thats just excluding if she procs her follow-up which does about the same amount
all because I gave her my JY LC
but her dmg doubled, going to 200k with her Ult against 5 targets too
not only that
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I got to see QQ do like my JY level damage like it was nothing
anyways, I got depressed just now
congrats to you too
congrats
Wtf
Cooking our pc and laptop for no reason now
So it doesn’t count
Yea, but like we arent gonna be beating the pro botter anyways
So literally all the view botters and big streamers will get all the rewards
<a:gunpull:1146796544406859866>
Scam
Rewards are “limited in numbers”
guess its all useless
lmao
alright
or was it like all Vietnam or like all Japan or something?
did you all picked different area for VPN?
well, more like 15-20
ngl, I used to have like 30 different Gmail accounts
guess thats a you problem, Im using Edge and it lets me make new profile
alright ty
or a bunch
just 1 new profile?
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
Im on Edge though
oh, I see
how do you make new profiles?
and then see the drip marketing for next patch
and also skip all the banners til Wrio and Topaz
so that I can skip all of my exams
actually, I want it to be 4 weeks
No, I want it to be 2 weeks already
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
my brain sleepy
hewwo Taihen
also, do you just use normal tabs or incognito?
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
lol, I ain't using Chrome, Edge did got better and I rather not have Chrome eat all my RAM
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
what vpn did you use? also are you using Chrome or Edge?
I will, but after I take my shower and do my actual HSR dailies
I really want to just go to sleep as I leave my stream open with HSR Screensaver lol
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I don’t give a fuck about my twt account, so I legit followed whichever account I felt like it to get both nsfw and sfw content
what????
wait, it ends in 8 days?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
it would be nice if they actually gave me any LC that is relevant in any way like Dance Dance Dance or Swordplay
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
lucky, I have 1 Econ exam in 2 weeks, 1 Art History Exam in 3 weeks
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>
so fast
Midterms/Exams are like coming in like 2 weeks
School/Classes is such a pain
I need to find a day where I can continue playing BG3 with Tai
Tai, shouldn't you be sleeping soon?
<:icy:828402220151603231>
Because mine is always cooked 24/7
I cant tell if that’s normal or not
If it was my laptop, it would’ve melted
Really depends on what bot it was
Plus, that one just appeared, copy paste and then left the stream
Im fine with them, I just prefer not to have them spam links, though at least it wasn’t a porn bot lol
My dead stream somehow got 1 of them to appear
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Be careful of bots btw
Have it run for like 8 hours
I’ll do that sooner or later
Lmao
Did you set up a vpn for each?
never though my ultra deadge channel would get a bot of all things
<a:Y_KEK:792821099062362122>
well, more like a bot
POG, I got to ban someone
Pretty sure the days one are separate dates, though you can prob do the 100k Minute one though running it for 24 hrs
Well, its already fried from how much game I play 24/7 but I still need to give it at least like 6-7 hours of rest when I sleep
Good luck there, I don’t want to fry my laptop yet
<a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620>
Getting the view hours will be the annoying part
Yee, since its 21 days out of 30
Im on day 1
Congrats
Good luck, I prob wont be able to test it til like Tuesday cuz I have lots of work to do
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
At least we can get the basic 4k streamer xtal for 21 days
Maybe next time ig lol
mine just looks like these
I remember I had to set my stream to HSR Category on Twitch
what does it show on there, did you make sure you're in the HSR Category?
did you go to the website and connected your Twitch Account to Hoyo?
I'm just going for the basic streaming part
oh, im not setting that up
yay
yep, its working
I started streaming it, now ig I just have to see if it properly knows I streamed the game
I have OBS so i'll prob start streaming on OBS instead
oh yea, viewer minutes... theres also the livestream for x days too right?
how much view do you need anyways
ty
neither do I, rn I am using Edge
How long is Sept 13 to Oct 15 anyways?
true
lol
its so much viewbots, or if its not viewbots, its embedded views
true
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
how long you think its gonna take them to patch this out
Neko gotta do what they gotta do to get those f2p xtals
wao, congrats, are you streaming longer so that I can get my drops
what a mood
lmao
I think I was lucky enough to get 1 ER rope for Keels and the other being the ER set
rip <:shxtouLUL:892987461599387679>
except for the apology
I'll prob try and skim through it all
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yeeee, I still have to spend like 3 hours tmr trying to finish the Sushang Market event though
its so joever for me
I haven't even started on Swarm yet, for Market event, I had to go out and eat some dinner at 9-10 pm so I didn't have time for it
I'll prob go take my shower while I afk
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
alright, ty, its like almost midnight here
<a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620>
how long are you keeping this up for, I'll leave my view in the background
oh 100%
thanks Heki
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
fuck
ty,
I forgot I still need to do the Sushang event
Tet, sleep, or read more manga
ishoke, im at E2 S3 rn for JY rn, I just have to pray I get double 5*...
<a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620>
Im waiting for the day I can join the E6 S5 Whale Club
so in HSR, I'll still whale for E6, but at least when I whale for S3/S5 LC, its actually good rates for once
I can only go for R1 of Yae's Weapon, couldn't go for R5 because I know the rates were rigged not in my favor
yea, 100%
ended up whaling in the end for her last 2 Constellation, but it will prob fair better in HSR
but after Topaz, I'll actually be saving... reminds me of when I saved for C6 Yae
Building Pity but I know its actually stupid and don't really care rn <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:Hehe:524821459915374592>
Im just gonna see if I can get Luka or the new 4* before I get Topaz or not
<a:Y_KEK:792821099062362122>
so like im already 4 multi in anyways
considering I did like 1 multi on Blade banner for fun to see if I can get him, 2 multi on Kafka (wanted to see if I can get Luka)... and then 1 more on Daniel (same reason as Blade)
I probably will
I agree, I need to hurry up and go away... I'll maybe pull for Topaz and see if I get her or not, if I don't get her from 50/50, i'll at least be guaranteed for whenever we get an expy character <:deadge:975652771082698782>
crying
then I still have to finish the Sussy event
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I still haven't started on Swarm... new content for another game dropped and I have to go through that hell, but also do my school work today
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
like the list of what her E4 does, I'm more surprised people don't know the basics on how it work, though there were some things there I didn't expect
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I remember my QQ Critting her Basic, but failed to Crit on Follow-up, and vice versa, and then random Tingyun proc deals for like almost 1/2 its dmg because of how inflated QQ Atk was
ye
no Arlan LC is kinda sadge
nah, Herta's is basically an upgraded version of Moles
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
cuz its Atk%
nope, kinda mid
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
that is actually just rude
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
that flat attack cursed
rip
what's the rolls?
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
it can always be thrown on another dps
well, you can try your luck then
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
and lmao
I went with the Salsotto because I can get 50% Crate but never get to 70%
If you have E4, either one will work for the Follow-up/Ult or the NA/Skill one

mainly because gettings 70% Crate is pain, so sometimes, just getting the consistent 15% for Follow-up/Ult is just better because its 50% Crate Condition
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
rip
I rather QQ have Atk% Boots, though i dunno if you have Bonya
rigged ass game
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
luck skyrockets
building my main, dead substats, building someone random
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
don't worry, my Midyuan is extra unlucky, but my Welt has better average in his Relic substats roll
Crate Chestpiece, always
just like me fr
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
well, more like Cdmg is all I can get with my Welt
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
my Midyuan is actually cursed, tried rolling on Relics with him and I get pepega'ed roll on all my Crate/Cdmg subs... then swapped to Welt and then this happened
I hate this game so much
<:huh:966619839307321394>
idk why the lottery decided to be so nice to me
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
They lucksac
Its the same one that got E6 Kafka in less than 400 rolls
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
My friend’s Trace drop rates, apparently, this is their usual…
I need to fix my JY Planar set
Oh, wishing sim
You're in Spain without the S
it looks fun
I still haven't started on Swarm
Carv prob hasn't started, like with me
Though ig since they arent always spawning every turn, its prob not as bad
Jingyuan, even though he’s Euridition, actually gets bricked the more mobs there are <a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
<a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620>
~~I started on it as in I just talked to Herta~~
can't relate either
Hunt
<:shxtouCopium:1013233700261072916>
I don’t need another Preservation, I just need Dmg
<:derp:724856219600289853>
I still have yet to start on the Swarm event
lmao
based Mobi
<a:shotowigglepup3:1031425935938965536>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
...
You can do dis
...
Tet
like a true menance
the Destruction Trotter taking revenge
lmao
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
For Elie had said: Different Start but Same End
<a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620>
listen to Elie
but different start
Well, according to Herta, it doesn't matter because what happens in the end is up to your own interpretation, its like a Choose-your-own adventure that has the same ending
I like the braids
so same as Gres
I used my Geppy, Fmc, and Luocha
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
but so far, all the Children avoided me so I can't tell if thats a good thing or bad
because I have 2 Clara Lightcone
honestly, I would want Clara
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I remember a strimmer getting 8 Clara, and all their other Standard 5* like Bailu is barely at E1
But I have Welt, Himeko, Geppy, and Bronya
So far, I still don't have:

No Clara (2 Clara LC though)
No Yanqing
No Bailu
well, who else is left
I guess im the only one left
I was forced to build her this MoC, I did have some fun using her though, but I still used my JY for first half


Still waiting for another Dps
Lmao
Oh
Just to fix her crit issue for a bit
For me, I’ll prob give QQ my Midyuan LC lol
🐒
lmao
considering killing Trotter refund like 2-3 Skill Points
but Bronya if you can only pick one tbh, at least for the current MoC
I would use both
its actually fun
my friend got 1000% Cdmg Blade lmao
yea, if its SU, theres always way to get SP back, but for MoC and everything else, her E6 is really useful
I have mine at E6 and that 1 SP refund is so useful, because after she drains all your SP, you'll at least get 1 back to be used on other characters like your healer
very worth it
wao

wao, stat inflation at its finest
Lmao
Sadge its only up to 6, unlike MoJ which went to 15
yay, just finished Mox6 ig
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<a:shotobongotap:1135611530356981911>
or at least that was what I was told
up to 3
Funni Difficulty name
based indeed
then even then, all I know was that he was Minecraft person
ngl, I didn't even know who Dream was til drama got pulled up with him and whatnot
what happened with Mr. Beast stuff?
Been waiting for that PRI and Expy since Hi3 launch
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
The true Expy is Judah Chan Expy
<:huh:966619839307321394>
yes, such as with Kebin, Kalpass, and Su SU expy <a:NodBb:561613076844249130> totally
min E2 S3 though at worse
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
me when Hua/Kosma Expy comes out, E6, S5 and all my Fuel down the drain
was one sided
<:PepePoint:857792708479680552>
Neko was Carv's cat for quite a while before
oh, I remember that
then became bootleg Cocolia
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
the Alchemy Lady who was blind
honestly, that Mox6 is prob like a Moc10 stage
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
lmao
I think I forgot all about it after I did Mox 5
oh, then I prob havent done the last one yet
how many stages are there to it?
I forgot if I did all of Mox tbh
lol
so its probably harder/worse for other
for me, I used Wind Dan against Kafka but thats because my IMG/Wind Team was perfect for that match up
Kafka side?
kinda had him with Bronya and Welt and just nuked out the Summers
I used Wind Dan Heng
lmao
me
especially when spamming Svarog, obv not Full Defense because that would be <:eek:765359367524188161>
help her tank more hits
nah, unironically, Clara does want a Def% Mainstat piece
yea... <:despairge:1045736540875280465>
im using the Salsotto rn, I would use the Basic Attack one but tbh, it depends on your preference and which one you got luckier subs with
well, its her current BiS, but also the most niche because its doesn't buff basic Attack <:deadge:975652771082698782> but it does make her E4 deal fat amount of dmg lmao
<:Sadge:842131939607183360>
I only have 130 pulls rn
mine with semi scuffed things, but still cleared MoC10
E4 lets her proc this shit twice for basically 240% + 240% dmg <a:kekah:844467095227990028> and while you're at it, you get Atk% from her Talent and for every failed roll, you get more Dmg Bonus
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
basically you gacha for 4 Tiles, then gacha for E4, and then gacha again to get all the Dmg Bonus from your failed pity
within gacha
so gacha within gacha
well, 24% everytime you use her skill, which then makes it so that when she attack, she attacks twice... so I can do 36k dmg, then another 10k or 36k if the 2nd attack from E4 Crit
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
E4 literally double her dmg btw at a 24% chance
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
rip
E4
heck, even my Sushang, Dan Heng, and Midyuan had a rough time
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
probably, considering there will always be content like this shit where Seele won't be as useful
real mvp
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Not even any set bonus, just there for the stats
honestly, I get like 30% Cdmg from Keels and like another however much from Bronya but yea
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
70% Crate QQ failing to crit so often
god that took me a while
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
on the enemy side, Yanqing resummoned his sword immediately
I almost beated him, but rng bricked me
shes using my Sushang gears basically
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
mine is legit running mad copium Phys Set
lmao
oh, no Speed Boots?
Atk is ass too
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Mine is barely 59:100
i'll be doing like 10-11k hits when she couldve easily done 26k just by critting better
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Rng her skill, rng her E4, and then Rng the Crits
She never wants to crit
I don't think my QQ dmg is good enough
true
then Luocha, Bronya, QQ, but idk who would be 4th
I can prob go Geppy, JY, Tingyun, Asta
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but idk what to run on 1st half tbh
I still need to redo mine... *sigh* because im using QQ first half... though ig it might be better to use her 2nd half and JY first half since the trotters are pain
These guys are disgusting, my QQ is still underleveled using Phys Set... she prob couldve cleared faster if it wasn't for that lol
yea, only need 116 for LL, its why without Asta, I need Speed Boots because getting Speed from subs is too deadge
yea, I have to use Tingyun 1st half with QQ and Bronya so I can prob run Atk% Boots with Asta on 2nd Half
I really wished JY wasn't so gated by Lightning Lord and his Speed sot that I can run my Atk% Boots... though that didn't change much compared to my Speed Boots lol
what I need to fix is my Welt
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I guess im the only one with the best JY crit ratio
yea, whats depressing is that even when theres more than 3 enemies, it doesn't help JY who does AoE because Lightning Lord is Bounce
if it wasn't for Daniel innate Crate and his LC giving Crate, Heki 100% would ran so much Cdmg
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
heki would
makes sense, 60% Crate with Lightning Lord does kinda be depressing sometime
for Midyuan
what you think is more entertaining, 90 Crate 170% Cdmg or 60% Crate 220% Cdmg
the Trotter diluted his dmg a lot
my only dps options rn are just Midyuan, Dan Heng, and Sushang
I have no Basic Attack spammer... so I don't have much option rn
the trotter are hell though
I'll try raising QQ and see how she'll do in 1st Half... I should be fine running 2nd Half with Geppy, Natasha, JY, and Tingyun
those guys are always sniping you with one shot skills
I did say 2nd half has 2 Void Centaur
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
yea, I think mine is E6 too, so I should build her... my only problem is that all the Euridition LC are dogshit
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
unironically, I might have to build QQ just so that I have a Enhanced Basic Attack dps
its disgusting when both of them target my Welt and kill him being wombo comboin him
not the Wind one, but the Void one that actually fucking hurts
Centuar Sniper to be exact
Yanqing side also has 2 Snipers
Yanqing 2nd Half... 1st Half are those Lady that debuff your max hp
having no NA spammer doesn't help either
Im did MoC 9, but I really don't like 10 so far... I can prob clear the 3* but it feels too annoying
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
so how was MoC10 for yall
...
I need this kind of luck, too bad its on a Boots (not mine)
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
and I can't be bothered to deal with them
oh I cleared that one easy, my only problem now is MoC 10 where I get sniped and one shotted by the 2 Centaurs
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
ah yes, Seele or Gacha
wtf
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Trotter Blessing is actually bricking my run
never thought the Blessings would rigged it against me
thanks, I hate fighting them
The trotters are aids
I see
<a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620>
<:Childe_Sigh:789002373153685504>
smh
thats so outdated
I'll join your MoC10 soon, just doing some classwork rn, but ill go on and do them ig
why would I use Welt when I am using both Bladie and Daniel smh, Tingyun/Bronya Atk Buff is kinda just dead on Bladie anyways so Bladie is already playing on a handicap against Daniel
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
so thank god for telling me your Daniel has skill issue
its your Daniel smh
Better Skill Point Economy and consistency, even when I spam Daniel 3 SP every turn because he's slow with Bronya and Tingyun, its still not enough dmg for me
I still like Nini's Blade more <:YEP:815000469902065674>
?
Im talking about 74k dmg per Skill Point smh
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
Nini Blade cost 1 Skill point and does way more than that overall
223k/3, thats like 74k dmg at most
that costs you so much skill points though
smh
Imagine not doing 200k with 3 Skill points
<:PepePoint:857792708479680552>
No need for Daniel
Welt, Yucock, Tingyun, Luocha
Path of Harm
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Welt, Yucock, Tingyun, Daniel
so Welt, Bronya, Tingyun, Daniel
my other team is Jing Yuan, Luocha, Tingyun, Nini Blade
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
my current team is Jing Yuan, Daniel, Luocha, Tingyun, I wanted to use Yucock but shes only E1
wdym?
triple buffer and Daniel
is Yucock
actually, whats better
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
you should replace Luocha for... um... uhhh... ASTA
ishoke, he gets Cdmg from his Talents
Similar to Daniel Talent where he increases his Dmg% per hit he does with his skill
For example, one Blessing does Aftertaste Dmg 1-3 times with Follow-up Attack, if you get 3 Aftertastse Proc + Ult, the blessing essentially buff the dmg by 4%, 8%, 12%, then 16%, etc
Its because it stacks with the 3* Blessing Aftertaste Dmg
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Hmmm.... I wonder what the lovely Aha <i><ub>12</... Blessing do
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
<:shxtouCopium:1013233700261072916>
You can have her gacha all your bad gacha luck and reroll your luck and hope you profit off good luck
Gachaception
<a:shotobongotap:1135611530356981911>
A gacha within the gacha within the gacha
Heki, shes the gacha character for the gacha
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
use it with Midyuan not so mid but unironically OP Lightcone for even more Dmg
I guess I just like characters that uses summons or pets
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
of course he would be the most mid out of all 3
Trio are Destruction while Midyuan is the only Euridition in their friend group
Im skipping Blade, Daniel, and Jingliu, all three of which were Destruction
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
same Elie... I pulled Midyuan (which is Bounce) so its mainly 1-3 Target (preferably 1)... my Dan Heng and Sushang are Hunt (thus bricked)... my Welt is also Bounce (even more bricked)... and the one I might pull for next patch might be Topaz (who is Hunt, thus Bricked once more)
better than my characters, im 1% off from the 70% Crate buff
they didn't even pulled for Seele and got 2 Seele Lightcones within 2 multi
Literally their highest was 77 for Kafka, everything else rolled 8-48 at most, averaging around 20-30 per rolls
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>
I don't know myself, I want those low rolls, wtf is this luck bias
No, not really
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
while I over here already lost 3 50/50 across 3 Banner Characters...
yea
<:HimekoWTF:423917413063720980>
E6 Kafka in less than 400 rolls
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
I legit didn't even noticed they were all low ass pities either til I took a 2nd look at it
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
all of those Early Kafka wtf
wait a minute
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yea, I lost 50/50 to Bronya, which I am fine with... I just realized they were as much of a whale as Nini at this point
1 Yukong out of all of that
Reminds me of when I was going for Luocha
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Im not sure, all I know was that he got E2 Daniel thanks to this but also the fact that he said getting E2 Daniel was easier than getting 2 Yukongs
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
One of my friend's pull, guess hes set for the next banner lol
and since he can do AoE, he can stack the Atk% buff quicker
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
it works on him yea, mainly because he's one of the first 5* we have where he gets so much Dmg Bonus that the Dmg Bonus Lightcones like Arlan's isn't as useful on him
Yee, its super nice so you at least know the event you’re gonna be getting
basically with E4, Jingyuan LC becomes extra stonk on her
because people always want to find a reason to compare characters together
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
but its a fact that those Lightcone sucks ass though
Euridition LC are the most copium
correct
<:shxtouCopium:1013233700261072916>
I might go for Topaz but im still debating lol
oh yea, I forgot you were going for her
<a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620>
now pull 2 more copies
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
congrats this shows that LC > Characters
<:A_WheezeTao:793919527208484924>
Heki moment
<a:shotoBonk:903861896271237120>
good luck, for me, I might pull for Topaz but thats about it... depending on who is next after, ill prob skip it all
imagine pulling for Luocha, losing 50/50 but still only get 1 Yucock
<:Sadge:842131939607183360>
my Yucock is at E1/E0 still
March and Asta also bodied my Yukong rolls
I wished the Yucock can stop ditching my rolls
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
especially one that gets powercrept for not having Cleanse
because I don't want another healer
its why I stopped pulling for Daniel and only did 1 multi like with Blade/Kafka Banner
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
So many of my friend pulled a Bailu when they lost their 50/50 to Daniel
thank god Im not pulling for anyone else
I want to have Nini Blade with Luocha and have it solo the Boss together
<a:shotobongotap:1135611530356981911> <a:shotobongotap:1135611530356981911> <a:shotobongotap:1135611530356981911>
But I like your Blade more
I like story when its not side quest that isn't funny in any way
My complaints will always be why are dialogues too long <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
they'll find a way to profit randomly
this is Heki we're talking about
Not as much dialogues as Genshin at least
Pretty sure most Bonya use Speed Boots too
Midyuan because its the less cursed out of all of them
because 1 is not enough to keep him constrained
cells*
Heki jailcell
<:jailpepe:721011857376411699>
<:stare_phone:988710127718760479>
stop breaking your sentences
vulgar or not, the end result is the same
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
so it all sums to SEGGS... just that word alone solves most thing you said
simplify it to one word, if not, don't
<:Childe_Sigh:789002373153685504>
you didn't say it in one go
yee
1 has 400 more Atk and 16% Cdmg vs 25 more speed
Which Welt should I use?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
this is so rigged
This is so depressing
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
why are you using a lvl 50 Clara Lightcone smh
on Cocolia boss
your Dhil died
How were they?
I was busy on HSR so I didn't get to see the pulls
when I was watching it before, its been mix of losing 50/50 and winning 50/50 lol
Standard Banner
E1 Welt Pog
Noice
Won 50/50?
2400 Reserve Trailblaze Powder wtf lmao
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
tbh, he's not exactly wrong either
nighty night
thats too many acronymns for my smol brains
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
true, but what I meant was, if you say Gilf, it can at least be the acronymn for both, if you call Arlecchino a dilf, you'll would also have to call her a Milf if you want to use both terms on them <:despairge:1045736540875280465> 

since just calling her a Dilf alone just mean they are a dilf, not a Dilf + Milf
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I forgot Gilf applies to both and unlike Dilf and Milf
me watching for CN dub
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Dhil and his existential crisis
sleep is for the weak
indeed a Tingyun moment
How long does the treasure event take to finish?
the only thing that isn't mid about Midyuan is his overtuned LC
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Midyuan LC will definitely last well over a year though
He'll last longer tbh, or less depending on the supports, but he at least have better hopes than JY because unless they add in a new character that can make Lightning Lord act immediately, Midyuan is doomed
All my other friend begetting her once or twice more commonly than me
I haven’t even gotten her once either
this made it even more depression
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
1% off from the Dmg Bonus
I hate this game
thanks, its gonna be useless for me ig, since my only Nihility rn is Welt and Break Eff% is useless and he can't do DoTs
I forgot it he tried pulling for her gears or not but yea
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Got her when pity counter was at like 10-20 from hard pity
Yeppers, iirc he was pulling on SN Adv Supply, which as we all know SN was one of the most deadge S Rank
One in HSR and one in Hi3
He for bodied twice by Seele
Where I watched Asmon win like every 50/50 for Seele while Tectone f2p copium ass was getting bullied by her
Yea, he truly balded from Gacha

I actually only realized it was him because Asmongold vids since Baldtone was in whatever their org was called
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
mine is Attack because my Speed Boots are nonexistent for Welt
indeed its Kektone but balding
but yea, that would be so rude on any other units lmao
He gets Crate from his kit though iirc
Sounds like something HSR would do
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
DoT blessings, deadge, ig im not maxing this run, no DoTs afterall
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
when 30 trailblaze powder gave more rewards than your 60 powder run
<:derp:724856219600289853>
using Effect Res Planar set, 0.5% off from the 10% Team Dmg bonus
I cant with this game <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I haven’t even started on the previous version Companion Quest
lmao
noice
My Welt gears is better than expected, other than the lack of Crate
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Its better than rollong purely on only Flat Atk
Defense Set with all the Crit Subs
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Higher chance to roll Crate/Cdmg when upgrading all my Preservation Relics
Had like 8 Break Effect rope before a single other mainstat rope
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
It is, its just that for me, for some reason, the drop rate for Break Effect was somehow higher than Atk%, Hp%, and Def% Ropw combined
Of course ER would be the rarest, Ult spam be stonk
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Outgoing Heal and Break Effect, I erase those 2 stats from my memory
Lmao
Oh yea, I legit forgot the Healing One existed
But that just how it was for me
Atk%, Def%, Hp% Chest are more common

Then Crate Cdmg

Then hardest is Effect Hitrate/Res
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
iirc, Atk% Chest is not that rare

Rarest Piece for Chest is Effect Hitrate/Resistance at least from what Ive seen
Speed is the rarest from what I’ve remembered
Atk, Def, Hp, Speed

So yea 4 possible mainstat, not sure if there was any other
Its also because for HSR the stats numbers are less so it gives you the illusion where the stats aren’t too inflated


So that you aren’t crit fishing for 10% Crate 20% Cdmg subs or 30-40% Cdmg, and so when you roll on okadge stat like Atk%, you won’t feel as bad… similarly for stat distribution like Speed
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
I do agree with this part, 

the main reason why I like HSR is only because I have a separate domain essentially to farm for just only my Dmg Bonus piece when the drop is basically split between 2 Slots and have less rng than to go Fish a Dmg Bonus piece from a pool of 5 different Slots
Mostly when I farm for anything Dmg Bonus, trying to farm for a Dmg Bonus Goblet with useable substats is actually hell when you not only have to get the Goblet drop from the 5 Different Pieces but also make sure that the mainstat and substats are actually good on that piece

and even when its your Off-piece, you now also have to make sure that your Circlet actually is also on set with the right Crate/Cdmg Mainstat and Substats
There was also the Yae one as well, where my best piece was just a 80 flat def piece… later on, I got lucky with Shimmie off-piece and called it a day
My greatest hell was when I was just trying to farm the 4 Piece Physical Dmg Bonus set and ended up getting 4 Gladiator instead before even anything useful from that Domain
At least I can cope better with HSR relic than spend 8k Resin for 1 useable piece and a full set of artifacts for a completely different set than what I was farming
My trauma from Artifact Grinding in Genshin was pure hell
Forgot to add in less
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Oh, I forgot a word in there
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Doesn’t help for me that my Off Piece is either on set for 5 Piece or I have 2 Off Piece because the game can never give me anything better than 2p 2p or 2p 3p
I hate this game less than Genshin though
Literally all of his Atk% Rope that has more than 15% Cdmg was because those Atk rope were being farmed for Sushang/Dan Heng instead
Yet when im trying to build my Midyuan, hes getting utter garbage
Im not even gonna go for Dhil yet I get a 22% Cdmg IMG on set Globe <:wheeze:833318723565649950> it was rated SSS on the Artis Rater too
Im still saving eternally for me
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
but in a meme sense she actually just give him survival instinct so he can't die
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
She gives Bladie survival instinct
yep
Lynx just has the most value for Blade/Clara too
Nat has cleanse, Luocha has everything in a healer, Lynx now has cleanse + makes your tank/destrction char more useful
I love how every new ambundance char is just kicking Bailu while shes down because they are just more versatile
noice
lmao
either work tbh, depends if you have good Shieldbreak potential, but I'll still say Spd
W
Wao, it actually happened on 2 occasions, 1 for Yae and another for Razor where i spent an absurd amount of Resin for doodoo
I was not, dont think anyone would after spending 40+ fragiles just to get not a single useable artis
Sounds like me spending 4000+ Resin in a single day only to get 1 useable Artifact for my Razor
Ishoke, Lightning Lord can continue to carry him
Bindle?
Jack the Rizzler
Afterall, Bonya got 2 Expy, who says there cant be 2 Kebin Expy
MC isnt named Kebin so we need a new expy
Its MC but they dont count
Waiting for HSR Kevin, gonna be name Kebin
Lol
Birbwei
Birb
Yee
Same
Ua evolved to Uah and then became Utah
Uah
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Yea, since one was Raiden and the other got Yae too
I would cry too
I want the Hua expy to have a different name yea… though theres also General Hua, which aint gonna end well for me
Skipping her too though
Didnt expect Topaz to be Hunt though, but Fire Hunt, thats new at least
<:COPIUM:897281976317411378>
I hope she’ll be the VA again for the actual Hua Expy
Yea, its sadge
Ima wait for an actual Expy character
I love Hua VA, but Im skipping PepegaLiu, cuz I don’t like her
CN or JP, or was it both, nvm, its CN I see

Me want actual Hua Expy though <@82358863155703808> so Im still skipping her
Lightning Lord is the dps, so they aren’t wrong lmao
Oh yea, for the Warp Trotter event that I completely skipped, how much xtal did it give?
I want to travel in time to my next Expy so that I can simp and save through that time for my E6 S5 Expy Hua/Kosma
Its because I was forced to fight Sanctus Medicus guy that keeps spawning in 2 more mobs…


It turns my Welt Skill useless, and that shit actually hurt when it uses the Spear Throw followed up by Kafka AoE attack
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
its totally Elio
robo?
Bobo cham? doggo?
Sam, wao
My Welt was dead useless this run <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
ig lvl 50 March is hard carrying me this run
sounds like the usual Video processing pain
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Ooooo
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
even their Rng mode here target primarily Tingyun for no reason
These 2 just won't stop targetting Tingyun
God I fucking hate this game
I hope it good for Welt... Im tired of using a 3* one on him <:YEP:815000469902065674> 

anyways, why Nihility and not Euridition which has the most ass LC in the game <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:slayjj:1120092406012989451>
I never gotten this once
Unironically, all of my Welt pieces are so cdmg heavy but no Crate, if I get anything with good Crate, I can prob even throw it onto DHIL
I have Bonya but I use Bonya on my Dan Heng/Sussy Sushang
24% Crate at its finest
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Goes like 4-5k to 14k when it feels like it
My Welt dmg is real random
there was just a 3* LC that gives Dmg Bonus against Slowed enemies which Welt does 24/7
EZ dmg bonus with Slow
I don’t really care for any Nihility LC rn because my Welt works fine with the 3* LC
Congrats Chrom
Oh, I’ll prob read the companion quest, I just won’t care much about event story though unless its good or not too boring and tedious
Which event?
Haven’t even done Luocha companion quest yet
Nope, dying rn
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:A_BigBrainTao:793917214427185163>
Soon they’ll add in Crit Resistance and you’ll have to build characters over 100% Crate
wao Bladie piece noice
also new code
8B64E57RPP3P
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I still haven't even done Luocha companion quest
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I did it
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I unironically liked the Blade Blessing back then better than this one
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I use Geppy and I don't get enough dps going
First team always caused one to get killed because of BS
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
they always find a way to one shot or gang up on my characters
issue is that first half hates my Welt
oh I wouldn't have this issue because I normally use Geppy
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Im trying so hard to keep her alive rn
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
playing Abyss with Tingyun is actually hell
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Good luck, I think I have about the same amount
I have to kill the stupid monkeys all over again
im actually gonna cry
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Yanqing only targeted my Tingyun for all his sword
My Geppy actually has 3.9k Def because Planar Set 2nd half doesn't activate until im in battle
everything else is utter garbage
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
all thats going for it is the fact that it rolled 9 Speed
my most meme piece
so that was another 15% Def for 30% Defense
I didn't actually think that my Geppy had more than 50% Eff Hitrate
Lightning set is ass, but not like theres anything else better for JY rn
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
its fine, rn, I need to go back to farming Jing Yuan up, which unironically will also drop Geppy's pieces
yea
Im still on the Belo Planar Set that gives Def, and even more Def if I get x% Eff Hitrate
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I think I took one and only my Tingyun died because it’s Tingyun
Im surprised your team even died with Geppy shield
^^^
My Jing Yuan be eating good then
Oh, pog, follow up attack blessing
Enemies are the same im assuming, what is the Blessing this time though
Thats a mood
Lmao
Or at least not decay all the way to the start
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I wished when Lightning Lord gets max stacks, he just automatically attack
Poor Stando
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
CC is Jing Yuan biggest hell
Jing Yuan?
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I haven’t even gotten to start on MoC yet so I cant feel the pain
So she prob still have her destruction level taunt value
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Seems like her taunt mechanics most likely wasn’t fixed, just her talent passive
Cuz I haven’t been working on him as much outside the bare minimum to make him good
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
But he has like 55.5% EHR and 22.5% Effect Res
Im trying to upload the image rn
If my data can load the image in
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
I take it back, game just decided to give me some ig
Im not home rn so I can’t show you, its utter trash though, I don’t plan on building Effect Hit Rate unless I get his E1 though, since its still only a 65% Freeze chance til E1 makes it 100% Base chance
Gives him more actions to gain energy and spam his Ult more often
Honestly, I would say to give him Speed Boots instead
Speed vs Hp and 35% Cdmg
I wanna cope and say use the 2nd one and just have Bronya move his action forward
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Like for instance, if lets say Kafka used Domination on Luocha, it will basically go through 2 skill check

So lets say its 100% Base chance, it will go up against his Effect Resistance before going up against his CC Res if it goes through the former
In Genshin terms, its equivalent to Elemental Resistance (Razor Ult) vs Dmg Reduction (XQ Rainsword)

They both literally do the same thing (almost), but the difference is that they are considered separate modifiers
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
My Bronya is running Lightning set
I finally got the poor SU achievement of having 0 Cosmic Coins left over
yes kinda yes
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
but I got Luka in 1 multi so I hope its the same in HSR
I lost mine to Clara, somehow got a lot of Asta
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
No, I still need better pieces for Jing Yuan... farming for Welt somehow gave me better pieces than me farming for anyone else
Why is Welt actually getting all the Cdmg
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<@781539392039682058> My best piece too
minus the Globe cuz I needed a Wind one and not Phys
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
its why I built Dan Heng to lvl 75 and gave him my Sushang Relics
My Jing Yuan is functional enough, I need a 2nd team to clear my MoC
I ain't doing anymore, I need to go back to fixing my Jing Yuan now
been farming his shit for like 2-3 weeks now
<:wheeze:849512019405439006>
Tell the game to give me one then
185% Cdmg vs Imprisoned enemies
He has at most 34% Crate with his set bonus
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
someone save my Welt pls
I like these kind of numbers
I usually have Welt go dps... but imo its usually the Cdmg or ER Set
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I already built my Wind Dang Hen Chicken to level 75, dont wanna get another Windie rn
But other than that, I should be safe
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Im going to build pity pulling one time on Kafka banner for Luka
and they aren't even good relics
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
My Jing Yuan has been running on the same relics since his release
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
don't lie
Hung
I know I left it on auto but Tingyun dying every time is just depressing lol
I haven't but considering I spent a long time farming just for that gear is still depressing
also most depressing Jing Yuan here
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
My Welt is so shit except for his Globe
thank you
<:pepepray:773373711751315466>
Gib website since i forgot where this was from
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Now get it to 180 Speed
Picked Galaxy Lotto and the very first item I broke immediately deleted all my hp, Luocha ftw
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I had to leave SU on pause because im going to the temple today
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Honestly, Yukong is just a Hunt character disguised as a Harmony character
OOoooo, congrats Carv
Joined the 30* MoC crew <:blushhehe:1040755514411335780>
so he was able to deal more dmg and kill them easier
Got Dan Heng to lvl 75 and the BS Level diff got decreased
I did it
Yay
Nini should fund me the beta access to all the pre farm gears and mats to max out Hua/Kosma before they are even out
<a:HugSpin:693756707637035078>
Thanks Heki
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
Nini blade is whale Blade, you'll have to wait til Kosma expy or Fu Hua expy and you'll see me get a E6 S5 Hua/Kosma
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
I just leave game on auto thanks to Luocha
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oh, that lady
Which boss are you even fighting? oh, Cocolia, lvl 65 Cocolia? no Natasha?
My Lightning Lord not good enough for you? <:cryge:966624721611403294>
Cuz I don’t have enough damage
Cuz I can clear it quite easy, but I can only get 2* rn, quite off from the 3 star reward
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I would and I think that was partially what I did, but my problem is that I need to kill them faster
Ig its an investment issue for me? Since I will have to continue build up Dan Heng and Bronya

Since Bronya has 10% Dmg Bonus at lvl 70/80… Welt has like 0 Crate too so theres that
How do y’all deal with the stupid Apes
yangsing
Luocha being luocha
Slow from Welt for Dan Ult and Bronya for Dan passive
I have Luocha so I have to rely on his Ult instead,

Since my team there is Luocha, Welt, Bronya, Dan Heng

No place to really use Pela nor do I have any resources to build another unit
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
They are all Tanky AF so I can’t even target properly in case the stupid Ape one shot me
Cuz for 6 not only do we have to fight the fucking Apes, and 2 of them, we also fight the Mara man that keeps on spawning in more minions to annoy you
MoC6 is still Aids than MoC10
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Yea, I got lucky with mine, because I was running like lvl 69 Welt and lvl 60 Bronya

So my teams always get low of hp, I almost died so quite a few times hoping that Kafka didn’t AoE them to death or I can heal them to where they have 100-200 hp left afterward
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
MoC 10 is easier than MoC 6 ngl
I can't care much for achievement just MoC aids
wao
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I'm just waiting for Before Dawn rerun
<:rip:654220221292478465> reminds me of when Himeko cucked me, I was fine with Bronya cucking me from Luocha but thats cuz she was early pity and Bronya is unironically good for my 2nd team now with Sushang/Dan Heng
I would prob have it under Blade but higher than most other LC so far
eh, its good but its not like broken in any way
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Jing Yuan LC is my Judah's Oath, even Lightning Lord is basically the Judah Spears
Once they add in better LC for Euridition or I get better LC for them, ill start using raising them
except for the Dmg Bonus Planar piece for obv reason
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
my Dan Heng and Sushang are sharing LC and Relics
I have her at E6, I should be building her since shes my only QUA Dps rn, but at the same time, all Euridition Lightcones sucks ass so its why I haven't built her or Himeko rn...

But I did start fixing up Welt, Dan Heng, and Sushang
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I honestly expected them to add in a heatstroke section to Sumeru
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Melt into the sticks
Sounds fun, now walk and have some things stab through the Sandals into your foot, its sounds like fun, Ive tried that
Ants pops out everywhere if you leave even a speck of food
Visiting Vietnam during summer was hell too, mosquitoes and heat stroke
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Yea, everywhere is hot, humid, or hot and humid, those closer north gets it luckier since they get less heat unlike those near the Equator or in dry ass region
Cali heat is killing me instead rn
Nah, my brain too dead rn, I fan never tell because half the time, my friends are in either SEA or EU and then randomly America when I least expect it
Cali heatstroke?
me too? and Carv?
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Nah, of 5 people, 3 must pay the price with their Credit Card
Im happy its not like that for me yet except for when Himeko cucked me from Jing Yuan
Her Eidolon are very QoL too
She very skill point efficient so I would
or maybe face
I guess its because of the head
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I still hate how stiff that idle it compared to the coffin
or I did but was asleep
I never got the ping
...
but one gives Atk% (useless for Blade) while the other gives Dmg Bonus or Crit
Hp diff is not a lot
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
while having worse passives than some of the 3* one
literally the hp it gives are about the same
since Blade don't scale well off attack and the only thing the 4* LC are better than 3* one is Attack
that one is useless for Blade tbh, Atk is not helpful, the 3* one are prob more helpful on Blade tbh
prob one of the better 4* Destruction LC out there
For Blade and in general
This one is better if you have it
until I get Clara, I won't fuse the 2, its just there to remind me that I got 2 Clara LC before I get Clara
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Im getting Clara with mine I get depressed everytime I look at my lightcones and see 2  Clara LC
only mono with SW but shes QUA <:KekPat:966625000339668993> so can't be full mono there
A lot of Abyss stages rn are like IMG Wind or IMG Phys, so I recommend just running Luocha and Blade together on one side
same
I just want both Hua expy
same
But yea, im skipping Blade and IL, they are cute but at most they are temptations, not enough for me to pull for...

Tempted for Blade just now cuz of the stupid Apes
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
any Hua/Kosma expy is gonna be E6 with LC at S3 or S5
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
yes
nope
cuz I want Kosma and Hua expy
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Im skipping him though
Should I pull for Blade... fuck... I just got Dan Heng to lvl 70 too... and my Sussy Sushang still there too <:deadge:975652771082698782> but its true I don't have a single Destruction character built either
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
mine is just there as a safety measure when Gepard Shield breaks or Fire Mc fails to Taunt
can't be worse than mine
His speed was nice
same
at most
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
My Nat heals for like 900 hp
But I did maxed out Jing Yuan and Luocha instead
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
My Natasha
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
oh same
mine is Tectone
literally the only reason I'd pull for Blade is so that he can commit genocide against those Apes
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I hate this Ape, it just ignores your aggro
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I can never 3* this because my dmg on Dan Heng is too trash to deal with 2 Apes
Nini's blade is extra whalao
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
cuz I hate the fucking Monkeys
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I am tempted to pull for Blade even though I just started maxing out Dan Heng like literally yesterday
Speed or HP boots, depends on your preference but hp would give better dmg unlike Jing Yuan who needs the speed cuz of like LL stack
because its how Blade will always be at full hp while Luocha gets free proc
yea
My Sushang and Dan Heng just sharing their gears
my consistent team of:

Jing Yuan + Tingyun

Bronya + Sushang/Dan Heng

and then have Geppy, Luocha, and Natasha save my team


The greatest despair is when they combo my unit to death because 3k hp isn't enough
Stupid Monkeys
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
God I hate Stage 6 for MoC
<:huh:966619839307321394>
ER one will still be best for Ult spammer though or just casual support like Tingyun
its free CDmg for your dps
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
fml
I have to raise Nat up talent wise and farm up both Bronya and Geppy to 70... also need to build up Daan Heng for Wind Hunt... then build QQ so that I'll have a QUA dps...
Im pretty sure the Dmg Bonus is good, the Fighting Spirit Part is Atk/Def though so yea, it can be a bit suboptimal
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540> <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Skill Issue
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
I like the suffering
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
I want to get to 65
Im still 64
I’ll try Fire MC first for story reason and then Geppy later

Fire MC does give 15% Dmg Reduction so its not too useless
Or cope with Fire MC Skill during the Story fight
I can cope with Geppy and Luocha ishoke
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Boss is not weak to Lightning?
Don’t worry, I should be fine with Fire MC, Luocha, JY and Tingyun

After my Fire MC fight for lore stuff, I swap to Geppy for Shielding
I should prob be fine though
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I still haven’t even unlocked the boss
<:slayjj:1120092406012989451>
of course it was cuz on Tingyun
...
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Finally done all the limited part for the museum event
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Thats how behind I am
I barely started on the Museum event
<:EllenStare:564840150429990927>
its bright enough to be flashbang mode
Light mode, disgusting
<:eek:765359367524188161>
Flashbang...
I need that kind of luck
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
One of my friend got Bladie in 40 and his LC in 10 pulls
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Cant get on my phone cuz well, I can’t predownload it like with my Laptop
But I can’t log on because my internet is dead so I can’t do dailies and my stamina is capped
HSR Update
I forgot Im bodied today
Which Eidolon are you on now?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
They dont want the Genshin Drama where they include 1 Stelle and then fandom started complaining why is it X stelle and not the other one, etc etc
my credits are dying
only minor traces left
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
almost 2 weeks...
<:eek:765359367524188161>
wait, its way after patch drop?
Very interesting indeed, best part is that theres 5 of them, and they all come together for Exodia

Queen of Hatred
Knight of Despair
King of Greed
Servant of Wrath

Jester of Nihil
The magical girl
Oh, its the Queen of Hatred
<:blushhehe:1040755514411335780>
love you too
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
My bonus drop are better than my actual normal one
lol Heki
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
He got insta killed by the Perma Fire DoT and my Luocha couldn’t even cleanse it
It happened to my Welt
Yep, for this fire bitch, the Fire DoT gets stronger each time he uses it, to the point you cant even cleanse it
Gotta finish that game first b4 I get back to HSR stuff
Plus, Ive been spending 100+ hours on Library of Ruina recently
I haven’t been home recently do I could only do HSR dailies
Still haven’t done any Companion Quest nor any of the Museum event
But honestly, idk, I assume whenever the banner ending
<:PepePopcorn:801534993687511080>
When the new patch drop
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
Luck synergy
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Dont worry, while that happened, I won a Raffle and got a Bike Chains/Lock along with a bottle
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Simpulator
Warp Simp
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
My internet barely works and load anything out here
Im not home
Oh, hes out?
Tomorrow I’ll show better luck
better than us unalive players
congrats

<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I love that even 1 turn it, 3 of the Void guys attacked Bronya and had it proc Luocha passive immediately
I guess Otto really did rigged the IMG Tree to boost his own mat drops even in another game
thanks
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
yay
I want it to be Kosma/Hua expy already
lol
so many trotter event too
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
also finally
Luocha is nice
Were you both just achievement hunting?
<:kek:809950280258945024>
oh
its Heki though?
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Yes Im a bottom, anyways my 5* luck is good, but winning 50/50 seems like its impossible
Ranking is relative to those who submitted their gacha rolls
Star Rail gacha stuff, one for Char event Warp, 1 for Standard, and 1 for Lightcones
My Light Cone luck was goated though apparently
This is mine
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
49.99%
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
that happened to me so many times
Im so gonna hate this
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I just realized theres an extra Lightning/Ice Ascension mat boss
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Cant even refresh the portal
Can’t reject blessings, cant turn off bonus blessings, cant go to next portal until you kill the gate boss or do event
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
You can’t even turn off the Bonus 2x Blessing at the start either
Its actually aids
If you want to know, that is very common to me

Once I tried a run and they gave me so many trotters I had to avoid and even then, I ended up getting 1-2 more Blessing over 6 and bricked my run
Oh, that happened to me too
Resonance also counts as a Blessing too, so I had to pick all the most random ass blessings and it still somehow 1 over each run
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
The avoidable one would appear in the beginning with the Blue Portal but then it would do double Red portal and it be like:

Tournament Event Fight 1 Mob or Both of them for 1-2 Blessings

Kill Boss in under 4 turns for extra blessings and its those event where I get 1 Blessing more than 6 because Elite Mob is next or its already at 6
I know, but all of them are always ends up becoming unavoidable one
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Because Portal will just both become Combat or Combat event portal
Can’t avoid getting them either
Its always been 1-2 Blessings over
Every single fucking time
Same, every single time I try this run, games like: “Heres 1 over, so I get 7 blessings at the very last moment and then I just try not to kms”
The other mainstat being the wrong mainstat or the wrong set
The greatest pain is when 8/10 of your rope mainstat is just break effect
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
But getting so Break Effect one made me maldge more
I got lucky with mine
Honestly the best Harmony LC for 4* ngl
Its my favorite Harmony LC
Oh use Dance Dance Dance
What Harmony LC do you have?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
She's quite useful if your characters still don't have Speed Boots Mainstat yet because game is sadge and pepega
Depends on your resources, if you have tingyun or bronya, probably don't need to, even with just Tingyun, you'll prob be fine without building Asta


If you need Solo Boss Fire Shield Break or Speed buff, then yes build Asta, if not, theres really no need to
seems normal to me but its Sussy and not YQ
Its official now
Wao
and then just only 1 copy of Yukong after I whaled and pulled Bronya
I pulled for Luocha and Yukong, ended up with Bronya
no, I got cucked by her when all I wanted was Luocha
Yukong Ult just buffs her Skill Effect by basically adding Crit Modifier to the buff, so I can understand why it wouldn't work, even if I hated it for that
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
oh yea, I know that, I just want Bronya LC cuz I actually have Bronya
i would assume Yukong
On who? <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
^^^
I hope I can get Bronya LC, Energy Recharge and Skill Point on Ult is nice
Yea, definitely, like among all the Harmony characters rn

I would prob rank Bronya, Tingyun and Asta around the same level

And Yukong somewhat lower cuz being/feeling forced to build a team around your Buffer/Harmony character  to use them and not your dps is kinda depressing
But at least the best part of her kit remains consistent
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Asta is good with Fire Solo Shield Break, Atk Buff and Speed Boost

She sadly lose either Solo Shield Break when against Mobs, or Attack Buffs if its not against mobs
Shes solid, but her Attack Buff does suffer once she targets anyone that isnt Ice Weakness or multiple Mobs

But her Speed Buff is very universally good yea
We can cope with Shielding and Healing
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Tingyun is prob the only Harmony character that doesn’t have a downside outside of the Tingyun moments
But at least the other Harmony characters weakness, you can still find ways to deal with
They do, but hers is very sad
But she’ll still end up like Seele in a sense
Because Sushang can Ult for a 2nd turn and has a lot of speed/action forward… and cuz Sushang dmg is heavily reliant on shield broken enemies so she doesn’t need Yukong buff to be up 24/7, just when she can Ult
Sushang
Especially since without E6, using her Ult at the wrong timing will only give you 1-2 turns of Crate/Cdmg or none at all
But finding really good team for her becomes really annoying sometimes
Yea, Crate, Cdmg and Atk but applying it can be so ass, she herself isn’t that hard to build either
If I had E6, maybe cuz she gains a charge using her Ult, effectively making it 3 charges and not 2
Buff runs out by the time Lightning lord takes action
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I can’t use her with Jing Yuan either
Dont worry, I had like E2 Qingque just from Standard Banner alone and then got E6 cuz of Luocha
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Yea, both Resurgence and Ult
JY and Sushang are Speed Boots user rn
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
For me, that would need Speed Boots <:KekPat:966625000339668993> cuz my Dps runs on Speed if I ever were to build her
Basically the standard dps build, Crate/Cdmg Chest, Speed Boots, IMG Globe, ER/Atk Rope
^^^ yea, her talent also makes her a really solid Shield breaker too, Ult does dmg afterall
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Somehow died even with Geppy and Luocha
Tingyun moment
Thank god I don’t actually have anyone else to pull for and can save til Hua and Kosma Expy, or just any Flame Chaser Expy
Its a sign
<:Copium:834822065231364156> <:YEP:815000469902065674>
Tingyun piece because shes always targeted
Nini whalao loves, you gotta accept it, I would do the same if it wasn’t for the fact that I shouldn’t have been whaling in the first place
Which neither aee built cuz im prioritizing Bronya rn
So that means I have to Build Himeko or Qingque
Having no Euridition with Sushang also doesn’t help either cuz of all the mobs wave and Sushang is Hunt
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
For me, im fine without her, my only problem was that Sushang would’ve wanted SW since shes Break Oriented unlike Jing Yuan who could brute force through it all
Got Bronya so I can go 

Geppy/Luocha JY Bronya Tingyun

Fire Mc/Luocha/Geppy Natasha Sushang Welt
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I just need to build a 2nd dps, prob Qingque for QUA bs
I pulled for JY and Luocha, I don’t regret it
E6 Qingque is lvl 20
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
No Seele and no SW so my Sushang was extra useless
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Prob not, its like Genshin, hope that event gives good enough credits and mats
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Yea, I only cared about clearing this, I didn’t even bother to go for the time limit cuz this boss is just aids
When does it not suck tbh
I might have to swap back to Destruction MC because I have Geppy as my Tank, and my 2nd team has Luocha but then again, that would mean more Relic farm so nvm
I still need to max JY, but I also need to finish leveling Bronya, also need to farm for her Relics and Planar set

Then theres also getting better relics for Sushang cuz I need to finish building her and fixing her crit ratio
though I'm not getting it because I got cucked by Bronya
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
its worth it for me, basically almost permanent 20% Atk uptime
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
its like Genshin's AR 60, getting from AR 55 to AR 60 is just pain and you get nothing for it
yea, its at 65
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
So very balanced
its because you either pull a Heki for this

and when you somehow profit for doing so, its <:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Can tank but also deal decent dmg, which you can see through Destruction Blessing in SU
Destruction characters are like bruisers/berserker characters
Yea, best part is that you would think he would be really squishy since he scale off Attack but he actually has pretty good sustain

And unlike Qiqi, he can actually do a lot of things like Cleanse and Buff wipe
cuz their buffs last pretty short while for the latter, when his field is up, you want him not to act as much
not great for Yukong/Luocha users though
Ults > Mover everyone's action forward > Spam skills more, Ult, move everyone forward again
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
honestly, I would prob give the wind set to Tingyun as well
its very strong
Whenever you Ult, everyone have their entire action move forward
lets me catch up against my enemies and stunlock them fast XD
I like Dance Dance on Ting mainly cuz I can easily just go:

Skill > Ult > Action Forward on JY > Ult > Skill
24% Dmg Bonus for JY, that is true, then that way, I can give Dance Dance Dance to Bronya ig instead of Past and Future
I do have that one maxed, but im using Dance Dance Dance on Tingyun instead rn
Thank you Nini
I don't have any good 4* Harmony LC rn, so ig ill be using that, I do have the Break Effect one but that one is gonna go to Yukong since Yukong Talent lets her do good Shield Break
that means I have to raise that 4* Dmg Bonus LC
...
Tingyun just works better with JY
yea, i'll prob use Bronya with Sushang
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I use her on Speed Boots rn, but dmg feels a bit lacking, but thats also cuz without shield break, her dmg goes from like 10-15k to like 4k
issue is that rn, unless shes against shield broken enemies, her dmg is doodoo, but its prob because my Relics on her rn kinda sucks ass

oh yea, whats better for her, Speed Boots or Attack Boots?
also Welt-kinda
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
my dps rn is Jing Yuan and Sushang
Nini nini, how do you get so much dps,

who do you think I should raise up rn:

Yukong, Bronya or Qingque?

I also need to get Tingyun A6 for the extra energy passive too
Disapear among the sea of butterfly
Musketeer Set like what Tet said, since Luocha scale off Atk and he can also make use of the Speed and Basic Attack Dmg Bonus... basically he can make use of the entire set compared to Healing Set which is pretty meh
Post OP is useful but 1/2 of its passive is useless for Luocha because his Ult doesn't heal for anything... so only the 8-16% ER is useful out of it
I prefer it more because Luocha only has 70% CC Resistance, but that doesn't mean he's immune to DoT or Stat Debuff either
This is his best one tbh
Abyss yes, it has 2 phases too
it really should've been Tet
<:KianaSweat:550951037586898944>
Jellyfish
Heki is the only one who profit off this banner and I feel tilted for that
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
it costed me 115$ for a single E0 Yukong
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
yea, the moment Luocha gets his 2 stacks of Abuse Flower everyone is just back at full hp
Im on Ebon Deer stage rn
Boss had 2 phases wtf
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
wow, I really might have to build Qingque as well
Resources dead
And I have to raise Yukong, Bronya, and Qingque now
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
4 Pelas, 4 Qingque, 1 Yukong, 1 March, 1 Serval
it can't be worse than me, Tet and Nini rn
it will
Like I don't have jack shit for good Harmony LC rn, but I have this for Clara
I wished I lost my 50/50 to Clara though
Me and Tet got cucked by Bronya too
me, Tet and Nini all got cucked
So far, only Heki profited from this banner
Baited into thinking I got JY
I had whel money but it still doesn't feel good, not as bad as when I got Himeko at 80 though
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
getting E6 Qingque... means I'll prob have to raise her up to be my QUA Dps
I might actually level up Bronya first like Heki said, only because that way, 

I can run Gepard, Jing Yuan, Bronya, Tingyun

I also need to upgrade Yukong, so that I can run:

Luocha, Yukong, Welt, Sushang
<:TeriSmoke:1061942220409810996>
same...
Its always a Tingyun moment, battle just started and shes already almost at 1/2 hp with 2 Preservation + Geppy LC which increase his own Aggro
We really are twinning, lost 50/50 to Bronya cucking us
Then I hope you get Dan Heng on hard pity guarantee
and then March jumpscare
Instead of IMG, it gave me QUA
I prob bought the wrong ritual items
I somehow got E6 Qingque and E4 Pela but only 1 Yukong
Tet... you forgot me, I also got cucked
Im using Tingyun with Jing Yuan though, she actually pairs better with him than Bronya
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
who do I raise, Bronya or Yukong
With Bronya, idk what to do now
its actually depressing
Heki actually profited from this banner
E0 Yukong and E0 Luocha is my despair rn
130$ for Luocha, I wished it was for E1 cuz of the 20% Atk buff but alright
I might reach around 150$ for just E0 Luocha yea, I got cucked by Bronya too
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
My first Yukong after dropping 115$
You're not even on rate up
And then stop touching the Banners forever until Hua or Kosma Expy
I'll prob whale for Luocha now
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>
I got cucked by Bronya too
<:eek:765359367524188161>
E5 Qingque
I didn't even get a single Yukong
No Yukong, no Luocha
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Fuck my life
If anyone also wants to join and watch
Ima be pulling for Luocha as well
bettter than me
ishoke
better win 50/50 than never
You can quit midfight too
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
they do, its why I got confused once, but I at least look after I do one run
Dear, how… It says Lightning or Imaginary <:kek:809950280258945024> I also got confused b4 but I double check
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
Qingque dupes though... ig I can prob raise her to be a QUA Dps skill bot for me... just never use her Skill so that Sushang can have her Dps remain consistent
Thankfully, I never pulled on Seele banner, so getting Pela or Yukong will be a first for me
Luocha still have the superior 4* on Rate up <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Farming them is dogshit drop rates too
8 Purple Keys for 7.5% Defense is actually Aids
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Ima mald so much getting this Trace so that I can max out JY
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
so it actually just caps at 6/10/10/10
+2 from Eidolon^
NA is 10, Skill, Talent, Ult is 12
NA maxes out faster than Talent and Skill and Ult
yea
I got my 10th one from Standard Warp I just did after Ascending Ting to 70
Just give me Sushang LC instead
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
This ain't it chief, how does I get another one of this from Normal Warp...
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im afraid to get another Clara LC with no Clara
Once I get Yukong, thats another free multi
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I would pull for SW so Sushang be more effective but I need Otto more rn
I got Himeko'ed instead
no, I never got Yanqing
me? or Carv
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Sushang is not strong enough so I might need to build a 3rd dps for my 2nd team
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I still need to max out JY traces, but also get Geppy A6, Tingyun A6, Sushang A6, and then also pre-farm for Luocha A6
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
because double blessing start fucked me over
its always 7
I can never fucking get below 6 Blessings
I can't even reject any of the blessings either
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I hate HSR so much rn, because I was trying to clear SU with 6 Blessings or less, game proceeded to give me 7 Blessings so I don't think I can get the achievement for it now
This is actually depressing lmao
Literally Tingyun moment
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Tingyun moment
Well, every unit work well with Speed

I just mean that Luocha can use both Speed and Atk from Adventure Set really well
CN Players recently been trying out the new Wind Set because it moves their Action forward whenever they Ult, so like every 2-3 turns they basically get a free action almost in a sense

But I forgot who that was with but usually for the Dps
But its wrong set tbh, Speed/Atk set is better since he scale off both stats… while all the Healing one only give +1 Skill Point at the start of battle which is just sad
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
All I need was just Atk, Speed and Effect Resistance
Me trying to farm Adventure set for Luocha
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Same
Tells me in Version Overview we will get new Luocha Companion quest dates but not banner dates and time
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
It proceeds to give me jack shit info, only info about when SW Banner starts and ends
Tried looking on HSR official notices just now
Asked for date and time and it gives me leaks instead like wtf
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Tried googling it
I forgot how bad websites are… half the time they only say the day but never the time
Its either that or a few hours after SW banners end
You can prob just exit and return to wish page and it will auto appear

Gotta double check the exact time though
so like on Wednesday or something
in 2 days and something hours
Its gonna be hell for me since I just realized that ill prob also be building Yukong lmao
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
me forgetting about the PS5 because they were so rare to find any thats in stock
but for me, I would prob prefer Atk%
Its pretty interchangeable
prob Atk, because you'll really just use her for her Follow-up attacks... and shes reliant on other characters (and sometime herself) for breaking enemy shields
Yay
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Always Tingyun moment
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
The deadge will come back to life
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
ah
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
but yea, they basically extended it to when version end
samee
Thank You Carv
<:derpostasis:834561554858770513>
They either extended the Event or it ended already
Idk, I didn't even started on it if it did
Resource Drain is not daijobu
<:Copium:807985860820598834>
well, ig to 70 because I need them for Shieldbreak
my guys can still cope at lvl 60... Dps can go to 80 <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Im close to 60 too... Im so not looking forward to that...
pain
But its still 1 more piece because HSR is going same route as E7, Summoner Wars, and basically any other gacha game with their 4 Slot Gears and 2 Slot Accessories or 6 Slot Runes etc
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Because its 1 less piece I have to farm for
For me, I love and hate that there is no off piece
Heals that Crit
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Ishoke Tet, you can cope that we will get a healer that scale off Cdmg
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
There was actually no need to do that but they did it anyways
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
They really did
Run Remembrance against Cocolia
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
also because this MoC rotation blessing is aids
I want to pull for Luocha already
I need the 10 days to pass faster
<a:pat:717159864891342848>
I cant do anything about it though
My luck is bipolar
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
its like 10 pm and i still havent done dailies
I legit been caping my trailblaze powder rn
been getting lazy
<:Sadge:842131939607183360>
im still 57
don't worry baban, im on the same boat
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I did all of the main story, just waiting for next part, so all I have left is all the new stuff from 1.1 which I haven't started on yet cuz busy busy

SW event ends in like 3 days
oh, thank you
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I haven't gotten the chance to start on it
Anyways, how long does it take to finish the SW Event?
Shush, its still Honkai, lemme have my fun
She's very pretty
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
Wao
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Hes fine
I do occasionally
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
I got to see an AR 55+ Account where their best artifacts were 4*
Isn’t that just the Genshin Experience
doesn't even help you clear MoC faster
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
ew, this Abyss buff is dogshit
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Like unless you are using Sushang to deal dmg to a weakness broken enemy, she’ll deal 0 dmg anyways and her Dmg Proc will be lowered to oblivion
<:PepePopcorn:801534993687511080>
Her E6 came from LC Banner
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Mine is E6, and I still need to give her better Crate/Cdmg
I just got my last 2* for 15 stars because I was grinding Trace/Skill upgrades for my Dps
Even if I didn't whale, I would still had 12* to 13* minimum
<:shut:885303431978430504>
Im waiting for Luocha to improve my team even further... Sushang 40% Crate isn't enough <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>she only average around 4-12k Dmg rn
for me, im probably skipping everything from 1.2 to 1.5+
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
oh wait, thats only if they get banned
<:Sadge:842131939607183360>
What I hate is then when people leave the Server, all their messages got deleted too
Im just assuming Eli is taking a break like how Taihen left the server and took a break before coming back
For me, even if I get Bailu, im still pulling for Luocha because Debuff Cleanse do be nice to have
congrats, you can skip Otto now
you can pause and exit it like how you can exit Ely Realm
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
you also could've just pressed Esc and leave the SU temporarily and then come back to it later at the same spot
FMC + Nat on 1 side and Geppy/M7 on the other side lol
Dont worry Nini, I did the same
because its Danganronpa <:YEP:815000469902065674>
 I hate that they also showed it through the Summer Game Fest <:deadge:975652771082698782> only Luka too, no Kafka or Blade teaser lol
but for Break Effect, there is actually no one that really cares for it much, at least not until we get Kafka or something ig
cuz at least with EM, Anemo Char could be already good
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
tbh, its worse than EM rn
ty
oh, that I didn't know
It buffs DoT dmg from Breaking enemies, it buff how much you delay their turn, and Initial Break Dmg ig
though at least its still decent on supports even for copium purposes since Break Dmg scale off the enemies Hp, so breaking Bosses actually deal more dmg than breaking regular mobs
its why I said its copium <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Asta is also a good Fire Shield breaker so Break Effect won't be too useless on her
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
since you can still basic attack with her and spam her Ult Faster for the Speed Boost
also, Energy is really good for Asta
Chorus is 12% Atk, which as Taihen said, is already diluted by Asta's Attack Talent
56% Break Effect is Copium, but the 8 Energy per hit is really nice for some character though
it gives Energy
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
you can use it for Asta
Btw, Bronya move Action Forward by 100, so Dance Dance Dance moving everyone forward by 24 is super OP
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
Basically everytime you Ult, your Whole Team gets action forward
Infinite, because its also a Drop from Weekly bosses
^^^
for what?
Past and Future is only good on Bronya
Tingyun should have Dance Dance Dance
but for anyone else that doesn't have Bronya, its prob the more useless LC since Dance Dance Dance exist
since you have Bronya, you can
well more like you either build for Ult Dmg or you Build for only Follow-up dmg, which are both equally trash
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Seriousness of Breakfast is also semi worth, but thats because all Euridition LC except for JY's LC are all trash
Im busy multi tasking, im currently on Zoom, Talking to my brother via FaceTime, also grinding my gacha games
nah, shes definitely QUA
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>

<:OMEGALUL:788545079223517184>
So I would assume shes QUA
I don't think we have a QUA Herrscher yet
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
QUA Herrscher
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Definitely QUA, there is yet to be a Seele that isn't QUA
we have assumed leaks but other than that, we know nothing
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I hate Hare's Ult/Burst Mode, she just made a SK Clone to fight for her
Im happy I can save after 1.1... maybe pull for Blade if he has good 4*
it will prob be Veli Veli if we get another Seele

like how we have Bronya and Bronnie basically
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I like Luka, but I don't want to be like Heki and Build Pity just to get Kafka
as for Blade, im debating pulling for him, but for Luka, sadge he's with Kafka so I just want to get him randomly from gacha ig
ishoke Cata, for me, I only need Luocha and I get to skip 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4... basically its all skip for me til Hua/Kosma Expy
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
ah yes, the one thing they prob should've added into Genshin so that people could've done dragonspine event stuff or any event in general and not felt like they were missing a bunch of lore
that was fast
Nini already have SW
play other gacha game like Limbussy Company
nice
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
As Carv said, its Trailblaze Level, not Equilibrium level, basically their usual, if AR level/Captain level is over 5, you get the rewards because you at least played the game through the tutorial
7 Curios within 2 stages
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
The lotto gave me so many Curios lmao
I wished Luocha lasted the entire patch from start to finsih so I can gamba the whole patch for him
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
<:worrysuicide:769040326731235348>
For me, I went preservation, anything else and I get fucked yea, because having no cleanse and Jing Yuan perma CC’ed is yikes
I went to the temple today and so I hope I cleansed all my bad fortune and can get good relics for Jing Yuan and Luocha
I erased Break Effect% from my memory, and they prob decided its not enough
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Those must be all my Break Effect Rope
Congrats
At least its better than my 3 flat roll one
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Give me that shit
It was Tingyun earlier, I forgot why it became Geppy after though
Alright, I changed it back to Jing Yuan
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I thought I did
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Also seeing people post their pulls where they got 3 Jing Yuan in 1 multi
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
I know, im just
Isn't that the Lightcones? so wouldn't it be 75:25 instead? 


though tbh, I would still say 4 5* pulls was more unbelievable than not losing any 50/50, but thats because I only lost 50/50 twice going for C6 Yae <:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
....
he'll work well with SW weakness implant ig
with his Trace, if they have Ice Weakness, he'll also deal another Attack equal to 30% of his Atk
Its only active when his Talent is up, so when he has Soulsteel Buff, he'll get Crate/Cdmg, and his Attack has a 50-60% Chance to proc a follow-up attack that has a 65% Base Chance to Freeze and deal DoT dmg if they get frozen
? Wdym
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
and yea, JP is very into horse racing, add in anime waifu and done, you now have it rich if the game works properly and well
Sounds about right
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I heard its very big in Japan
Is that the Horse Racing Gacha game where the Horses transform into Anime waifu?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
HSR stole my monuh, but unironically, my HSR luck is still better than Genshin's luck
<a:pat:717159864891342848>
But for that, I had saved up a lot too so my whaling didnt cost me too much
<:pepepray:773373711751315466>
I got Yae to C6 in Genshin when she first came out because I said I would
I want E1 Luocha at least because I want the buffs it provides… plus, I realistically only have like 1-2 units left Im actually willing to whale for

Which is just Hua and Kosma expy… if any of those 2 comes out, im probably going to at least get one of them to E6, and S1 Weapon
Anyways… I’ll prob go for Luocha, and depending on how it goes I may or may not whale <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Its dead, but alive
I might go for E1 Luocha or E2 because I don’t need to care about his LC
So 3 JY and 3 LC
Yay, S3 JY LC finally
Yukong Atk and Crate/Cdmg
Asta is Speed/Atk
Tingyun is Atk/Dmg Bonus/Energy
Bronya is Dmg Bonus and Cdmg
We dont have any character that’s just purely 1 type of Buff which is nice ig
All Tingyun can do for him is just 3 Turn Attack Buff and quick Regen for his Ult to get another Abuse Flower stack

Though tbh, that Attack boost is better off on your Dps
Feelsbadman for Echoes of Coffin, you dont even get to see the Coffin in their extended LC wallpaper
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
You sonova REEEEREEEEEE
<@1053015370115588147> I’m trying to speedrun minecraft in a comedic way where instead of achieving the end of the game as fast as possible, the game gets ended as soon as possible such as my character dying right off the start. This would be done with hardcore mode. Please optimize the path for me.
How do I die quickly in Minecraft?
How about dying quickly in Minecraft?
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
<@1053015370115588147> what is the best way to die quickly
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Im finally out of Lc exp
since with all those characters being at S Tier, all they are doing is just inflating the tiers
at least, half of the characters in the S Tier would/should be around like A tier at most
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
Like I would swap Hook and Himeko's placement
Hes solid, but considering they are making a tierlist, Dan Heng shouldn't be at the level where you feel like you must build them kind of Tier <:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462> because in the end, Dps are very replaceable like in Genshin/Honkai depending on the content 

so the supports are the one that carry the game for longevity in teams <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
cant we just pin this
no Chicken =/= no Hua
It has to be Hua
ill most likely max those 2 out immediately if I can
I simp for Hua and Kosma
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I don't, his LC is just too good
and get S3 JY LC
or win it
2 more days til I either lose 75:25
2 more days for me
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
at least you can cope with Break effect
Like Genshin Flat Stats...
posted them all earlier too
Its so cursed, my farming got me 6-8 Break Effect Rope mainstat rn
with only flat rolls
All for a Hp%/Break Effect piece
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>
honestly, just feed your trash Gold Relic as fodders, salvagin Gold Relics is a waste of exp... I got to witness that firsthand... so much wasted exp mats
^^^
my Fire MC has more Defense than your Geppy with only just 2 Gold Relics and 1 Purple Def Relics
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Mainstat difference between a +15 Mainstat vs a +12 Purple Mainstat is insane
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
I have his Signature LC, so thats another 24% Def... oh im not using ER rope, which is why

5* Relic is important... I have like 2.6k Def on Fire Mc with 4* Lightcone and 5* Relics (exception being 1 4* Relic Chestpiece)

5* Defense Relic gives up to 54% Defense btw, so its a lot compared to 4* one
My Lightcone was another factor, tbh, having around 3k Defense is solid enough with Geppy... my Fire MC has like 2.6k Defense rn because I swapped out his Def Globe for Fire Dmg Globe
I just got lucky with Defense Mainstats Relics... I lied, I was not lucky, just cope that I had enough rng to stop getting Break Effects and instead Def Mainstats
<:KekPat:966625000339668993> ishoke
3777 Defense rn
<:KianaDrool:652709420752699403>
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I just got another right now from Cocolia
Speaking of Break Effects
but dogshit everywhere else
good depending on the characters/support
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
It doesn't help that Break effect is like running EM on Geo Characters, utterly useless garbage stat
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
had like 8-9 Break Effects Mainstat in a row
But I erased it from my memory
Break Effects
actually I lied
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
oh, the luck part yea, I usually get bullied and its mostly just HP
and no rolls into Crate except for the +3
the one you saw with 3 flat subs
I just meant use the resin and just forcefully craft one with shit substats like my JY Lightning one
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Craft with Mainstats, we are still getting 2 next patch, or those who are lucky enough, I had like 3-4 ER Rope, 2 were 5* and 2 were 4*
<:despairge:1045736540875280465> I dont even use any QUA characters too, and its not even the right set
Speed Boots and Energy Recovery Rope, since his healing scale off Atk, Atk% Chest and Atk% Globe is still good enough... since Boots and ER Rope can still have Atk% subs
We can always give him Energy Rope and Energy set
70% CC Immunity with more Immunity towards Debuffs is godsend
but yea, once Luocha comes out, im prob giving him his 4* LC, Perfect Timing that gives him more Effect Resistance and Healing Bonus scaling off Effect Res
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
30% Effect Resistance yet get frozen 9/10 times compared to Gepard with only 4% Effect Resist
My Tingyun is doing much better now
10/10 tank
18% Hp and Def subs
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
aint my JY Relics so beautiful
<:kek:809950280258945024>
try beating this for shitty artifacts
like the game is ready to bully me
and another with Hp%, but Crit subs but on set
not on set
its so depressing
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I got a Belo piece that was Atk%, with Crate, Cdmg, and Break Effect
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
my friend's, they only have Blues on their Seele
stop rubbing salt on me
At least they have crits
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Me when I picked Elation and they gave me only Preservation... picked Preservation and got Elation and Destruction
? Adult yea, but I don't think like a mom for me
I use Nini's Bronya everyday and occasionally Baban's and my friend' Seele
Oooooo congrats
Fmc is cool
for Mc, I like his clothes more, face is generic but clothes are good some im fine
anyways, im just waiting for Hua and Kosma expy after I get Luocha and maybe Blade if im lucky
The most beautiful
<:OttoDerpNggt:996935503129608282>
<:OttoBestGril:585957690858012674>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
forgot if I saw Xueyi in LC
I know streamer lady is LC
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Probably
Heres mine
I like male mc, its the same as the pfp they gave us and its super cute
 most likely this one, same as wish tracker
<:pepekekhands:803405741561479238>
I should use that but it makes me despair so i ignore it
anyways, back to HSR, how's everyone's farming went
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
I occasionally like to fight on YT, but thats because I get bored and someone started it first like this one
I can't say anything to them because I already had an argument with them earlier so theres no point here
<:kek:809950280258945024>
Average Gamer only have around 60 min to play daily... calls them lazy because Daily Comms takes up 1/6th of that time
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I really wanted to say something about this but realized it was the same guy too
worse part is that I see him is so many of the YT comment trying to defend it using the same argument when there is no point
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
I stopped after that since theres no point anymore
The last part is true yes, but who said I never explored in Genshin in the first place, and the original comment wasn't even about exploration but that the game feels lifeless
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I forgot how much of a lost cause people are
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
just farming Tingyun's Relics rn, and gathering Relic exp
I'll prob reach T60 by the time Luocha arrives which should help me farm his and Yukong's mats quicker ig
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Hope and curse/pray that I wont lose the 75:25 3 times in a row pls when that day comes
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
4 more days and I can get S3 JY LC
wao
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
trash day was yesterday
me forgot to take out trash
What should I do
I rather mald over Hp% than getting Break Effects
I just kinda removed it from my memory of its existence
I have so many Break Effects one
^^^
you can check on the Relic Synthesis iirc <:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462> but iirc:

ER, Atk, Def, Hp are the main one I remember
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
so now my Green Bin is filled with all the thing the Gardener cleaned up
I forgot to take out the Trash on Thursday
<:PensiveTrash:758695180323913778>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
AHHHHHHHHHH
...
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993> me hoping to fail it whenever I run destruction because I want to be low hp for that... but yea, im surprised it didn't happen more often for you

it happened to me like at least 1/3rd of the time of first hit
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
its more like stop pulling Belobog Challenge, but with every stat that isn't Defense Mainstat... so its never actually a good Belo Planet at all
Kekw
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
honestly, just clear it with no death for the 1* stuff
MC is exception since I always want to max them out first
Im just kinda keeping everyone at 60 except for my Dps like Jing Yuan and soon Sushang
Dont worry, same kinda
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
I know, a maxed Eidolon Qingque belonging to a whale once one shotted Memory of Chaos Boss
I unironically might have to build another AoE dps like Himeko cuz of this
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im currently hard cucked by the Bronya stage, cuz 3 waves is too much, my Natasha can’t even heal fast enough and Sushang dmg isn’t strong enough to break through all of them
Ye
ew, thank god they changed it to just speed buff <:despairge:1045736540875280465>
yea, definitely
If I don't get it, then ill go for Luocha guarantee ig
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
thats all I need
I want at least S3
I hope I win it
Who wanna bet if I’ll lost 3 in a row
Lost to Yanqing and Clara LC
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
So far, I lost 2, third one coming up soon
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
im about to lose my next 75:25 next week too
then theres me who somehow lost every single 75:25 on LC banner
prob like that more than 24% Atk, 3 Energy (up to 9) when attacking enemies, and 1 Turn Speed Buff on Ult
70% CC Res + Effect Resistance
<:kek:809950280258945024>
his 4* LC that increases his Effect Resistance and give Bonus Healing Scaling off Effect Resistance seems better tbh, makes it so that hes extra immune to CC
LC is more universal yea... though im not gonna really get Luocha LC, im just debating on it because I can't really say its good or bad <:deadge:975652771082698782> just meh imo
and then save for S5 on next rerun
I want to get S3 Jing Yuan at least b4 his patch goes away
for me, its E1 Luocha (maybe LC) and then im not spending til Hua (excluding BP and Monthly)
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
so KR and JP also got delayed
oh, its not just EN, basically every livestream except CN/Bilibili were delayed
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Always active, similar to his 70% CC resistance
I know, but that just means he wont get one shot
Yea iirc, anyways, nighty night, I need rest
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Cuz Atk scaling healer
His weakness is that hes squishy
Luocha is cleanse and buff wipe, also AoE heal
Yea
Cleanse is important
Yea, I misread it b4, but it says After Version update to 7/16, so 1.1 to 7/16
Tet can though, <:huh:966619839307321394>
Start of patch going to 7/18
Log in event
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
We get a free multi for him
Phase 2
NA stream being on time? That takes a miracle
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
It got delayed by like 3 houra
Like with Genshin, delayed to oblivion each patch
Anyways, night, ima go back to sleep
NA codes are delayed as per usual
CN codes iirc
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
The male banner has the better 4* once again
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Pela, Yukong, Qingque, Luocha

Dan He, Asta, Serval, SW
Nope
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Honestly, I thought Yukong was gonna be on Luocha banner at first then people said it will be on SW, and hold to behold, its on Luocha like the initial one
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Thank you ~~Shud~~ Prom
Ye, it goes til July, so into 1.2 ig
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
CN code only, NA we have to wait cuz stream delayed
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Oh, I might’ve been influenced by the doomposting
Didnt read “version update”
Yea, I misread it to “after version ends”, its like 3-4 am when I woke up for the stream
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I hate the vague description because i woke up early and my brain comprehension is gone 

Cuz they talked about Yukong for 1.2 and that’s confusing me between the two versions
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I keep on forgetting if that meant 1.1 or 1.2
It says “After version updates ends”
The main one is the SW LC and Relic Mainstat Craft
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
I was fine with not getting Yukong on Luocha, since we get her for free the patch after but game said it has other plans ig
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Im pulling for Luocha, but skipping everything else yea, I feel bad for my friend tbh, he wanted Yukong + SW
It says end of version to 7/18 so it starts after 1.1 <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
So 2 events
One of the event give SW 4* LC, and then another that gives Custom Resin for Mainstat crafting yes
Ends on 7/18
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Wao
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Not even 10 min into watching stream
8 ads in a row
Twitch ads are Aids as always
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
They said it on stream so yes, think of it like Genshin alternating between free characters and free weapon/lightcone
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Yukong on Luocha banner
Ew
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I swapped to Fob/Tenha since he can translate for me
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Yea, not by like a short time but like 3 hours
1 for Code commentary and 1 for Bilibili
I had 2 tabs open XD
Adges, twitch ads are Aids ngl, good thing Carv has the Bilibili link up ty
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Other than the animated short for the model stuff XD
Lol
They revealed Jingliu so early
Just lurking on stream
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Im watching Code watching the stream lol
just NA cucked
not bilibili yea
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Somehow it didn’t change much though (for me) also I thought Livestream was like 16 min ago but it was actually in 13 min
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
At least when fighting 75:25 I dont have to worry about the 50/50 that comes after it
True
Still hate that their monetization is the same as Genshin <:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I knew it was gonna happen, it was just a matter of how much pain
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I lost to a 2nd Clara LC and a Yanqing LC, in about a week, I’ll find out if I will get JY 3rd LC or if ill fail the 75:25
Ishoke, I knew what I was going into
0% rn
anyone wanna bet if ill lose my 75:25?
anyways time for me to sleep
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
LC luck is good but I didn't need the 4* LC luck but I needed the 5* one
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
This isn't it chief
fml
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
1k away from a multi
600 Jades
<:kek:809950280258945024>
the saddest part is the one event for this entire patch is a micro event... it goes til the end of the version, but theres only like 5 stages
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
iirc, that was from the older Beta, thought idk if its considered leaks or not, ill spoiler box it then
E1 Buff Atk for the team

E2 gives more healing or shield (when under 50% or over 50% hp respectively)

E6 reduces their Resistance
also, his Eidolon are better than expected, other than E4 being kinda trash, the rest are good
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
soon, we'll have a healer scaling off Defense
Because Mihole wanted him to, buts fine <:deadge:975652771082698782>
and proc his Passive
^^^
nah, Buff Wipe on Ult

Dmg multipliers are ok
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
Atk yes, because Luocha healing scale off Atk
So he regen 3 energy, 9 with Ult, and increase Atk + Speed Buff on Ult... but Speed buff is only 1 turn
Im whaling for Luocha regardless, ig the real comparison is whether Luocha LC has more value than JY LC dupes
Yep
Im neutral about the hair but his face is cute
Yea
The only 2 I want rn is JY and Luocha, the only one else is Hua and Luka but Hua is still MIA and Luka is 4*
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I was just debating if I should go for S3-S5 LC, ill most likely whale for E1 Luocha + S1 LC later, or just E1 Luocha but yea... just contemplating my life choices...
because I was debating buying this for Luocha instead when he arrives, I bought the 99$ one for E2 S1 Jing Yuan
really only 2 multi, 4 with double bonus... maybe around 3 multi with remaining bonus after
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Im pretty sure they increase the price in other regions now to make it match with inflation, Im just basically only talking about the amount we get excluding any bonus gems
50$ is only like 2 multi, 4 with first time
for me, its sad that it costs like almosr 3$ for 1 single pull <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I just want something useable and then ill start farming up Golden Calyxes
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
rn, im farming some artis for Tingyun, not even farming for like perfect subs either, I just need like 1 Atk% on set Chestpiece for her
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I just want JY LC because its the only LC that makes my Crit Ratio not look like trash
my friend's JY because hes also a whale
I know, I should be saving for Luocha + LC, but JY LC is just so juicy and good <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
rng matters but I still like seeing the approximation
E2 JY for me costed like 99$ so, im happy there, just wondering how much it costed for S5 <:deadge:975652771082698782> I might go for S3 tbh, since im guaranteed rn for S2 if I decided to pull for more
S5
So how much did it cost you? <:deadge:975652771082698782> the approximation also works
He can never imprison the last character
^^^
I wanted this Kafka instead
Already have Sushang afterall for my 7 Sword Collection
While for female, all I want is Hua
I have Geppy so im just waiting on Luocha and Luka next and im done collecting all the dudes I want
Just missing Destruction now that I have Jing Yuan and Sushang
I dont need a Nihility Dps, already got Welt for that
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Tbh, im neutral for Blade and Kafka, Luka is cute, but for me, if im going to ruin my pity, I rather lose it to Blade since I dont have a DoT team for Kafka
They gonna make him in 1 banner
We know how Mihole is
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Plus, I have like 2 Clara LC, I just want Blade so that I can use Clara LC on him
I prefer HI3 Kafka more
I dont want Kafka
I want it to be Blade
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
1.2? But with Blade or Kafka
I just want to see the actual in game model, also forgot which version hes gonna be in…
Logic checks out
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
There is no such bad luka except for the bad one
Not surprised considering his LC is also Nihility <a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
<:TeriSmoke:1061942220409810996>
nighty night, sweet dream <a:pat:717159864891342848>
oh, its Aether Gaze, I saw Gigguk playing this the other day, it seems pretty fun, im not gonna play it though
its only every hour, not too bad compared to texting every 5 min or less
<a:gf_pat:1077167310219006012> Sushang can also proc extra Attacks (up to 3 extra hits with her Ult), when she attacks a weakness broken enemies, it goes from like 33% chance to 100% to proc the effects... she also gets a speed boost

So basically shes a Hunt Character Ideal for specifically to beat up weakness broken enemies
I love you too
Deals more Dmg against Weakness Broken enemies and with E1, she can recover 1 Skill point after using her Skill on weakness broken enemies
yea, but 3 and 5 is always good anyways
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
E4 is silly like the image
E2 is eh...
I hate this E4
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Sushang best Eidolon is just E1
though ngl, other than Sushan E1, then the usual Talent one, E2, 4 and 6 is kinda trash
yea, cuz I went for JY
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
This is my team so far
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
but those guys don't have AoE CC though, bounce and ST CC doesn't care whether Bailu is in the corner or next to Fmc anyways <:KekPat:966625000339668993> Bailu should be your 2nd most tanky char after Fmc anyways
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I don't remember any enemies that can Splash CC characters, only AoE 4 target random one like Cocolia and the Ice Giant
simple, my 1 main team + 2nd team where though its not as invested, its still viable
I have 2 teams, just need to finshed building some relics and Lc + lvls
only good thing about it is Crate, Atk is kinda <:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Danheng LC is like 24% Atk and then Crate when there are 2 or less enemies, its pretty copium
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
honestly, Hunt LC tend to give decent amount of Crate so you just give them Cdmg Chestpiece unless your Hunt LC gives you like Cdmg or Dmg Bonus instead
yea lol <:KekPat:966625000339668993> in reality, it was like Geppy and Jing Yuan
Didn't even bother to roll into Crate once
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
This is so depressing
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
oh lmao
im now gonna run Cocolia
5 was easy but I used wrong blessing/resonance
to me, Difficulty 2 for W3 and 4 are pretty easy
<:derp:724856219600289853>
how?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Rude...
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I had to redo that run because I went Elation and not Preservation/Abundance so I just kept getting Dominated and died
~~totally not a scam screenshot~~ <:YEP:815000469902065674> <:Kappa:524820851011616768>
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
tempting me with that 60% Cdmg, 30% Skill/Ult Dmg Bonus and 80% Lightning Lord Dmg Bonus
<@370438895965306882> Gres Gres, you maxed Superimposed his LC? <:huh:966619839307321394>
Bald e
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Or just gamba with Relics as 45
43 is still too little for you to care, Ascensions and Lightcone + Talents til lvl 4 is more important tbh
You’ll only need to start caring at 45 min and 50 max
Before Dawn in #1 slot
<:woggers:1002597195645714582>
Oh nvm, they did update it
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
They are kind slow to updating new LC though, cuz Jing Yuan LC should be the BiS 5* LC for all Euridition characters rn tbh
Yep
Accurate enough to be credible, but wont be good enough for min maxer, since its really just a build guide and not any tier lists or stat builder
Its the “official” one pinged on HSR Official server, so its at least somewhat credible
and then just get Jingyuan and Mc to 70
ill prob get there by today
almost 50
 probably because the final version just have less of the horny content <:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462> though the game itself is as horny as ever <a:kekah:844467095227990028> GGZ is just horny depression
This was just a random one someone made <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
thats the meme version, whats correct was:

Kiana starting weapon was a bat and a pistol and shotgun, she did indeed started fighting her way through a highschool full of only girls turned zombie, last boss was Delinquent Mei who she defeats (meme version is that Mei got defeated by stepping of Doodoo and slipped <:wheeze:833318723565649950> )
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
its nice for bait
when you clear the last boss, you can just switch your team to lvl 20 Herta and leave
Rip lol
Im happy for my Jing Yuan since Dance Dance Lc and E1 Ting can buff his speed anyways
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Resurgence essentially acts as if Seele casted another Ultimate, so buff timer like Bronya which only last 1 turn can get extended to like 3 turn <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Wao
Seggs?
Easier way to explain it: Activating Resurgence on Seele is equivalent to casting your Ult, you’ll get a turn instantly to cast the Ult, but it won’t consume any of your buffs duration
it counts as her getting a turn, but it doesn't count her ending her turn, I have to test it again later though to double check, my internet died on me <:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Resurgence doesn't count as a turn iirc, its why Seele is considered so broken because she gets to keep most of her buffs
place that in spoiler box baka, and yea, I just read it because I had to double check it
Yukong is lose stack per attack iirc
makes sense, for me, I have Tingyun + Dance Dance Dance, so rotation his skills for Lightning Lord isn't that hard for me even without Speed Boots, even without Speed Boots, only real problem for me is the Ai making Jing Yuan use a basic Attack <:YEP:815000469902065674>
Thanks for reminding me to update my game too
n o
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
E1 does increase his follow-up dmg by essentially 50% in AoE situation
his E2 is kinda useless though
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
? He's good though
I don't trust myself either but it doesn't make you much better off
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Heki, you attempted to build pity and got Seele... you honestly think I trust your decisions making skills
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Heki gonna use it all for bad decisions
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
ngl, I didn't even know what weed was, my classmates were passing them around, I was able to smell how disgusting it was and didn't even know what the smell was til way later
congrats, now have it roll only Effect Res and you're good
Death by snu snu
<:eek:765359367524188161>
drugs
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
I would've used it and make bad decision such as whale fund
good luck
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
You said your family doesn't know about it
unlike Genshin where you can check the exact artis rolls
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
even for friend list, you can only see the stats but not the artis stats
you cant, this was a random one I saw, not someone I know
Whales do be going crazy
<:huh:966619839307321394>
my friend arrived after I whaled and blessed me with his luck
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
I lost 50/50 late pity and even guarantee was late pity
it was 100% rigged for Character banner
I took such a big L until I whaled
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
he did
well, prob still same amount but at least not as much compared to if he was next banner
good luck, im happy Luocha is Part 2, lets me save up for him longer XD and I can whale less for him
so now im saving for Luocha LC since im guaranteed it now
I tried doing 3 more multi after for more JY LC, but game told thats enough
Btw, thats my 2nd Clara LC
<:huh:966619839307321394>
After I whaled
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Essentially b4 I whaled, I got cucked by Himeko
100$
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Then go for Luocha S1 LC and E0 Luocha
Guess I have to be happy with E2 JY and S1 LC
Sadge, I did 3 multi after getting Clara LC, game told me to stop and only gave me 4*
true, the wind one is def the most annoying Centuar though
even some of the Goldfishes are annoying with their AoE, thankfully, those guys does no dmg though their debuff are annoying so I would fight those guys anytime
both of them are annoying ngl
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Fire one too does AoE random Fire hits
yea
Im not talking about the 3 target AoE, cuz yea, with those, it won't be a problem if YQ is in the corner away from the Tank, it is against the Ice Guy that does the AoE 4 target Ice Hits or the Maidens that does AoE random Lightning Strick or Imprison Hits <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> cuz those ignores Aggro completely
like that one bitch that spams AoE freeze every turn
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Oh, was just talking about fmc taunt and having high base aggro helps lower the chances of YQ getting hit and taking dmg, which was why I said the issue would be random hits and AoE
but thankfully its not hits, just taking dmg cancels it
yea, having Fmc solves it, combine it with Aggro LC and its even better, only issue is AoE Attacks and Random Attacks
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
it was super copium using Sushang on Break set
I think im on stage 4 here rn, still need to build up Sushang
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Yea... thats quite something
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
so rigged
2 Clara LC but no Clara
Mine
each time Shield going for 1.7-2k Shield
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Honestly, Geppy ER is pretty cheap <:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462> If I wanted to, I could've made it to where he Ulted essentially every other turn
his Ult is only source of Shield but its AoE, last 3 turns and only cost 100 Energy <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yep
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I have Geppy and M7 together ngl, never take dmg
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Tbh, I don't even use my Nat for cleansing
you'll still need 2 healers for MoC anyways
Luocha
my Roster rn, Asta deadge

My team for Abyss is now:

Geppy, M7, Sushang, Welt

Fire Mc, Jing Yuan, Tingyun, Natasha
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
making Break Effects even worse now
I also learned that Break Effects only Buff the DoT dmg from Breaking Enemies weakness, so DoT from other skills wont get buffed by it
yes
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Its basically, if your unit is same Element as the user of the LC, they get Dmg Bonus, not that Asta gets it
it is
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
to clear most content that isn't scaling off BS mobs for underleveled gears
and do basic math
I love for most gacha games, and for HSR, you just have to learn how to read
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
L
MoC is too depressing with shitty relics
I have 6 lvl 60 and 2 level 50-60... wait, maybe a bit more than that, but enough for 2 teams, my only issues is Relics exp

I need better Relics so that my Sushang can do more dmg, same with Welt
I taking a mini break to build 4p for Welt and Sushang... and then go back to farming Jing Yuan and Geppy/Fire MC/March 7th
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Not like we have much resources anyways
yea, since Ult is mainly for extending the DoT
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
I gave up on Lightning Dmg %, and just crafted the Mainstat for it using my BP mats
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
when it doesn't move
its so cursed
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Geppy might reach around 3.6-3.8k Defense at this rate
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
farming Relic exp is pain
If you quit after you start, you have to clear up to an Elite or else you'll start the run Curio-less
it happens a lot for me too
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
its normal yes, you have to kill at least an Elite to unlock Trailblaze Blessing
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
so ig its like Elemental Reactions in Genshin, can't crit
ty, I knew it scale off Break Effect, Atk, and Dmg Bonus, didn't know if it can crit or not
ah, alright <:deadge:975652771082698782>
DoTs crit in this game right? Then ill say crit
LC >>>>> Characters
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
compared to Jing Yuan banner, 78 for Himeko, 79 for Jing Yuan
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
45 pulls for all 3
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
If not, it took me 40 Warps for Yanqing LC, JY LC, and Clara LC
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
which was why the Total Warp was at 60
<:Sadge:842131939607183360>
game told me to stop abusing my LC luck, so the next 2 multi I did were only 4*
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
2 Clara LC kinda
Like even when I lose the 75:25, this is still good... kinda
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
plus, my LC luck been better than my character one too
his LC is just too good
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Im gonna lose all of mine either for pulling for Dupe JY LC or for Luocha LC
AHHHHHH
Still have yet to fully build Sushang nor Fire Mc rn, even dont have enough for Tingyun and etc
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Been using my refreshes too
Ishoke Nini, im so deprived of resources rn
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
LC Luck >>>>> Character Luck but I somehow keep losing 75:25
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
Idk that one, I just know the main one lol
so unreleased Characters
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
Fu Xuan, is Preservation QUA
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
only issue is that if you have another Element like Fire, she might give the Fire Weakness to an enemy that already has Fire weakness
Random Atk, Def, Speed Debuff

Random Weakness Debuff based on Random Teammate (so with full QUA team, means QUA Weakness)
Im pulling for Luocha and LC... since I got Clara LC so im not guaranteed his LC...

iirc, Luocha LC is Atk, Speed Buff, Energy
Yukong is with SW iirc, and Luocha is solo
SW, Luocha, then Kafka and Blade yes
I mean Luocha
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
Guess im guaranteed Otto's LC next patch
<:TeriStonks:1009416806898868254>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yay, I got my Geppy LC
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
1 is free
its only 5 LC though
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
my LC luck is just that good
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
it was indeed a sign
at least its more useful than Himeko's LC
ishoke, its still 24% Atk, 8% Healing, and 24% Dmg Bonus when hit so its fine
This is my 2nd Clara LC
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I dont even have Clara...
...
Stage 2 I think
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
yet crafting them for JY is also copium... yet for any other set that isn't Geppy/JY, its decent subs wtf
The game won't stop giving me Hp% pieces from farming Relics
Game heard what I was talking about for Sushang and gave me this
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Why can't this be Lightning for Jing Yuan
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
this is so depressing
same with Atk%
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
It didn't even bother to go into Crate once
the rest are so copium
only his boots is good
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
apparently, only when you look at your char will LC effect show, but looking through friend's list, LC stats wont show (outside Base stats)
the Cdmg is from his Light Cone
109 Speed
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Shush it Gres, look how shit my JY is
I don't have Bronya either, so I also use Ting, shes way better tbh, since she can refresh his Ult which cost 130, so its super useful
cuz my JY is slow asf
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
its also why I use Baban's Bronya and not Nini
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Her Ult is 2 turns which is nice, but for Skill, she has to be slower or else it be useless for JY
So the most Bronya can do for him is let him have another turn to stack Lightning Lord <:despairge:1045736540875280465> but that also increase the SP cost
Jing Yuan's own dmg is ok compared to his Stand
yes so that she can give him a 2nd turn for Skill... her main issue is that the only buff relevant to Jing Yuan is her Ult... cuz her Skill buff only last 1 turn, which isn't long enough for Lightning Lord
game doesn't show LC Stat buff either, since this is supposed to be 86% Cdmg and not base 50% with JY LC
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Cuz I know we can see their stats obv and their LC and the Relics they used, but I was talking about the Relic Stats
Does it let me see the stats on the relics?
Don't think we can look at character Relic stats
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
honestly, I would keep any Crate/Cdmg Chestpiece
^^^
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I need a Crate one that has actual useful subs
Honestly, for the achievement, I just said fuck it, ima go Preservation and take my time killing Cocolia while ignoring Bronya and the Icicles <:KekPat:966625000339668993> since the Reflection Dmg from Quake cannot kill Bronya... (unless you decide to take the AoE Quake buff which would ruin that) ... and Preservation will keep my whole team essentially unkillable with Geppard
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Break Set
My sushang is so copium rn
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Dont worry Baban, ill use your Bronya, shes slower than my Jing so I can use her skill to let him stack his buff faster
lol
I have to build Sushang + Relics + LC
And then I also have to raise Tingyun's Relics... and then Clara LC for Blade if I ever feel like pulling for him
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
I’ll have my Finals in like 40 min so as a gift, ill show you my friends account after they spent only 100$ on HSR
so many people gonna be using Jing Yuan support to flex that they got him lol
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Then late pity Jing Yuan
Late pity Himeko
Yea, I got trolled by Himeko too
Taihen can attest to that
So steal their luck not mine less you want the hard pity luck
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Its thanks to them I got 2 Jing in 1 multi
Oh, its not my luck, my actual luck with Jing Yuan was the 2 late pity you saw

Once my friend who I invited to the server appeared, my luck immediately improved
Like I say, my LC luck is 100x better than my Character luck
Himeko was when I failed 50/50
ill show mine in a bit once i get it set up then
ty
which site did you use for that?
I think I whale 99$ <:deadge:975652771082698782> and only after whaling my luck went up
nice nice, how much did you whale?
<@370438895965306882> How was your pulls for Jingyuan btw? how much you whale?
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
I have so many LC to raise now and it aint it chief…

Lets see my lists:

Build Tingyun Relics
Build Sushang lvl + relics
Build Yanqing LC
Build Clara LC
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
Close to that Geppy LC
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
One of my friend got E6 Tingyun
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I don't have Clara though
ishoke
But this one was close to pity anyways
From Standard Banner
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Preservation is ok, I like it but thats cuz Im using Fire Mc and Geppy, its useless because tank dont need to be tankier but I like it
Hunt or Preservation, Destruction sucks
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
So I had better gotten something out of it
I paid 99$ for him
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Building Pity
E6 Sushang
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
wtf
My LC luck 100x better than my character banner luck
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
The game knew I wanted a Euridition char, but it decided to give me the wrong one
got cucked
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Wrong Euridition
FUCK
only good multi so far
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
My LC luck is so strong even in Char banner
first multi was March lol
this is not gonna end well for me
I'll stream mine then
Are you not streaming it Tet?
I'll be streaming it, ima invite one of my friend here to watch it too
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Totally normal person
Ishoke, just a sadist
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
wao
<:kek:809950280258945024>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
its ok, I bottom so ill take pleasure from that regardless <:run:1065680602168299530>
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
you should take pleasure in my suffering
so I'll have a worse day than you
I'll help you feel better, I have a Final for my MIS class tomorrow where I have less than a day to learn all the things from the class I haven't been to for over a month
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Them sailor moon March
lol
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
that was so sick hentai, but back then, I was the kind that will watch everything to the end no matter how shit it is
also Euphoria
such as all the bad ends routes in Hentai games and Yaoi games
I was like 10 when I learned about Yaoi from YT, along with all the other degenerate shit, how tf did he not learn anything
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
did you also got one trying to explain to your friend sex position?
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>
I blame Finals for this
Also, ima go do my Honkai Abyss...
I would have one too

<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
<:eek:765359367524188161> what kind of sane and normal BDSM test results... I feel more afraid of them than I do with the one that have the kinky results
L Bank
...
<:huh:966619839307321394>
totally normal
The real horror
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
Basically for all the playable characters, rape is avoidable unless you get all the bad ends or bad routes
Btw, these are some of the tags, also, you can also have them cuck your mc too and the same result will also happen, but you'll kill them and fuck them instead <:YEP:815000469902065674> its unironically a very complete and good game with multiple routes and replayability... Even a Harem ending for the girls and a reverse harem with the 2 boys
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
if you have the girls on your team, you'll be dealing with tentacle monsters for game over events... for the boys, well, you get a crazy ghost lady that rape you as well before stabbing you through your guts and killing you or the other boys
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
The place they are at essentially make them horny but also make them go insane
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
part of the horror... essentially, in each resting point/save spot, you pick 1 person out of 3 (yourself, and 2 others) to keep watch while the other sleep/rest... there are other events too but this is the main one 

the 2 resting gets more intimacy with each other (which at some point they will prob have sex with each other)... btw, its 3 males and 3 female (which each one have a crush on each other), MC you play as will always be Male

So you can essentially cuck each other too <:run:1065680602168299530> fun fact, if they find out you cuck them, they will most likely kill you and rape you... well, actually, if you go insane or they go insane, the same thing will happen regardles

best thing about the game is that you can decide if you want to run on Yaoi or off, if you have it off, it will just be best friend/bros stuff but if its on, it turns to seggs
combat is iffy since its pretty retro but everything else is good
 ngl, this was prob one of the only Horror Gay/Straight/Yuri/NTR game ive played and actually liked a lot <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I mean Gocho
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Love Gacha
it doesn't matter, Lightning Lord has 60 Base Speed and 3 Base Hits

When Jing uses Skill/Ult, Lightning lord gets 2-3 more Hits and 20-30 Speed, if he gets 6 Stacks (which isnt that hard, just 2 skills or 1 Ult), he gets more Cdmg
dont worry, I do both
noice <a:Jibrildrool:1065707312263733349>
Separate Enity, counts as Follow-up Dmg and have its own Speed
me, too bad I also prefer good horror gayge
yea, pretty much just Lightning Lord starts off Slow, then whenever Jingyuan uses Skill/Ult, his Stand gets an extra ORA ORA attack and gets to do ORA ORA faster
Lets hope I get mine too and not … nvm, dont wanna jinx myself
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>

<@1053015370115588147> Ludwig himself had stated on TrashTaste that he could nut and cum 20 times in a single day, does that make him a degenerate person?

And nighty night
I wanted to watch everyone’s pulls too, but regardless, gl
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Its 2 Am, I have to sleep
Pom Pom to me is like this Rabbit, there for being cute and cuddly… anything else that turns Pom Pom into that makes me want to distort and lose hope in my already nonexistent hope in people
I agree with what everyone else is saying, No, and I would like to cleanse my eyes
you'll either see strimmer luck or strimmer curse
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
btw, when I pull for Jing, lemme add one or a few of my friend to the server to watch my suffering
I suffer
<:SadBb:552684268921290772>
Lucky
how much longer til Jing's Banner on NA?
and higher dmg than her basic attack... shes very skill point free, basically like fmc and nat where they just spam basic til otherwise needed
kinda yes, all it really does is give her more energy for Ult
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
aster dont have Ting yet afterall, neither do I
then again, not like I pulled for Pela too, her Def Shred will be useful, same for buff wipe depending on the mobs
also, which Cocolia are you talking about, if its Weekly one, yea, her P2 doesn't spawn Spikes, but SU Cocolia summons her for all Phases, though even then, ill prob just use Asta for Speed buff and break
Speed boost and Shield break isnt bad even without full fire team tbh, though ig if you want to make use of her A4, full fire would be nice
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
im just talking about shield break too though
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
unless its against Cocolia or Fire Weakness boss cuz her shieldbreak OP
Like we have normal one, and then the degen version
<:milk_is_cum:1108015036544323635>
I just occasionally see GGZ being Degen like this...
smack you with the bonk hammer
If they did, I would've banned you instead
I know bits and pieces
I'll say this know, I don't know much, its a lot more vague since I don't really keep up with GGZ lore anymore after so many things happen... the story gets so convoluted like with Fate <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:kek:809950280258945024>
...
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
oh
I just saw it... milk is wao <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
its cursed, I love it
yea, but that was like a really old version of God Kiana, this was really... iirc, this Kiana was when Cocolia killed Sieg and caused Kiana to let Sirin take over her body and ended the world, resetting it... 

but then the Houraji Kyoshu stuff happened after which was almost like a fever dream <:KEK:1024468566835204137> god, its been so long, Carv would know more accurate info than me tbh
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
but that changed afterward
so God Kiana again lol
rather than Finality, it was just the Herrscher of the End
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
We did actually fought WoH as an actual Boss
The timeline for GGZ is so convoluted ngl, but there was a Finality thing, but I don't think it was really time like Hi3
I would say yes kinda
oh sorry, she was sent to kill Welt
even made a clone of Cocolia's real Daughter who died back during the Honkai Outbreak and sent her to to assassin Cocolia iirc, or something similar to that
He essentially also created a lot of Pseudo Herrschers
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
He worse than Hi3 Otto <:YEP:815000469902065674> as in more of a villain than Hi3 Otto
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:kek:809950280258945024>
my only 2 useable pieces were Glove and Helm cuz they were flat stats
most of mine is always HP or Atk
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
ngl, at my luck, ill take any mainstat that Jing can actually use
Break Effect got nerfed quite a lot too so it do be kinda sadge
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Oh, its 12 pm, I forgot im supposed to eat food
Yea, sometime it gets bad anougj where once I had lunch at 4-5 pm and then dinner 2-3 hours after (or just skip it all together)
<:Sleepy_FuHua:818508203447943179>
<:tired_uhm:988714164144967700>
I like that we get 90 Xtal with Monthly Card too
If I get BP, thats another 4 pulls + 3 pulls gemwise
I have 220 Pulls for Jing Yuan, well, 139 Pulls, but I'll get around 81 more pulls if I <a:Whale:557787005959012352>
in some cases, I just have lunch and skip dinner altogether
at that point, my breakfast is actually lunch
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I legit have breakfast at 1-2 pm and dinner at like 9 pm
Finals week made me forget the existence called eating
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
dont worry, yesterday I forgot to eat lunch and dinner, the only thing I had for breakfast was like Boba, same for Dinner
Worse that is that the next day, I have my MIS Final in class
same
you can cope on LC
at least just raise their levels and Relics
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
thats Fire MC for mono Fire team
I prefer MC cuz you have to use them for Cocolia Boss Fight, and presumely every fight where you unlock MC new form
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
trying to run SU with destruction sucked ass ngl, not cuz its bad but because I dont get any of the actual buffs
Even though ill be replacing him on Wednesday for Jing Yuan
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Im using Arlan for fun
<:run:1065680602168299530>
good luck there then, can't help you much for that
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
oh...
even if its just levels
I thought you would have MC built at least
<:huh:966619839307321394>
who do you have built then
Phys Mc or Dan Heng, whoever you have built
you can still run something like:

M7/Tank, Nat, Asta, Dps
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
same day as Limbus Company's Maint
oh, Wednesday
so I havent been able to get on and check
I was doing my Finals
How many days left?
Preservation = Thick Skinned
Destruction = Masochism 
Remembrance/Hunt = Perma Freeze/Its my Turn
Turtle Tactics
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
go Preservation and go pew pew **EXPLOSION**
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>

and now this happened
Carv is the typewriter, always sane <:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947> dunno how they can even handle us but then again, we were pretty sane or horny for the one posting HoS Thighs back then during the WFP Arc
? lol
I am not one of them, the most sane is Carv and Aoi tbh
only a few people here are actually sane
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
You know we are immune to that Heki, it doesn't work against us
Kinky
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
I just want something nice
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
it doesn't matter to me
Yes skins, at least I want good skins <:despairge:1045736540875280465> I dont want it to be like 1 years for 2 skins that does jack shit while costing 20$ USD when I can spend that amount for a Honkek skin that does even more than that
which language? CN? JP?
I bled like 190 pulls for this child, I love this Art + MV outfit so much <:run:1065680602168299530> I need them Skins in HSR already, what are you bets on HSR Skin being way better than Genshin's
<:Worrywhatever:964345643315384350>

Hai Taihen
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Im not gonna build Hook
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im already wasting mine building Arlan and replacing him not even a week later
Should be building Dan Heng to synergize with Welt but whatever
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I dont even have a single dps, rn im building Arlan so that I can replace him with Jing Yuan in less than a few days
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
I dont have any dps built for Forgotten Halls so im just ignoring it rn
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Chaos is just harder Genshin Abyss
20 pulls for Collab Subaru... Current pull for my fav MV outfit for Subaru... 190 pulls, 110 away from Hard Pity
my EnStar Pulls were like that
I can't, I don't trust my luck...

This is essentially my luck:

Win 50/50 but take late pity counter

or

190 Pulls for the character <:despairge:1045736540875280465> 

The most rarest is this one: 2 5* in 1 multi
Im pulling for JY LC so im not worried there
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
they are building towards that 300 pity
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
they just bought more Standard Banner pulls
its Heki...
its Heki
I didn't even get to change my Bio yet
<:SadBb:552684268921290772>
thats so depressing
Why did they patch it
Didn’t stream my ES pull and so it took me 190 pulls for Subaru too
<:despairge:1045736540875280465> Instead they were hp mainstat
My Fire Mc still on 4* set, and I have yet to complete Geppy nor Jing Yuan pieces… heck I have yet to even get any Helm or Chest 5* for lightning nor Chest and Boots for Geppy
Still are
Ishoke, those were mine back then too
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
nothing can change that
ah rip, it really depends, I streamed to my friend, and for Limbus Company, I got like 2 Nclair which was the rate up character in 1 multi, totalling like 30 pulls

while my Baizu pull, I won 50/50... also won 75:25 on Weapon banner, but my Catalyst luck is so shit that I got Amos Bow instead... but thats not cuz of Streamer luck but cuz my Catalyst luck was always shit <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:run:1065680602168299530>
We need the streamer luck
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
... I'll stream it
lol
I have yet to get a single Crate/Cdmg Mainstat coat
lol
oh wao
Since if Fire MC is going to solo anything, Dmg Reduction set is better <:KekPat:966625000339668993> 

Defense gives slightly better stuff for team
yea, pretty much, since this seems more towards the set that is useful for MC itself rather than for the team
I gave him the Dmg Reduction Set but thats mainly since I cant be bothered rn as I am farming Geppy and Jing Yuan's set
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
basically self sustain mc
oh, that set is essentially only useful for Fire MC since they are the only one that can actually synergizes with it <:KekPat:966625000339668993> cuz they have Taunt and whatnot, so when they drop under 50% Hp, they get to heal 10% of their hp (5% from A4 and 5% from Set bonus)
?
Fmc has taunt and self sustain
For me, its because Fmc can get 40-50% Dmg Reduction on Skill + 8% from Set Bonus, it should also work with Dmg Reduction LC too (obviously theres a Hard/soft cap on Dmg Reduction or else everyone be taking 0-1 dmg)

Fmc shield is kinda <:despairge:1045736540875280465> only 4-6% Defense Shield... 6-8% with E2 <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
iirc Defense set is just 15% Defense and 20% Stronger Shield
E1 gives Defense Scaling
both
hp regen and energy regen seems more like a bonus
most likely because their shield scaling isn't that high, Dmg Reduction set is more Dmg Reduction for Fmc which increases tankiness for themselves when taunting
I remember the Memory Run yea, even when it was 35% failure rate, I always fail immediately each and every time, only one instance where did it not make me enter combat and let me pick it again til 90% Risk <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Due by midnight, while I also have another Final for my Art Psy class
March and DH LC is unironically pretty good, mainly March, free perma Dmg Reduction is crazy good

Asta’s we just ignore
k
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
was World 4 Svarog, all I know was that it was either Geppy or Svarog
I went Preservation route at that time which was useless once Svarog decided to CC my team to death, then swapped to Hunt for perm freeze
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
not that RL itself was hard
I wasn't really saying it was hard, but more that Difficulty 2 felt infinitely easier than Dif 1, its like going to Nirvana Bracket but Nirvana was easier to clear than Red Lotus
what happened?
lets you try out different comp to cheese it
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
yea, its why World 3-4 at Difficulty 1 was harder than Difficulty 2, since we were more underleveled... ngl, I wished it was that way because I like the Rogue-like when it hard
Or it might be 1/10/12
all I know is that the first one is at lvl 1
But I dunno, never really checked
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
should be yea
yep
he has a Base Scaling of 99% due to 3 base Atk Count
So each Attack Count adds another 33-72% to Lightning Lord's dmg
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
Each Atk Count essentially let him do another hit
Increase Speed and Dmg Procs
Like Single Target Ult scale around 240-255% 

Ult that Targets up to 3 does around 180%
I guess its because the skill can target up to 5 Enemies, while most Ult either Target 1 or 3 Enemies at most
Jing is also 120%
Herta's is like 120%
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Pela Ult is like 60%
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
more for utility than dmg
I guess for Buff Wipe + Abyss Flowe Stacks
lol
he even has Cleanse in his kit
he really do
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Oh yea, that
I know, its really good, but its sad we can't unlock it til A6, and most A6 are pretty good anyways
A2 is Cleanse
A4 is CC Resist Up
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
its his A6 though iirc
Otto passive there is prob to keep him from getting one shot for being a healer that scale off Atk and not Hp% so he has less tankiness than Nat/Bailu
The only thing that is sadge for Bailu is lack of cleanse but we already have Harmony char with cleanse like Bronya anyways <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I’ll prob do Green later cuz Kosma
get the Curio that guarantees another 3* Blessings, game proceed not to give me a single combat event/portal
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
What the fuck is this shitty run
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
well, Fischl in Honkai I think is taller than Genshin's Fischl iirc
Ponytail Asta wao
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
the animation stops you from petting it
I hate that theres no petting animation
L
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I play the game so that my younger brother can trash talk me when we do ranked matches because I have skill issue for the game
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I used to play Mobile Legend a lot like back in highschool
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
omg, that reminds me of my cousins who plays Mobile Legend because they're in Vietnam
I have at least 5 other friends that do
wao
<a:pat:717159864891342848>
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
costed me 190 pulls to get my 5*
I already had to spend 60$ on Ensemble Stars
no, I need my fund for Jing Yuan and his LC
just <a:Whale:557787005959012352>
We still have the vid
yea
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
thats even worse, in-person live streamer luck
streamer luck
wao
rip
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Like CBT2 Ningguang was essentially unplayable <:KekPat:966625000339668993> post launch, she was actually pretty decent to play for a Geo Characters... while over here we have Himeko whos basically the Dehya of Honkai rn
nope, but at least you can cope
She is basically Ningguang but if Mihole failed to rework Ningguang to be viable
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
The current Himeko we have is the one they buffed for Launch, so that she can barely compete against Serval
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
she was even worse
why couldn't it be any other condition that isn't weakess break
its so depressing
needs 3 weakness break for a Follow-up attack that does only 70-154% Dmg <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> while Clara gets to do the same thing every single time she gets attacked, which also becomes AoE when she uses her Ult
lol
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
She would be more consistent yea, unless you can consistently let M7 proc shield on Clara and Clara Ult
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
yet you need to proc break to make it remotely useful
that shit does no dmg either
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Honestly, idk what they were thinking for Himeko's follow-up Atk
once Jingyuan comes out, hes also very reliable since his is very consistent
it only has one that makes Ult considered Follow-up Atk which is ok but still sad
I pick Preservation, its generally the safest, the 2nd best mainly for Svarog would be Hunt + Remembrance for Perma Freeze
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Yea
To me it is all pretty good but I do like the music for his trailer much more but thats because im biased toward these types of music like with Hua’s <:KekPat:966625000339668993> 

Susannah’s was pretty decent for the desert theme
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Not as garbage as some of the other A4
And then work on my Finals
Ima go back to playing Rhythm games
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
My brain is fried
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
I just read the convo with Burst mode stuff
Not Loli Model = same as everyone else
Me who picked Geppy over Welt for Support and uses Seele Support because I dont have a single Dps for farming
lol
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
1:2 ratio at least
note the Crate comes from their LC as well
they have like 90% Crate on their Seele but like 70% Cdmg
my friend Yuuki is looking for a Cdmg Piece
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
The first one is so sad ngl
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Lightning Dmg Globe for him too
I need a Crate one for Jing Yuan
I dont even have any Crate/Cdmg Chest piece, im coping with Atk rn til I get one for Jing Yuan
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
its why you just craft the QUA one at this point ngl and just farm another set
team will prob be:

Geppy, Tingyun, Jing Yuan, Asta

then Fire Mc, Welt, Natasha, Sushang
thank god Sushang and Tingyun are on Jing Yuan banner, March can be gone
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Sushang who? I dont have anyone else other than the starter 4* and Arlan/Hook
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
Is the actual Abyss
 yay, CN version out
<a:owoShock:1065708439067705406>
Now we are just missing Kebin's and ~~Otto~~ Luocha
lmao
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
is cn one not out yet wtf
correct
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
lol
you forgot to ping me too <a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
ishoke, after him, I have to save for Luocha too, I can skip Blade <:deadge:975652771082698782> just waiting on Hua next
so im guaranteed him + LC at least hopefully
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
I have like 130 pulls for Yuan + LC, I might whale for another 50 pulls
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
lol
why not both?
...
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
School casually fucked me over for my BP
yea, I saw that
<:KekPat:966625000339668993> change that to Belo city and you got a solid piece for Geppy
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I couldn't even use Welt or Asta's Skill cuz its random target and I dont want it to accidentally kill Bronya
yea, once Phase 2 started, I couldn't use my Resonance or else Bronya would die, thankfully, my Shield was always up so the Cocolia 2 Ice Totem always get to 1 hp <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Got the Achievement though
That was annoying lol
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
So during my Finals week
When does Seele go bye bye?
It also gives more DoT dmg too when you read it on the stat menu
yea, I figured that out a while back
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
anyways, nighty night, its almost 2 Am now
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Unironically, the Galatic Big Lotto carried that run
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I know I have Herta and M7 who are follow up attacker, but none of them are in the team to do so in the first place
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
im talking about the one in my team
Elation would need me to have Follow-up Attackers, which I dont have
nope, Preservation
lol
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
how do I get the last 5 for my E5
16% Dmg Bonus per 100 Shards, 75% more shards from won battles, Random Enhanced Blessing where each time, the enhanced blessing was the 3* one, and yea
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
its just I got lucky with my Curio
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<@781539392039682058> nah, I didn't have all my correct blessings either
lemme upload the clip and ill show you how it went
heres with the Resonance
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Svarog attacked my fire mc and he got countered by 100k hit
yea
He attacked Fire Mc just to take 100k dmg back lmao
only 10 Preservation Blessings but all my 3* one are enhanced with me having 500 more shards
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
why tf is this so ass but so good at the same time
Like me on my runs
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Then leave the game on auto
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
You can always Alt F4
Lmao
Welt is their CEO, not their child so hes the favorite character, not child
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
they are fan of trash can
raccoon makes sense
Just cope til then ig
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
One day, we’ll get a support that gives your skill an AoE effect like with SU Quake Blessings or Remembrance Ice Blessing
Cuz with Resurgence, it do be like that Seele meme of what time it is
XD
Ya ya, I knew what Resurgence AoE was, I was talking about actual AoE to speed it up
Your Seele kills all of them at the same time in 1 animation?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Ima feel so slow even with Jing Yuan cuz his dmg comes from his Follow-up Atk and Ult, Euridition good for AoE, but doesnt mean they are fast enough for it
Just cope harder and one day, your Seele will somehow AoE them to death <:Copium:849740782583021598>
And its gonna remain like that til Jing Yuan too
For me, nothing can feel slower than running 2 tanks and 2 support/healer
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Maybe it will feel slightly faster
Just borrow a friend’s Seele instead then
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
True
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Its sarcasm because it really feels like normal speed is going at 0.5x speed and >> speed is 2x speed and with most gacha game usually having a 1.5x speed being the middle ground
Because it is and Mihole was too lazy to add in a 1x speed which is the real normal speed instead of 0.5x speed and 2x speed
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
ngl, even the illusion of choice in HSR feels better, at least the dialogues where they blatantly just had it just the choices being the 2 parts of the same sentence doesn't exist as much in HSR, I've really only seen that like once or twice compared to Genshin
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Also, why is Paimon doing all the talking for us when our MC can actually speak, they even have proper VAs for them too
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Im so happy our Mc actually talks, or even when they dont talk, its still better than having Paimon acts as if we’re super stupid
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
The real question is whether ill live until then to bother about France or even reach the story there because unskipable dialogue is painful
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Well, I have yet to see its existence rn so until it actually happens, then until then, its the neglected child rather than abandoned child ig
WAIT WAIT WAIT WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT ?!?!?!!!!!!!!!!!!!???!?!?!?

Animated Short for HSR, wao wao wao nani...

wait actually, its Honkai so that makes sense but like wao... Genshin really do be the abandoned child <:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
out of all my 4*, only Hook and Arlan were new
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
only 2 of which were actual new 4*
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
I have less than that 80~ pulls on Standard, only 1 4* per multi
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
ishoke, ill get that much once I start pulling for Jing Yuan and his LC
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Her skill is basically like the new ~~Da Heng Skill but worse because shes rng~~
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
yay, it fixed itself
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
so I alt-F4, hopefully nothing got lost
I cant even mmoveveeww
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
HAYLPPPPPPP STUCK
Y for Yaoi
no because living includes Therapy and Joy, which I dont need
you can be done with living but you cant be done with malding, suffering, or gachaing
what about suffering?
We already knew the path of Enigmata from the trailer
yea, its a fun one
oh its that one
??
HD Furry Porn
lmao
soon to be me
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
...
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
wtf
this is like my 3rd QUA Mainstat
aight, this game is rigged
My Geppy has no ER so I can cope with pure Shielding because I combine him with Fire Mc lol
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
So far, I got QUA, IMA, QUA, Phys, and 2 ATK, yet my Rope gets Def Mainstat for a Crate Set
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
also, can the game stop with this shit, I just want Def Mainstat
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
lmao
nope, maybe the shield one when I get extra mats
yea, Nihility have some really cracked effect
cope with Phys Mc then
Lol
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
not a problem for me who runs 2 tank though
Attack Scaling Healer means they are equally squishy
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
the only problem is if your healer is going to be Luocha
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
apparently, to my friend, Difficulty 2 so far is easier than 1 for World 3 and 4
He only got her after he lost all his xtals
was just watching Asmongold reacting to him
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
I love watching clown shit, love to know that now matter what version of Honkai Tectone plays, Seele still fucked Tectone over, both im HI3 and HSR
9~
Welt LC already does that
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Whats her Lc?
Lmao
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Congrats
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
It only benefits Bleed which is sad
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Kosma being Kosma, so overprotective of Griseo that even his Signets made it 100x easier for her to clear
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105> <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
How was the Griseo run lmao
Wow
I dont even care about substats rn
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>
just give me the right mainstat
this is hell
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
why are the Globe drop rate so Abyssmal
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I just realized how good World 6 Globes are for my characters lmao, I get to essentially build Fire Mc, Geppy, and Jing Yuan at the same time
Does this work with SU? If so I think I got this one already lmao
Though once I get Jing Yuan, it might become him instead of Gepald depending on how good I get to build mine
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I will, considering hes quite simple to build, Defense and Effect Hit Rate
I need to make mine stronger after I get to T40
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Yw
Lmao
Thankfully, I really only have to whale for him + his LC, then just pull for Luocha and ignore his LC... ignore the rest til Hua or someone else related to them like Hua were to be released
thats about enough time for me to maybe save enough for Jing Yuan, but I might have to whale for his LC since its unironically a really strong LC
So a little over a week, less than 2 weeks ig
like 9 days 15 hours on NA
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im not cuz 99% of my char are AoE
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Theres an achievement for killing Cocolia while ignoring Bronya
?
lmao
what lvl you think I can reach with these? I know ill be 37 tmr thanks to Dailies giving so much xp, but yea
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
For me, Elation is the worse one, cuz its useless for me til Jing Yuan
Lol
Not even I got it yet, one of my friend did though
It is very rare
So was there a reason to ping all of us for that? <:KekPat:966625000339668993> I dont mind it but yea lmao
Congrats?
<:SadBb:552684268921290772>
Taihen can attest to that
Legit my latest Multi gave me another Herta
I cant get anything other than the free 4* the game gave me
<:run:1065680602168299530>
Gib me the LC
L
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
kinda wished when you salvage 5* Relics, you also get exp mats too
mainstat is better than nothing
you're slacking more than me in HSR smh
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
while I have Final exams and essays to write too
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
ill prob reach T40 on Tuesday because school
even Im like T36 for like 3-4 days now while being busy with school smh
I need to get to lvl 40 soon
wow
congrats, gonna take me next week for mine
I feel so bad for Mika Va, worse than Xiao's raspy voice <:deadge:975652771082698782> while for Da Heng, I hate it but its not too bad, sometime it doesnt sound nerdy which is good enough for me
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
the character wasn't even a nerd in the first place
same
<:CaroleTeeHee:895021822570008606>
and I hate that, not as bad as Mika's En for Genshin but still annoying <:despairge:1045736540875280465>
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
because skill issue
congrats?
Sustain iirc
Its pretty good considering Hunt unit mainly are meant to nuke down 1 enemies anyways… Dmg Bonus is always nice, better than Atk at least
Lol
Me three
I thought Preservation was shield
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I spent like 1-2 Fuel so far, 1 to get another Herta Eidolon that I’ll never use
Is it because I missed like 2 days worth of Resin xp?
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
I only have like 2 quests left and still lvl 36, how are yall so fast
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Did none of them
I never even bothered with hangout events
I would but I dont have enough time for them
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
Oh, I dont think I did Serval either
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Also Main Story
Clara and Nat
I think I have 2 Companion quest left
I havent done Nat Quest so idk, I have so much essays to write <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I might have missed 1 day who knows
Same rn, but even then, ill only be at like 37-38, nowhere close to 40 til next week sadge
night
now stop spoiling me
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
its just a you problem
<a:TeriSmash:595691400260222976>
<:Worrywat:964345611488993320>
I have yet to catch up to story yet
just slow them and Welt will do more dmg
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
most are affected, but not all
Control Effects RES = No Imprisonment
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
yep
aint gonna work when they immune to it
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
some bosses like Cocolia says fuck your cc though
Welt has Slow and Dmg Taken Increase on Ult, Pela is Defense Shred and Buff Wipe

Welt is more dmg oriented yes
? depends on the team
it wont because it states: The next ally taking action <:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462> so if you use Tingyun Skill for instance, thats 16%, then its Bronya's turn, Bronya now has the 16% Dmg Buff, she use her Skill, buffs run out cuz its on Bronya, and now LC proc again, so person buffed by Bronya only gets the 16%
<:kekpalm:901574024830791690>
This was launch patch with 3 region essentially and quite a lot of quests, make sense why event are dry til people catch up to the story for our usual bs events
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
no
I want Jing Yuan
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
<:eek:765359367524188161>
in some cases, its even more useful than the 5* one because it actually help protects your team from AoE
<a:BonkDoge:731400931329179680>
you legit have the best 4* LC for Preservation, its literally a perma 8% Dmg Resistance for the whole team
I was gonna say isnt that for Break set but then realized its QUA set
my mom makes me stressed, prob because everything she does make me more and more irritated <:despairge:1045736540875280465>
lol true
yours was shown so evenly
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Left to Right
So literally in order:

1 > 2 > 3
Energy to Spam Ult, Crit next so that Resonance actually do dmg
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
more stressed than desperate
~~Less of dicknball but more of a buttplug tbh~~
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
yea, its so OP <:KekPat:966625000339668993> at some point, depending on how lucky I got, I even got to swap out Natasha for another dps
yes
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
thought something else was happening
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
so typical Heki
thanks for telling me
<:huh:966619839307321394>
?
 I accidentally spent like 2 min afk, but yea, this run was prob one of my fav run, full auto no healer <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
it was Sushang lc too
I did 1 single on Seele Banner and got a 4* lc, so I know thats a sign <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
pulled Seele trying to get more Pela Dupes
its Heki, Heki is a Heki, we know how he is
I love how they didnt even both to update her pyramid stuff
L
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I dont even have Tingyun
I like Geppy tbh
Dupe or new?
<:SadBb:552684268921290772>
I need that kind of luck
congrats
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
The destruction one sucks ass because its Atk%, essentially, think of it as Genshin

Crate/Cdmg > Dmg Bonus% > Atk% in most scenerio so either Preservation or Hunt
yea, and btw, it can be any path too
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
reminds me of the Key of Castigation Umbrella I could get shipped out from Taobao because it was too long
waow
are they essentially the Barbara ~~stalker~~ but for HSR? <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Nope, dont think they ever do <:Sadge:842131939607183360>
yay, I finally got to give him more Def
...
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
this game really do be telling me im not allowed to get new characters
I accidentally did 1 single on Seele banner when I was trying to pull on the standard banner half asleep <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> thank god I pressed the single and not multi... it gave me Sushang Lightcone <:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
 me like this version more, even had en subs
Unless they make her walk in paint and have her own painting world
Clara is not Griseo, she needs shoe
HSR has way better humor
I should
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I hope my sarcasm from Genshin is getting through
For 20$, no new effects either
Nothing changed about her model other than her getting shoes
You have to wait for Mihole to add the Clara Shoe cosmetic for 20$
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
No
Its like waiting every anniversary for a chance to pull a single S Rank Valk and you somehow get Kiana twice but not just any Kiana, HoV Kiana from year 1
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Its is, but ill take this over Summoner Wars, thats shit was so dogshit that I didnt even get a single 5* until they started to that BS Anniversary event for me to have a chance for a 5*… whats worse was that I somehow got the same dupe 5 stars TWICE, same Element, same unit like what the actual fuck… it was like the most mid version too
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
yea, my friend got that yesterday, btw, it can be any blessings
I wished I could give you my Welt, I feel so bad for him rn because Im essentially forced to Bench him for Asta <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Once I get Jing Yuan, I might go Elation for Follow-up attack finally with Preservation on the side
Lmao lol
since Asta can use that a lot for Cocolia
lol
its not worth, but if none of them are good, for Nihility, I would go for one like 50% Weakness Break Bonus
1st one imo, more perma freeze, 2nd one is decent but it needs DoTs
more reason for why I dont like her
at least get to 40 by end of this week
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I still need to get to 40 from 33
I wont ill just be in Office Hour with my professor while driving instead, its hand free
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Anyways, ill be driving to Uni rn so don’t expect much response anytime soon
You will think the switch button means to switch lightcone buts its actually to switch Path
Same page as the Relics, theres the “switch” button
time for me to dip
true lol, it was hard scrolling down there each time
now we go with dilfs ig
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
I love you too
lol
<:SadBb:552684268921290772>
even Taihen?
aw, you hate me too? and Gresham? and Aoi?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Fire MC is preservation, that is Destruction
lots of Lightcones for Preservation unit are unironically good
any works, but which one you have>
<a:TeriSmash:595691400260222976>
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Enhanced Basic Attack
yes they do
Fire Mc has Taunt, shield, self healing, and higher base Aggro for being a Tank/Preservation unit
I hate it
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
The game gave me 2 Qingque in 2 multi
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
I hate Qingque
^^^
Fire Mc or M7, preferably fire mc
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
thats better now
where?
?
Quantum Relics and Celestial globe for Cdmg or Crate Globe set
Im farming globes instead
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I havent been farming the aritfact domain
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
my Asta has 1.1k Atk so could be better
its the easiest to get afterall
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Break Relics
except for like the 5* one, most are bait... the Geppy 4* one is good for Geppy though lol
I hate Uni
<:SadBb:552684268921290772>
My grades went from like a B to a C
half my class had their grades drop down like 20%
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
same
Memory of the Past, 4* one Bronya thumbnail
which one you have?
lol
what question?
you get another 10+ speed
use Asta
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
good relics
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
5* Globes
<@704867526877904908> Essentially my Cocolia runs, its super inefficient time wise, but I get to multi-task lol
nope, me like Hi3 Kafka more than this one so me skipping
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
you don't forgive me?
I never pulled for Seele so ill never have her in the first place <a:NodBb:561613076844249130> I just saving for Jing Yuan, Luocha, and Hua rn
My team always been Fire Mc, Gepard, Nat, Asta/Welt
I dont have Seele either
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
well, if you are running with Seele, you'll never have enough SP if she always act so much
she needs another buff
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
they did Himeko dirty in HSR
Asta buffs Atk and Speed, with Dance Dance Dance, she can even make the team act earlier
Himeko has follow-up attack so its not too bad
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
because you never have enough sp to support 2 dps anyways
you usually want 1 dps
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Seele is fast
Asta buffs speed
she also have defense break yea
shes useless in the ice world because most enemies there dont really buff themselves, but in the 2nd world where half the mobs there has self revive, buff wipe do be good
Pela is buff wipe iirc
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
theres an option that lets you see the numeric value of your action btw
Its Heki <a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Speed affects your action, so you get to act quicker, I have Dance Dance Dance which also moves all my characters Action by 18% letting them act again even faster 

Asta also have Fire Multi hit so she breaks Cocolia and 99% of the ice enemies shield there
I dont have it yet, plus Jing is mix of Ult and Follow-up <:deadge:975652771082698782> which is hard to buff since really we have Herta Lc which is follow-up dmg and then other that buff Ult stuff
Energy Regen and Ult dmg right? <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I dont think I even got that one yet
Which one is that?
I dont have any good Euridition LC so I do need to get lucky
Well Lightning God is more single target oriented, Jing Yuan himself does good AoE with his skill and Ult
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Jing Yuan Follow-up attack seems better tbh, not reliant on breaks to proc
DoT AoE like Serval or Follow-up Attack AoE like Herta/Himeko
There are 2 type of Euridition characters so far
AoE follow-up Attack
Im wondering if Lightning god can get buffed by things like Asta’s speed boost or action increase lc like Dance Dance Dance
Yea, though it prob depends on playstyle too since Jing is also Follow-up attack playstyle with a speed mechanic on his summon
Once we get Hua, ill most likey whale to get her to E2 and weapon to S3 as well
Waow, I’ll only be pulling base and r1 lc

Cuz I also have to pull for Luocha
I’ll also be pulling for him
All, tell me too so that I can join the pull party
I just woke up, look at discord and saw that
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Oh, I was wondering when how are you pulling for Jing Yuan
?
night
I need cn version
 I love how they speed run through the remaining Aeon's like Remembrance and Elation... Hedonism, Voracity, Equalibrium, End of All Things, Propagation, Enigmata, etc
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
do you understand why I said I need Jing Yuan? so i can replace Nat
even my Asta does more dmg at that point
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
its actually a downgrade in dmg if I swap to Phys Mc
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
you'll see it all once it loads
<:kek:809950280258945024>
I aint swapping to this shit
<:run:1065680602168299530>
you're not gonna be able to convince me from swapping Fire Mc to Phys
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
I have no resources for it either since I need to still raise everyone else
that aint happening
<:eek:765359367524188161>
its lvl 1
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
only on shieldbreak, i already said Asta can burn
<:derp:724856219600289853>
I have no xp to raise it, and my team does no DoT except for Asta
which one?
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
no, they have nothing good for lc
nope
my Asta has the highest atk rn
dmg is nonexistent
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Geppy, Fire Mc, Asta, Nat
my overworld run is forever trash til Jing Yuan cuz I have no dmg
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<a:SleepingRin:700806971623997542>
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
This is how you dont get any of the male characters
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
I gave my explaination and then called it skill issue too
I love how 99% of the comment is just skill issue
<a:KEKWlaugh:843918348893814795>
they just need to go Perma freeze or Preservation nuke
congrats
Its why I want Jing Yuan, so that I can get my AoE dmg along with extra dmg proc because his Stand is considered Follow-up dmg
And I even get to deal 120% Shield as Dmg + 80% Def as additional dmg
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
if I did it well, I would have a consistent 5-8k Shield every turn
I was still missing at least 2-3 more core blessings like 15% Shield every turn
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
it is, combined with Asta for shield break and I pretty don't even need Natasha if I had all my Preservation blessings
its so braindead
I love preservation
even without the Skill, my Fire Mc took essentially no dmg
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
The Dmg Disparity in how well they tank
nice
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
took me like 2 runs to beat Cocolia consistently
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
my friend's remark on Cocolia in W6
nighty night
<:run:1065680602168299530>
Did you see my World 6 Run that I had on semi auto
<:Ehe_HuTao:815153369445564446>
Ult also gets buffed
yes it does
Qua Res Pen is still better than whatever Geppy A4 was
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
semi auto because Galaxy Lotto decided to take all my hp away
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
I got a 5* Defense one thanks to that fight
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
oh that was me too
I just auto and slept through her
Congrats?
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>

I know Heki is gonna get another ghost pity with that World Clear, makes me not want to help even more
...
...
I hope
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Should be able to get 80 more by then
16 more days
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
I have 100 pulls ready for Jing Yuan
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
my account was fucked up already but the 5* were the only reason its even alive
You are really good at this
Heki...
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
yea
<:run:1065680602168299530>
early pity built from ghost pity
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Only Standard but it built toward the imaginary pity in that banner
<a:KianaCooking2:653170566362300437>
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
instead of Jing
Heki spent it all to get Seele
yes, only 1 per week, 2 for 1st clear
I was gonna try and see how M7 does compared to Geppy
March 7
<:run:1065680602168299530>
how about M7
you have Asta raised?
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
this shit need to upload faster
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
if your tank dies in the first place, theres a problem
<:eek:765359367524188161>
the most useless A4 in the game... it require Geppy to die to proc
been spamming SU
i think im still T32, so many side quest and main story still
once I am, I can finally give that set to Geppy
im not T35 yet
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
cant be worse than this though
same
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I love how abysmally better our mc is compared to Genshin's
this is mine
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
my team is gonna be healerless once I get Jing Yuan
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yea
Who has Geppy here?
2 teams Abyss <:deadge:975652771082698782> so I still need her
prob Blade but I wont have enough for him with Jing and Luocha being there
<:run:1065680602168299530>
For me, im pulling for Jing Yuan, Luocha

So ig rn:

Fire MC, Geppy (Tank)
Luocha, Natasha (Healer)
Asta, Welt (Buffer/Debuffer)
Jing Yuan (Dps)

I still need 1 more dmg dealer, preferably a shota or hot dude and not a loli <a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
im at 20k rn because I spent 9-10k on Ely Skin
<:kek:809950280258945024>
^^^
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
This is why you dont go for 4* copies, especially when you already failed 50/50
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
...
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Once it finishs uploading onto YT, ill just show you my Cocolia run <:KekPat:966625000339668993> Other than me doing manual at the start because Galatic Lotto Ticket stole 99% of my team's hp, I mostly had the game on Auto for Cocolia (Healer AI sucks so I had to manual for her Ult)
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
not yet lmao
it took me C1 Childe for a single Ningguang copy
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Sounds like me in Genshin
lmao
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
my only new 4* rn was Hook and Arlan
I dont even have Pela
I dont even have those 2, so its do be nice <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
yea
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
guess how long my Cocolia fight was
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
I like my preservation build <:KekPat:966625000339668993> Im legit just leaving my fight mostly on auto against Cocolia
never
just the break set <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Asta has the highest attack in my team
lol
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Mc and Gepald was basically at full hp 24/7
well, Nat and Welt took dmg but thats cuz they squishy
wow, congrats lol, I think I just took 0 dmg against her <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
still no Globe stuff yet
yay
I did <:Kek:898256955922067466> mine and Geppy is only 1-1.2k Def rn… though at least my Mc gets a bonus shield when he gets attacked
Or Elation cuz Follow-up attacks
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
But in SU, main dmg is actually gonna be from Preservation Resonance
Jing
<:run:1065680602168299530>
If I get Luocha, I can have a full men team
Lets see how far ill go without getting a female 5*
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Ishoke, you’ll get them all someday… me pulling for Luocha and Jing Yuan wont help my case either rn
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
I have to use Asta instead of Welt and I hate it
Gepald OP, same with Fire MC
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Cleared more consistently than my friend’s Seele run too
Ishoke, I still cleared Cocolia though <:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:ReallyMad:1047442160003326002>
Preservation unironically OP when built right and Gib
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Left game on auto and went to take a shower
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Good luck, I cleared mine, my 2nd run had Asta and I almost auto’ed Cocolia into Phase 3
For me, I just happen to get Dance Dance Harmony <:KekPat:966625000339668993> which is perfect with Asta
Also answer me question, did you clear Cocolia yet in SU 6
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Talking about lc
Its hard to find any decent Destruction or Hunt one
Tbh, there are a lot of good Preservation lc
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Fire MC lives longer than my Geppy
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
No no, that Preservation is for Fire MC
I picked Preservation because im biased
She doesnt need any, ishoke
In SU?
B4 I sleep, Heki, did you clear Cocolia?
anyways, nighty night
either her or Himeko for collection
Im prob gonna get Bronya for my 300
yea, definitely one of my favorite
good luck there... CN Clara is really cute the way she says her name
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
and Himeko's lc isnt Follow-up attack so its ~~useless~~ for Jing Yuan
my Fire Mc already has his 5* lc
oh, you're buying Clara's, I dont have Clara so im buying it for Gepald
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
and his lc
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I'll prob get it by the time I roll for Jing Yuan
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
... I rather just get it from 600 Store at that point
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
or was it S4
even got it to S3
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
ngl, I gave the Herta Store lc for Fire MC, they are always the last to die, and then gave the one you got to my other Preservation unit
nice if you have 2 Preservation unit on the team
its decent
<a:worryGanbatte:900369496907350016>
it is
<:Worrywat:964345611488993320>
<@964806731471405086> I dont hate her, I just dont like her
<:kek:809950280258945024>
I legit auto'ed Cocolia to Phase 2 at 49% hp b4 I died,,, and that was just with 1 Resonance active and no proper dps blessings
I dont like Asta but god does she makes my run smoother
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
actually OP lc
I just raised Asta though
yea, because it gives 20% Dmg which is nice, and another 20% if enemies has higher hp%
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
game is telling me to raise Arlan
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
run would've been smoother with Asta tbh lmao
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Praise Gepald
FUCKing did it
YESSSSSSSSSSSsss
my friend finally cleared her
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
First try lvl 40 characters
Beated World 5
Bronya gets her usual skill to make Cocolia attack instantly too
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Phase 2 Cocolia summons in Bronya yea, Phase 3 she auto summons AoE random Freeze
just know that if you ever get Candle that gives that Freeze every 6 hits, always take it for perma freeze cuz thats how you stunlock the boss
lmao'
Candle, that one is the core for Hunt Perma Freeze strat against Svaros
Middle
should be one of the Candle one
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
theres one blessing that adds Ice Weakness to the boss
anyways, good luck
<:run:1065680602168299530>
if Nihilism Shield Break 50% pop up, its a pretty decent random 1* blessing
Bailu healing is strong, but healing is worthless if you dont live by the time she gets to heal you
maybe if you want on the side, just in case you dont freeze in time and the boss gets an action... <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Bailu is prob tankier than Asta and Seele, so yea
someone who isnt squishy <a:Run:828749243820802130>
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
my friend cleared up to Cocolia with Hunt Main, though they didn't try Remembrance on the side
Asta multi hit is useful for shieldbreak and applying more freeze stack, Seele can clear any wave mobs and also nuke the boss down
yep
the rest is kinda whatever go, Hunt is so that you can always be fast enough to proc freeze
For Candle you only really need the 5-6 hits for Freeze Blessing
Hunt Main + Candle Side
yea, I know, but I was just talking about building their core signets stuff, since unlike ER, we have 4 different units to build
Hunt is really important to clear the mobs waves and allow easier time to proc Remembrance freeze
like how in Ely realm, we have our core signets with other signets like Hua as a bonus
yea, you want to go Hunt and hope you get some good Remembrance on the side
Theres a Remembrance Blessing that do 30% of the boss max hp when you break its shield
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
save some Hunt charges for that part to destroy the hands instantly

Svarog Hands grabbed my Welt too and thats how he died... ended up with Fire Mc and Nat doing the rest
I cleared World 4 with lvl 40 characters yea, on my way to clearing World 5 the same way
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
My friend cleared world 5 too... World 6 is Cocolia
^^^
I think someone cleared with this... mine was the one with Gepald, ill show it in a bit
go Hunt Perma Freeze, Heki recommends it, and its pretty good
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Pela extra useful in the Hunt region too with all the self revive enemies
<:derp:724856219600289853>
I cleared world 4 with 3* Relics
I cleared World 4 by using Hunt + Remembrance and got lucky on Remembrance, so I was fast and stunlock the bosses... Shields make sure I dont die when I didnt freeze fast enough
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
so I just stall the game til the enemy dies
I have 0 dps
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
im spoiled by Gepald shield
I'll prob be going to sleep, the others can prob guide better
can you just post the lc for Fire Mc, Seele, Bailu, and whoever you plan for 4th slot, ig Clara
rip, which Lc do you have/use?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
honestly, I have Fire Mc and Gepald next to each other so they never felt anything
cuz AoE
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
tbh, I just mean just mean the team member, obv Fire Mc in one corner, Bailu in the other
^^^
why not use fire mc taunt?
Fire Mc Corner, Bailu, Random Slot (ig Asta works), Seele

Go Hunt Resonance, if you can get the 5-6 Hit Freeze Remembrance 3* Blessing, you are essentially golden that run, rest is Hunt Buffs so that Seel clears all the mob and nuke Gepald
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I have no real context, but they are annoyed and think you stole their friend even though hes your bf?
this was my peak
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
what do you need help with?
basically me but with my whole team alive
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
true, I dont have Bailu anyways, its fun running some of my Preservation build, essentially 8k+ Shield
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
essentially, half the people here has Yanqing and the other half have Gepald
one of my friend used Yanqing, they got Seele, so Yanqing was replaced
who do you have? tbh, you can prob brute force it with Hunt + Remembrance
hes definitely not Qiqi of HSR, mine has been carrying me
how?
I cleared Svarog
On monday I get to upgrade it to +2 and have it be 20% shield
Ngl, other than the Preservation one, I actually dont really like the other 2 5* lc
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Kafka is next which should be easier for me because Confusion does jack shit when all mu units do 0 dmg anyways
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
I clear this with Hunt Resonance + Freeze…

Gepald and Fire Mc just there for emergencies whenever he breaks free from the freeze
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Finally a new character, but one ill never use <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> I didn't need Lightning... especially when ill be going for Jing Yuan
like my Gepald with A2 usually get targeted like 60-70% of the time compared to my Fire Mc or any other characters
but it does mean higher chance of getting targeted more often
for absolute, you'll need the actual Taunt debuff like Fire Mc
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Taunt Value isnt always absolute which is why Aster's Asta is always getting bullied
Clara Ult helps increase her Aggro
M7 Shield does yea
lol
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
just mean higher chance to be targeted, so like M7
They do yea
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Clara is Phys Destruction
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
I like Gepald with Fire Mc though tbh, they have pretty good synergy
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I'll have my Finals by then
<:SadBb:552684268921290772>
 I want Jing Yuan banner already
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
How much can you bench
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
just monstard
no d
its why I call them by nicknames by that point like Benny
same
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
I just call him Benneto
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
honestly, idk how she mispronounce that, prob could've just said Ciao and still pass
...
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
its why people meme and call Zhongli Jonhlee
ye
^^
lmao
I dont, and shes gonna be rate up on Jing Yuan banner and I hate that fact... I just want Sushang and Tingyun along with Jing
tingtong and jinjong done <a:Run:828749243820802130>
lmao
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Hook is my only new 4*
me neither
I dont even use her
I hate it
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
my Qingque is E2
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
mine is at E1
lmao
I still have no one but Hook at my new 4*, everyone else is the one we get at start of the game
<:kek:809950280258945024>
I want to know Jing Yuan A4 already <:deadge:975652771082698782> His Stand deals more dmg than him
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
that passive should've gone to Yanqing lol
I just said that already
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
They had to buff her so that she can compete against Serval, and even then, shes still ass
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
why is she the one with a Basic Attack Dmg Buff
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Tingyun: Basic Attack Increase by 40%
wow
thats actually good
18% Fire Dmg Bonus for all allies
Sushang is:

For every Sword Stance triggered, the DMG dealt by Sword Stance increases by 2.5%. Stacks up to 10 time(s).
<:A_HuKek:803544603751612436>
Bailu is that her Invigorate proc 1 more time
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Nat is just, 10% Healing Bonus
Welt is refund 10 Energy after using Ult
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Like Bronya's is Everyone gets a 20% Defense Buff for 2 turn at start of Battle
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I guess I should say mostly unique
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
no, its all unique for each characters, Gepald's A4 was when he proc his Revive passive, his Ult gets refilled
Pom Pom is actually adorable too
waow
lol
lol
its a nice filler set
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
but better because you dont rng for 3 separate Talent upgrade mats
since its essentially Weekly Bosses in Genshin
Its for the Ascension passive, so its always pretty worth it
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Its monthly like Genshin
Even though Star Rail essentially have all the QoL that Genshin doesnt have <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
<a:KianaCooking2:653170566362300437>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
oooo
lmao
for  what
<:RazorSquish_liesNslander:864499524516577320>
Summoning Ritual, wrong ritual
did you not do any ritual?
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
lmao
the rare one is essentially every other 5*
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
so far, everyone mostly got Yanqing or Gepald
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
his sister also pulled Gepald
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
My friend got Gepald, his streamer luck today got Himeko Light Cone
E1?
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>

<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Why is M7 the icon smh
Yea
way better than Paimon, less annoying and doesn't even have to do the talking for us
Pom-pom is indeed cute
no HSR, then Honkek, no Honkek, then GGZ, no GGZ, Limbussy... no Limbussy, Ensemble Stars, no ES, then ToT, no ToT, them Memento Mori, no MM, then Tower of God... and so on...
I legit rotate them
why else you think I play like 6-7 gacha games actively
even without Star Rail, I zone out to many other things
doesn't work that way chief
now, I have maybe 4-8 other essays and final drafts to write
got 1 down... well 2 ig... had to turn in my annotated Bibliography, a Research Report Paper, and I just finished writing a Reflection Memo...
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
its 3 Am, night, see you in 4-5 hours as I wake up to write more essays
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Freeze can deal DoTs and Stun
once its their turn, they immediately recover from it like any break and attack
nope, only slows down their turn
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
im waiting for them to nerf it by either making enemies immune or give them 3 turns attack
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
it is
I love how Freeze is the only actual stun debuff we have, everything else only delays the enemies turn or do DoTs
Preservation Burst is hard without Gepald tbh so I do agree there
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
honestly, idk what to run... 

maybe Bailu, Fire Mc, Seele/Clara, M7/Support/Debuffer/SP

You can go either freeze or preservation nuke... theres a Destruction 3* Blessing that essentially share all the dmg you take equally across all allies
why would you need Clara?
?
once I clear World 4 and start next week, I'll most likely get R2 Preservation Lightcone from Herta Shop
anyways, congrats on beating World 4
nihil

worthless
useless
<a:Yaeslap:966597937696223232>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I wished that hand didn't need his direct command so it could just clap you
I will go freeze route yea, I went shield route because I clear faster with Shield <:deadge:975652771082698782> that run I had earlier, I had no shield so I couldn't do much... cuz that run was my Masochist Run where I just reflect dmg
Welt was my dps even though logically speaking, any other dps couldve been better <:deadge:975652771082698782>
just Fire Mc and Gepald carried me
I would've been disapointed if I somehow died in World 3 with that kind of shield stat
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
me, im on World 4, clear World 3 on my first try with lvl 40 characters
mine are still 40
50
<:eek:765359367524188161>
and as Fenri said, touch grass
Tell me how that run goes
Fox Girl buffer also works I think
hate, never want to use her, so no comment <:despairge:1045736540875280465>
in some cases, someone with AoE to help clear the mob waves since Da Heng is only good for Single Target stuff
yea, if you cant do healer, just have it be a filler slot to either help slow (debuff) or be a skill point generator with a good passive
Da Heng prefer slow debuff, if you have anyone with that, it would be great, buffer is also needed to proc his passive so Asta or Gepald... Fire Mc shield doesn't count as an active buff proc sadly so it wont proc his passive or preservation shield stuff
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
well, just use Qinque as the Skill Point bot ig
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
I havent unlocked the 2 team thing yet
idk
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
basically how I clear most of my content
I would use Gepald with Fire Mc, shields for days <a:Run:828749243820802130>
my characters are too underleveled sadly, so Break Effects are weakened thus the delay is more sadge
but what you do when its multiple waves of mobs
2 waves?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I forgot she does multi hit skill which is good for single target, Welt does that too, for mob fight though, its copium
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
what did Asta even do
just give up getting the bonus and clear it normally <:KekPat:966625000339668993> we are way too weak to get any of the bonus bs
I gave up on that one, just took my time clearing that shit
oh, did you get the Bonus Blessing Challenge?
Svarok til 3rd Phase was unironically easy <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
well, at least my Gepald and Fire Mc are running 3* Relic set
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
my characters are lvl 40 running 3* Relics
Im clearing this with a lvl 40 team, you know that right? <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
his Hands are
Svarok isnt the issue
only Svarok is weak to Fire, his hands are weak to Lightning, Wind, and another that isnt fire
This would've been so easy if I had Jing Yuan rn, I would replace my Welt for AoE lightning
nice, tell me how that run goes later... I wasn't too lucky so I went ~~Masochism~~ Quake route where whenever I get hit, I essentially reflect back damage, the only issue here is that Svarok Hands usually say, Fuck your allies, heres a perma stunlock that you have to kill and do weakness break but we are only weak to Lightning and every other Element that you don't have
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
for me, I went nuke route, never took much dmg and just one shot all the minions each time, my only weakness was the Svarok 3rd Phase cuz once he got even 1 hit off, my whole team gets clapped by the hands
so do beware
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
as for what getting fixed mean, who knows, sometimes, the bugged Curio will kill off your own team
never got em so idk, from what I remember, they essentially are debuffs til they become buffs <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I was just wondering how much yours does in general, Svarok constantly summons his minions for a full wave of 5 phase 1, 2 Chainsaw one in Phase 2, and then 4 Arms that stunlock your team in Phase 3
how much dmg does your Freeze Resonance do btw
literally anyone that wasn't a dupe <:despairge:1045736540875280465> <:Sadge:842131939607183360> legit the only new unit I have from Gacha is Hook... Gepald and Welt are 5*, so they don't really count here
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
her skill tiles rng is too much for me
I have E2 and I hate her <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> shes one of the unit I get dupes off while never getting new characters I actually needed
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
1 because extra Cons/Eidolon is nice in general... I'll pick 3 if you have a good Resonance team like the one I had to clear Svarok's minion each wave
cuz I dont have til to get to T30
btw, they are all lvl 40 still
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
Jing Yuan could've solved this for me, not Lightning, Wind, or Qua means no Break... Svarok just summoned like 4 extra hands
Lmao
Its so Ironic that our Mc in HSR is already way more useful than Genshin MC
<a:pojjspin:1091417290882433165>
I hope ZZZ Protag starts off with a Bat too
Because our Honkai People starts off with a baseball bat before evolving forward in cooler ways
<:Worry:608011211229102101>
What level are you now?
Ew no, I only care for fictional characters, real human are ugly, including myself 

As remember in one of my phases, I just kept calling Baban a gymbro
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Tbh, my definition is shota is like how Taihen called Welt an old twink
I go for Shota and Twink, Hot dudes is a bonus for me, my issue is that I bottom which is prob why im not getting any of thw twink characters <a:Run:828749243820802130>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I only use a healer because I dont like being under 100% hp
Himeko or Serval
Everyone else was dupes or lightcone
Btw Heki, the only new 4* I ever got was Hook
Me
I can prob run Triplr Preservation if I wanted to
I forgot there were achievements for using 3 Characters of the same roll
im still lvl 28 or 29 i forgot
touch grass
way better than Genshin at least
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
we still havent gotten to the 5* Relics yet too
like wtf
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
congrats, I hate that 99% of those Globe needs me to have over 120 Speed if I want the other buffs
maybe it was: Baban was used to having a dirty environment, it became slightly cleaner over time, and once Taihen came back, it became back to normal again but Baban was under the delusion that it was always clean before so hes no longer used to it <:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
<a:Run:828749243820802130>

some of the assignments I have to all finish by Sunday if I want any credit
I will prob just do my dailies for HSR and then start playing again on Tuesday or something
If I was being smart, I should be using Da Heng instead of Natasha so that he can synergize with Welt for more dmg but im dumb so that aint happening
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
My main Dps rn is Welt, whos not even a Dps unit but a Debuffer
You see, I have no dmg dealer so I’ll never get to see that

ill unlock that all next week
rip ig

oh, so I have to be Trail 30
some are good
when do you start unlocking Fire Mc Eidolon btw
clear world 4 and I can Superimpose it to R2
Im getting the Preservation one for Fire MC so that I get a shield when I take dmg
The 5* Hunt one from the Herta shop, or Da Heng Light cone... only other option I know is the BP one
that was how I cleared World 3, took essentially no Dmg and just Nuke Gepald to death with my Aeon... I also had the Blessing where I take 15% Less Dmg and Share all the Dmg I take with my teammate... so combine with Fire Mc dmg reduction and taunt, it was essentially 0 dmg taken
who needs a Healer at that point
8k Shield
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Fire Mc and Shielder is all you need tbh
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
once I get Jing Yuan, ill be going healer-less til Luocha
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
you prob should, though mine prob has the lowest hp out of my entire team and is just there for emergency heal with Ult
but no phys dps
same
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Her CG art is so nice, but who knows how long will she ever be a playable unit
Hook works best in a burn team
Shes basically a Hunt character disguised as a Destruction character, her AoE is kinda trash but for Single Target dmg, its good, im not gonna raise her though
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
should've sent that to me instead yea
Preservation has a lot of good lightcone ngl
I want that ngl, its really good if I can't get the 5* Lightcone for Gepald cuz at least it increases Aggro and reduces the dmg he takes
World 4, got to the last boss which was how I died
first try too
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I just cleared World 3 with lvl 40 characters
The Edelon Curio is so nice, +1 all on Edelon is just too good ngl, especially since some Edelon are super nice with extra Debuff proc chance and whatnot... 

I prob could've beated World 4 with only lvl 40 Characters if my Relics had been a bit better... and if I had gotten the blessings I needed
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Still using 3* Relics rn
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
none of my Characters went past 1k Atk yet
that Attack Power... waow
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
If I had that much Def for Gepald, ill be golden
<:run:1065680602168299530>
I want that Lightcone so bad for Gepald
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
My list of Characters is actually just sad AF, except for my 5* which is my only redeeming feature for this account
I can see the gif
Grab the Shield one for Preservation Mc since his shield is weak AF, and give the Dmg Resistance one to Gepald since hes just Support Tank
<:derp:724856219600289853>
close to grabbing one
only the boss killed me and spamming summons
World 4 is hard kinda

<a:runNezukorun:1065703033259970671>
Fire MC also has Taunt + 40% Dmg Reduction on Skill and I had a Dmg Resistance Lightcone
Guardian Aeon was my dmg, basically had 30% Dmg Reduction with Fire Mc skill + 15% Dmg Reduction Blessing... Blessing which buff Shield Absorption by another 30%, Shield when ending turns... 

also Curio that shares Dmg across the whole team so I take essentially no Dmg anyways
Shield OP when combined with Fire Mc Dmg Reduction
I love you too, they are the only reason why I havent deleted my account yet <:despairge:1045736540875280465>
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
first try
~~I beated Gepald in World 3~~
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
<a:gf_pat:1077167310219006012>
I just beaten Cocolia today and unlocked Fire Mc… Saturday/Sunday i have to finish my Essays and hw b4 its too late
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
It says 500 times
I love Otto in HSR, cuz hes basically Otto from HoS Stigmata and 7 Sword Novel in terms of look and I love it
LUOCHA
For me, if I get a 3rd 5*, I want it to be another male or Bronya cuz I need a buffer... a dupe Gepald would be nice too cuz 35% more Freeze proc is nice
~~ill take the cone~~
lol
I told the truth there too
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
there was also the android one
<:draculaLUL:892683720870481922>
i told the truth
oh, the time one
rocky?
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
I love those balloons, too bad I dont ever want them because once they deflates and I become sadge
even though we already have an actual Kafka <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> ima let them cook longer ig
so far, I got the Pessimstic, Hot Blood and Quiet Trail Blazer achievement lol <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I like how we can respond normally or even tell her to beg lmao
Sampo? lol
same, like even the jokes and localization feels nice, they arent good jokes or bad one, but are just guinenely nice jokes
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
cuz sometime, i press too early and it moves on the dialogue and I cant backtrack it
what HSR is also missing is a Log, so that I can look back at what I missed like with Honkai for dialogue
at least the VA for our mc got to actually talk this time, wished there was full dialogue but this is a way bigger improvement compared to Genshin
at least Genshin story improved with Sumeru from Inazuma so im happy there, but Genshin QoL team definitely moved into SR and soon ZZZ
no Paimon doing all the talking for us
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
the best part is our mc actually speaking when they are talking in their head, im fine with them not saying the dialogue but at least I can actually hear them talk outside of grunts and pants when in combat
just give me a regular sentence at that point rather than a fake option
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
yea, like we look at Genshin and sometimes, the responses arent even responses but a part of the same sentence like:

You know...

Lisa killed Diluc right?
the only thing HSR really need to improve on for me is the combat system, since not being able to cancel any Ult skill or being able to block/skip your turn is pretty sad... 

breaking enemies don't always stun them for long either <:deadge:975652771082698782> but everything else is pretty nice, all the things which I wished was in Genshin to make my life easier... also love how people are already review bombing HSR for log-in issues and whatnot
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I love that the dialogue options actually feels worth it
they used this Blessing to help
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
nah, it was also because he went a perma freeze route
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
<@416445660443967491> my friend just cleared World 3 with this team
lmao
my 4* rolls are worse than my 5* one rn for some reason
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
you are letting your demons out to Blade, im just saying what I just realized so far with my rolls
ngl, i feel like the reason why my 2 5* so far are dudes is not because im lucky (cuz 90% of my 4* rolls are trash) but also because ~~Im just bottoming~~  thats not good for me because I want the shota/twink characters too <:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
currently eating my breakfast at 2 pm because I've been playing HSR
<:Sadge:842131939607183360>
I didnt add enough Salt and Butter to my potatoes
<a:pat:717159864891342848>
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
or get Speakers next time
watch a clip of it on YouTube or something
same, though that depends on the gacha... rn in Esemble Stars, I essentially just save for only 2 Characters, Subaru and Mika <:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947> which some I have to save til like December... same with Luke stuff for Tears of Themis
for me, im saving for Jing, I dont really care about any of the 4* this banner too
you still have 19 days left ig
<:draculaRip:814619093721415703>
Bailu main weakness is that she has no cleanse
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I feel so bad for Natasha Talent passive, only buff healing when she heals those under 30% hp, but most mob one shot you by the time you get even under 90% hp
this was prob one of my favorite <:KekPat:966625000339668993> stunlocked a boss for 20 actions
Still doing all the side quests rn
I havent even unlocked that yet
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I just call it Ely Realm 2.0
Im only lvl 21 rn because I was too lazy
they are my friend's character, but I say they are lvl 40
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
there's even a Lightcone that even said so
yea
no, I got him after I collected like 9 pulls from my characters, so im just gonna leave it there to annoy me
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I learned now that rituals is the way to go
666 Shield and 666 hp
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
yep, 100% because of the Devil's luck
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
and each time he summons new helper
my friend didnt realized that
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Gepald has 3 Phases btw
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Fun fact, theres a Beserk Mechanic, spend like 35+ min in a fight and the mobs start getting this each turn
If Genshin had all the QoL HSR had, I prob would still be playing the game
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I love all the HSR jokes, all the things that Geshin needed but was completely ignored
I remember the closet scenes
Yea
Im waiting for Hua or Yae to make me want to pull for a female character, rn im just going for the guys and if they are someone nostalgic like Himeko or Bronya… but I wont be focusing on getting them cuz thats too much for me
<a:scrajj:1085182561921286246>
Look at her kit from the Start of the game
I am, but ill be suffering because then ill have to bench either Welt or someone else because I aint benching MC anytime soon, and I like Gepald kit rn
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
No slot for her, nor do I wanna use her
Once I get Jing Yuan, this is gonna be pain as I run Fire Mc, Gepald, Jing Yuan and Welt with no healer
Seele is super strong for single target dmg afterall
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Waow, so strong, my team essentially have no one who can buff for shit rn

Gepald is Preservation so CC/Shield… Natasha is healer… Phys Mc is ok, need to build him more… just replaced my Daheng with Welt who’s a debuffer not dps
They prob did more than that, but I wasnt paying attention, the 11k was from one of the normal mob he fought outside of the ~~Ely Realm~~
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
My friend’s Tingyun dealt like 11k dmg and that was like nothing to the boss
My friend took a break after losing there a bunch of times… whats worse is all the enemies hit like a truck too
I havent unlocked it yet though
Yea, I said earlier too, whats worse is his shield is AoE so his entire team just lives on forever
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
its actually hilarious how often that proc with my friend killing off their runs
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
my favorite Curio
it really is from what my friend showed me
<:derp:724856219600289853>
I guess I did got the devil's luck after my Gepald started spamming 666 Shield
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
my friend Yuuki is lvl 27 rn
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I actually did not expect to get Welt
Gepard as my 50 guarantee, I did 2 more multi on Standard... 1st multi was dupe useless Mahong girl and 2nd one was Welt after I ascended all my character once for the 1 Express Card
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
~~I want the twink too~~
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
im just missing Luocha, Yuan, and Luka
I feel safe with Natasha's healing, while MC is MC
cuz Dahen, i just raised so that he'll do more dmg... Gepald is my main rn
my problem now is idk where to use Welt <:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
# Im sorry TET <:derp:724856219600289853> Please forgive me #
i only have 30~ pulls saved up rn ig, if I get to rank 35 by the time Jing Yuan drops, thats another 10 for 40 ig... does the Mirror Abyss thing reset monthly? or does it not reset at all
true
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I like Female Mc hair, but I like Male Mc clothes better
looks so comfy
<:KianaDrool:652709420752699403>
ngl, the main reason I picked Male mc is because I like their clothes
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I hate getting her, I rather get another Dan Heng dupe over her
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I fucking hate this bitch with a passion
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
He didnt even cause a dent to it
The shield is so tanky
Final boss was Gerald I think, my friend reach him and just got bodied because enemies essentially slaughtered his Bronya and Gerald (I know its Gepald but too lazy) can cast AoE Shield btw <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
666 Shield <a:NodBb:561613076844249130> for all my characters, now gob me the Devil's luck on my gacha please so I can get the characters I want
lol
<a:pat:717159864891342848>
there there Neko
I never called him shit <a:pat:717159864891342848> I thought Gepald was shit but then after using him for a while now, I actually like him... too bad I dont have any good dps characters
<:Kek:898256955922067466>
my friend's Yanqing
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
Im saving mine for Jing Yuan, if I don't get him, then i'll get Luocha instead
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
thats so me
<:derp:724856219600289853>
one of my friend already unlocked Fire MC
Yep
If you’re talking about Gepald, his A2 also increases the chances of him being targeted
lol
my team still have 0 supports, except maybe Natasha
I know, but I prefer Gerald because AoE shield is nice even if its only on his Ult
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Im so happy I have Gerald now so I dont ever have to use March 7th... the real pain is when I pull on the Sushang, Fox Girl, and Yuan banner, March 7th will also be there
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I dont even have a healer
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
or get Gerald and shield the whole team
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
I love Fmc hair, but I do really do like Mc clothing
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I look at my other friends and their insane dmg
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<a:gf_pat:1077167310219006012>
Thank you
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Wheres the Gun btw
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
My reaction when I got Daheng dupe
Still no Cryo Catalyst like wtf
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im just coping they wont be like Genshin
Probably not for me because of pf Daheng, but then again, this is Mihole

I know they will have characters with same role + elements at some point or already do, but I dont think they’ll do it this early when we already get a free Daheng
We know it wont be Fire or Phys
Space China theme is hunt huh, now which Element you think they will be?
Which MC type do you think we are gonna get for the Area? We got Preservation Fire one in the Ice Region afterall
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I cant do that yet cuz sadly, I has school… if not it wouldve been like a game where I played around 18+ hours with like 4 hours of sleep
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Makes sense, I like the game which is why im still playing it

Their recent event sucks grinding wise, but the story itself is really good and funny… “Hell’s Chicken” event
Oh rip
Oh yea, whats your friend/company ID so I can add you in the game
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Oh, mine is the reverse lmao, Sinclair is my Number 1 with Homg Lu being my Alternate… though my Hong li is wayyyy better built rn
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
really good story though
A Korean Gacha game, pretty fun game, you play as an Amnesiac Clock that can turn back time for 12 Sinners who are connected to you in some way while traveling on a Bus that eats people for fuel <a:NodBb:561613076844249130> 

the 12 Characters are Fixed, no more or less will be added... so when you gacha, you gacha for their different Identities and E.G.O (literally just Honkai Battlesuits/them from different Mirror World)... 

combat... is a bit hard to explain, but its essentially Clash + Coin Toss Simulator + Sanity til one side runs out of coins and you unga bunga them to death
lol
<:eek:765359367524188161>
same with Seele
anyways, im surprised even though Kafka and Silver Wolf are already in-game, you cant even get them cuz they were limited banner character...
~~Im now in the gacha hell simp phase~~ simping for for Ensemble Stars Character... simping for Limbus Company characters (they are all mad/insane)... simping for a bunch other too...

Im literally about to simp for that twink above... N Corp (Nail Corp) Sinclair... I just Sparked (Pity Store) the chef... as you can see, they are all totally sane and normal
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I think I am finally done with my semi toxic phase thankfully, or at least its now mainly something else
you are wildin Baban
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
lmao
I need Gepard A2 and A6 <:despairge:1045736540875280465> A6 especially cuz thats where all his dmg will come from... A2 so he can actually be a tank
but yea, basically Im assuming unlike Genshin where we unlock MC new form at the start of each region, we unlock them at the end instead
lmao
So not anytime soon
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
during Cocolia Fight, so near end of the first Arc
Gepald... <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
wtf
so they are a proper Tank character
also has Taunt in their kit
Good dps + Shielder
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Fire MC is superior to Phys MC
so another Preservation unit like Gepald
I just realized Fire MC is Preservation and not Destruction <:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
when she weakness break them, she regen energy too so she can Ult again earlier for another turn
yea, Sushang kit is specialized for Break so thief glove for her
yes
correct
<@447218009749061632>
oh, only those 2, yea, ill most likely go Muskeet Glove for Flat Atk + Atk Set... from what I remember, they nerfed the Break Set so depending on who you're building, either one could be better

If its a good shield breaker, then maybe Thief Glove, if they are more Raw Dps, then Muskeet Glove, Hat are useless cuz its Flat Hp
is it only the Clown and Musketeer?
let me see the other Relic options
Any other Relic Options? 

I'll pick Glove because mainstat for Glove is Flat Atk, Musketeer Set is Atk set
alright, let me check which stats the hat and glove have then
lemme double check which stats the Relic can give
Are you allowed to pick 2 or just the one on the images? cuz if its just the one in the image, I am leaning on the Light Cone for long-term stuff

cuz Relics are basically your Genshin Artifacts in HSR
Its gonna be a pain for me to backtrack to it and double check while im in class
can you send the image again?
I'll say all are equally useless, maybe the Attack Set one will be nice, Break Set one is a bit niche, works depending on the character

Idk if they had any other set though... if you want, going for the Flat Stat one is more consistent unless you want to test your luck in getting an Atk% Mainstat one on the Atk Set
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I tried to kill it with my lvl 8 team because I didnt want to raise anyone that wasnt MC or the character I planned on raising
Stole everyone's luck
Taihen is the only exception rn
except Taihen
wouldve been easy 51/300
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
its sad that the starter banner didnt count towards the 300
I just need Luosha or Natasha for my healer
I got cucked for 4*, 5 stars wise, im good ig with Gepard, Yanqing works too if I ever get him
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im fine with any male or female character that isnt a useless dupe or a loli
Im not hating on Yanqing
<a:pat:717159864891342848>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
lmao
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I dont even think I even did that event
anyone bought Monthly Card yet?
<a:petCarv:990307540610990100>
more will apear, they are rare, I love how cute they are, but I'll do anything for gacha
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
if you dont kill it in time, it runs away
yes, poor thing is sad <:KekPat:966625000339668993> I killed it twice, it runs away too when you aproach it
lol
where you got to this? event or from in-game stuff?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Seele super OP too iirc
waow
Welt? Clara?
guess ill be losing 200
oh, I forgot to do Honkai Abyss today
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Taihen lucksac
<:eek:765359367524188161>
yea, there isnt
...
Gepard start <:deadge:975652771082698782> hes cute, but kit is kinda doodoo
same, you basically in the same group as Aegir and me
I guess once I get Natasha, I can use her for healing whenever his shield is down
also, why is Gepard's kit kinda meh... its a worse March 7th Kit ngl...

me repeating myself, like why does he have self-revive but he has no taunt in the first place... Only his Ult shields the team <:deadge:975652771082698782> Skill is a chance to freeze
Nini, you have better luck than me at least ishoke
All my rolls were so scuffed
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>
Lucksac, I need that kind of luck, stop taking away my luck
by who?
but I give nicknames if I cant remember them well enough
yes
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
I got Gerald
I think shes a good healer, well, one of the only character that actually heals
maybe this one too
<:derp:724856219600289853>
well, you get an Avatar
you do
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
ngl, when I look at Gerald's kit, he feels like a worse March 7th <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> Shield on Ult only, while Freeze is on Skill instead, but I guess since Shield is for the whole team, its not too bad
I hope you have better luck than me... I dont want anyone to have my results rn... always pity rn.. 2 were Lightcone 4*... 1 Dupe Da Hen... a Loli and another 4 stars
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
What was everyone's 5* so far, most ive seen is the Twink and Gerald rn
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Thanks
I'll take the guy
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
4th Multi
lmao
this account is so scuffed
wanted to get to rank 15 so that I couldve gotten the last 2 multi done for my 50
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I have to go sleep now, its 2 am
closet event huh?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
not me
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Hook was my first 4*, Loli, I hate it, cuz my 2nd Multi was a Light Cone
nah, im not at my 50 pity yet
for me, im fine with anyone but the loli, game been bullying me since the start
oh
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I dont even have any good account... Gres, are you rerolling?
Cuz its like choosing Signets all over again, but without Ely Ego Signet and its a full team
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
So the Aeons stuff is just ER?
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
a hot dude also works, just give anything that isnt another loli
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
For me, I take a twink over another loli character
I still havent reached my 50 yet, only on 30 rn but thats cuz I took a break to do my hw
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
not a single new male character or anything remotely useful
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Fuck, I hate that my HSR start is so dogshit rn
Theres always ChatGPT
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Hey, cant be worse than mine…

Dahen dupe Multi 3, Natasha Light Cone Multi 2, and a Loli Multi 1… didnt even get Extra copies, just pity 4*
most gacha games or pre-registration game now is just as long as you play around the time of launch before the evet stuff is over, you get all the pre-reg rewards basically... 

heck... some gacha games like Ensemble stars or Limbus Company when I played gave me Pre-Reg rewards (or some form of that) even though its been like over a month
Im still 2 multi away from my guarantee
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Im pretty sure they just auto sends it to everyone regardless
I just exit the game, prob play it tmr or on Thursday cuz I have a lot of hw to do now
also, Ive never used my exploration skills tbh
<:derp:724856219600289853>
How do I even accept friend requests
ty
gave me a loli multi 1, a Light Cone I cant use Multi 2, and now a Dupe for Multi 3
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
this is so rigged wtf
copy pasting works too
Idk about Mobile though, but yea, if its PC client, you can claim codes in-game to make your life easier
I really like the design for male trailblazer tbh, mainly the compass on their side
if you're on laptop, dunno about mobile but you can claim your codes here too
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
The Pre Reg stuff is automatic, sent to your in-game mail which you cant unlock/use til you unlock the gacha
oh, rip
im playing on laptop too rn, im pretty neutral rn
how long did it took you to get enough for 50 pulls? well, I guess 24... since we got 20, and each til 50 only cost 8
you can also redeem it in-game iirc, though I think thats only for PC/Android
<:Razorwao_devonxy:1006146274069839872>
so rn, its Evn, Gresham, and me followed by Baban for the oldest code, with Evn and Gresham having no competition there
rare code
<:derp:724856219600289853>
waow
what happened?
<a:KianaCooking1:653170565519245312>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
None of them were cute boys, I hate it
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Asta is guaranteed yea
L gacha
yea, its why 99% of their side quests are so annoying <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I dont blame them either, especially with Genshin making me hate not having a skip button
they are both cute
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
I actually like Star Rail Female mc design, same for male one
correct, also because I prefer long hair better, if Lumi hair was like Star Rail female mc rn, I would've been happy
I picked Male because I picked Female for Genshin and hated my life for that
did they let it to where you can cancel casting your Ult yet or no?
nice
I got it, like 1-2 cutscenes later, I am now downloading CN dub
^^^
I think it already give your UID
same
^^^
Gresham has quite an early UID woaw
gotta wait, im downloading my CN audio cuz I hate EN Dub
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Well, now its in like 2 hours so ishoke
7 Pm for me, but I have a few essays im supposed to be writing
So whenever I add in a note to remind myself who’s who, it never actually saves in between devices or in general so I then get confused
Cuz Discord Notes Function is stupid and doesn’t actually work
<:shotolurk:892985948382576740>
Ngl, same, I was just backreading and almost thought we had new blood and got shy
alright
because it took me the full 90 pulls on ToT for his initial copy
I need the streamer luck
Do you wanna watch me pull for Luke Bday Card Dupes? I'm prob gonna whale for extra copies too
<@482139585355448333> Taiiiiii, you still awake, I just woke up <:nom:511747449316966400>
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
They got clapped by Bleach, then Oshi no Ko, and now Frieren
poor Aether and Caelus, would be nice if they had 2 male mc and 2 female mc there... since there was Lumine, APHO MC, Stelle, and then Rosa
I remember seeing this yea <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
smh, where did the M and AY go, it should've been May Goth Sex if you reworded it
like if it was another Bow or something, I would've skipped it easily
it has good stats too, so at least it was better than rolling copium
The last time I rolled on this Weapon Banner, it was back when Baizhu first came out for his weapon, I lost for Amos Bow

So then I pulled again this time, and got Furina Weapon... only reason I pulled was because I was fine with both Baizhu weapon and Furina weapon because it looked nice
I get to save for Clorinde and wait for Furina rerun
so tbh, im happy with this
Thank you, I also pulled Yaoyao from this weapon banner too
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
another Sword in my Lists of many 5* Sword even though the only Sword user I use is Bennet and XQ... and sometime Qiqi
Idk why I did this to myseld but yea
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
good luck, ngl, I think with Chasm, Sumeru, and Fontaine, if necessary, I can prob gather enough Primos for Furina if I wanted too but im too lazy
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
im skipping Furina, gonna wait for her Rerun, currently saving for Clorinde
too bad mobile just gets cooked faster
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yea, the Launcher for Genshin is just utter trash
<:derp:724856219600289853>
even longer after entering the game and waiting for it to Verify game files
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
still took another 2 hours though
I tried updating Genshin yesterday, and it took 99 hours to finish... I had to restart my laptop like 2-3 hours later and the download speed fixed itself
the Fanfare Points is the main she can synergize with other healers
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I know, Yae def got better thanks to Dendro and EM Set, but yea, still feel sad about her scuffed kit...

Furina and Kokomi definitely can work well together, but its still ironic she does everything better than Kokomi
being scuffed for being an Inazuma character
my poor Yae
even her Burst doesn't remove her summons
<:Sadge:842131939607183360>
I hate that Furina is just a way better Kokomi... Heal, does dmg, and can actually crit... she also has better QoL Skill than my Yae... can summon all 3 summons that last 30 sec vs Yae individual 3 Totems that only last half that duration
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I know, I heard it does, I actually want to play it but can't
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I'm still at Chasm... don't even have time to play Genshin... just enough to log into the game and then dip
thats a mood
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
im playing on Laptop, but yea, one day, I'll build myself a PC to play Jenshin... Im happy about their new QoL? that actually lets me farm Weekly Bosses I haven't unlocked yet... now my Wrio won't be stuck at Talent lvl 6
I turn on Jenshin and my laptop starts cooking in overdrive
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
For me, its one cooks your device more than the other
<a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620>
alright
nice
<a:pat:717159864891342848>
the hardest part would be flossing your teeth and making sure there isn't leftover food stain stuck in between your braces
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
good luck, ngl, I forgot how long I had to live with my braces before finally getting to wear retainers
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Oh, I was watching this Movie Earlier in another discord server with 90 others
I wish you luck, I have my Art History Exam tomorrow and its so joever for me
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Teri teri landscape
Is that like the new trend
Lumi, that was so fast and instantaneous
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
and I don't want to drive 15-20 min back to get it
oh naur <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> I accidentally drove home and forgot the 2nd part of my order
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
This was such a mood
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
not like I have any pulls for them anyways considering I never played any of genshin's event
oh, sadge, so I guess I can pull for Wriosley and then ignore Furina patch ig
Oh yea, for Genshin, is it just Furina drip marketing? And like the other 4*, or will there be another 5 star dropping later?
pretty much, its already bad enough that Chicago sold their Parking Permit right to essentially another country, we don't need another clown show
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
whats worse if you know some people will still be dumb enough to support that
Real Skill issue
lmao
deserved
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
another Black Butler Season
also surprised about this
ye
nah, Wal's was stated to be the collective despair of all the magical girl, so its not only Homura
its why I said now with headphones and subtitles
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
and with headphones
watch it with subtitles
the one thing I hate most, *undrinkable water*
ah, lovely floods
lol
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I see
...
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
how
like wtf
Glb server was already closed too
GGZ Kiana
yea
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I think he's out of prison, and the first thing he posted was that he was a weeb now, posted a pic with a Pop-up stand of GGZ Kiana
La Chancla > Tate
my area is mostly hispanics so it makes sense why mine doesn't really care about Tate
same
unlucky, my older brother knows of him, he makes fun of Tate too
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Vtuber do be motivating for realsies
my other motivation is because of ~~Shoto~~
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I do need to fix that, like I can casually eat like 2 Double Double, 2 Fries, and a medium drink but still be like at around 100 lb
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
my problem is that I eat a lot, but because I never do any proper exercise, I remain underweight asf
lol, im currently starting to exercise more often now
Im so happy there wasn't any by where I live
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
but yea, theres so much brainrot nowadays, even im not unaffected by it
she just didn't even bother to deal with their nonsense, she remained so calm and respectable before leaving
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
the best part was the Queen that rated him low and proceed to immediately dip from the show right after
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
but proceed to get mad anyways after they rate him low
I also remember another one where it was like some men bringing women to their podcast just to talk shit about the women after asking the women to rate them out of 10 and that they (the host) wouldn't get mad at their rating
oh, I remember this vvid
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
 I prefer chaos like this
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Japan is still in a depressing situation though, with their declining birthrates and everything... especially because of their shitty worklife balance and all they won't let any foreigner make babies with them, as like you know Japan... a lot of Foreigner really fucking love your people
Im over here basically going, omfg, he just them into Fujoshi <:wheeze:833318723565649950>
The girls sometimes even ask him about the boyfriend
yee, cuz even some stories showed kids being quite open about things, like my friend had a picture of Kpop Idols on his Phone Case, the girls was asking who is in those pictures, and he was like, Oh, he's my boyfriend, and some were like, I thought only girls can date boys, etc etc and he told them who says that boys can't like other boys... they were pretty open about it
it was obviously better when they were talking about the stories but yea <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
oh, 100% bad parenting, the Parent came a week later to complain about my friend being racist to the kid while they were saying slurrs left and right
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
apparently, anything race that isn't Black or White doesn't exist for him
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
afterall, I never had a black kid call me white when im Asian... legit one of my friend had a black kid say essentially, Of course you white $%$%$ would be racist to me (My friend is Hispanic and all he said was telling the kid to stop bouncing the ball during the Assembly)... 

My friend started pointing at other kids, asking what race he thinks they were, and he pointed to (2 Hispanic Kid and 1 Asian Kid) and that Black Kid called them all White
I legit sometime question that I had it easy during my time
its umm... interesting, like at least 3 of my irl 3 friends teaches at a School... they give the most interesting and crazy stories about them
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
don't worry love, we can all suffer together
oh my professors are making fun of the Classes our college/uni gives btw:

Basically saying, Hey, these data shows that these Jobs/Career are on the rise, maybe we should guide our student to those Jobs/Career to fill the gap and allow them to have the skills to do well in our society

School - Nah, we are too above that to do that, we gonna just let them do whatever they want, even if no one fucking need to be a History Major or English Major for 99% of everyday Jobs/Career but still make it a Requirement anyways
so my classes kinda partially got fucked by that too
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
btw, I thought I was an accounting Major but im apparently a Business Major
So I just kinda gave up on that shit
don't worry, I want to work toward getting a CPA, proceed to find out that I still need to take a shit more classes/units on Business and Accounting, meaning I have to spend at least another year or so if I want to get the requirement for the CPA exam...
...
even jobs that aren't been taken by AI are still shit, like I'll go for a interview, it turns to a video interview, and then I have to contact them again later on to remind them: hey, I applied for your job, fucking check your applications ffs
People be making tiktok of them being at war
ngl, if the army were to draft people that isn't already trained and discipline, its gonna be so goofy ah because of how stupid our generation are
it is
<:sigh:988710210992472084>
You are just digging your own grave
thats different
oh, I don't think Heki would defend himself
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
that really is something Heki would do
all for a prank
though it doesn't help when people do challenges like stealing another person's pet... or pushing someone into the sidewalk which if a car went by, that random bystander would've been run over...
true
<:derp:724856219600289853>
people die just to do a stupid Tiktok challenge
Imagine having Common sense nowadays ig
Like anyone with basic sense knows its a stupid idea
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
My greatest question was who TF allowed Chicago to sell their Parking Meter Rights to a basically a Arabic bitch... for **75 YEARS** for like 1 Billion... which btw, they made all that money back from the Parking Meter Right they bought in less than 2 years from the same Parking Meter Right
its to the point that even the republican hate themselves
honestly watching a republican and democrat debates is just brain rot
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
the Southern States are so racist and so deprived that according to Pornhub, the Southern states searches up Black Porn the most
its depressing, the US Govt is still deadge asf, back then, other than Japan, the US was prob the closest to the one that can reach unity (like with Pearl Harbor) and now our own Govt are just too busy fucking each other over
well, its dead as can be because if it was a thing, North Korea wouldn't be as shit of a country as it is til now... its a literal dystopia over there... the Nukes doesn't help either, same for infrared Googles
same
 I'm just looking at this Sarcastic Video <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
*looks at the Australian Govt as an example*
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
they can lower the prices and everything just by placing more budget on making more affordable things, but they are just trying to milk as much profit as possible even though the owners already have billions of dollars and can evade tax because they open it in a 3rd world country
Doesn't help that Oil Company opening up more shit and ruining the environment even though there are way better alternatives available
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
thats humans for you
<:huh:966619839307321394>
??!?!?!??
what?
why?
how?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
since magic Armor is much harder to get than weapon early game imo
should've fed him the useless weapon instead
yea, thats why I said it was a waste to feed him your hat, it was a good hat
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I like how it looks but as how Aoi said, gotta wait for actual gameplay to see if I'll like it or not and how they will do their customizations (if it has any) or what will the gacha be like
Mostly copies their facial feature, tbh, im not sure what a dickhead would look like for it either
They just take the facial feature ig, lemme find some variants
Tbh, the snail copy the face of the person they are speaking to anyways or the person who they were modeled after
Cursed asf
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
At least from that angle
Den den Mushi is the Cycrance, but yea, it does look awkward
Theres a Telephone wire there, but it does look like he was blowing at its behind from afar though
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Those snails are just mimics ngl
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Its like those weird old school telephone, but snails
hewwo, lemme grab something for my younger brother and we can start the discord call
<@482139585355448333> just ping me whenever you're ready
Add in some more Critical Fail rolls when you have 3 different modifier rolls and you failed a check on your best stat
Lmao
Indeed He
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Btw, he literally does all of that to transform into a Shrimp costume
Alright
Done with my own errand, <@482139585355448333> When do you wanna play BG3? now? In a few hours? Gib time approx <a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
I’ll prob be back in at most an hour, but its prob gonna be less than that
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Alright,but first lemme go to a Auto Paint Shop to check the price and get quote on the cost to repaint/fix the paint on my car

Last night, I accidentally fucked up the front right rear of the car
Theres even multiplayer so if we wanted, we can also start a new game together and play a new game with each other
I agree
D

I just woke up, anyways, Taiiiiiiii, I saw that you also got ~~Balding~~ Gate 3 how was it for you
It did, and I got so shocked out of it
why? it was basically my last multi, while for Anni, it took basically hard pity
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
<@482139585355448333> I got him in 30 pulls, I was so poor after the 100 Anni pull I had to do for a single Luke copy, so that was kind of them to balance things out
Sanest VC chat

I always sleep through the concert
<:COPIUM:897281976317411378>
but I still have to pull for multiple copies
its like equivalent to if they decided to add in a new Valk Rank like they did with SP Valk but now its for S rank
Love the card though
oh yea, the new SSS Card rarity, I hate it
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Wao
I was reading it yes
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
prob not, it just came back a while ago
<:derp:724856219600289853>
another server is the same rn for me
<:derp:724856219600289853> Whats happening, did a server get nuked or something? Anyone here have something similar happening as well?
Went to wallmart today and this is what I see when I went shopping for Car shade stuff

When the Actor in real life looked more like Nami than her playing as Nami
smh
Usop doesn't even have his long pinochio nose either
Zoro also sounded so dead inside
yea, its why I said I hated the dubbing
I don't even have neflix so ima avoid it like the plague
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
but thats because I hate the dubbing
I knew it was coming sooner or later but I fucking hate it

we should but only issue is finding the time when people are free to be able to play Uno for that long
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
omg that would so so so fun
YES
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
same, I just want a game that lasts for hours because we never get the right card/colors and everyone +4 each other to oblivion
lmao
though I said I got the steam version recently that was like in 2022, steam said last time I played it was Sept of 2022
Im waiting for when we get a 2v2 TCG Invocation or 1 v 1 v 1 v 1
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
omg, I would want to join too, ngl, I played Terraria back in mobile version, got the Steam one recently, and got myself a workhop to give me all my gears back because I can't be bothered to start from the very beginning unless im going to start a new run with my friend
They just kinda disapeared and was a bit unstable, wasnt really close friend so not like he could do much about that
sounds like one of my friend's friend when they did the same but it wasnt after a month but 3 years <:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Twitch ads are hell
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>

It isnt as bad as Twitch Ads though
lol
lol
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
are they doing the how many people can unfollow me challenge and burn my account to the ground? He truly be walking the Path of Destruction, maybe he'll get isekai'ed next time
tbh, calling Da Heng gay doesn't sound much of an insult <:KEK:1024468566835204137> then again, the wording they use is prob worse than that
Waow
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
which one they insult? March? Da Heng? Himeko v2? Welt?
who they insult this time?
lmao
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
The fuck is all this bullshit lmao, it legit changes nothing
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
My question is whats the point of the username change bs
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I guess makes it easier for us to impersonate each other?
Oh that, I dont even know the point in doing that tbh
And no weapon
Now I have 2 5* Bow ill never use
I shouldve gone for his C1, I went for the weapon and the game told me I was pushing my luck and gave me the bow instead
lost to weapon banner though

rng is already sad enough to deal with
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
having dodge chance would be nice, but I dont want to deal with enemies also dodging my attacks
im fine with no dodge, no defend is my main sadge
even if I cant get him from the gacha, I can guarantee getting him from the Shop
Im ready to get him basically instantly
yea, its my favorite so far
<:EiMiko_Hug_starleowo:975062835061202985>
<@171082989046988800> I know you don't play the game anymore, but I still want to show you the trailers for some of the latest unit, this one being Sinclair and Don

Im listening the Senti/Kiana part rn
but its fun to watch regardless
nope <a:runNezukorun:1065703033259970671>
can you link me to it?
do you still have any clips or vid of that?
honestly, you dont even need to cry, just being respectful is good enough

imagine blaming strangers on the internet too <:KekPat:966625000339668993> you are asking for suffering there because there are always worse one out there
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
how many times now that he told ppl to kys when they gave him SC
so he told another one to kys?
so he just admitted that hes only playing for clout... thats essentially 95% of the things that give people a reason not to watch him... no one wants to watch someone play a game only for clout
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I should hear some clips tbh, I wanna know what they sound like
I love it when he tried to distract them, he just added more fuel by stating they overworked their editors, did he say that jokingly at least? since some streamer I know do the same with their editor in a joking manner


and for the acting weak <:eek:765359367524188161> if streaming Genshin non stop makes you tire, stream another game instead smh
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
<:derp:724856219600289853>
that I know, but the overworking part was what confused me
<:huh:966619839307321394> ?
overworking his editors?
anyone one the internet long enough with a brain knows that apologizing is just giving people more bullets to shoot them with <:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
honestly, their biggest mistake was apologizing, if he was going to apologize at least dont do it half heartedly either smh

He couldve let the flames died out but instead decided to fuel it
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
you were talking in VC?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
you should ping me to for that, I like listening to drama <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Lemme go turn on my laptop then and grab my headphones
Yes?
I know a lot of people really like Kaeya
<a:KianaCooking1:653170565519245312>
Shouldve insulted Zhongli, that would be great way to get completely annihilated
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Oh, lmao
Which character did he talk about for Genshin anyways? The only one I really care about is Baizhu, Cyno, Razor, Yae and Ningguang rn
HSR will cause it to be burnt to a crisp
The forest is burning brightly
Its gonna be another wildfire
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
Per minute…
<a:KEKWlaugh:843918348893814795>
Yea, which is quite easy tbh
I think even I have at least a lvl 1 Bilibili account even though i cant understand jack shit on that site
Lmao
Even not saying anything would make it less obvious
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Yea
What an awful way to word that
They prob worded it in a way not to get themselves in trouble im assuming?
Omfg <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Ohhhhhh
?
Adding wood to the flames, and even blowing it
Well, thats another way to start a wild fire
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
…
Im not too attached to Genshin char except for like 3-4 specific characters
Yes please, mainly Honkai since im more active there
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
You dont ever mess with fangirls
Rosa is a Rose, and Roses have thorns
Yep
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Oh, thats how you start a wildfire
Im neutral about everyone but Luke, but I do agree its feels like sht to have all your favs get insulted <:eek:765359367524188161>
I was waiting to pull out the blick for that
<:Michidelete:976242471208091708>
Lmao
Thanks
Everything burnt yet or are they still cooking it?
<:huh:966619839307321394> do tell me, this seems quite entertaining

Oh, a normal one

The only difference is who starts the friendly fire first
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
It is fate
Impossible Love, probably because everytime we will cause friendly fire <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
if only my Pag M luck was that good back then
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>

<:JingYuan_Sleep:1084670039485071361>
Oshi no Ko just caused me not to sleep, thats all

Nice
Any Lovecraftian Elritch Horrors?
Yea, I decided to delay watching it when I saw it was over an hour long… ended up staying past midnight watching it on speaker
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
So many depressing things except Konosuba
I thought this season would be a nice break season til next season with just Hell’s Paradise, but then I realized all the good anime this season too like Oshi no Ko, Heavenly Delusion, and Konosuba Megumin Spin-off
time to take my shower, wash my tears away, and sleep
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
the voice acting, visuals, and everything was just on point with the build-up
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I just finished watching the episode...
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I should watch it soon
Had Mihole been smort with their decision, I wouldn’t have skipped Nahida for Baizhu had she been 2nd banner

<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>

<a:gf_pat:1077167310219006012>

1 MMO has gacha for cosmetics
others are~~ MMO games~~
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
you can see some of them from my bluestack emulator here
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I just remember it was actually 4 other gacha actively, I missed 1 cuz its partially an idle gacha game, its the Tower of God: Great Journey
I would add Summoner Wars, E7, Date a Live, Chain Chronicles, The Alchemist Code, Gun Girl Z, Hero Cantare...

these were some I still play occasionally for like a month+ straight each time I get back on...
my gacha hell used to be worse
ToT is card collector... Bungou is Marbles, and Legendclo is Tactical turn base
Tears of Themis, Bungou Stray Dog: Mayoi, and like Legend Clover
other than Genshin/Honkai, im playing 3 other gacha game actively too
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
just wished there was an auto button
I do like turn base combat
im not sure if ima play HSR tbh, i have a bit too many gacha games rn... i'll prob be super casual ig
I got Mika in 1 multi so im happy rn, im 2 multi into pity so when Baizhu arrive next, im mostly good to get C0
ty
im still playing cuz why not... im waiting for Baizhu in Genshin and then I can retire completely from Genshin
not like HoFin had any good deals cuz of HoO banner
I like HoFin, but Trio Herrscher was too costly for me, especially since i was also going for Sushang gears + saving for HoHe skin was more important
since I couldn't get HoFin
I just want new Hua suit to let me not care about HoFin
I want new Hua too
I hate how HoS S2 is leaderskill bs when every other rank up I know had leaderskill at S3 instead
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
SS PE and HoS
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
im looking at these people slacking and ready to snipe while staying at 425~ pts
balded better rng
if you cant QTE for the head start, just Ult and spam her Charge Attack as often as you can as Lumi said
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I just proc Griseo QTE into Ult ad spam her CA for bleed
yep, its even worse when im close to her but it still misses anyways andnot proc
for me, its worse when I use HoS evasion to attack the clone fo time fracture and games like nah 3-4 times in a row
HoS SP was good thanks to Neb PRI
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I keep running out of SP for Griseo
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
this is too much for me
I hate Bleed Vill V
ty
but 4/4 max PRI for both Dudu
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
so 3/4 no max PRI
no MPE because shes PRI-less
ima die miserably in Nirvana... do I use Bkek or ~~PE~~ forgot if Abyss Vill-V is QUA or typeless
I hate it
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I fucked up and accidentally locked my Avocado M to Clock so I had to settle with 2-3 sec off
ill prob get bottom 10 once HoFin shills occur
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
though ill still get back like 1-2 rot later
oh yea, true
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yep, very lucky
2 cycles if no one snipes me ig
rip, I got stuck at 542 I think, and im prob staying for another cycle to suffer
im just suffering with this rn
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Im just going ask a question to whoever feel like responding to this. So I am in the process of researching information and completing a report on a Career for my BUS-310 class.

If you are in the Business Management field or something similar, would it be possible to schedule a 20-30 min appointment to ask you a few questions to help me learn more about your field and complete my research? If you are, please DM me so that we could work out a time during this week preferably or next week to do the meeting.
Btw Neko, how was your Kalpass Mald, I just got to T3 for my bracket after malding for a while, did you get to see how Kal ruin my run every single time?
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
....
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
oh, it was the bonk image but its gone so Carlbot breaking
<:huh:966619839307321394>

Ooooo me also has game
project zomboid?
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Manga is Seinen, and chapters are released monthly <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Yea, but do try watch the Flashback episode because they aren’t in the Manga but is really important too <a:NodBb:561613076844249130> 

 this was the 2nd trailer for their Season 4, you can see a lot of things happening while also not knowing wtf is going on XD…there is CC subtitles for English
Even if you dont watch it, the manga is really nice…

At least anime wise, the flashback episode are really good considering they are adapted from the light novel while the main story comes from manga
1st Season is Ass but 2nd Season After for the anime is goated, we on 4th Season rn

Its a manga adaptation but starting from Season 2 onward, the first 3-4 Episodes of the season were adaptations of the Light Novel which the manga does not have
Dont worry, i wont do it often XD

Btw have you seen or read Bungou Stray Dog?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
So to make you watch, i can only spam clips?
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Why you hate watching?
Lmao
Oh
I watch and read
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I watched subs so i dont have to suffer from that
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
the luna hatsune miku skin prophecy was too much for Carv's pc
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
ngl, I wouldve just eaten the strips of meat by itself
yee
Btw, these are only 1 time stages, clear them, get loot and move forward, it gets harder each stage you clear

But it also increases the Weekly Cap on the S-Chips you can get per week from the Temple (Abyss) per week as well
Cuz it gives a good chunk of S-chips
Yes and no for me <:KekPat:966625000339668993> because I never have enough stamina, but my Weekly Premium Currency is nice
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Whats nice about the game is thats its pretty slow, so you dont have to worry too much about missing anything
Its in the NXX study room, you prob have but its been a while
So leveling your R cards isnt bad either
Most of your hp comes from this and your levels
Itshoke, you’ll be fine, you’ll have to level up more ig
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Oh rip, no SR either?
I was early game since I joined the patch right after Luke’s Bday which made me sad AF
Feelsbadman, XD thankfully the event itself is not too hard, with decent Luke SR cards you can pass the event… I did that for Marius (Rich kid) afterall since I have 0 Marius SSR
<a:Whale:557787005959012352>
<a:gf_pat:1077167310219006012>
what you cook?
While this is for SSR, only 1 Artem Card, not a single Marius SSR <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
All my Luke cards
It was the same with the first one too, choose Marius/Vyn route, can only use their cards and try to finish the event
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
The Event, you choose between 2 routes that’s available, so Artem or Luke… 

you can only use their cards for that entire route, then once you’re done you can switch to the next route and do the same
Luke’s Birthday, so around December <:deadge:975652771082698782> but you get that long of a time to save for it
lol
unironically, Bakerton Artem is really pretty for Rosa, prob one of my Fav Rosa card
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
2nd Anni cards are the most sus... same for most Vyn's card lmao
cant see Rosa face in this one though
I go for Luke so im fine for the most part, some might be sus but most were wholesome
<:draculaLUL:892683720870481922>
oh
Luke is my Kosma but for Tears of Themis
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
I love Luke
im happy with all my Luke cards, too bad I cant get em all, might have to skip FFT cuz 2nd Anniversary and Luke Solo afterward... Bakerton + Bday gonna make me bled too
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Rosa extra cool
Year 4 sadly, but its really cool
Rosa is nice
<:cattoblush:675924852598636544>
its for Luke Bday card... 3rd Bday are all smol version
Luke Simp
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I just want Luke
 heres the link for the schedule ish if it follows CN
Banner came out like today/yesterday depending on your timezone... but yea, I bled for those cards... 

after this should be Vyn solo banner, Marius Bday... then another Vyn/Luke duo for FFT (Furry Fun Time)... then 2nd Anni... followed by Luke Solo... etc
rn, its Luke and Artem Rate up, cuz its Cozy Couple Getaway Part 2

Part 1 was Vyn and Marius
At least I won 50/50 for it… not looking forward to Furry Fun Time nor 2nd Year Anni banners though
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Good to know that I still bleed put doing gacha in any Mihole gacha games
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
no, its simp for your men day, the opposite of simp for your lady day
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Hunter x Hunter was prob on the same or worse level
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
oh, just veteran? i thought thats on easy medium
<:10_10Bb:769043694463614996>
Waow
yea, ty
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Its sad, they dun even give us the option to pick CG and then just delete the other CG option to save space… not like they haven’t done that with Genshin or Tears of Themis or any other where you can download the additional language content
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Because it just messes up my immersion
It annoys me that I cant choose my CG language… like ill be listening to everything im CN and it still forces JP CG and I just die on the inside
basically gives 2 stack automatically when ulting and another stack every 0.5 sec for 1.5 sec afterward
C1
not my Itto btw, cuz me no have him nor C6 Benny
new bugs for Dehya kept being found too iirc <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I posted the vid here b4
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
the irony is when Pyro Itto does around the same dmg as against C6 R5 Dehya using the same team
it only costed me 3 multi for 4/4 HoO, it was such a good deal, for HoFi, you'll get them from normal gacha or off rates anyways smh
there there~
<a:gf_pat:1077167310219006012>
congrats
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I was confused for 1 second
oh, the Seele skin
???
true KEKW
cuz they can and was just showing how a Pyro Itto who is geo be stronger than Dehya lmao
from my friend ^
when pyro itto do better dmg than Dehya
lmao
her ost is indeed a bop, i really like it
is it the initial hit or the coordinate attack?
what does this mean btw
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
100% Sleep Books and exploding Globe
cuz it was modded Elden Ring
 there was this one too where you can see me die briefly on screen
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
 I got beaten up to death by books in Elden Ring
me skipping Finality because I can cope against using Trio team and just be fine without Kiana
anyways, at least next patch ill only have to spend 9.8k xtal for Ely skin and thats about it
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
why was this luck way better than my Sushang luck
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
had to wishing Well B
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
spent 28k xtal this patch cuz of Sushang... 11.2k (4 multi) for 4/4 HoO... but spent 16800 xtal for 3 Sushang T stigmata
oh, i havent even started on the event cuz ill be busy doing my hw today
ty, gonna sleep a bit then
very pretty greatsword, can i unlock it and r5 it in a day or no?
what a great stream
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
lmao
booba

Why….

I love and hate the new image system
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
thats a new low
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
shes worse than Xinyan too
thats somehow worse than Qiqi/Diluc
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Who would've thought that we finally have a character to be afraid of losing 50/50 to again
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
when Dehya somehow is even worse than her doompost
so pretteh waow
<:cattoblush:675924852598636544> <:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
I forgot to do MA this week
and then they still block off the shipping by saying that I am not allowed to buy it/ship it... cuz I tried with more Charms and it rejected me
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
so i cant buy anything from them, and they tell me so by adding in a 9999 Chinese Yuan Shipping fee
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I know, its been there for quite a while now, but I dont think the taobao shipping situation is gonna get better anytime soon
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Baizhu, prob the only time ill get back on Genshin and then leave after pulling him
Ai and Captain are going to Hyperion to help stray cats (forgot if last number of my height was 6 or not)
At least Hua, Teri and Seele looks like their color palette will remain consistent like their older battlesuit
Sounds about right, and I hate it
Rerolling for 2-3 days straight for a game ill prob only play for 2-3 weeks til Octopath Traveler 2 and HSR
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I think I know another reason why my luck this patch was good, I was rerolling in another game so ive just been flushing away all my bad luck there
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
I told you HoTr just didn't like me... this made up for last patch
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
got Bkek from Dorms... I wanted AE so that I could SSS her <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
not like ill use it over my time runner
Im only at like 120 for spending event... and yea, same, this patch spending event outfit is kinda ass anyways
cuz spending event
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
but yea, now im a bit sad cuz I expected to spend more
mine was Hua and Judah PRI
smort
Games telling me to skip HoFin and wait for Hua <a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
4/4 HoO in 3 multi
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I forgot about the Stig Box
I did a 4th Multi cuz I was an idiot
<:KekPat:966625000339668993> full set in 30
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Just means more time for me to save
I dont need Context, all I need to know is that I need save new Hua Suit and Judah PRI
Too bad I saw Hua, so now its a Gurantee skip for me except for the HoO refund banner this patch
*Looks at my solo SS SW pulls vs 110 for barely S1 HoTr*
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
But rather than stealing luck, its more like you get a luck debuff cuz we dont get any luck from it either
Tbh, thats sounds about right
I’ll join to watch after a quick shower
Ty
ty
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Well, that means I now know the 2 characters I will be simping for (for both Female and Male char)
include school + Elden Ring + Minecraft and im just dead
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
currently playing 4 gacha games actively... actually, make that 5 now... wait, 6 since I need to go back to a game tmr to check the new banner
im happy HSR isnt out yet for me because of all the gacha games ive been playing recently
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
<:KEKW:788545502961729547>
ishoke, cant be shorter than Genshin's lolis
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
reminds me of the people who cosplay as Maid Xiao and other maid characters
beautiful
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Me talking about 5*
^^^
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
you are correct here
nope
nice, free rerolls til I get the man I want to simp for
<:run:1065680602168299530>
Ima just go play minecraft instead and not suffer through those
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Sushang only 4* here, waow
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
but 99% of their max hp and not current hp makes me wonder if you can die from drinking it
sounds really useful
i actually unironically want that
<:KEKW:788545502961729547>
I only saw the honkaianni2 part
meonhonkaianni2
sorry Carv
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
the subtitles blocked my view
meonhonkaianni2
meonhonkaianni2
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Carv is fast
I’ll just say 90 stamina
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
I cant grammar
I take it over the drinks
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
So it was 3 potion
you mean 3 stamina pots
^^^
scam indeed
lmao
I get on the game once every 1-2 year when im bored
still same issue with Ulting though, you cant animation cancel/skill cancel your Ult after you select it
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
at least flop rail cant be worse than tower of flop rn
...
still in Beta baban, but the actual release is not that far away
I dont want to download another web browser tbh
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
sounds like a pain
doesnt work for me, which ad blocker did you use?
its so annoying
now I have to go through 4 ads because of twitch
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
53% away
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
my friend has a 90-95% Crate Childe who miss all 3 crit for his Ult on on all separate Ruin Guards,
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
you can always quit the game after you are bored anyways
play what you want
almost had it but oh well <:deadge:975652771082698782> Sushang got a good pose but not SW
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I thought they would’ve use Sus since HB is range but ig her hitcount is better
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
<:concern:966623298639261746>
So many copers
Im in RL bouncing so it doesnt matter to me tbh
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Been busy with homework and couldnt check, and can I just use PE?
Whats the new weather?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I wouldve had some cool one if I knew but im too dumb
waow
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
tbh, I prob couldve recorded some of the really cool scenes but yea... its because I just have a habit of using the discord Gif search for my gif
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
how do you make gif anyways?
like if some are doing QTE together and whatnot
ye, especially when for some, the animation still just goes on
I really like these kind of win screen over the regular one XD ngl
Its very entertaining ngl
Since its almost closing time, the people there are just watching league on the tv
It was in a restaurant
<:kekw:803302409707061285>
Even the employees are watching it rn
League OP
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
then theres me whos super slacc in the event
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
and then I just left the game, ngl, it feels like pulling on Honkek foca but with shittier off rates and you have to pull for dupes
It took me til Hard Pity to get her
true
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
me who dont even know what this event is because I havent been on the game cuz school
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I legit open discord on mobile and first thing i saw was Eva
<:ning_angry:777037112746311696>
congrats
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
ugly sword
<a:petCarv:990307540610990100>
...
that should tell you how trash my internet at home is
my school internet is like 10-17x the speed of my home internet <:KekPat:966625000339668993> from 30-50 MB/s vs 3 MB/s
found her, theres actually 2 with Teri whos staring at them
cuz shes like Sakura who also doesnt have her fox ears, this is the normal human world where Honkai doesnt exist
this is so cute
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Yes and no, I cant imagine how much time you have to do all of that when I havent even unlocked Chasm yet
Thanks
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
I took a picture of it like a few min ago and got it in an angle where it looked the most ugly and creepy
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I myself dunno if its a rat, a cat, or actually a rabbit
<:chorry:966005898013192203>
And heres your reward
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
basically Kosma is like Luke in her doujin, so that means that I basically simped for the same character which was Luke and Kosma
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I simp for Luke and Kosma and griseo just makes a reference to them both
Happy Lunar New Year
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
nah, she was prob volunteering knowing how many of those there were that she burned away
yee
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
ngl, im pretty sure griseo's doujin is a reference to Tears of Themis as well
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Watch we have to wait til March 7th of 2024 to get the official release of Star Rail
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
my bracket rn... I just got sniped by 5 SpA
<:chorry:966005898013192203>
also to make my OCs which are taking inspiration from Lovecraftian and some Lovecraftian inspired CN novels as references
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I have Tarot cards too but I tend to use them for random things because I dont need them for love
regardless, even if I can't give any advice about love, I will still wish you the best of luck
<:TeriTeehee:1061942177921519736>
yesn't
I don't know anything about love, and I prob wont even care much about it because as you've seen, I have my share watching of love drama happening and my life is too dead rn to care about love
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
hopefully, you can find some, for me, even for my close friends, we don't talk much, but when we do, we always find a way to hang out with each other and reconnect with each other and kinda talk about what's been happening in our life
thankfully, most of my really close friends are not the exhausting kinds, only the one I kinda talk to occasionally
basically my friend group were like my close close friends, friends/classmates and then acquaintances
so we got tired and stopped caring
im not that close to that one but most of us got tired of her drama afterward because 99% of us were like after the few break-ups, we were like Hey, just take a break, you don't need another man, etc, just take a break for now instead, in less than month, they get a new boyfriend and the cycle repeats,
so its not their fault for the first one, the 2nd one deserved it
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Oh the worse part is that none of us actually knew that til the last year of high school, which was how they broke up
oh, its unironically worse than that... for instance, for one group of them, basically the boyfriend basically believed that he could fix them (the person he's dating) because the one he was dating identify themselves as a man rather than woman... another just basically had love drama literally every year, and somehow a break-up every year... etc
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
just gib me the cat, I dont need Diona there
other than maybe like 1-2 friends I know, the rest had their relationship ruined one way or another
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
also because all my friends I know with their relationship going to hell like 3-4 years later
oh dont worry, I say love is <:deadge:975652771082698782> because I really cant be bothered with it tbh, for those who have time for love, I wish them the best of luck in a stable relationship that last for a long time
for me, all constellation are incompatible; love is too deadge for me <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
good luck there Evn...
...
which I will do
correct, and no <:deadge:975652771082698782> my karmic retribution was telling me to keep my AE alive longer
shut it, this is by far my worse Bronya luck, which helps my bias in saying shes not the Bronya I know or care about <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I hate HoTr for trying to replace my AE and her ok design... ngl, I like HoR and SW design better <:KekPat:966625000339668993> the mech she stole from Kallen is still cool though at least


HoO I just hate in general as compared to HoT

HoFin is basically my Time Runner but as an actual unit and not a skin
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I pretty much hate the Trio except for maybe HoFin, which is also the only S rank of the trio where I have to gacha for both unit and gear without any bonus or discount
I dont even like HoTr, I already have SS SW, and 4/4 SoE HoR, I aint going 190 for HoTr when shes already 4/4
yay
I should be able to get my school money this week
hell nah <:PeepoEek:716899871210340393>
not even s2 <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
and her hair there actually looks good unlike HoO
Mei does have good drip
I hate their eyes outside of Bronya's cuz that eye is basically the same eyes as SW
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Prob the 2nd or 3rd time Heki successfully made me gacha and whale
Heki became my Devil advocate to gacha, they did the same for one of my older gacha session too
Seems normal enough, Cunny Role
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
6S PRI shouldve saved her like with Yae, but nope, somehow Tranquil PRI was just even more cope
All Kallen suit deserved better
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Lmao, but thats so true, cuz HoTr mecha form is just Kallen’s Ult
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Hai
The pawn pieces, mannequin, and strings are really nice, I can see all the connections too
Gonna use my AE and then snipe later with HoTr once I get her weapon
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
Yea, quite lucky I got to sleep against the Quantum weather during Nirvana bouncing and then go back into Ignite Weather where I finally have Chrono Navi to make HoF useful
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
And I couldnt even clear the side stage… for MA, I was at 1.14% because I was missing HoTr PRI for Bella
Oh, I fell off from Nirvana thankfully cuz it was QUA weather and I have 0 usuable Quantum characters except for FR
It was such a dogshit weather, Dodge timing for Blackhole
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Phys team is PE Dudu and Bkek, which for some reason could not clear the Phys Side stage last Abyss in Nirvana
My fire team is just gonna be HoF and later HoFin <:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Then theres me whos going to be using HoF
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Ty, the right one did look like it was just pepega ai art or just L art compared to the one on the left for comparison
Which one is the plagiarism? The one of the right?
<:PiKek:973573411911659540> i just left Nirvana so its ok, cuz I couldn’t clear side stage last weather either
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
<a:StabbyDed:576647937371668486>
Same
i was actually malding how I got to Wave 5 and then the timer was up
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
this Abyss, I slept cuz it was Nirvana and I couldn't clear the Phys Side stage even with 4/4 PE Dudu, 4/4 HoS, and 4/4 Griseo
At that point, I wouldve just pulled on her banner before reaching that point
<:MissMeWithThatSht:561649397650161664>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I know, don't rub salt on me, my HoTr luck is dogshit so at least let me gloat on the actual Gear Luck
sorry, 15
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
it took me 15 pulls for Kissy and Bronya MB
nice, how much did it took you
getting Kissy is super nice
anyways, only 12 cards which is good enough for me
I hate HoTr
just 1 more multi for S1 + Weapon
just need 1 more multi for 4/4 HoTr
I can use her stig box so now I have 3/4 HoTr
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
pulling for HoTr went to hell, while getting her gear was super good
getting her is shit
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
wtf
got Kissy and M piece... so my gear luck for her is unironically good
only 12 pulls
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
unironically decent off rates
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
2 pulls for kissy, hey, I finally have this weapon
since if I commit to HoO gear banner, thats already ~25k for Spending Event, and then ill have to gear HoFin too
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
tbh, im not that worried about the spending event next patch cuz ill be forced to spend anyways for HoFin and her gears after pulling for HoO gears
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
just debating to myself rn whether to pull for HoTr gear this patch or next patch... technically only need 1 more T/M or Weapon and ill have 4/4 HoTr with the box at 110
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
true that
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but doesn't talk about pulling her gears in 6.3
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
for 120 pulls?
80 Refund 40?
for HoO banner, how much is the Refund?
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
mine will be S1 at 110 because of the Fragments
while HoTr is like, S0 at 83
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
SoE took me 1 multi, SS SW was within 110, etc
same but with HoTr
I have 19 Foca + 15 Foca/Expa Cards for 6.4... I can prob do 1 more multi if I want to maybe get 4/4 HoTr this patch... or I can wait until next patch for her Expa Select cuz of Spending Event
got it
oh, you did 2 multi
yea, i know weapon box is 110
isnt 150 the box?
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
now I need to do 110 for Box and S1
you're luckier than me, I went til 83 for S0 HoTr
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i try to use HoT QTE but gets bodied because I proc Time Frac wrong or used her weapon active so I have to wait til the attack was done
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
the worse part is when I accidentally press her weapon active while in Mecha mode which fucks up all my QTE
I still dont know how to play HoTr
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:catblush:963351912235810826>
AE lives yet again
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
my HoTr does not exist until next patch
also 42 (45 with this patch) Dorm Tickets
I have 19 Foca Tickets and 15 Foca/Expa Tickets for next patch <:deadge:975652771082698782> so HoO gears and HoFin gears shouldn't be too cope
I got HoTr Bot Stig in 3 single<:deadge:975652771082698782> which is just as important, but now, I need her Weapon, T, or M piece next patch... that way, I can use the 2 box for either the Weapon, T, or M piece to get 4/4 later
basically i got therapy from Taihen to suffer this patch to suffer next patch but not as much once I get 4/4 HoTr
I can get 3/4 HoTr, but ill still be suffering way more than just suffering now for 4/4 HoTr ig
oh, Heki made me do 20 more, i just now need 10 left for the 110 box... and still suffer until next patch cuz i need the Foca for 4/4 HoTr if I get lucky for M,T or Weapon
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
my HoTr til next patch
I love both JP and CN dub
a cour is just a part of the season... so like for instance, Spy Family is 24-25 episode long... but it is split into 2 Cour, meaning though its just 1 Season, there is 2 part because they took a break before the next Season came out
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
btw, whats better, HoTr weapon or her 3p set
Lmao, yea, they prob didnt know, these one are worse than the Genshin one <:kekpalm:901574024830791690>
Actually 0.99 cent
1 penny
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Which means I need 1 multi left
While I did 80, with 0 HoTr til Heki got me to do more so now im going til 110
Just Rebooting getting 3 HoTR in 3 Multi and now have SS1 HoTr
Tai can see it but thats about it
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
Btw, that vid better stays in this server
Bleeding on the inside and outside
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
I’ll just do 1 more multi and then go for Griseo outfit and im done for this patch… also have to buy the BP which is another 20$
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Need to find a new job/internship now i lost my current one
So I end up with excess funds
But for the most part, im such a cheapskate that I use them all for basic school sht, and only buy the textbook if i cant find a free online pdf version and etc
Obviously i still use it for school
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Me school financial aid money meant for gas and school supplies usually end up as my year long Honkek Whale money
But yea, School check, please come soon so I can whale more next patch
<a:StabbyDed:576647937371668486>
No you wont
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Im complaining about HoTr still
I happy about that
Im not complaining about S1 HoS
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I just got HoS to S1
Yea, HoS/Sus Fragments
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
BP frame that version is just really good ngl
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Plus my own whaling that patch
Its fine, but yea, ill still be whaling for Griseo outfit, I still have 15 Choice Cards, and 19 Equip Cards so i should be good there for HoO refund banner
K, good enough for me
That’s excluding BP/Monthly card right?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
So -6400 xtal, how much can we get this patch?
Around 3.6k max if you do it right
Less than that if you do it proper
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
How many xtal can you get in this version? Minus the 2800 and however much I would need yo get Griseo outfit?
Mr Knighto san
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
I get to have my salt, i still have to whale later for Griseo outfit
After Reboot bodied me by getting 3 more
But only S0
You tempt me to do another Multi
I went to 80
<a:iDontUnderstandThis:561646870942842907>
I legit was gonna skip HoTR start HoFin banner at 20 pity and then pull HoFin in 20, then put the rest of HoO banner til refund all gone and then go all in HoFin gear
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
if you didn't tempt me to go to 110, I would've done that
I really planned on skipping HoTr and then going for HoFin
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
I was actually serious about that
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
note that I sold like prob a few hundreds of these earlier too
me and my 413 Raven Fragments
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
tempt me to whale when I already have to whale on HoFin patch
Heki is my devil's advocate
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I pulled basically every A rank on rate up except HoTR
<:yep:833766933685076029>
I did 80 for like A rank HoTR
<:kek:809950280258945024>
fucking hell
Im so done with this patch
stop rubbing salt on me
im actually malding
80 with 0 HoTR, while Rebooting gets SS1 in like 3 multi
I wanna cry
3 HoTr
3 multi
Legit got 3 HoTr
WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY <@171082989046988800>
the only good thing that came out of this is that I only need to do 20 more pulls for HoFin and then just pull for her gears
i was just waiting for you to join a channel XD
I do
80 pulls no HoTr
good luck there, I wouldve whaled a bit had the game not told me to fuck off
im awake <@171082989046988800>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I remember when APHO Teri teased herself
Sp Seele or Teri and I go broke with Teri
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
SP Valk tend to be really good
watch as 6.5 Valk powercreep HoTr as fire/lightning support by giving them Fire/Lightning Breach there too
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
HoFIn is a normal banner so I wouldnt have gotten any bonuses either anyways
its fine, it just means next patch, ill be 20 away from HoFin and just use the rest pulling for gears
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
skipping HoTr it is
i'll prob go for like 4-5 more multi, or when I get the first box
ig ill be streaming my pulls for those who wants to see my cope
hopefully you no have it and be healthy
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im still debating on whether or not I should pull HoTr
as much cope as my new Hua/Senti suit
gotta ask Siri later if its worth my blood to pull for HoTr and then HoFin later just to suffer as the next Valk comes out
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I like HoFin
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
APHO Teri still has a chance, but yes, just 3 S rank IMA Herrscher and the refund banner is for a Mei battlesuit i dont even like really makes me mald
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I just wanna skip all 3 for Teri Judah PRI or a new Hua suit at this point...
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
on another note, is HoFin banner just a normal banner while HoTr is box while HoO is refund?
<a:StabbyDed:576647937371668486>

no

woaw
how many pulls was that?
...
1 multi was enough for me to stop at
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i dont wanna pull HoTr
I got mine on glb though
oof
<:KekPat:966625000339668993> I did 1 multi and got Himeko, so i stopped there for the patch
plus, seems like shes getting her rerun later next patch with HoFin/HoO
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
a 1/4 HoTr seems more cope than a 4/4 SS AE afterall
im not pulling for HoTr, too poor for that
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
feelsbadman

im finally done with Ch 33
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Jesus died for our sins, so that means no matter what sins we commit in the future, we can blame it on Jesus
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
imagine dying for other people when people nowadays are even more pepega than ever
ngl, i agree with that statement
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
imagine playing roblox but with your face 2-4 feet away from that monitor screen when you're like 12-14
btw, the reason why eyesight is so shit early on is because of that same monitor
how bad the resolution is
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
but yea, when I use it tomorrow, I can show you the copium of it all
my Dad just said, no, and taped it back together somehow
that umbrella snapped in half before too
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
and im like in my 20s
I legit have a 30+ year old Umbrella
nostalgia and because why not, its just there
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
it just happens to be there even after a decade so I just use it randomly here and there... though I dont use it when im playing games with my friend cuz it increases the chance of my laptop freezing and having a mental breakdown because this one is defective
anyways, I dont actually need multiple monitors
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
I have another tv which my mom uses in the other side behind that tv <:KekPat:966625000339668993>, I also have another TV, but that one is way too big to fit in that area so I cant even use it or set it up
Once I wake up tomorrow and use it, ill show you how bad it is
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
It has some of the worse resolution
But i prefer not to use it because my god its bad
The HDMI cable just happen to be able to reach my laptop, so when I get bored, I can multi task with it, letting vid run there and playing game on my laptop
Its just there
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Ngl, i dont even consider it a monitor at time, just a random tv
Its just there
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Prob around a decade
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
equivalent to watching on an Ipad at 1080p while watching on a 28-32 inch tv at 360p quality
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
its just the other monitor is just a random tv I decided to use as my 2nd monitor which has a worse resolution setting and everything
it does, its why I have Fu Hua on one, and GGZ Mei one on the other
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
gonna change it later
this was the wallpaper after it fixed itself
idk, maybe i connected to a 2nd monitor that is a relatively large tv with shittier resolution so it bugged out Wallpaper engine?
<:MissMeWithThatSht:561649397650161664>
it just casually broke on me
hmmmm...

I wanna hug it
I fully geared her prob last patch, or whenever her gears rate was up, but i lose track of time, but im happy because she’ll still be viable for quite a while at least
Were they fluffy?
Saf?
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Im just using Dudu that I finally fully geared
On another note, gl on your date Taihen
If it was just the first image alone, it wouldve been fine, but the 2nd one sound like they are trying to justify their dislike as if they were wrong trying to make it seem like they were right even though they have no reason to justify anything if its just their own opinion

Yui Horie
wished her Booba was smaller unlike the one we had now
found better quality
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
maybe but for me, i remember this April fools from 2018
all 3 dead vs alive raven
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
they just needed to give her an SP suit, but instead, they said heres a regular A rank battlesuit
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
and Pagnami
only reason Carole isnt worse is because of her Ult
yee
talking about Fire Support, but yes, you're correct there... well, Carole is also kinda scuffed for me too
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
her gameplay feels good compared to Raven's at least, 3 Chackkrams then Ult
poor sussy
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Senti and Hua votes are counted together <:concern:966623298639261746> but anyways, people really do love the FC, though Hua is also a Flame Chaser
welcome to snail pace impact

both are Logic (Blue) cards too
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I whaled in Tears of Themis trying to simp for Luke <:deadge:975652771082698782> got bodied instead

I got a bunch of Luke SR kinda so im happy there but my 2 SSR was Vyn and Artem instead
They dont deserve to exist
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
tbh, this would be somewhat a good deal... aint gonna buy it but a random Weapon/Stig is prob pretty good deal since its usually ~2800 xtal per multi anyways
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
it will give me a HoS stamp if i do buy it ig
ill get it but I still need another 50 for SS1
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but i need 600 Fragments for SSS AE
SSS AE
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
even though it will literally do nothing for me
im so tempted to buy this
foca select but CNY and HoTr and etc are soon
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
biggest bait til CNY patch ig
we can play and talk about it at the same time
we can play, its fine
alright, ill be playing on my bed so ill be extra scuffed btw
good morning
Thankfully only the back side cracked ig
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Fml, I accidentally left it outside to charge my phone, my phone proceeded to fall down the table dragging it down with it
now I have like my school email, actual email, then a bunch of random emails I use for either spam notifications, game purchases, or whatnot because its annoying having 10k+ unread emails
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I forgot how many spam emails I have just for random things
this laptop can run basically most game on medium/low graphic with good frames like Elden Ring just fine afterall
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
one, this one still runs perfectly, and i would rather save up for a personal gaming pc than a laptop
idk
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
i am not buying a new laptop
no ethernet so wifi whack
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
noice, this is mine rn, i wished i could get a better CPU but since its a laptop, it doesnt really work like that
ig hes the younger brother cuz the older one should be in college <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
ngl, they seem so similar i couldnt tell a difference, gotta read the latest chapter
but still same vibe so im happy
wow, I like Kobeni 1.0 better, long hair cuter
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
happy Bday
playing the race cards, not surprised really, same thing as people who used the twitter card to try and cancel people or call them names
nice

get rewarded for your suffering ig
OOOoooo nice, promotion
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i wished it was recorded so that you can show proof of their clown sht, but thats prob not allowed
they are clowns

dealing with customers are the worse tbh
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
Dudu?
^^
Geo and Phys is now the most cope still... Electro was brought back to life with Dendro
cuz 40% Geo shred
or ig Geo team still
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
like with Scara
now, ig you can use him to help cope with your teammates that has 0 interrupt resiistance cuz mihole sucks at balancing
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yea
ngl, ZL redeeming factor is the fact that he has 20% omni shred and 150% shield to all Dmg instead of only 250% to Geo
5* Hydro Diano, that way we get better scaling on shield + healing... so ZL shield but with good healing instead of cope burst
but hydro?
Diano?
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
dodging with Scara is annoying since it drains his E Stamina too unless you rng his no stamina dash passive
I would dodge if even getting scratched wouldnt have interrupted me either
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
recently, we been having unit like Cyno or Scara who have little or no interrupt resistance at all even though they need it the most
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
cuz you can just get juggled in the air with scara
you need a shield too cuz Jenshin Mihole dont know how to do Air Interrupt resistance
imagine making a support dedicated to a unit but have that support have the same issue as that unit which is that they have 0 energy
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
when you are coping with Scara, and even with Scara where she was a support made for him, she still sucks ass because her Particle gen is non-existent
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
kekw
cuz the warehouse themselves arent really affiliated, they are basically like your 3rd party shipper, you ship the product to them so that they can ship it to you <:KekPat:966625000339668993> which really the main difference is that they are verified compared to unverified 3rd party shipper
shipping to warehouse and then warehouse shipping to you
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
in some cases, you pay for both shipping
pain
theres tax as well
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yea, since warehouse shipping is different from regular shipping too
since its usually best to buy them when a sale is going on or there is bonus merch to go along with it... like the Flame Chaser stickers bonus or free shipping (just shipping to Warehouse, aint free oversea shipping)
and also buy a Tuna watch
cuz it was Bday merchs
yea, sucks for me though cuz I wanted to buy some Tears of Themis merch
ill take any kind of shipping over none at all
yea, so those shipping option are available, just got bodied instead
I cant even buy/pre-order the Timer Runner watch
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
the Bday sale for Tears of Themis is gonna be gone in a few days too
fuck
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
apparently, theres a lockdown in CN rn, so they are prob blocking off overseas shipping
oh, nvm, just reading off reddit rn, other people are having the same issue
and im 100% sure its not the product's fault, cuz I tried buying an old product like the Pillow and it said the same thing
basically if you google translate it
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
no no, I mean that they literally said that there is no overseas shipping in general
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:deadge:975652771082698782> wanted to buy some Mihoyo merch, but apparently, rn, Taobao said no, we not gonna be shipping anything overseas for you rn
k
Just finished eating
Ye
Was buying and eating lunch
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I just realized that I didn't have Discord opened up so I didnt get any ping or notifications
13$
or whatever they are called
or just use a Sleeping Blindfold
just sleeping meds
no
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I wished I do though
I have like literally no pills or medicine at home
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
take sleeping pills
I want to travel to the future already, just let me play my game <:deadge:975652771082698782> I still need to finish up Elden Ring too, was busy with college and didnt have enough time
but to die elsewhere is not allowed
dying in hunger game simulator is allowed
cant be worse than me malding
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202>
you haven't received permission to die so you arent allowed to die
no
you wont die
wow, reminds of one story someone told me about a school they went to, literally their history teacher basically taught them everything except for actual history/science... was some religious BS of how God made the world and everything... doesnt teach them about other regions either <:KekPat:966625000339668993> so it took them til either highschool or something to learn about actual real sht
guess who that is or what its theme is; (i.e Egyptian Mythos, Roman Mythos, Santa Claus, Halloween Theme, etc)
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
K
Dbd with Taihen?
Good morning
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
anyways, night
<:KekPat:966625000339668993> its fine, just makes it less cope ig so brute force is the way to go
no, just that I get sick (prob some kind of allergic reaction?) to chocolate, but its not the serious kind
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
too bad I cant eat much chocolate
Ooooo nice
same, especially since other than Sirin ELF and now CN, we literally had no consistent Ignite Support, Rondo doesnt count cuz Mihole decided to make Sakura PRI do 0.1 Ignite trauma and her Ult is like 1 time ignite before you run out of SP cuz it drains it off field <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
because 95% of fire stages arent even fire stage but ignite stages
yay, my Flame Tuna actually being useful again
But yea, if you find more info about that jenshin news, do tell me, I like listening to drama, the more of a clown they are, the better, of course, as long as people domt take things to far which knowing twitter, they always do that
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
No one really knows what happen outside of stream though since its none of their business unless they’re stalkers
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
At least on stream she seem pretty chill yea
At least from what I was in his stream, when his chat once called him out why hes acting x-way towards his wife, he was like: “*insert wife name*, come here! Now tell me who was it that did all of the Cleaning, Cooking, etc, in the past. Now go” as if she now has to do all the housework for him now… 

kinda <:huh:966619839307321394> move for calling his own wife out live on stream tbh, at least that was the impression I have in regard to their relationship <:KekPat:966625000339668993> though it prob doesnt change that his wife could also be toxic like him outside of stream who knows
Oooo tell me, i wanna know about the drama
<:huh:966619839307321394>
?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
True, worse part is actually the unskippable dialogues for useless side quests
hmmm... ig the Sensei... I would've said Quasi but I dont really count her as a non-devil
k
which arc, just spoiler tag it for me, since ive read the manga
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
my favorite devil, while my other fav was Kobeni out of the fact that she takes so many Ls in this anime
yep
just for personal reasons, same with last ep
next episode gonna be one of my favorite though
I already watched it, its a good episode like always
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
and if they are farmable S rank, then its usually SS or SSS
tbh, 99% of Valk outside of the gacha S rank one usually want SS anyways
<@482139585355448333> im back
K
K, lemme move my laptop to the other side from my bed
Im alive
Just kinda listening to Reboot malding in PGR
Ty
My eyes are kinda hurting, is it fine to play next time
K
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
rn im watching Chainsawman, so maybe in 13 min
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
So you cant be worse than me
Dont worry, i havent played the game in 2 years
So it hasnt even started yet
Ye, rn its just reserving space
7 hours <:KekPat:966625000339668993> but its prob less than that
sounds like mine 90% of the time, gets double crit, misses every stat of crit and goes into flat atk, flat def or def%
I have to reinstall it, so it might have to wait til tmr or late today for you, aka when you wake up ig
owo translate Xiao
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
havent played DBD since 2020
I just woke up but I have to redownload DBD first
Night for the 2nd or 3rd time now
Ima cuddle with my Birb now
God I feel old now because of that
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
My first S rank Valk was DB and Blood Rose
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Ye, legit played when these were still a thing and Yae Sakura A rank suit wasnt even out yet

Ive also been playing GGZ like a few years before Honkai was released
Ive played the game since launch afterall
Ive also played for a long time, its just that I got burnt out often so I take breaks for a few months each time when I do
Heres mine, but wow did you hoard a lot for yours
Ishoke
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Good anime, last episode was really good
Chainsawman
I only choose it because I really dont care about which one I want…
Night though, ill prob watch CSM tmr too

Oh my major is Business/Accounting so I also had Accounting classes… but honestly ill prob just go with regular business major… I hate all my Majors equally though <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Like rn
Since I tend to stay up a bit past midnight or around there
Idk about your sleep schedule though
Tbh, by the time I wake up, its prob 5-7 pm your time
Ah, highschool? Or Uni/college, since I see PE, im just assuming Highschool
My finals week was last week, this week is when grades are due
Just waiting for Finals Grade and whatnot to be turned in
I just finished with Finals
Ah, you still have classes?
If my honkek mobile loads
I’ll show mine soon
Nice
Maybe once i download Dbd tmr, we can try a SWF Queu together ig… though im still debating actually playing the game

I usually can stay up til like 01:00 in the morning if im dead enough anyways
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I was surprised it even worked
Legit was using an Intel Core I3 for playing Dbd at 4 GB of Ram
That was like super long ago, using a laptop meant for basic sht and then using it for gaming, then I got an actual proper one now that can actually run games properly
15 fps if i was lucky
Its fine, I once played Dbd for 1-2 months at 3 fps
Am?
Yea, so rn its almost midnight for me, how about you?
Cali, so its 11:44 pm for me rn

PST or PDT, forgot
Basically Behavior just wanted to jump on the LGBT train to get more players
Prob like a few years ago with his tome even though his original story had none of that
Yea
They just decided that he was gay now
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Oh yea, they made David gay
David King
Yea
Self Heal is stonk
Claudette
They keep tempting me every month with Prime rewards that ill never use because I main Feng
I am shit at killer so i never play it
I might get on Dbd one of these days ig, just tell me when you’re free for those Dbd games… though I gotta redownload Dbd first…

But I also dont wanna ruin my Anti Dbd streak and play dbd… hard decisions
Now you do with us
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Survive with Friend
Cuz normal Queu arent as bad
What about for SWF Queu
Are queu time fixed now?
Also when Pig can tunnel you and still have the Timer go off so you’ll just die because you cant do a single Puzzle while in a chase
Yea, b4 they nerfed Legion, it can stack its Bleed causing your mend time to get longer and longer each time, to the point where you spend the entire game mending til the killer finds you <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
That was b4 they nerfed Legion
Yes, I remember that, also remember when someone made it last for more than an hour worth of just you mending
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Last time Ive touched Dbd was back in 2020 or 2018
I wonder the same thing… it used to be so annoying where killing just camps 24/7 and tunnel you to death
I might decide to play it again one day ig, just tell me when you play so that ill join you
Kekw
Oh
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Isnt that just borrowed time
Hitboxes still bs as ever?
Garbage ass devs
….
I stopped playing for like 2 years now, honestly, they shouldve added that a long time ago… also is that a perk or proper in-game mechanic?
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Kekw, used to play that game like years ago but i stopped after debating that my friends no longer olay it and its boring playing by myself with campy killers
Its 50/50 for me and 75/25 between it getting worse or staying the same
It took me a while to realized it was Childe HoTr…
Cuz i never saw it til now
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Yea
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
…
I just realized our server banner is just HoTr as Childe
lucky
not even Neb PRI for HoS
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I cant even...
SSS Vill-V and SSS CN... but lvl 60 AE no gears
they are literally waiting for HoTr i see...
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
lvl 60 AE*
woaw
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I legit forgot this existed
so usually the opposite of the meaning
well, not exactly bad, but its upside down
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
oof
2 good, 3 bad
I also have tarot cards, but I dont use them as often as I wanted to
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
its sideways
oOOOOOooo Tarot
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
like how you did with FR PRI
Mihole, buff Neb PRI and add in Time Stop to AE Ult pls <:deadge:975652771082698782>
as compared to all the newer Support valk nowadays like Griseo, Eden, Yatta, HB, Fischl, etc who does do decent dmg
so giving her more dmg when her dmg is nonexistent doesnt do much
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
AE was back in the old Era where support dun do dmg
but other than that, its super copium
i did say above the +10 atk is important
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yea, but the weapon itself is useless for how pretty it is
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
its so pretty but so useless
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
10 Atk too important
along with more Sus Shards to SSS her sooner or go with Yatta
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
ig ill be going for that then
I just realized they have a DK on BP <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I want the Special Episode to come out already
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
since my Lightning team is still solid and with Eden PRI, it wont be as bad still there... 

Fire team is still fine with AE/Ai-chan, I just wanted someone to replace Raven, so I dont really care much for HoTr 

and Ice is Ice, I dont wanna max another Ice PRI after maxing SW, HoR and HoHe PRI
not really, I can cope with weapon since Turg T/B still is quite viable and still gives similar performance... ai stig is 3/3 or its meh anyway
whose? HoTr?
ima have to see what the new battlesuit gonna be like before deciding if I want HoTr
no, just for her weapon, I still have a lot of xtal, but not enough xtal for HoTr when Tuna and Mei is also around the corner
plus, not like I have much Xtals after Ai-chan anyways
ima see what the new Mei/Kiana suit too
yes, im just extending my SS AE 4/4 life rn
yes, I am <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
im skipping HoTr because I dont want another Bronya
now have SS SW with max PRI, HoR with Max PRI, and HoHe with max PRI
I do have PE at 4/4... I got SS SW but yea, its because I didnt want Aponia <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
even HoT steals Husk shills away from her
literally no shills for her because every content is stolen by Aponia, HoHe, or HoR for Abyss and MA
but SW is dead unit
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
oh same, I had to run full Ana on my HoR too and that was sad... my SW was fine running her T/B with Welt M though
MA is Dudu, HoT/HoFs, Dudu/SpA
well, except for ER and Ice Side Stage
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
it was useless for this week though because theres no Ice Shills
just hoarding ig... I wouldve gotten them way earlier had I not been busy with Finals and Midterms making me lose a lot of Mirage Tickets wasted because it was capped
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
finally crafted all 3 at once
imagine being racist for a game
wow
it was funny itself that it happened during the game awards though
apparently a white nationalist so he was possibly trying to be antisemitic or something idk
yea
<:draculaLUL:892683720870481922>
well, not a complete random kid but random enough
During the Game Awards, just a random kid went on the stage
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
which is why I dont really know how they work XD
I use a laptop so I have no reason to merge mine yet
nice
did it work?
 you can try this, but im never tried with mine so I dont know the result
merging drives? dont think so, at least not that I know of, 

I can ask my friends/younger brother and see if they know anything about it
I agree there
Cabbage head too small
Shifting Blame
Ah yes, the best tactics of them all
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I dont need the Tuna braids
I like the high ponytail from OG outfit
I dont like it
<@416445660443967491> happy birthday
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
it is but I cant get it sadly
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
~20 usd for Pardo skin
cuz its still active here
which caused the playerbase there to die, but if not for that, the CN players alone can pretty much fund the game
GLB/SEA was only closed down because of poor management
^^^
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
heres Ekaterina
you can go to full image mode, but since im on Emulator, it rotates it to the side
because they still do collabs
Michaelangelo Stig
got Mobi and Aponia weapon, but not Ely or Kallen, I already have Senti, no HoR though
Pardo skin cost money so I cant do that
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
feelsbadthough, I couldnt gacha the Ely skin in time
Sirin is the one with skills oriented to Sprays
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
depends, some Sprays are like healing/shield sprays, some are utility like ammo replenishment and then some that deals damage
this is Mobi
<@483689649727078400>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

Still in Chasm
Im 5 patches even more late
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
good luck
and ~~kissing~~
lots of blood
its not too much gore, just some intestines and brains, zombies, its a chainsaw... you need to handle gore better
you really do need to catch up, latest episode is exploding
Havent even started on Chasm
I stopped playing the game for like 3-5 patches now
I've been slacking too much on Genshin anyways
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

When did it became Fenri's Bday?
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
out of pure boredom because I saw someone else posted this
though that prob wont help with gossips or whatnot that can occur if the relationship is already in that bad of a shape ig
I prob don't have enough context for this, but honestly speaking, if you feel like the situation between your friends and you are getting too tense, you might want to have some distance or time apart from them. At least if that's what you feel like its best to do

since at least for me, even when I don't communicate much with my irl friends, we still keep in contact with each other occasionally and check on each other whenever we felt like doing so, which doesn't meant you're cutting off the relationship, just giving it some breather room ig for both side to chill out
Its Spending event outfit so why not, be like me and get it just to not have the unit til next year where their BP gets released
gone with the wind, I pulled C2 Yae with my freemogems and then decided, hey lets go to C6, why not and got C6 winning essentially every 50/50 except for 1
i have FF at max PRI, its sad, its why I dont want another Bronya, I dont wanna max another canon after I just maxed the DK
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I would pull if I was still playing the game and had I not have a C6 Yae and C1 Childe which Childe I dont even use anymore
I hate them all equally
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
I live in NA, so I should know at least some stuff about it
lmao
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
and China laws are... quite something
cuz they decided to move their base to China
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
they even have company/sites like this where they scam you by making you bid for the items... btw, even if you Fail to get the item from the bid, you will still lose the money that you bid...

so if you decided to bid 12$ on a spoon, and someone bid 13$ and win, you still lose 12$ while not getting the spoon... and if you decided to bid 30$ for a cup, well, you just wasted 30$ buying a regular retail cup
<:draculaWave:855191595044044821>
hi lumi
yep
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
so you are donating to them to donate to someone else
they just donate part of the money to an actual tree planting charity organization
its why I said its their latest one
yea
yep
a scam corporation whose goal is to start-up successful scam company, their motto is dare to fail <:PiKek:973573411911659540> and they are proud of all their failed companies with the few successful one that appears...

the latest being Established Title, the scam company that basically sells you NFTs of England's property so you can be called a Lord and landowner of England
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
78 start-up Scam Company, failed 72, with 6 successful scam company
nah, its not sad, at least its better than this company thats literally named:

Fail Venture
I have no dream, how can I be a failure of a business owner when I dont even want one smh
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
they arent old wound, just new one layered on
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>

basically pick a company to research on, write a 10+ page report analyzing it and compare them to an optimal business structure... basically if you were to roleplay as a finance advisor
Business Operation Analysis paper... it makes me wanna mald... its like worth 15-20% of my grades too
so minimum 13 pages
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
excluding the other 3
10-20 page paper

It started off so good and then it just went downhill from there
Me dying rn… my sister is a good person but god does she makes a lot of bad decisions for last minute stuff

Thought I was going to eat hotpot… it was KR BBQ (a week after he supposed appointed time) which wasnt bad til the last dish she choose was something i cant eat because its intestines and those are hard for me to chew and eat

I hate eating overly sweet stuff, especially at night… she decided to make me go eat ice cream with her and bought a bowl of ice cream… so now im feeling sick from eating both pig intestines and ice cream at around 11 C weather at basically 11:00 pm
<:concern:966623298639261746>
Had Korean BBQ, I liked all the food except for the Pig Intestine that my sister decided to order which I hated and it ruined my appetite… thankfully it was the last set of food
All I did was buy my Headset that I bought last year but wireless instead this time so the price tripled
<:draculaG:1029195994518274088>
I had nothing good I wanted to buy for Black Friday
its just Cat, not cat, person, and something

most dont really remember or care, a day off is a day off for them

<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
it was at 2k book sold, and then 3~ hour later, less than 1k more books were bought

<:slacc:963350438940397588>
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
Im the sane one
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Nah, we dont block bruh because we lose the comedy if we do, so we learned to just know that Bruh exist and thats all
Its ok i did the same til i realized I havent added anyone as my friend til like a few months ago
Same
Who are they tet
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Me with Bio, Psy and Mech Ice  PRI maxed out for my main dps but at least 2 of them are still missing their BiS stig
<:draculaHeart:814619100428763146>
<:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I limited my contact with them
I rarely even go to WFP anymore so yea
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Who pinged me
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
so im just suffering rn
either way, I am playing too many gachas rn...

Chain Chronicles JP
Honkai Impact 3rd
Grand Fantasia (MMO)
Memento Mori (Gacha)
etc. along with my 18 unit class
I legit forgot it existed
i never uninstall it nor updated it, so its just wasting space on my laptop rn
havent touched that game in forever
I should uninstall it
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I still have ToF
another bombed and killed 5 people
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I remember when like 7 people did a suicide pact
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Tet rarely live past like day 3
unless one of us died from an accident, we will end up killing each other
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Cata and I are teammate but we always betray each other in the end
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
it will end up with us dying at the last round from hunger/thirst
or die from hunger and thirst
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
and we all kill each other til last person alive
definitely
ye
^^^
so your name is just XD
hen, im in class
oh yea, game night ping, i legit forgot
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
game night?
no?
now I have to pull for her gears
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I dont really like her base skin so I pulled for Pyramid
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I got Sus weapon and then dipped... decided to pull for Dudu Pyramid Skin
same
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im tempted to get Nyx from spending event just for collection purpose, but I would prob wait for BP instead and just get Sushang Stamps
AE will never die
SSS Support Teri
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
maybe, or they take a break and do APHO3 Teri edition
that I had since AE banner
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
my Nyx is nonexistent too... it took me til BP to unlock SN and be able to use her spending event skin
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
also, I got AE 4/4 back when I was still f2p
if a Hua simp has no Hua, that would truly be sad
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
if I dont have Hua, of course it would be sad
I am Fu Hua simp
SS AE 4/4 with all skin
mine is SSS, 4/4, with skin
660 to unlock and 500 to buy
we need 660 for Book
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
im only at 390 Tokens right now <:cryge:966624721611403294> 

with the 80 from Sushang Story, prob at 470... then with maybe Abyss today for 25 and 3 ER Runs for 45... so another 70, and ill be at around 540 which isnt enough
i got into Nirvana many times to sleep there
I had a finance exam like last week
my entire october had been either exams or a group presentation... I had a 40 min minimum long group presentation like 2 weeks ago
RL/Nirvana bouncer

I have exams during those time
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
so I feel like ill wont wont be able to get it

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
is it the first whatever gets it? or is is a raffle

tero3 bug?
hewwo lumi
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I just woke up and have class til 8:50 pm

Only 3-4 hour of sleep today too
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

also cuz so that i can get closer to the Aponia skin ig
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I decided to pull for PE skin for good luck for the stig
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oh yea, there is no PE gear banner this patch right? since only SEA gets the Selector stuff
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
be like me and have outfits like SN, HoT, etc without the actual unit until like a year later when they were added into the BP
I hate the fact that they wont even let me skip the useless npc dialogues XD

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I got scam of the Nue
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

Ive been so busy I even forgot about ER last week
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
at least I was still able to do it, but it was way more annoying
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I fucked up in ER and forgot to pick the robot instead of Husk for HoH
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>

feelsbadman

Skip Class?
Human are driving ourselves to death afterall
True
Cant be worse than a gymbro, League players are just malders
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Smh
Theres still tiers to it
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
No, because Pedo are worse
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<@605258215185186816> I gave up so now I ended up explaining why I am a shotacon and not a pedo instead
For new year, hopefully the third piece will arrive
For Halloween at least
Now I just need the wig

Anyways, clothing good

<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
anyone here having issue logging into their account for Honkek on PC client?
here
others which are more annoying is the arguement/lectures type
since normal situation can be like you feel like you had this convo or this eact type of conversation in the classroom or in another setting
its worse for a shtty situation, but bearable for like casual situations of deja vu
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
she has better crit ratio than my Cyno, ishoke
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
hes pretty easy though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
no 36*?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
and then when it hits you, you're like wait, didn't I saw this exact same situation happening?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
it feels like shit sometimes, because you felt like you saw this exact same situation before but somehow couldn't remember until it happened
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
now I keep on feeling like im in a simulation
I had deja vu today so that was fun
<:huh:966619839307321394>
you think i can speed run it?
I legit got to start on it barely today
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
15 more days left on it
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
....
<:KekPat:966625000339668993> that was me with my Cyno/Yae team, ended up need Qiqi and Dendro Traveler to carry me there
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

you can help make your Anxiety worse with Gacha but don't worry, we wont have any more anxiety content that involves making your invested unit useful anytime soon outside of our first mistake which was Abyss
Welcome to Genshin Farming Simulator
only End Game Content like Chopping Wood, Fishing and Card Games
they dont want any Combat End Game Content
you get a Bday song, so thats a stuff
it took my brother 10 days after my Bday to realized that it was my Birthday 10 days ago

I dont? so thats already invalid
even this year, I forgot my Bday existed
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I honestly dont remember ever celebrating my Bday other than when I was like 8

<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Ask them for cash as your Bday Present and use said money to buy Honkai Merchs

Well, im waiting for these to be shipped after how I much i paid for their shipping
62$ just on Shipping
I dont need my parent permission <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
Oh, I thought it wouldve been like 10-20$ and then like 70$ shipping
And how much was that?
Show, i showed mine b4 already afterall

Baban prob also immortal, healthy immortal body because baban a gymbro
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
9 lives to the power of 9

<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I keep on forgetting to do that so my HoT isnt even SS yet even though she shouldve been by now
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
3 ER run for 1k coins
true
thats true, but ~~I want to lose all my hair and bald in more content~~, it feels really sad when most of my other units arent even used because I can just use the same old boring team to clear Abyss over and over again <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> legit my Childe, Hu Tao, Shenhe, Raiden are all useless now
I rather have a self driving car that doesnt crash into things while im baldning in MA
no its not, because then ill get in trouble
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
I rather not have a Tesla run over child and stop 10 second after running said child over
reading this made me mald
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Gas Prices in Cali is so disgusting rn
Now i wonder if it will even arrive b4 Halloween in time
My Clothing gonna be shipped late
AHHHHHHH GDI
lmao
i just got DA from BP recently too
they are like the only 3 unit, ill get only if they are from BP
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
the only units I dont have are the one I dont want
I love how we get Herrscher like HoT, HoR and HoH getting new gears and support keeping them very relevant for a long time while Flame Tuna just getting cucked
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
if it wasnt for the fact that I cant use the Gun Lance Attack without Midnight, I wouldve used Abuse Flower on PE tbh
Abuse Flower Stonks
nothing else
and Weapon
2 Bianka T
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I wont pull a Heki, its ok, I dont want another PE Dudu situation where I will have the Weapon and 2 of the Same Stig pieces and no other pieces
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Luck sacc
I can cope with Liu Qi and pull for Sushang Stigs
actually Sushang gears seems more important
or try my luck for 4/4
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
should I just wait for Liu Qi instead?
this is so sad
I have HoH weapon at max at least
shut it
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
feelsbadman
nope
my SpA is S rank, 0/4 so shes extra useless
I would get SS SN, but my SN has no use since even HoT does better than her in Quantum Stages so theres no point for me
lmao
my SpA is 0/4
so I dont really need her stamps
from BP
I have SN already
honestly, prob shouldve invested in her stocks cuz my Juan is so copium with no Bianka TB
so mine aint winning either
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
i have 4/4 mpe but S rank no PRI but with 4/4 Gris
she was a cheap and useful investment
and gave me a reason to not pull for Aponia
at least SW still have some uses til now
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
honestly speaking, V2V, HoFS, and SpA shouldve been at A rank, maybe S- only because the lack of Fire Support makes them all equally shit to play with
no PRI and no SS so she feels like shit to use, it why I said around S
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
even if I have 3/3 Stig on her
tbh, I dont have her at SS nor her PRI so thats prob why she felt underwhelming for me
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
SW makes me sad
though she would be around maybe A rank or S rank
I didn't expect Normal Elysia to be so high up there though
Mobi should've been a bit higher, same as Aponia <:deadge:975652771082698782> though thats my own personal bias
yea, V2V being S almost EX makes me confused, her gameplay still too scuffed for me, better than SpA but still feels shtty to use considering the state of Fire Supports rn
what everyone's bet on the next SP Support being another Lighting/Ice/Phys before we even get our first SP Fire Valk?
thats if we will ever get a fire support
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
thank god i wasnt in Nirvana
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
sniped 3rd at the last minute
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Kosma still annoying both in MA and Abyss
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
And im going to go eat dinner rn too
I forgot to do my Abyss
Oh fuck
Can you show me the screenshots so that I know what you mean, easier that way, and I just woke up


I would assume so but I would have to double check it first
I lost mine to Jean instead but its better than Kekqing and Diluc anyways
skill issue
watch what?
Block fight
Pinapple Apple Epipen
ima get back to class then
k, good luck ReBoot
oh
just tell me what I can and cant do for your dailies
<@171082989046988800> tell me what you need, i can log into another acc and do your dailies
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
like 5 hours
i can try then, what dailies you need? <:deadge:975652771082698782>
is your acc glb?
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
I have glb and am in class rn too
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
its late compared to my brother, most of his 5* pulls are around 40-50 pity
77 and 75
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
if you want to feel better, I always get late pities
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I lost 50/50 to Qiqi pulling for Hu Tao, but ironically, I said it was a win if I get either another Qiqi or Hu Tao, everyone else was a L
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
if you want to feel better, it costed me C1 Childe and 8 Beidou before I could get my C6 Ningguang
i never pulled for Kazoo
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
rip
lmao
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
yep, but thankfully wasnt a 50/50 loss
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I only lost 1 50/50 in Yae Banner
lost 50/50 but got the Standard 5* I was missing
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
and then and there, I got C0 Jean
I never lose my 50/50 unless I wanted to or if I jinxed it <:KekPat:966625000339668993> I got Jean, literally because I said shes was the only Standard 5* I dont have even after getting C6 Yae
and I have another item that still hasnt arrived yet
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
66$ Shipping
so i prob will have to skip Nahida, save for Baizhu then pull for Nahida again if he rerun comes around
i lost my 50/50 to Jean, then pulled for Cyno with 2nd pity, so i lost 16k xtal
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but I want Baizhu
now im debating on skipping her or not... i might try pulling for her
I dont like Nahida too, her Ult looks nice but everything else is eh... i dont want her either, but shes dendro and seems to have longer lasting kit which is useful for Cyno... so Mihole is just bullying me
Cyno is cute
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I legit forgot about Abyss and had to speedrun it 30 min b4 my next class started
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
there are a lot more substitute for HoS stig, so I would say wait for Anni Valk, Sushang is also Ice Psy too so HoHE, you can cope for rerun later
its fine, pain helps keep you sane
you'll be ok
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
what happened?
<:huh:966619839307321394>
It will prob do a rerun later on anyways so its ok
Gl
Assuming you are using air shipping since Sea Shipping is more expensive with initial price, takes long, but can carry heavier things, while being cheaper if you go over the weight limit
Around 15~ usd i would say
I say 10$ but thats just figuratively, base shipping is always fixed <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> but expensive shit

I legit can buy a Jingwei pillow for 20$ and the shipping would be like 50% of the price
Ye, shipping depends on size and weight

Too big/long and they wont ship it… but depending on the weight they may charge extra

So like in tiers (let say base shipping is 10$)

then it would be like: (0-0.5 kg) = 10$

0.5001-1 kg = 10$ + X(Excess Size fees)

Etc
If you are planning on using the 3rd party, I cant help much there since I never used those
Oh yea, also make sure to add in your shipping address after you made the account for obvious reason

If its overseas, they will first ship the items to a warehouse and then once it arrives at the warehouse, you can pay for them to ship it overseas… but that is a very expensive process for shipping


If you can, using a 3rd party Taobao vendor or whatnot for shipping also works… sadly since im in Cali, I cant do that… but on FB or other places overseas elsewhere, there are prob Taobao Shipping groups
Actual Taobao will be in CN, but the account creation process should be able to work in English
 this should prob hopefully help you out if you ever plan on making an account
You will still need to register with a phone number, but it doesnt have to be a cn one unlike with video games.

Though even with games, if you are using Bilibili, then you dont really need a CN ssn, you can just use your actual id for verification for said Bilibili account
You do not need CN SSN for this, Taobao/Tmall, you can think of as Chinese Amazon/Ebay
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
:eek:
well... speaking of not getting Jean even after getting Yae... now she appears
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Painslasher
C1 Candace, this is like my 4th Sayu i think lol
Mika is cute ig, but thats just another twink
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
just give me another cutie
anyways, i honestly dont care much about Genshi char either
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Cyno is cuter than Veli but cooler than Seele
Regular Seele is less cool but more kind
Cyno is cuter, Veliona is indeed cooler though
the closest resemblence with pure copium i can think of is the claws
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
SayNo?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
The amount of sht I didnt claim
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
XD
im pretty sure yea, they prob wouldve included it as just episodes but then they wouldn't have been able to time the ending of the anime to the destruction of the Kingdom arc... and seeing how long it takes for them to make new seasons, it would've killed some of the hype and make people hella confuse when they come back afterall if the anime ended like right after they were about to enter the Royal Capital
ngl, shes really nice looking too, the madness suits her more than the white dress and fake crown
and turning it into a movie, which is nice
they skipped basically what happened in the 2 month leading up to Ains and co destroying the Kingdom
yep, the Holy Kingdom which occurs in between episode 8 and 10 of Season 4
really great episode tbh
on another note, I honestly didn't expect Renner to become a Disney Princess and sing out of nowhere
for the past 3+ seasons
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
they always have been
I saw YT showed me this like many hours ago
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
this is dosght
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
you know i took a long break when im behind by 14k kills
ive been slacking
but its also where my Genshin.exe is located which is in the next folder
yep, transfer basically all of it, so just make a new Folder thats called the same thing: Genshin Impact game and move all of the game files there... I think I made it so that I moved my Game Files to be in the same place as the GenshinLauncher <:KekPat:966625000339668993> you can see this is is my game launcher folder in my SSD
Ig once you finished downloading the files and verifying the files integrity

You can transfer it to your SSD, you can also move the launcher files if you want, to the ssd too, and then once you do, open up the launcher and change the file path to the new one where the exe is located
Did you have the file path be the where the Genshin.exe (or Application) is located?
Thats what I did with mine
Oh, that was your issue, ok, i think i can prob help with that

Basically if you have Genshin already downloaded, you can just open the Genshin Launcher and in Settings, go to Installation Location and click “Use Another Folder” and it will let you move around


You can then locate the Folder where Genshin is Located after you moved Genshin to your SSD (file path should be like: 

D:\Genshin Impact\Genshin Impact game

Though the D: can be anything really, cuz your PC main storage would be C:\
And then theres the one like my brother PC where he added them into the PC
Like for instance, mine just uses a Usb-c(iirc) to connect to my laptop which i can unplug and replug in at any time
But what issue are you having or are stuck on for installing the SSD anyways? What kind of SSD is it?
Im not tech savy enough for these kinds of things tbh, but ill try <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
I was driving home from school… and wdym? you mean SSD or actual brand new Harddrive Disk?
and wait for Cyno rerun
or get Venti, then Nahida
lucksac both
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
im getting Cyno because i dont use Anemo
cant even start on Chasm quest because apparently another Quest is cucking me
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
im still stuck in Chasm
<:PepeSmile:966629532943650836>
now they gotta turn them into ELF with gacha
shes so pretty
?
OOooo
<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
could be a few days to a week?, if you recover fast, maybe faster than that idk... but i do remember eating stuff making them bleed again like an idiot
i honestly dont remember... since its been over 3-4 years ago
I need to pull for Cyno later when I get on
though ig with his weapon, he gets a bit more atk
so not really that great
My Ning legit have 1.8k Atk <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
oof XD, I have an SSD for my device so I never really run out of space even though I have so many games downloaded
itshoke, makes sense, though for me it doesnt because my phone always have 128-256 GB on it <:KekPat:966625000339668993> since I only replace my phone every 5-10 years
good morning
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but icd will def be annoying
I know his dmg will prob be around the same as Xiao, Itto, etc, but prob slightly better thanks to having access to Quicken/Aggravate to help buff his dmg a bit more
its cool but then you realize nothing new is actually added at all, since hes just another hypercarry like Xiao, Razor, Itto <:deadge:975652771082698782> well, the Eye Mechanic seems interesting if it wasn't for the fact that it feels scuffed to use since you apparently have to match the timing if you want to buff your dmg for a single E
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
5.59$ for Gas even at costco
Fucking hell
<:concern:966623298639261746>
No, in 4 days 20 hours 6 minutes 9 seconds
Ive been sleeping through all the version, so only 16k
Because hes more entertaining
Im with Zy0x side though
The usual
More Genshin Drama
But yea, its mobile YT
You can do it on home page, just not when searching for YT vids to watch
Yea, because im on my ipad rn, but iirc, PC YT is same thing unless its from main YT page
Can only report their vid which does nothing becuase there’s nothing legally wrong with the vid
I know they do, but it doesnt let me do it unless its from the recommended list, one like from searching for YT vid dont work
Like look at this shitty clickbait thumbnail, just looking at it already make me cringe
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Its becuase you’re a gymbro smh, on another note, YT should give me a block option so that I can block certain channels from ever appearing in my searches or recommendation
Prob have to drive home after and then ill be free to commentate
Was eating lunch
Im here
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
That was cursed asf
…
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
since quite a few is already in vc balding
I can join since its the weekend
Heki somehow more literate than Honkai-help channel people, stop shaming him
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
I changed my mind
I never thought about making it separate because I couldnt be bothered to at the time... but because of what my mom did today
Ima need to contact my bank tomorrow and ask them if they can separate my account from my mom's... if I have to close that account down and make a new one, I will... though then I have to redo my Direct Deposit for my part time job and school as a result
anyways, nighty night
I plan on keeping Kosma, give Griseo to one of my Artist friend, Aponia to another, and Eden idk
I got myself a bunch of Good Luck Charms too... mainly Kosma, Griseo, Eden and Aponia charm
yea, its pretty unisex like with SilverWing Bartender outfit
on another note, I plan on doing this one for Hua... I just hope the last piece can be shipped out soon... because rn, I only have the pants and the inner shirt, the outer one still awaiting to be shipped to the warehouse
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
too poor for that, and I dont have time to anyways, college draining too much out of me
on another note, I would cosplay as Kosma, but theres no cosplay/outfits themed after him so cant really do much about that
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
He just do the pose that Ely made Sakura and Hua and Pardo do
plus, Nov 4 Date is a bit yikes
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I dont trust Amazon for that only because I dont see any reviews and it seems quite pricey
hmmm...
anyone know where I can get a decent Hua wig?
already have the Birb sleeping cloak afterall
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
ty, if it doesnt work, then i'll just be Jingwei
also need to pray they come b4 Halloween so that it can be both my New Year Costume and Halloween Costume
17 days left til im forced to ship them or else ill be charged storage fees
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Like all of these Hua Merch + Kosma Merch are ready to get shipped yet one of the item I bought at the same time isnt even ready but its a part of the set
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I love how most of my shit are ready to get shipped yet the one shirt I need isnt even ready when I order it the same time
Kalpas lmao
well, theres 1 for all the FC
Theres even an Ely one
Dont worry, im also broke but I dont regret much
but image quality too low from the screen capture
you can even see the smol rice grain on his face too
its fucking adorable
Kebin Pillow
yea, I have the Kebin one, Im waiting for the Kosma one to ship out
mainly with the Kevin one
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I would troll him with that
lmao
mine used to be way worse than that tough
oh, thats my finger
my cute adorable child
I should prob exercise or something, but I dont wanna go to the gym either
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
mine are just bones
no one here should have worse fingers than me
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I like Boys too
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
you should've done what Kosma does and make it worse
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I legit only got back onto Guild Wars 2 like this week so im speedrunning pvp for some rewards cuz GW@ is on Steam now... and I had a bunch of Expansions bought for the game that I dont want it to go to waste
tbh, any game I play and she says im too addicted to the game and then starts lecturing me and then comparing me to other people, yadi yadi da
ye
I stay up late at night playing mmo pvp, and then she says im too addicted to video games... and then assumes I was spending money on that game when in reality, the 60$ I spent was on Pre-Ordering Octopath Traveler II
ngl, I rather listen to a stranger rant to me for 6+ hours than to deal with my mom's lectures
I should go to the rant room when I remember again
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
... and because I bought our generic 60$ Steam game off of Steam, shes now being annoying asf
so she can see all of my purchases, including my steam game purchases which says: Steam GAME in all Caps
I forgot that I had a joint account with my mom back when I was a minor
This is annoying, I need to contact the bank sooner or later
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
HoR Bike mode is melee
no because Pristine is Herrscher Mode + Range
going on a first name basis
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
cuz I know they call Mei, Yae in CN
though I forgot if it was CN or JP
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
didnt they call Yae, Yin?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I dont get how they manage to mess up names
ye
while everyone else gets their name pronounced properly like wtf
same reason why I malded when they called Baam in ToG as Yoru.... just because 25th Baam means 25th night in Korean doesnt mean you literally have to call him Yoru in Japanese <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
40-50% extra dmg during the 3 sec window is quite fat if you use it well
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
usually 1 because thats a free nuke
should be 1
still better than Ana for my HoH but still sad
all round nerf in v3
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
also, rip Liu Qi
its 9:46 over here afterall
XD
maybe, if I somehow dont wake my mom up lol
ikr
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
and that its not fraud (aka Mihole scamming me)
I had to call them and confirm that I did indeed spent money to buy said merch
My Bank froze my Debit Card because I bought Mihole Merch from Taobao lmao
I know that too
i get taken advantaged of way too easily
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
sometime, I wished I was a bit more selfish and mean
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
on another note, I spent 26k xtal this patch and I didnt even mean to
but yea, its best to avoid it like the plague
trauma dump when its barely their 2nd convo isnt improbable, I had a random stranger rant to me for like 4-5 hours straight about how the people they trusted most wasnt even there to help them when they needed it
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
whats worse is that the Paga TB was from off rates as I try rolling for HoH Stigmata
My main and my only account got Paga TB so I had to wishing well mine for M
both are nice ngl
 Cn Version

just draw skeleton fingers and stubby feet
night baban

<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I never went for Ganyu, because there was not a single 5* I wanted... all the unit i wanted was like Ningguang and Razor lol, only 4*
ok
heki
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
and you're a gymbro so its just as bad, so shut it

Never have time for those days

<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

Violence is the solution

<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

Ty
Owo avatar

This is so chaotic i love it
LMAO
Am i not in it?
Kinky
Oh?
Hakcer gonna be the first to die ngl
Keilo will bald and try to win this like in MA
True
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
But you’ll accidentally snipe Neko instead
Carv will obviously be the winner wdym
Just make a list of those joining in
Anyways, one of you should make it and show it to us
They all legit dragged each other down lmao
But lmao, Round 1 and Kalpas already causing chaos
We should
Lmao
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
so you prob open it
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
oh, I remember, it was that one time you asked me for the taobao link for the HoS keychains
oh, probably
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I even forgot that was a thing
as in Discord Friend, I added Gresham and co in Honkek, but never on Discord
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
so that was prob why, I just started sending it rn because I realized i never friended anyone here
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I never sent any friend request
?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I just realized i never friended anyone
I should prob start sending friend request
2016 boomer account
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
so rn, me, Ruby and Carv are the oldest one in terms of account
May 18 2018
just link your acc to something, or if you have something already linked, have it display on profile
well, more like display
woaw
2016
ty
or am i checking it through the wrong way
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I did already connected it to my steam ac so why doesnt it appear?
or do i link other sht
I do have things linked though <:KekPat:966625000339668993> ig i need it to appear on profile
oh
feelsbadman
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
can anyone check mine?'
i dont see mine either
🍿
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
and that means suffering for another 2 months getting it
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
im just coping til Liu Qi
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i dont either
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
that was pre-Abuse Flower too
not 4
I knew there was 3
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I didnt know about the 4th code
all of our animated short are getting better and better too, unless they decide to pull a fate where they consider Honkek as a Visual novel and then adapt the Visual Novel into an anime, but tbh, we already am playing through the game like its an anime/visual novel anyways
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
why isnt she SS yet
i have 2k+ each for me
Judah chan Uwu
Ah yes, lets break through when you dont even have the weapon, the resources, nor team
How tf will they even get all the PRI mats shit too
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
That person just want to self destruct, it’s different from coping and hoarding
Ima sleep, im too sleep deprived rn
So i said fuck it and Wishing well them for M
But no M
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
They gave me Paga T and B
HoH weapon banner trolled me so hard
I beed Bianka B most cuz Dante M is stonk
Not enough dmg
And Ely TB Dante M is still real copium
My Dudu have weapon, and Bianka T, but Bianka set is dogshit til i get a 2nd piece for 2 set bonus… hopefully B but instead i have 2 T
So now my SW is locked on Hellmaru
Take a break, like me who took a break after realizing that I shouldve used my SS SW on SSS Husk instead of my HoT team so that I couldve gotten a better score for him

And then use my Mobi against Hellmaru… but i got so tilted against Hdom (especially with my 1/4 Dudu, that I legit forgotten)
I have it
Also, other than whales like me, who tf would even max a PRI
But they gonna lose lots of brain cells trying to help them
They are trying to help
Yea, those kind are the worse <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Who?
My HoH will have use against the SSS Boss but thats cuz my SS SW gets cucked there
cuz no Liu Qi
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
my HoH is gonna be useless until 6.1
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
HoH with max PRI but Full Ana
My Copium is stronger
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I got her for my 20
on another note, Ely really was painful, making walk the road of <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
ill prob do that too
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yea
so my HoR is at S3
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I havent been buying from War Treasury
lmao
I had the skin from spending event so i was fine with it
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
once I pull ZA WARUDO, then ill have a use for my HoR thats with her costume
ill just luck sac both
thats fine
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Its fine, ill get HoH in the end, and then get Sushang stamps next patch too
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yes it is
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
so this is despair
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
idk even why its important when I only need Mobi and Sakura core to kill 2.75x Husk
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I keep on forgetting but yea
I assume 2nd core
was Mobi Star Signet 1 or 2 again?
<:huh:966619839307321394>
mine was just getting Ice Himeko
so its either Pardo, Tuna, or Mei, Mei because Mei will be a magnet for Ely
Hua has bad gacha luck in general
Mobi on screen gave me Bask for my Ely Weapon rolls
they really cucked my rolls
and yea, I prob shouldnt have used Mobi or Hua
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
but I have all the Valk except Aponia, Nyx and Vill-V

and I hate those 3
and no Fire SP either so I have less reason not to skip HoH now
the only reason ngl
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
its because Sushang is farmable
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
so that I have a reason to pull for her, im at 54 counter

also, this is a one time thing

normally, I pull for the character, then gears... but Pardo banner traumatized me a bit
its ok, it took me getting 2 more Mobi Bask for this shit
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I have her weapon now but no HoH
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
cuz with all of these fodders, I could easily do so
I was not whalao enough to do it yea, but in the end, I didnt do it, thus making me not insane enough to do so
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
I am very sane as I did not do it
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but then I remember you can only PRI Divine Key once
because its Judah chan, I originally wanted Judah PRI to come so that I could PRI all 3 and go Triple Judah chan
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
as for Mobi weapon, tell that to Ely
ignore those, I wanted to 5* all of them but got too lazy, there was originally 3 more
Anyone want my extra Mobi weapon
Mobius said no
or pull for HoH + Weapon, and then save for Sushang Weapon
or just skip 6.0 all together and wait for Sushang
ima be doing the horrible decision of get her weapon first, then HoH herself
then I'll cope whether or not ill get her later
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
and when I say for her, i just mean for her weapon
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Im still debating if I should even do more pulls for her
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<@605258215185186816> so you're skipping her?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
So who has HoH here on this server? well, better question is who doesn't
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
we are all still coping with AE
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
while i was talking about support since it was in the context of what Carv sent
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
cuz b4 Vill-V, it was SpA
shes not a support though
its gonna be another Fire Dps just because mihole wanna cuck us of fire support
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
900+ days since Fire S rank... and 0 SP Fire
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Fire support are just going to stay dead
no Ely in 1 Multi, and not Key of Ego to give me a reason to pull for her so that she can even be viable
I can skip Ely now
I'll prob do 1 multi each for Ely + Weapon
feelsbadman
lmao
night
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I had like 90 days on Welkin... go on like 2-3 times for the entire thing
I should log on Genshin at least since i have Welkins active but even with Welkins, i couldnt be bothered lmao
then i went on Genshit
because it said there was a maint
and then got off
Because I got on like 2-3 min ago
I knew it
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
nani?
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I have Bkek invested but phys stages are Psy enemies now a days, cucking her
my Phys is cope til I get Bianka TB
yea, I have SS SW and I have HoR

So I have a lot invested for Ice, like how I have a lot invested for Lightning now... just my Phys and Fire is still lacking, but Fire will always be lacking because no Ignite SP Valk
and then save for the remaining of the patches so that I can pull for Sushang gear and then cope for Fire SP
i still cant decide between skipping Ely and not skipping her... so ig ima do 2 multi, 1 for weapon and 1 for her
I still need Paga M even though I have full Cezanne
even if her gameplay can be quite easy to do
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
using her makes me feel like im using Raven in terms of making me feel tilted and scuffed
I dont like playing Carole either
lmao
i couldnt even clear past the 1st stage
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
50$ a week just on gas
but i commute so i need to save gas money
stacking them all on the same day was just as sht
taking 18 units was a mistake
I already do that... too bad my long ass classes ended up with me zoning... it took me 2 hours to do one of my assignment that I didnt even do in the end... only skim through the textbook
I even get side quests I cant even do because I dont have sht unlocked for some reason
the checkpoints and navigation system is so weird
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Cardbot is indeed great, but the side missions are not
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
...
I wanna redo the HoH Dance
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
I did the main story, but the side story are just...
how?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I only did the main story, I legit dont even have Aponia and Mobi Card Core unlocked
for genshin or honkek?
good luck, even if you're lazy and rng it, you'll still do well
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
so very fun
<:worryweird:987958026071834634>
pog
you can have fun
since its comp class... one of the question was just a bunch of codes,

the question was:

How many Syntax error do you see in the code:

1
2
3
4
None
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
like random indented space... its more confusing when the its like:

Mbps and MBps... they both mean completely different thing too because one is megabits and the other is megabytes...
like the grammar would be off while the question itself is vague or confusing for no reason
Like the question would be like:

(Not a real question)
There are 2 sex, male and female. Gender and Sex are               two different things

True
False
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I got a 11/24 on my Quiz today, though thats because 2 question worth 6 pts arent graded, and the question was hella confusing
If you dont like it, still do it and then cope, either by doing poorly, put in effort, or luck sacc and get a good score
Thats just how life is, just do them, whether you like it or not, and then either skim through the exam or try your best
Then go inside
And see if I can luck sac both her and her weapon
For me, im prob gonna do 2 multi this patch, 1 on HoH and 1 on her weapon banner
I thought they patched that off a long time ago but lmao, people somehow brought it back
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Got it
So 3 hours before the other copium stream
Kekw
even if I get HoH, shes gonna be gearless... at most I can do is spend 6k xtal
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
If I can cope with Sushang instead, ill take that
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
im neutral on whether or not ill skip Herrscher Ely
oh?
all 3 of which are Herrscher Dps
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
we have a lot of Psy options now
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
say that to Keilao
correct
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
sleep players = better placement for me
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
gives more reason for me to flex my balding head to genshin casuals
im fine with it, because I suck at SS Arena, but SS is also fun
or HoT FR Fischl
ill just sleep with HoT Eden Fischl
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
im in Nirvana so this aint happening
hes very trusty
because im in Nirvana
I can sleep
Pog
which boss is it this week?
no more Merch til next year, pog
1077.5 CNY (for my November Merch) and I can now die once the Shipping Prices gets totaled up... tbh, its not as bad as I thought it would be
<:concern:966623298639261746>

Or theres just a stain somewherr but thats prob also gone
Cum are liquid, its prob evaporated by now
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Dino cum
I cant, LMAO
new idea
no they did not, selfcest did
lmao
then randomly people just started hating on it
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
whats ironic was that homosexuality was pretty common in the past too iirc
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
that sounds annoying yea, for me, im not religious, so all I know was that Jesus was Human and he apparently died for all of our Sins
Zenless Zone Zero Maid Girl in disguise
it exist?
What is Paininti
just tedious because I dont know wtf to write for it
its not even hard
what is this dogsht
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I take it back, 4 page essay, not 3
but I still have my essay to write but ive been procrastinating
I  need to sselpep
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
baban should explain it
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Mobimaid only costed me like 6k
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I only needed to sink 6k for Bastet MB.... but I sank another 3 multi going Bastet T and getting nothing but another Purana
lost 6k cuz of Bastet banner
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I have only 9k
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
dont you ever pet a cat b4? its common logic that your hand magically disappears while petting them
then be baited when Fire SP comes out in 6.2
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
which seems pretty relatively important ish
then I can gacha for Sushang gears
since I have SS SW too
that way, I can farm G4, and use it for both HoR and HoH, alternating between them
For me, im at 66, so I need to snipe HoH and her weapon in 20 and then save for Anni
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I havent done them in years
zank you
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
just never could find the people
cuz I do need the mats
but yea, I never do my weekly raids so do @ me when you do and ill try to join if im not dead
lmao
Cata?
who do I thumb up
aite
SO i have to start from stage 1 if I do it
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
the stage is locked for me because I havent being doing my raids
kekw
Scarlet?
100106976
heres mine if you want to add me
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
what is your user id
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
have Gresham add me
idk, I should be friend with Gresham though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i can join
in NA?
Zero Dupe from pity, nice nice, I can finally stop coping
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
...
frooty
what kind of clusterfuck of drama is happening in there?
lmao
then again, I cant say anything about that since I bought so many Taobao Merch and the cost is prob around the same amount lol
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
wow
how much did that costed you?
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
cute
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
those were always nice to watch, the behind the scene stuff, but oh well, they are still separate teams
I just rather wished Mihole did more Dev kind of videos where they showed how they designed their characters
I like Genshin leaks, but its def not the way to go as if its the game's Savior
it truly is concerning
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Im not talking about only Abyss, talking about just content she can at least be used in, which is usually MA for Leaderskill
since HoT still had certain coverage til new DK came along to make her more relevant
or they will keep it to keep HoR alive considering her state was worse than that of HoT
the usual
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
its prob gonna get fat nerfed like with 7TR
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
No Finisher Attacks
oh lmao
Pri?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
like with the Dice event
all the FC are automatically in their Summer Chibi
other than Griseo Summer Chibi but thats FC Chibi
cuz there were some outfit chibi too, but i dont see them there
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but there are also the FC Chibi and idk about Outfit Chibis
how many Chibi are there we can choose from is the question
wow they suck
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
im still missing Bastet T
yep
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
me crafting G4 Stigs even though I prob wont be pulling for ZA WARUDO... though ill prob end up doing so because of the 10 Flat Atk or something
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I can cope with SW and Pardo
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
SorAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAaaaaaa <:cryge:966624721611403294>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
ig its time to wait for Aponia BP
me with no Aponia
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im asking how tf you get the skin <:worrymad:987990517453303820> 

if its the stupid Bingo, then its a scam for me, I would rather use B-Chips or Pyramid Gacha instead ngl
the skin itself may not be a scam, but the process can be
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
im talking about how to get it
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
its scam?
True lmao
I dont even rmb if you can even whel those in the first place
I just havent been buying any shards
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
idk why, but the JP one this time sound a bit more... how do I say it... like calm-ish?
both cute and emotional
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
the emotion comes out stronger too
CN sounded way better for this Animated Short
<:huh:966619839307321394>
somehow ended up wasting 4+ hours helping a stranger
I was really busy today
I def agree there
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oh yea, I forgot the JP version is out
Ngl, ill bald so hard if I can use the New G4 over Bastet for Pardo
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
But have no use for it
Good thing I have full Ana
Since Ana is G3
I know
We already have Ana for HoR, G4 being like Handel but for all the Ice Dps would be nice ngl
Then I can have Sushang support with other Ice Stig
So hopefully the G4 Stig works well for HoHE

Basically someone in WFP that we hate enough to have a Diavoros Dislike Club Role in here
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Only because i forgot which server I was on
Just now
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Ngl, you almost baited me into thinking I was in WFP and that Dia was here except less dislikeable
You can basically get a shield equal to 1600% of your Atk, 800% Base with 160% per Cube Stack
Coco is still best healer though, with Nemesis
Other shield are like Merylin which is like 10% max hp shield
Best Shield is prob Zero, since its AoE Shield + you can also buff the Shield… iirc each Cube Stack increases the Shield Hp
3* makes its 30 sec Cd with 30% Atk Heal Over Tine while its up
Cuz 10 sec Shield with 60 cd is so cope
I need 3* so bad rn
Shield, heal is with 1* and 3*
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
For me, its Zero, I love the Cube, fucking hate the arms though, it gives me fat hands each time I use them
And so i mad coping
Because i have 4* Selune
I cant grab her
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
Its fine, im nice to people usually

I just hope the next Queen of England looks almost like her and is also old looking to make it seems like she never died in the first place
:E_KEKpat:
Tbh, when I think about the Queen of England, I just think of a really old grandma that transcended time and somehow lived for over 300 years
She can cope with Neb PRI
Wow did humanity standard fell quite a lot these decades
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>

What, you dont watch those podcast where the VA states about their fetishes live?
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
Im not toxic enough to be one of those
Thats a mood
Japan is VA are based ngl, they just openly says whether they are a lolicon, brocon, siscon or shotacon
Whos HoO? HoH?
Yea, theres a lot of details in her animation
wait til my next phase and then it might get more cursed
anyways, im quite sane again
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I was called a pedo for liking Kebin too
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
...
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
simple as that
since I like Kosma, then that makes me a shotacon
<@468680026162724864> I think it started here, sorry, it was Fenri, not Ruby, but Ruby was brought up later when the my not-sane self decided to say more cursed content
420
they were useless
I dont when it wakes me up at 2 am in the morning because they were crying about wanting to eat cup noodles and not real food
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
no, since I never said that I wasnt a shotacon, I just said that you booli me
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
and then Baban took my word and turned it into a sus quote
basically yesterday, as I was suffering from heat waves and sleep deprivation, someone said Baban was a pedo, then Baban said Ruby was the one closer to being one than him (as Baban still a minor), and then I stated then I would be even closer than compared to those 2 but I hate irl children
<:KleekPoint:998911499315728404>
its 5 pm, and im in class
I wanna sleep
im already not a minor, thus, am infinitely closer to being than one than you, same for anyone that isnt a minor
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
the only reason why you aren't close to being a pedo is because you arent an adult yet
they also tried to make Alicepedo2 because I said I like Kebin and Kosma pillow
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
as you can see, Baban is a booli, they didnt even want to change it to AliceShotacon
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
*sigh*
you did nothing, Baban is just being a booli and aboozing us because they can play the minor card
now i cant unsee it either
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
...
you are free from booli, cata became the new scapegoat
<:worrypat:986461060104081508>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<@704867526877904908> why did the room changed from bullying heki to bullying you?
Almost fell face flat to sleep
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im slowly zoning out
do tell
or gain 100
lose 100
I still have time for mine, I just got on to snipe 100 pts more than the current 1st place
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
If it was some of the others, they prob wouldve followed the <#977584145142259782> rules and booli you for it
You are not stupid
Kinda like how Tuna slashed it with her Time Runner skin and Ely creating a crack in the sky to show it
Prob the background with the Moon
XL gonna be Fire Aponia
Nah, its gonna be Fire Support with High Dmg and Ignite but instead needs Massive amount of SP cuz like with Genshin, she has sht Energy Gen
S Rank Ignite Support because Fire SP valk are nonexistent
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I get them even if i dont plan on ever using them
<:huh:966619839307321394>
How do you not have Ely?
Just farm and sell all the excess Mats

too bad i use IOS so i dont think i have access to do this
No covid here

What Covid?
since this is the Official Playlist for One Piece Filmed Red, it means all of these song are one way or another included in the movie, even if its just a snippet or a short part
she sang 8 songs iirc as Uta... there are probably other song in the movie too because this playlist seems to include other music not by her
now Im just coping for when the movie gets released because I wanna watch it already

<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
I wake up at 6-7 am
It once took me 45 min to find parking and i had to park in the corner
I need to sleep <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> i have classes tmr that last from 12 pm to 9 pm

Minus the fact that I have to get my dad his ice coffee and also drive onto campus 2 hour early to find parking

<:slacc:963350438940397588>
I should be back to normal by tomorrow, maybe
no, shotacon, because Baban Banba want to abuse me during Cali heatwave day to increase their sadism skill while increasing my masochism skill <:worrymad:987990517453303820> im totally sane rn
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
my prize should be Can chan
beating Ruby sounds fun
also, why isnt it AliceShotacon and instead Alicepedo smh <:worrymad:987990517453303820> I hate irl Childrens and I equally dislike lolis, so It cant be Pedo and Loli, so Shotacon should be left

if you want, I can help add more quotes, just tell me what to say and ill say it <:slacc:963350438940397588>

Why are you trying to level up your Sadism Points and my Masochism Points <:worrymad:987990517453303820> im not into that
<@846910913118601226> change my role name to Bipolar Sanity pls
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
Baban was really mean to me today when this was Heki booli room
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
Sleep, just think of this as a nightmare and ill be back to normal tomorrow
Hopefully i dont crash and die
Ima drive home now
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
I was about to say something really mean but i stopped, ig i still have some sanity left over, nice
Minimum 4 Flame Chaser
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
But yea,
I think im:
Kosma - Awkward + Real Nature is talkative child
Griseo - Gets influenced by other quite easily 
Pardo - Lazy + Bipolar luck
Hua - Hua
<:deadge:975652771082698782> ^^^
Evn wont die because their Elie didnt die either
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Kebin just rubbed his influence off onto Kosma
Im not emo <:worrymad:987990517453303820> also Kosma isnt Emo, hes just an awkward child
Im a mix of Kosma and Griseo, and Hua too ig, add a % of Pardofelis in the mix too
Both
Anyways, I should be back to normal hopefully by tomorrow
Like that one
They have quite a few questionable emotes too
Its not bad compared to some ppl Ive known, their server was degen enough for it to have toes emote
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
You were hornier than me
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
You were hornier than me
It was really lovely
Probably, my room was at a constant 90 degrees for around 6-7 hours
Whats the command to look at the list?
.,,
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
This is why I am happy with my poor memory, I sleep all my worries away and go back to being sane the next day
YT algorithms back then was fucked
Btw YT was the one the recommended Euphoria when I was 10 wathing normal anime and video game walkthrough
Nope, I wont realize it til at least tomorrow because I have yet to have gone to sleep
Also simping for Kosma and Kebin isnt pedo smh, so its more AliceSimp
Why isnt Delta there too?
I blame YT for that too
Fight fire with even more fire
My phase should be over once I get the Kosma Pillow and stop getting stressed from Cali Weather and School


This is on the lighter side… my most cursed stress phase ended up with me watching bad ends for random games + hentai in which one of them resulted in me getting to see something as cursed as a screwdriver shoved up someone’s ass… Euphoria was another and that one was truly cursed… I would rather watch Boku no Pico over Euphoria 
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
because there are way worse thing I can say
also known as the cursed phase
no, the bipolar phase
itshoke, im just going through a phase, ill go back to normal once I stop dying from the heat waves in Cali
look how adorable he is
smh
like who wouldnt simp over this Kebin Pillow
gotta stack it up
no
usually
I dont lie
true, I did simp over Kosma and the Kebin Pillow
I hate children so its ok
how tf is this a middle schooler, her booba is legit the same size as Aponia's
both

Middle Schooler looks like Highschooler and Highschooler looks like Adults
its why I said I hate irl childrens, I still have my priorities for fictional one too

anyways, why do the Middle Schooler in anime usually are fcking Adults in disguise
smh
I said i hate irl childrens
:kekah:
tbh, Im the closest to being one but thankfully, I hate irl children
if it was in my old home 3-4 years ago... i wouldve actually died... because back then, in Summer, the Room is insulated to the point that its 100 degrees as I try to sleep, I can open the Balcony door to the max and no cool air would even want to enter my room

the shitty owners wont even let us use the AC... they even said we cant use much water for our shower because we were using too much of it :eek: ... they talk about wasting money when they legit have **SOLAR PANELS** set up by the original Land Owner (who I did met like a few weeks ago as they were my dad's homeowner for his new home)... and they fucking somehow broke the Solar Panels or dont even use it...
heat waves, but my room being a constant 90+ degrees, I wouldnt be surprise if I get a heat stroke sooner or later
ill do that reveal when im not suffering through a heat stroke
im the chicken
go to school and be like me and stay on discord while in class
you were very pretty
I remember, wasnt there one time during stream where we just have you there with cam on and see who gets tricked into flirting with you?
true
perfect bait material
I remember it iirc from the Rebooting stream stuff
You are pretty
gamer chair god
yep
wow... 

I did HoT Handel, FR Sig, and Fishl Zhenyi, so my score is decent
yea, for Bkek, you use too much time with rotation with Eden

so FR with frontloaded dmg is beter
oof, cant tell if thats worse or better, mine was meant to deal with underbite so mine pushed my jaws back technically instead

so yours could be easier or worse
some months are easy because they just tighten it, other times, they replace it with new one and make it even tighter
well, its going to be extra sensitive because the braces forces your teeth together... worse case, your teeth will occasionally bleed til it adjust... make sure to eat soft food if thats the case


worse case for me, i couldnt even chew my food
:PETTHEPAIMON:
your teeth will be very sensitive at the start
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
theres been so many heat waves too
ima get a heatstroke one of these days
I need some rain here in Cali
Yikes forever
...
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
be careful when eating them with braces too... i once somehow got unlucky enough to have them break and get stuck in between my braces while also stabbing into my gums
ye
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
even though I complain a lot about my braces and retainer, they did really helped a lot with my underbite and whatnot... though because of my old underbite, i still kept my habit of taking 10 years to finish eating my food
hopefully you can get them, do you not have healthcare for them?
when you dont wear your retainer for a long time and then wear them again, not only does it can hurt from how tight it is, but also makes them way more sensitive
my teeth gets so sensitive whenever I wear my retainer again
ishoke, for braces, I also had to use them, but that was 2+ years ago so I can finally use my retainer instead... i still forget to wear them so my teeth still gets fucked over occasionally
ngl, even with Eden gun, I still ran FR for Bkek and got a way better score with smoother rot for some reason
:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:
im sorry to disapoint but none of yall should be uglier than me, if you are, its invalid and you are now cuter than me
rip
Eden PRI
i shouldve gotten them pulled out like last summer, but i didnt and now school is back up again...
I still need to get my Wisdom Teeth pulled out
the sleep deprived part is an appeal tbh, some people do look really cute and hot with eyebags
my skin is dry asf
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
sleep deprived too
no matter what, yall will be always prettier than me because I never take care of my skin
naked bimbo mud part is not good
yes you are ig
i dont know many people outside my circle
wow, the complete opposite for the one Ive known lmao
i shouldve said  straight because normal people dont exist, i forgot about that
then there are some that are just normal people too
there is, luckily for me, my friends are mostly somehow ended up being gay, trans, ace, pan, or whatnot
I'll take half
ah, hopefully she gets better, send the storm my way pls

I am suffering from heat waves in Cali for like 2 days now... I would love a storm my way
gib her some hugs, poor kitty
gamba for the right person
neither can I so you aren't alone there... but minus the cunty part and cute/handsome
tbh, flirting in general always sometime sends wrong message... even talking can sometime make people misunderstand if you are or arent flirting
thank god im asexual so i dont have to have a crisis for it
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Keilo, at least you can flirt, for me, I cant even bother with any of those interactions
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im in Class
this chat is too bipolar to get ruined
you are fine

so i did nothing wong here
Heki or someone else made a slander list, and you were ranked 13th for gay, top 3 was Tero3, middle is power Lolicon, and then last 9-12 is horni, and 13 is gay apparently

we have too many people,  who will be who... need to make a new role bot and have everyone fight for their slots
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
nope,  because top 3 were Tero3 searcher, and Kebin isnt a Tero3
ig im Hua
oh you are Kosma? how and why?
but when he was more talkative
or Kosma
Im pretty sure im Hua
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>

Btw, anyone one of you watch BriTANick The Dinner Party?
<:E_PoliwhirlConcern:793960306882773003>

I wouldve been good
If not for that
Too bad my Dudu is missing Bianka B

I got my refund in the end but i never want to go through that process ever again
And vice versa
You just assume they understand you
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Heres some examples of me talking to Mihole CS about my refund on the Key of Castigation Umbrella because it was rejected by the warehouse
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Or was that for Handel i forgot
Prob MB
Make sure the things you buy wont exceed the Dimension limit… so size limit, weight is subjective because they just charge extra the heavier it is
Yep
Taobao/Tmall
Yep
They speak in Mandarin
You also have to talk to Mihole staff and the warehouse
Imagine paying 50$ to ship it back to Mihole to get 30$ Refund
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Not like i wanna die trying to do so
I didnt see the other images so I didnt know, but its fine, its still really cute so i didnt need to return it
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
But it was actually this
I bought this thinking it was a beanie
So I got HoS, Eden and Elysia
They did Alice In Wonderland themes Flame Chaser too… but that was b4 2nd Half of Flame Chaser so it didnt include Griseo, Kosma or Pardo
Very worth, they added in Kosma too so I need to get those… then I can take a break til next year
At least I didnt buy any heavy shit outside of just the 2 Plushie, and those 2 were the only reasln my shipping went up to 50 usd

If not, it wouldve been around 25-30 usd for shipping which i can package most of them together because keychains and whatnot are light asf
So its not that bad
Legit a merch I bought back in March only arrived last month
Its not bad tbh, I only do my mass buy like every few months <:deadge:975652771082698782> and I wait like 2-3 months b4 I can even pay to have them shipped
But it depends
Like the merch can cost me like 20-40$ while shipping is like an additional 28-50$


Hmm… Prob well over 200, maybe around 300-400
Not a lot tbh, the shipping price is the most costly part

ngl, it almost reminds me of the Australian Govt but the difference is that the Govt were being idiots instead <:kekpat:913676309744451634> legit bleached their own ocean and coral reefs that they couldve used for Advertisement/Entertainment/etc for Money but instead, they reduce the taxes for Oil Companies and allowing them to open up more places to dig up Oil and destroy the environment while they're at it

What did i walk into
…
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
They werent kidding when they said this was the longest Chapter and Arc Mihole Writer did
I legit kept thinking, the Act must almost be done soon
me ngl
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:worryPray:729809925760614439>
its midnight and I binged Chapter 31 Act 1 and Act 2 in one day (literally today, so im tired)
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
im on NA Genshit, but im about to sleep rn
shut up, at least I binged it all in one day

plus, it just means I was immersed enough for it to feel like 4 hours
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
its around 10 hours
so yea nvm
oh wait, I prob did all of Chapter 31 today in 1 full run <:wheeze:833318723565649950> 

lets see, I started the Chapter prob around 1-2 pm... and its currently midnight...
Cuz I still needed to do the Can shop
I even said so
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
I already did the Act where Herrscher of Corruption Appeared, aka when Vill-V did her thing

I started on the 2nd part that was locked til this version all today
even dialogues
I literally read and wait out every single cutscenes
skipped what
<:eek:765359367524188161>
im so tired now
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
including eating dinner
yes... though i would say it took me like maybe 6-8 hours instead
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im tired man
meaning from the start of Herrscher of Corruption's appearance... all the way to the Banquet
I binged the entirety of the chapter today
if you want to know
I needed to use the restroom too
shut up, its like midnight rn
but only the 50 sp summon airstrike support
my 1st try, i was just trying to brute force it, but I didnt know that I couldnt use the 125 Sp Ult
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
tbh, I wouldve taken 2 try like with the Pardo one... but I kept messing up and running/dodging **into** Elysia's attack on my 2nd try and it was somehow worse than my 1st try
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
same, the Mantis/Bullet hell, took me a total of 3 because, 1st one, I forgot dodging was a thing, and the 2nd try was because I keep moving too far away from Ely and get bad luck and smacked by her skills
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
then it was too annoying without spamming it
didnt use the Ult either because I was an idiot
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I didnt know Pardo 1 time healing was literally just a 1 time thing, so it took me a 2nd try for phase one...

then took like 3 tries for the next phase cuz I keep on forgetting to dodge and didnt expect her weapon skill to not have I-frames during that fight
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
did you clear it all in 1 try im assuming?
I picked Hard Mode
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
oh yea, for the Banquet, what difficulty did everyone choose
too bad I just prefer cuteness over handsomeness
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
yes, that
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
Kebin is just adorable when smol though, Adult Kebin is just Kebin
Kosma is adorable regardless if hes smol or older
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
Smol Kebin is way too cute
because crying outside means my Jingwei Plushie that im currently hugging for comfort will get soaked in tears
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
now im just crying on the inside
I finally got time to do the story today
but they wont sent this one back because this one is a separate order
so like if the fan here gets rejected, then this whole package will be sent back because they are all in the same Order
I suffered because I didnt know that...

so I bought the Key of Castigation Umbrella along with some Keychains...

but because the Umbrella was too long, the warehouse rejected the package... and they return it back to Mihole... including the Keychains cuz they were all in the same packages...

so had it been separate purchases, then the Keychains wouldve stayed while only the Umbrella gets shipped back
so if its 1 at a time, the item wont be associated with it... you can always package them all together at the warehouse in the end
make sure to buy them 1 at a time, just in case the Warehouse Rejects one of the items... that way, you wont suffer... cuz if they reject an item, they reject the entire package and all the item with it... even if the other items were fine
for Keychains and Acrylic Stands, its prob cheaper... but the minimum shipping price is prob around 20$
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
shipping not included because the shipping can prob be like 20-50$... heavier + bigger = more pricey

just shipping the pillow or my Jingwei Plushie costed me 50$ usd when the thing itself was like 20-30$
60 yuan for the pillows, so 8.70 usd, 28 chinese yuan for Acrylic Stands
and heres the Pillows
Acrylic Stands yep
I have too many Keychains
I take it ngl
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
its an Acrylic Stand
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>
they finally added in Kosma and the other 1/2 of the Flame Chaser as Merchs too
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
why are these so cute
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
well, Taobao is in China, so Qatar should be way closer as compared to the US
or at least the warehouse than handles the shipping there
some items might be able to be shipped, but you have to check with Taobao themselves and talk to their CS if you can ship it there
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
More keychains too
Middle Tag means Consumer Protection, last 15 days after the transaction has been concluded 

If the item was stolen, broken or you dont get the item after payment, then everything will fall on the Seller’s fault for returning the item and payment stuff (this doesn’t count if the warehouse rejects the item and sends it back, cuz if they do, you gotta get a refund)

3rd Image is 7 day return but thats useless cuz we are overseas <a:kekah:844467095227990028> 

1st image is the most important because it usually mean Basic Guarantee (so its a legit good)
I look for these kinds of tags to tell if its reliable XD
its Delta Month
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Yea, they will usually ship it to the warehouse and then the warehouse will check the items b4 charging you money to ship oversea
Cuz Taobao does have special tags/symbols for certain merchs
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
True, I only buy from the tags that states they are reliable
You can talk to CS in English and they’ll respond to you in Chinese
So use Google translate or learn Mandarin
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Where do you live? Taobao is all in Chinese btw
If it wasnt so hot in Cali rn, i wouldve worn it and showed you how it looked
I use Taobao, so the Chinese version of Amazon/AlieExpress but with little to no scam
Taobao so suffered a lot from shipping
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Both?
I thought it was a beanie… but it was literally something else lmao
Its a pillow too
If only there was a Kosma one
Kebin adorable… i didnt even notice the Rice on his face
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
I just got this one like 2 days ago
no SpA so I had a really scuffed time
mainly Fischl
because Kosma stole HoT, FR and Fischl
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
AE, Eden, Mobi
ended up with this scuffed Ass Mobius run
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>

<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Fuck
Ig i can try pulling her and the weapon and then cope with Stigmata for rerun
Now im too poor for HoH
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I should’ve stopped when I pulled Bastet MB
I lost like 6k xtal more than I needed to
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Can I run BroNex TB Welt M?

Or is HoH charge attack?
So that I can wake up when the Concert starts
Anyways ima go to bed
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I have Welt M
Fck
Which stig can I run on her?
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I am poor for HoH
I got a 2nd Purana when all I wanted was Bastet T
Since it doesnt show all the skill, <:Copium:849740782583021598> 

For passive, you can pick any of the extra dice passive, the passive I wanted that wasnt in there was the Anger Threshold be Lowered from 100 to 70 but yea… The 50 Anger skill can either one of those 2 (so just pick one and have the other skill be Impair)
I can try getting on the game later and try showing a screenshot for better clarification
I just used the usual 

Mask Start for Hp Loss Dmg, 

The Anger +25 (+50 if under 50% Hp)

And then the Dmg Based Off Hp Loss + 10% Healing Total Skill

Third skill should be Impair related for 30% Dmg Buff

Passive were more Dice, and Anger related passive
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
There were many Kalpas Stage though
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
instead, I wasted 3 multis getting:

Purana Dupe, another Twin of Eden... and then copium SN piece
...
I shouldve stop pulling when I gotten MB
I got cucked so hard
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Im now coping because im missing Bastet T
yesnt, be baited like all of us
<:SmolBread:694399009082703883>
then I ended up ti 1k xtal and a missing Bastet T
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<@447218009749061632> it was this image, basically how I was baited into Bastet
and all that came from it was copium
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Lost an extra 6-9k xtal cuz of that
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
I shouldve been content with on MB
at first it was ok... then I tried pulling for the T piece...
<:COPIUM:897281976317411378>
I got free resos so its fine
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I lost all my xtal pulling for Bastet
<:derpostasis:834561554858770513>
Render resolution good at 1.1 right?
<:kekers:809958778812366908>
Should i turn on motion blur?
I forgot i turned off so much of my genshin settings on my laptop
Its ok
Thats just weed, your character are on drugs hallucinating rn
That heals
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Watch Hydro Archon be a turret
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
True
Oh
<:kekpat:913676309744451634> why? Because of Nilou?
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
But its not the case
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
If thats the case, Flame Tuna wouldnt have been cucked so often
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
But SpA isnt Quatum Fire
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I’ll prob pull for Elie later when she reruns
And Pardo is just overtuned so its quite impossible to replace her anytime soon
Just gotta fatten up my support first
I have HoR and SW so im safe for ice
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
I’ll cope and skip Ely, I want her, but its too hard <:KekPat:966625000339668993> I can cope with SS SW
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
I have like 11k xtal
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I already have Purana
What im pulling for is Bastet
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I really do need it
I'll prob pull for Bastet
<:COPIUM:897281976317411378>
so ig in like 12 hours for me then
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
also, Bastet Banner when?
<:COPIUM:897281976317411378>
who knows
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
mine's just has really shitty luck
durable enough not to be destroyed instantly
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
the screen snapped
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I remember when one of my laptop got destroyed falling 2 feet off the ground... actually, it was like 1 feet...
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I thrown mine across the room and it will be fine yet falling like a few feet off the ground somehow destroyed it
it was during PE, it fell like maybe 4-5 feet off the ground and cracked inside out
oh woaw, thats my Iphone I had like 5-8 years ago b4 it fell and broke to pieces in Middle School
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
and what model?
how many years?
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
ima take this gif
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:yep:833766933685076029>
because Su is also 2 letters
yes Al
or Baizhu
im pulling for Cyno, and if im lucky Al or Kusanagi
I only have like 16k xtal
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
better than me who didnt play for 3-4 patches... how much xtal loss and welkin loss is that
gotta trash yourself
sadge
no self-deprecation?
<:derpostasis:834561554858770513>
I went to sleep at 6 am and woke at 7 am to go take my SAT/ACT
Summer...
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
you dont sleep at 1 am?
kekw
ye, especially with electro
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
im saving for Cyno, because hes Sumeru Razor, even called it since 2020


?
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
Ive slept since Yae's patch
ishoke, I slept through like 4 patches
you do i think? but I just went to the statue immediately
I can cope with Dendro Traveler
I went straight to Sumeru
I didnt even do Chasm
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
Make sure its the right path or else it will make you install the game a 2nd time
and then after moving the game files, the launcher can either move with it... and you just make sure its opening with the correct path and whatnot
You just connect it to the laptop, and then just move the game files into the SSD like how you would for a USP or HDD
im using a ssd rn to play Genshin
yea
?
I need them to Nuke artifacts rng please... <:eek:765359367524188161> ngl, their artifact rng is even more disgusting than other Gacha's game Equip Rng
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Imagine Spending 40 Fragile Resin just to not even get a single decent piece for my Yae
lets have all your Resin be gone for nothing...
game said fuck you
im just trying to build my Yae on the new set
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
what is this bullshit
I even rolled 80 EM and more Flat Def even with double crit starter
...
legit im not kidding... I had like at least 10 artifacts rolling Flat Def/Atk on 4th and then just cucked me the whole way
<:huh:966619839307321394>
or 50 Flat Atk
and all my Double Crit Pieces roll 60-80 Flat Defense
40 Fragile Resin
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I hate this game
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
same
it was strangely accurate too
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
it tells me about my life, but i never follow through with it
ye
I would have to google them
I know mainly just the Major Arcana, but nothing else
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
but I dont really use them
oh, nice, I have Tarot cards
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oh, 3 for 1
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
throw in 33 artifacts and you get 1 back?
Ive never used it
how does Strongbox work?
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
watch a chests guide
<:yep:833766933685076029>
or dont touch any chests and then use interactive map
or 36% Atk
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
well, it should be good on her considering her only other set is:

15% Electro and 18% Atk
<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>
you have more than 40 em?
<:Um_actually:1008018476859932742>
so op
4 stat start
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
swirl cant crit anyways so you are fine
?
does vv even work with dendro?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
once I actually get home... ill see if I can farm for her artis and run it with Dendro  traveler
how long does it take to unlock the Dendro Domain?
vs 15% Ele Dmg Bonus and 18% Atk
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
180 EM, 14% Atk, 27% Elemental Skill Dmg Bonus
im transition my Yae to the new EM set
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
thats quite poor
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
I'll have 1.5k Artifacts once I spend all my fragiles on Yae artis
I have none cuz I slept for 3 patches
gib
even Jean avoids me
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
me with no actual Anemo characters
<a:Whale:557787005959012352>
after spending all 50 fragile resin
so ill be extra bald
i need to farm all of my Yae artifacts too
...
ye, since its a rainforest and desert region

plus, we still need the Enka, Dragonspine, or Chasm equivalent for Sumeru too
<:yep:833766933685076029>
smol region
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
still havent unlocked Chasm Underground
how tf will I do Sumeru
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I havent even done Chasm Main Quest
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I also have school
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
now I only need to worry about how much Resin ill waste farming for Yae 4p set
anyways, 3.0 is just a very easy skip for me anyways
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
because it was annoying for the most part and I hated the fact that I had to run and climb up and down 3 mountains while doing music notes puzzle that didnt even play any good music
XD
yet you cant skip Xinyan's dialogues
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
purgatory is nothingness so its even more boring
and so is hell
heaven is boring
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
not me, I just want to die in my sleep... but then if I die, I wont be able to see the ending for One Piece, or Honkek or anything good
Did Carv just killed him and reset the fight
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
For Carv to be counting
What happened here
<:KekPat:966625000339668993> you’ll get a decent one sooner or later… the FMA collab should have a 5* Ice Archer in there <:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462> 

Better than me getting a bunch of useless 5* Artifacts I couldnt even use
What was the problem, you have no archer?
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Oh nice, that reminds me of when I pulled Tamarine from my free pull
<@986224050877628487>  

This is where I get my unit's kit... it also sommetime have unreleased unit's kit  like ML Pavel and the FMA Collab char
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
its so dogshit, but i have no other option
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
its an Econ Class too
the class legit have 85% of my grade based off my midterms and Final... no notes allowed either...
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
Midterm - 35%
Final - 50%
at least better than mine...
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Its not that bad
Its only HoFs on Ignite weather
The good old dogshit SS Bounties
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I remember back when Ether Fuel was not an issue but everything else is
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
end me
from 12 pm to 8:50 pm

also that excludes how long it takes for me to drive there
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I have classes today
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
Houkai Gakuen Wendy
<:slapbaka:974814370817273876>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
so instead of Eden smiling at Su while Kalpas is being Edgy in the corner

Eden now in the Corner smiling at a Edgy Kalpas with Su right behind him
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I fucked up my stickers on my pc, I accidentally swap Eden and Kalpas places
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
yes its english
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Me, and then theres Summertime Render Thursday
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Oooo nice
Ye
Anyways good night
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I wished the world had like a skill tree or something so I can add in skill points for Language Comprehension
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Too many languages for my brain
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Ngl, my memories is quite dogshit
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Also taking spanish class in highschool did not help either
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
But when 2 languages have similar aphabets, it fcking confuses me and overwrites one another
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
Its how i adjusted to the US aphabets easily
They do give the books on how to write it, so they did teach it… but you know how basically preschool sht are, its basically just like the aphabets and all that bs… and then all the basic vocabulary like mẹ and whatnot
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Im surprise yours is worse than mine who are like boomers
At least i know some basic vietnamese and thats about it
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I moved from vietnam to the US but since I was like 9, it doesnt mean shit
My dad is like 50 years older than me
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
1951 and 1968, you honestly think my parent can teach for shit
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Correct, my speaking for vietnamese is quite limited
I say speak, not read, dont expect someone who was barely 9 when they moved to the US to be able to read vietnamese, I wasnt even in Kindergarten yet
At least I can somewhat understand and speak for mine
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
for me, at first, my parents were worried I wouldnt know English well enough and now its the opposite...
welp, time to sleep, ill finish downloading Genshin Predownload tmr ig
and thats about it
I can somewhat understand the basics
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
I cant read or write my own language
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
vietnamese?
but then they talk so fast and you're like, how tf can you tell the tone apart
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
can change literal meanings too
but the tone is everything
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
oh yea, the 4 tones
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
its also hard to read, but thats because every new language is hard to read and write as compared to speaking it
same
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
CN is more soothing for my ears
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
though for Honkai, I prefer CN more, though JP is quite good too
I usually do CN, sometimes JP and KR, but never EN
they just need to pronounce the name in their own language in a literal sense
its why I listen to it in CN, JP, or KR because they dont need to butcher anything
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
afterall, look at Fischl Eng VA butchering her German
honestly, I knew pronouncing their name will suck ass
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
I love how twitter pepegas are being idiots again because Tighnari VA cant pronunce the character's name right even though in the video talking about how to pronounce his name, they said it was very hard or somewhat annoying to pronounce his name
I need to sleep too
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
My Genshin Predownload is taking forever
like the PC turns on... but you cant even use the keyboard to start it up pass the loading screen
I once had it so bad, it couldnt even connect to the keyboard anymore
it was enough for me to run roblox and play Elsword back then <:kekpat:913676309744451634> 

but it was so old and I was so young, I prob went through like 4-5 of them, each getting destroyed within a year from all the viruses and the fact that I never updated the browsers/drives
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
I destroyed a really old pc once with hundreds of viruses
like me when I was little
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
well, also young stupid brats
old people sometimes is like a magnet for viruses
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
im not surprised... one of my other friend had to build a proper anti virus on the pc/laptop they gifted to their mother... legit in the first day or few hours of using it, their anti-virus blocked at least like 500-900 viruses or pop-ups
nah, more like my father, and partically my mother because my bank account is still connected with hers
legit you can only make like 10k a year, and if you have more than like 2-3k in your bank account, you now somehow now get less money from the govt
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Im partially not allowed to use my money, considering I have a certain amount of funds hidden somewhere as emergency funds because having too much money in your bank account lets the government know to give you less financial aid even if you are poor in poverty
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
I use my own money, anytime they asks me what I used my money for, I just say Gas and School supplies
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
some Asian talking on the phone, their normal speaking sounds like they are screaming across the rooms
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I dont because I rather not hear them nag for an extra 8 hours...

like im not kidding... I once had to listen to them ramble about my younger brother for like an hour and a half... plus an extra hour of them talking on the phone on similar subject
while being on their 3rd year of college
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
who still dont know want they want for their career
basically dont be like me
take care of your mental health, play more gacha games, and go to college and get a decent job/career
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
I honestly dont give a fuck about that though, since im basically the weird middle child
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
Im very neutral about my mom, I dont hate her, but I dont like her either

afterall, it really isnt a nice feeling when your own mother tells you that she really wanted to have an abortion and the only reason why she didn't was because she didn't want bad rumors to spread and because of god or whatever religion/higher being it is
im in college now so that doesnt matter as much but yea
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I would say my mom spends more money sendings gifts back to vietnam than taking care of me
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
just move away, make money, and occasionally send them gifts and money
<:derpostasis:834561554858770513>
another one I known, he basically wasnt even allowed to leave his house
while for others, their parents are overprotective as fck where they feel restricted
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
it all depends person to person, my brother moved out because he hates how annoying my mother can be...

even now, my mom's wants to to check up on him, legit not even a day after he moved and see hows he doing at school when school doesnt even start until like tomorrow
my brother hates my mom for instance, so he decided to move to a place thats a 10 hour drive away to go to a college there
Ig just pray and survive, go to college and then move away from them
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I honestly cant tell either, <:deadge:975652771082698782> 

since my views for it is quite warped since one of my friend had an abusive mother so she got a restraining order on her <:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462> so the info I can go off of are all quite extreme
so my math capability went down to oblivion
because I couldnt learn for shit
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
though sadly, im no longer motivated for it once online classes became a thing
im ok with math...
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:derpostasis:834561554858770513>
and Fire gets cucked again
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
instead, we'll get Yoimiya as another S rank Fire Dps
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
how did this even happen
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I also have 2 full set of Zhenyi now
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
because you need to just git gud and be like me with a full set of Margrave TMB

and another maxed out Margrave TB
no
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
I hope they announce APHO 3 in the Concert
well, APHO 2
most definitely
even my Eden is using Margrave because HoT stole Handel
my Pardo is coping so hard on Margrave
I still need a full set of Bastet
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
so 4 more days
because its 8/21 rn
a week
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
so 1 week
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
usually 1-2 weeks
Kise and Sigret Rate up is basically dead week
thats my IGN
HgAlice
so CN on Honkai and Genshin
because I like using the Voice-Over for the characters in the original language of the game
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
now I need to redownload the language package to KR
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
I just finished updating E7
I got into Gold surpisingly
She's basically good for PvE but kinda useless everywhere else (which is just pvp or Fire Content)
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
for Re: Zero, we got Rem and basically they gave you enough resources to 6* her
its usually 1 Collab Char as Free, and then the rest are gacha
idk who will be the banner as the filler til the Collab though
and Moonlight Pavel in 10~ days
thats all I know
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
in 3 days, they should be announcing the Full Metal Alchemist Collab
They were old units but since they are collab, they tend to stay good for quite a while
If not, then with the counter set, she'll have a chance to do a normal counter
its basically like this:

Enemy use an AoE

You roll a D20 for each Ally that got hit by the attack (so up to 3)

As long as one of the 20% Roll procs, then she will use her AoE counter
should be attack sadly
it will only activate once, but have a separate chance to proc per ally targeted
yea, because the 20% is separate per ally
Ras is good though at least, well, Adventurer Ras is good
oh, good luck
so if you get hit by an AoE, higher chance of it proc-ing
yea, thats why its fun using her

you use counter set so she either counters with a basic attack or if her allies gets attacked, then she counters with an AoE

its a separate proc per ally... so its 20% per ally targeted, but it will only activate the counter once per Skill
if not, shes useless
you need Sigmund Scythe for Rem though
Emilia is nice, Rem is nice, but 20% Counter is sad, but when rng does work in your favor, its quite something
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
I chosen Sigret too
Annoyed there was no new Re Zero character though
<:yep:833766933685076029>
Rem, Ram, and Emilia
dead week too because Sigret Rate up along with another dead unit
now I have to cope and wait for the collab banner instead
<:eek:765359367524188161>
Im only on like the 2nd region XD

I should actually do it for Adventurer Ras though... also, their Summer Banner sucked Ass
guess we'll have to wait and see
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
im still doing only Wyvern 10 or 11
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
lemme update my E7 first though
add me
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I just stop playing the game like 3 weeks ago
which server are you on for E7?
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
fatter succ too
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
farming for the Yae 4p set
Once the new version drop, ill start malding
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
too bad its another Regisvine
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
isnt it 4.0 yea
way too creepy
it was a literal cat in clown make-up
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
the other gif was cursed so I didnt wanna use that gif
because its one of the emote that just exists
<:Clussy:1006905943520452690>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
also, we still dont have a Standard Geo 5* in the Gacha
dont need Ganyu, already have Dongli, dont want Kekomi, and Tighnari is in Standard so I rather lose 50/50 for him instead
I can sleep on them banners for 3.0
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
the emote separated the statement
different statement
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
for Less Rng
More Rng
Basically drop rates for Atk%, Def%, and Hp% are like lower by like 1.6% at most, in return for Dendro Goblet getting that %
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
So how is it that you have a 100% Lose Rate on the Summer Betting event anyways
I rather not bald in Nirvana against QUA mobs
Ima stay in RL this whole Patch
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
same, Top 3 are all Vill V Simps
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
sounds bout right
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
how is it
oh, you bought it?
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Its a Bluetooth Speaker with Lamp Function
1/2 point
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
now you just need to guess what it do
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
I'll give you a hint, its Wonderland Themed Flame Chaser
also guess what this is
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
I would buy this too, but I currently have no reason too and same reason not to buy as the controller
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
umbrella hilt
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<:yep:833766933685076029>
Key of Castigation Umbrella
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Im still annoyed I couldnt get this because it exceeded the Size Limit for shipping overseas
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
and I dont wanna ship a controller overseas knowing it will break somehow
its because Bronya week rn is the Controller
so I dont need to care about any of the Merchs
also, its Bronya's Month/Week
I picked Kosma
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
out of these charms, who would you have chosen
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
its his money, he built it himself and bought all the parts himself
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
why?
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
nah, he used his own money for that
that will take care of the bug
burn your house down
oof
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
he spent at least 5k Usd building his gaming pc and he also bought a 100$ Body Pillow
that amount is nothing compared to how much my brother spent anyways
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
I will be fine
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I dont have to worry about those til Nov 3rd
I only have those left to go
cuz im buying the Fu Hua Merchs and Kosma
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
and I dont have to worry about those til Sep-Nov
I still only have 3 more left before I stop
but its ok
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
then whatever remains, I use for food, gas and this
so now I have money to buy my books, supplies and all that bullshit
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
what, im not kidding, I ran out and then my Uni Financial Aid money came in like a week ago
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
by the time I run out, I get more funds
<:yep:833766933685076029>
I do, but my timing for my funds come impeccably
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
38$ if I use sea shipping
its gonna cost me 47$ for shipping
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
with no new SP Valk while every other Element gets like 2-3 each
because the supports are outdated for like 3 years
where we will also sell you a new unit that gets bodied just as bad
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Come to Kekvana, here we have QUA Weathers for this patch for your special Bodying
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I have it but its too hard to decorate it
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Why couldnt you do it for them
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Im modless thankfully, wait thats a lie, I was a mod in another server but I retired and on another I asked to be demoted to helper
Vill-V getting cucked even in her own weather
Moroso was coping so hard for a Fire Support and instead, we now got 2 Rank Fire Dps to add to the collection
We found out she was dps
And then when the Beta started
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Back when Moroso tweeted out her as the Fire Support and PE as the S rank dps
It was b4 they did the beta
Yep
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Remember when Moroso thought Rita was gonna be Fire support too when the stats later showed DPS all the way
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:kekers:809958778812366908>
QUA
That brought a shittier weather back
And our Fire legit just became another S rank dps
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
0 Fire
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Fire is literally living in the past
We have yet to have a Fire SP too
Having Ignite Weathers yet no Ignite SP Valk is just copium
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Not like it matters, afterall, we legit have dedicated Bleed Weather and Freeze Weathers now
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
We already gets type disadvantage against AKA anyways and the one who dont already have Ignite in their kit like Dudu and Rita
Lmao
Or Rondo Sakura Pri
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
That’s literally just Flame Tuna minor 0.1 Ignite
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Well, actually, if her SP gather wasnt so scuffed
It wouldnt have been as cope
If only Raven could Ignite
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Ikr
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
Which for a gacha game, having hackers is quite oof
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
Yea, minor mods or something but I know it prob wont happen because its a running game, being able to mod it means it can get hacked depending on the situation too
“Mods benefits Honkai and Genshin”
“Why ToF is a Better Genshin”
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Im just looking at his vids and they were all clickbait or cringe titles
<:kekers:809958778812366908>
So I can at least not do 0 dmg
I need to get PE Bianka B at least too
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Same, but I just need a Ignite Fire SP Support for my Flame Tuna
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
And another 14 min video on how you can see HoV panties
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Sorry, I need to correct myself, he made a 24 minutes video about HoV instead
All the “safety” checks video are still as degen though so im not surprised
Like how tf can you ramble on about that for 15 min
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Probably because he once made like a 15 min long video about just HoV summer skin win angle that showed her undies being censored by Mihole
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Isnt he always like that, even in his reaction back when I ised to watch him feels really fake
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
<:eek:765359367524188161>
Yep
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
iirc while being bored wanting to watch some Honkek reactions, I saw he uploaded his Ely Reaction but I really didnt wanna touch it so I moved on
Im truly surprised
Yes he does… and I do agree <:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I forgot to do Abyss for the lvl 35 cap
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>
I only got 180k with my lvl 30 Mobius
what was your build?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Kosma
Thank God Im not in Nirvana rn
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
so i have to restart my run
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I love it when my controllers just suddenly disconnect while fighting Tonah and Kosma
Fucking hell
didnt even noticed
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
sex
I just love how on my discord notes, all it said was one word
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
my Tuna never carried me because it was scuffed
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
All are Loser is a good one too
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
How do you get it to look like this without anything in the background
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
At least those works
Its why I choose TruE and Moon Halo or Oracle
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>

<:eek:765359367524188161>
There’s literally a Character Trial for everyone
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Same
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Actually Baban isnt wrong
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
yea, pretty much
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
nice lol, I could already go to Warren but since i didnt do the main quest, i didnt get to unlock the Map Expansion
owo flip

<:deadge:975652771082698782>
FR for the win
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
I dont even have V2v so I can suffer
while AE is like granny age for her kit thats somehow lasting us for so long still
and Raven is just as scuffed for SP
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
it doesnt help that we have yet to get a good Ignite Fire SP Valk either
everyone gets to suffer equally ig
Bald
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>

The math has proven true
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I just want 4* Zero... so I can get the Dmg Bonus and 30 sec CD instead of 60 sec CD along with the Healing when Shield is up
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I need that 2p Crow Matrix set for the Dmg Bonus
I fight Ice Robot but I moved to Sobek because of the Crow Matrix I got
mine is Sobek but thats with other people
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
Tank Resonance with Healing
cuz im running Merylin, Zero and Huma
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
yea, I got King from Purple too, and then got him again on Gold... even though I currently have no use for him
I once ran a mile because of PE class and I was wearing my sweater/jacket the whole time in Highschool
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>

<a:Chatting:1008016148907950153>

<:wheeze:833318723565649950>

<:wheeze:833318723565649950>

best part is that I choose the smallest model for mine
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>

Ig ill stream the pulls for Mobimaid when it comes <a:KEK:740160662721921104>

my Whale Funds was to help me because I was running low after spending my funds on Taobao Mercs
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I love Ely, but I need to save my money
nah, im not gonna whale for HoH
<a:HappyHB:792233374395269120>
yay, my ~~whale~~ College Financial Aid funds arrived today
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
which since I didnt know that, I lost so many times
So far, everything Ruby betted on lost
I blame Ruby for that
I wouldve done that if I had more Tickets
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Ikr, legit hdd is like using a USP to run Genshin
SSD and Ram stick, you want to have at least 16 GB of Ram to run the bare minutes for most good games nowadays 

And SSD is really needed cuz PC space
Basically these
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Its loud when its at max
Wanna recommended me a good cooling fan to buy? That isnt too expensive 

Anyways, I always have my current laptop fan at max too <:kekpat:913676309744451634>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I forgot to check how high mine goes… maybe 100?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Mine overheats too but thats cuz I use it 24/7
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Basically make sure the fans are working and nothing is blocking them
I can agree to this
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Heki… we already said, no spider… <:eek:765359367524188161>
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
100% Lose Rate Ruby
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
if only I could spoiler box Gifs
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
like I can understand if they dont want to get spoiled, but they legit used a gif from the animated short itself
because they wanted to wait for the Japanese version that will take at least another month to arrive
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
they didnt even watch the Animated Short and then showed a Gif from it before realizing it showed the FC 13 Signets and said they got spoiled
I cant sadly, they make me mald too sometimes
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
they are like Semi-new
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
and now they are working on Handel
They have Ely T and just Crafted Ely B
I dont even think they have a single stig from that pool
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
no, if anything, they prob want all the stig in there
<:derpostasis:834561554858770513>
my friend wants to use the Griseo Skin Spending event, and skip her skin and use the Stigmata Ticket to pick Ely M...
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
I wanna mald
Ruby rigged it
Kal shouldve won had Can rng didnt happen
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
but its still 50/50 between picking one or the other and Ruby always loses anyways
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
and math says Ruby always loses
I feel at ease knowing that Ruby picked Eden
same
<:eek:765359367524188161>
pepega
Genshit is just the usual Gacha
im talking about the SummerEvent
I never knew someone who was this bad at losing 50/50
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
the math says 50/50, but the math for Ruby says 100 fail rate
The one that wins will always be the opposite of what Ruby picked
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Ruby rigged it
Can chan botta ruin Ruby's whole Career like it did when it bodied Kalpas
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
Next time an event like this happens, I know to bet the complete opposite of Ruby
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
With the Aponia winnings
I went all in on Pardo
Math has proven
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<@180679257851166721> your 100% Lose Rate is still going strong
<:pepepoint:887695198577127474>
The answer will obviously be FBI
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
true
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I have same funds as Carv, but ill lose 9.6k after Mobimaid
shut it, Carv has more funds than me though cuz 9.8k of mine is going to Mobimaid
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
...
oh ho
Ruby has a 100% Lose Rate, he only won all the Fake one
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

<:eek:765359367524188161>
<:eek:765359367524188161>
ill cringe extra if you somehow win the beach battle after riggin it on me
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

Mobi Maid coming out same day as 3 part of the Summer Event
<:deadge:975652771082698782> I hope my Bday Luck last that long to pull her
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
Wow, you even said the full server nickname
Even if its a test server, seeing that is still painful
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I can still feel pain from my heart though
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
All maxed too
<:jj:472591044681400332>
Oh?

My Bday Present would be Ruby 100% Lose Rate continuing

<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Oh, I legit forgot today was my Bday, thanks for the 100 xtal Mihole
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
Thus, Math Dictates this will be the same
Ruby has a 100% Lose Rate
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
that Ruby is cursed
yes, the math checks out
Ruby - Fails every Bet so far
<:yep:833766933685076029>
wait, nvm, I did vote Pardo
I was able to vote Aponia, but I think I voted Eden so Ruby gonna make me lose there
<:kekers:809958778812366908>
Got it, pick Aponia and Pardo
<:kekers:809958778812366908>
So who did Ruby bet on this time
Thus, you bet the complete Opposite
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
Whoever Ruby bet on seems to lose
<:kekers:809958778812366908>
Give Ruby the Cursed Gambler Role please
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Mobi shouldve won but Ruby bet cuz none of her procs to work
I lost like 2k cuz if Ruby, Kalpas almost won too but Ruby bet Kalpas so Can chan proc twice and bodied him
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
You fcking
Then you were the reason I lost
Kalpas and Mobi?
Then who did you voted
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:cat_sip:978644524039553054>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
TaiHen is calling your clothing cute
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Buy the Bronex clothing from Mihole Taobao, those were pretty Unisex
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Was that why I lost all my points
<@180679257851166721> who did you bet on yesterday? Kalpas and Mobius?
I know, its Kebin day with Chill buff
even with Kebin, its not as high as I wanted it to
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
then again, I wasnt using Kebin
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
same
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Kalpas shouldve won that but Can just proc twice
its so rigged
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:eek:765359367524188161>
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>

<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>

<:kekpat:913676309744451634>

<:yep:833766933685076029>
Kevin being forced to joke around in itself is already funny

<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
time to lose all my xtal
oh, nice
which week is Mobimaid skin?
<a:YEPJAM:871530521220489226>
This was so **not** worth it <@309634550273933314> <@781539392039682058> I recommend suffering by climbing this tower later
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
for me, Im waiting for Ruby, that way, I can get her and then kick out King or keep King and remove Zero when I need the Dps Resonance
how am I even top 2%
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
lmao
everyone sleeping this week
what is with the game and creepy ass robots
HgAlice
<:yep:833766933685076029>
Add me Heki
are you in Babel as well?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
too bad I dont like bows... well, I might pick the Cube afterall and buy a copy of it for C1 so that I can heal
12.5 and 10 shatter
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
King and Huma are both Shieldbreak
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
who should I pick as my SSR
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
I just got Crow from the Purple
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I just read light novels
<:yep:833766933685076029>
if you are under 70, you are young
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
btw, there are skin gacha in ToF, for some reason, they make those skin gacha cost like 9k xtal for hard pity too so like a pyramid skin
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
mine
children just pays their tax with school labor
because everyone pays tax
<:yep:833766933685076029>
I just sent Tet a voice message whispering, there's voice chat <@309634550273933314> have fun with the creepy message
with Tet
im so lonely over here
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>
so we can all join a server together
Im just waiting for the Server Transfer shit
what server are you on?
already got Banges and Astra
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I wanna get the 85% Crown Exploration Costume
since collecting the characters are useless because i will always use my main guy
Im doing the same but I also wanna gacha for meta
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
gacha gamer gotta do what we gotta do
but you can still collect the dmg reduction stacks
too bad you lose the dmg bonus after switching weapon
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
45% Dmg Bonus or 30% dmg reduction
Huma already works stonk at 1* advancement
Otto bootleg cube
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
I'll prob grab Cube for Mono Fire
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
all reso are except for the shitty hybrid one
but picking Cube gives me healing Resonance and then I can pull for Ruby for mono fire
Ice Greatsword lets me stay with Tank Resonance
though I might pick the Cube... not sure if I should pick Cube or the Ice Greatsword
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
because of Huma
im relegated to Tanking
<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
also have Chackram but i dont like it
me rn
but I rarely see Tet...
I have a main account which is in Babel with Tet, I just started a new one in Ethereal Dream cuz most of my other friends are there, but I am suffering just as much because the rewards are Character Oriented... so all my twitch drops and whatnot are in Babel
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
so now I have twice the amount of work
for me, I started on a new server as well
woaw
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but Huma does that well enough
Chackram is really only good for shield breaking
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
but I never use it
but its too late because all my main rewards are already given to the character in Babel
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
for me, the game gave me 1* Huma and the Chackram

I started on a new server to try an alt because I feel lonely that Tet is only lvl 19 and I got the Ice Sword lady for my guarantee 30
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
thats fine, not like it matters
lmao, internet explorer been dead for so long now
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
same with mine, but i understand some so its not as bad
<:A_HuTaoStare:899444164247298060>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
lmao
huh?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yea, this patch's Abyss is disgusting
just kidding, I can cope and stay in RL
down to agony i go
no Vill-V
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
easy sleep for me
then yea, im in Myriad against QUA Abyss
which one, Honkai's?
<:FeelsWeirdMan:748846745366167673>
I can never find any info
the question is how do we do it
I never picked up my high school diploma <:kekpat:913676309744451634> completely forgotten about it
lmao, im the one in College
not to me, Baban was always baban, i dont ever know age well
yes
how?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but the issue is if its possible but i dont think it is
though if theres a free Character Transfer, ill prob use it to move servers to one of my friend's server so i wont be lonely
this is my UID
110054554
HgAlice
im so lonely
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<@309634550273933314> Add me in Tower of Fantasy when you're free
<:yep:833766933685076029>
plus, I spent all my money on Taobao Merchs from Mihole
oh I can spend money when Herrshey Ely and Anni is right around the corner too
check the log
<:SadBb:552684268921290772>
fck
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
lmao
nani how
extra super gay
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
The Herrscher of Corruption was Mihole all along
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
that was why i didnt watch it yet
lmao, i thought it was JP
ill watch the JP one later
gib me the link to that one
btw, who has the Chinese Subs
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
also, why ping us
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
too bad none of us are
I got the Chackram
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
are these even worth it
good luck there
oof
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
irl stuff?
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
since there are some places I wanna unlock the 85% Completetion Costume
But i forgot if each region is harder than the previous
I honestly forgot, the region is larger than I thought
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
too bad quite a few seems like they prefer the game made char over their own
nice
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
some system feels ok, like the food system as that one at least is better than Genshin's
at least til they fix all of their QoL bs
it will most likely flop
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
my Username is HgAlice
Tet, add me then
the shield is fine at 0*, though the first one seems decent for extra tanking and dmg, but thats about it
same
They honestly suck with their server management skill
<:kek:809950280258945024>
cuz everyone are separated
but i forgot who
I know one of yall is in Babel with me because you told me that you picked the server
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I have no Queue time so im fine here
I think im on Babel
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
and i didnt wanna pick NA cuz i didnt wanna deal with the 10 hour long queue
joined whichever server was available at the time
im on South Asia Pacific or something
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Legit the weapon skill make you swap between the weapon form
Tower of Dudu
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I got the Dudu Shield that can even transform into an Axe like PE Dudu
same
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
im playing Honkai to catch up with the story before Ely Animated short
im not on rn
mine was the healing staff and that bow
<:kek:809950280258945024>
lmao
oh, same
I also have a sht ton of the bow dupes
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
like they legit told me, heres a healing staff and a dupe for your first 2 multi... now your guaranteed newbie SSR is the Shield
Though i should prob read what the stupid abilities are
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
I know, but I’ll have to pick between Cube Shota or the Scythe
Even have a healing Staff
Game made me a tank
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
I got Shield Fake Dudu
Lucky
Shield with Axe mode
they really gave me Dudu
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
dogshit game
gotta start all over if you wanna go to a new server
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
apparently, you can only play on the same server
what server is everyone in
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
no SSR
lucky, i got 2 healing staff which im fine with ig and a bow
Im still in game though
Wait really?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Wait are diff server diff characters too
<:kek:809950280258945024>
when you realize that you have Night Light mode on
mine was the absence of light, one reflect all light while the other doesnt have any to where you cant even see its texture
honestly, same, but for me, i used mine to make my hair lighter because apparantly, the game wont give me black hair unless it looks like a black highlighter so i opted to make it more gray
<:kek:809950280258945024>
btw, using new clothing cosmetic comes with their own color and not the same color as your outfit... so if you want to change the color from the basic bitch colors, you also needs it
disgusting
<:eek:765359367524188161>
actually, just to change anything
tf
wow, how rigged, just to change my hair color, i need premium currency
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
hmmm...
the scythe looks ok but the guy is kinda eh... the cube is cute too
the newbie event gives you a SSR selector for the basic SSR ig
I cant be bothered to reroll in a game i dont care about
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
even Genshin is not this bad for rerolling
it really isnt
<:kek:809950280258945024>
you always could
ikr
rigged tutorial and then they try to make me waste a single pull
<:kek:809950280258945024>
fuck this game in trying to make me gacha twice
anyways, when will it let me change my character's look smh, i need to lighten my char hair a bit because the game suck
im assuming the gold one is considering it has a pity
<:kek:809950280258945024>
Cant tell if the Gold or Purple one are rarer
pretty much
so you want dupes
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
and from what i see, the weapons have refinement level
same, plus, they dont have any weapon that I want on rate up anyways
Feelsbadman
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
But here we have Genshin whos char looks like actual infants
Griseo or Teri are like good example
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Genshin Lolis are like Infants
True, and I thought Genshin loli were bad
What else, an old lady voice act for Luffy, so of course its possible
Or lady
The male one?
Nice nice
Oh yea, the loli
It was hella weird
Yep
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I choose a green one and it gave me a weird error
K i choose Babel too
which servers did everyone choose
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Probably make one only because her playstyle is quite new
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
ToF has enough customization for you to copy pepega anime characters but not enough for actual good customizations
<:kek:809950280258945024>
ping once the game servers open up
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
My friend said you need to work on Kebin face size
And i prefer not suffering trying to refund it so yea
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Ik, i will, i somehow got 2 because i ordered it twice
I’ll get the link once i get home, not at my laptop so i cant send link since im using the app rn
Which one, theres 2

Alice in Wonderland and the normal one
<@482139585355448333> <:YEP:802850856118517790>
I just bought some, not a lot… one of them only came in yesterday
This was the one the finally arrived to my place, it was cute
I bought a lot of stuff, but i didnt have enough to buy SW stuff, like my HoS Birb Olushje barely arrived yesterday and I ordered like months ago
They do? Well weird ppl do exist on the internet
I just bought more Hua merchs afterall
I would buy it but i too poor
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
The beauty of Bronya dress
Who knows, im too tired to remember sht
Or maybe another anime
Blood Lad, too bad it isnt but it does share similarities
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Im not at my pc rn
Too bad ios screenshot are low quality asf
I already showed mine, I made like 2-3
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Cant type while driving
Well, if we can have a creep like Hisoka in here, wouldnt be suprised that was there
How lovely
I'll try anyways ig once I get back later
<:SadBb:552684268921290772>
I should try making Kosma but they dont have his hair
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
Sora doesnt have boomer handz for this stuff
but yea, each time you hit complete, it will save your current character look in the appearance hall, only accessible in the Share Option... you just click copy Character ID if you want to use an older preset because the game sucks
rip
they suck so it prob wont work, theirs look way uglier too
lemme stream it to you
lemme steal that to show my friend
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
nice, one of my friend tried making Kebin too... look at the side, it was ok, but looking at the front and it was a totally ugly stranger
click on share?
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
they have an import button but you need the character id each time to import the character lmao
I know, but im saying each time I leave the preset and go back into it, it changes my character face and how tall they are so i have to press reset each time to make them go back to normal
stop making my character tall
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
what I hate is the fact that I have to press reset each time cuz the models always changes for no reason
im using their own launcher and not steam lol
basically its in the Share Option, clicking Copy Character Id will auto change your preset to the one you made
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
it does, i made multiple too
just make sure to click complete each time, and when you go to the share section, you have multiple slots to overwrite it
you can save more than one character
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
so 3 weeks
21 days i mean
<:eek:765359367524188161>
but a month huh
ill take it
true
<a:KEK:740160662721921104>
oh, thats just the newbie quest
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
nah, theres no free weapon from pre reg, just cosmetics and random resources
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Same, I just like the Characters customization that seems to be able to rip out and make anime look a like perfectly
I want the Scythe
You must gacha for the weapon obviously
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Forget about healing

Im going to be spending 842 cny on new Mihole merch, this is excluding shipping cost
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
especially when you spend like a solid 30-50 pts just waiting for Husk to spawn its clock st
no balding can make you score that high
452 temp too
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
balding with lvl 78 units, S rank Fischl, no Pri on FR and using HoT on Husk

<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Cuz im in Cali
Well, its like 11 pm over here so who knows
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
And give the other person breather space or talk to them about it later on
I do the same sometimes but then i just give up and just relax
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
So theres no need to make yourself mald
But it doesnt seem like it was your fault nor did it seem like your intention to be unable to help them
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
No point in stressing yourself out
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
Then sleep it off too
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
a twunk?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
you prob just forget
nah, cum and piss are 2 different thing
hakcer too horny irl to have wet dream ig
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
feelsbadman
they dont get wet dream
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I just want Cyno and fake Su, thats about it,

Scaradoouche but i know Mihole will remove his hat so ill prob skip him
fake Su, wheres the long hair
Green Teri Teri
too bad you can see its fake ears like Kekqing
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
every archon description (except raiden) - a mysterious person
every other unit - their exact title and name
they really do
though if Cyno is electro or hydro, ill prob be malding and coping
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I just want Cyno and maybe the fake Su
better than what i can draw
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
Free SW weather for me though
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
After I sniped them, a bunch more sniped back
Nirvana will be Ice Hitcount Ely
? the current one which ends in like 6 min is Paralyze Husk on Lightning weather
4/4 SSS Raven
I even have her skin
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
SSS Raven and i still hate using her
Mihole just hate Fire
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Ice Ely is next, so very unlikely for now
I dont want Ignite weather at all
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I agree
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
unless its Ignite weather
I have a lot of unit so i dont have many issue
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
lmao
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
if I do good, then im good, if the others bald harder than me, oh well, I can still do well in the next RL rotation
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
so i can sleep fine
I have SS SW
I sniped them back
i have SS SW so im fine regardless if im in nirvana or not
oh, so SW weather
getting sniped by 1 pt, i can prob get my DK buff and kill them
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
well, that means i dont need to go to nirvana but thats still feels like shit
sniped 1 pt on me
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
this fucking bitch
Hitcount Husk wouldve been easy Aponia/SW weather
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Paralyze Husk
I dont think its as bad as mine, though thats cuz I have better scores
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Its like 90 degrees in my room rn
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im on na
rip
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
are you on glb or sea or cn
sniped 2nd though
god i hate the clock
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
K, hopefully once im free after helping my dad, ig ill try both team and see which gives me a better score
S2 HoT for me with max 7TR, no SSS Eden though

I have SS SW with max PRI too
Would HoT or SS SW be better here against Husk, brute force with type advantage or cope with Lightning weather
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
Those are just the degens, they are just degens, so nothing is wrong
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
For me, Loli and Shota is whatever since as Carv said, the meaning change, which is more to describe their body type anyways

Shotacon and Lolicon is the one with the yikes meaning tbh, since that would be what you call someone who fetishizes or are attracted to them
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Its twitter
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I also remember when Negro means the color black in Spanish but when you say it, people somehow just want to make it seems like you are racist because the same word was used as a term for black people back then
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
I just woke up so im totally innocent for what happeninf here
??
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Just Noot B them
Nah, just have SN kill them all if shes there
I’ll be getting food for my dad so yea brb
Who doesnt love controversy so yes here
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Imagine malding over rng in a gacha game
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
<:concern:966623298639261746>
Oh yea, a random note, anyone here played or heard of the game Abaddon Princess of Decay
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Waow, all the rip off
Thats enough for me to whale all i want
I suck so my score isnt that good
Which Abyss is this one again?
White Comet Augment
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
How sad
We havent had an Augmentation in years
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
If only Dante 3p was better
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Now wheres my Judah PRI
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
At least Abuse Flower looks good, only reason I use Bkek
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Green Doesnt match Bkek more tbh, ill take Green Teri over Green Bkek, but since I have Green Bkek, i am using it
Fu Hua is old, shes always based
Its ok, Mobi is green
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
This chaos is wonderful
Oh?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Too bad Bam was also a simp that was too attached to her due to stockholm syndrome
Rachel is indeed a bitch
XD
 this was one of the trailer for the anime, the others were a bit too spoilerly so I kinda didnt pick those trailers
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Fun fact, they censored a lot for the anime but its still extremely high quality

As for what they censored, the manga showed actual tits and ass <:KekPat:966625000339668993> so it was obv why they censored it
Theres still 10 more episodes til it ends
Theres Summertime Render, came out this season for you to pirate because its in Disney+ Jail, 1st half is Mystery, and 2nd half is more action oriented
What kind of anime do you watch?
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
You no watch Kaguya either? Season 3 really popped off with the quality 

Its Romcom obv
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
Its all cute so i love it
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
This is cute
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I blame YT for some of my taste, afterall, they decided to recommend me BDSM Yaoi content while I was watching video game walkthrough

I also remember when Euphoria was also on YouTube, truly cursed times but oh well
Im just fine with anything, Yuri, BL or just normal Romcom
Nice
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
The one thing I prob hate would be when looking for doujinshi, the bl one tend to somehow end up being furry sht or bara, like im ok with them, but theres way to many of those
They are cute too
I should watch it tbh, the art looks nice too
^^^
The literal definition would be something to describe a women/girl/female
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Probably
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I want some good Bl romcom too but too bad people now just want some sadomasochism
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
For me, I only started being kind to others after I roasted and kill myself and not care
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
The villains are smart and so is the mc, the first half is pretty much like mystery and thriller? I guess while the 2nd half just escalates into basically shounen action but with high quality sht
So its best to just watch the fansub because Disney is too much of a baka to not bring it internationally
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
For me, I was reading Summertime Render/Summertime Rendering again

Its a really good manga, theres even an anime Adaption which you can Pirate without remorse because its in Disney+ Jail Japan only
Yea
Its nice, the art is also pretty good for the manga, as for the novel, since I havent read it, I cant say for sure about it
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Oh, nice, I was reading that manga a long time ago XD
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
I even forgot to do ER last week and lost 500 xtal
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I havent done mine cuz ive been busy
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I do the same except for the bosses i know i can get good scores for
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
ima get sniped sooner or later
congrats
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
my xtals are crying
 Mobius summer skin trailer
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I wonder how i will fare in Nirvana
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
SS Griseo doko?
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
oh wait, im in Kekvana this rotation
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
And if my Griseo was SS
I prob couldve gotten higher points if my HoFS wasnt lacking in dmg for the last hit against Heilmdell
And even then, I think I got lucky to get a hundred more pts
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I balded a sht ton for mine
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
most of the time, im like 2.xx%
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
first time i might be T2%
Twitter moment be like:
How dare they whitewash him
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
It depends for me, depending on which floor my food fell in, I will either pick it up and clean it and reheat it, or throw it away
Yikes
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Gacha definitely taste salty though
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
Im not an anime character so that aint happening
<:concern:966623298639261746>
I got a cut of my finger cuz of it
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Why are my scissors so sharp out of nowhere
anyways, good night
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
except on mobile
couldnt be me
imagine having auto correct
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
well, i should be sleeping but yea
care to bald with us?
hewwo Carv
also sniped 2 pts more than 3rd place
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I can bald SSS bosses but not SS bosses
<@447218009749061632> Are you happy now?
and SS Griseo
now i just need SSS Eden
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
there we go
and they will only get the type advantage and never type disadvantage
new herrscher will obviously have 2 form changing their type, changing to Psy and QUA depending on their herrscher form
So me
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
The middle child is the weird one
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
My younger brother is like 2 years younger so its ok
Im the middle child
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I have an older brother whos like 10+ years older than me
Nah
My older brother is alread married and everything
My dad is like in his 70s
But yea, my family are hella old though
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Im only 19,
I have my nice Bday to attend tmr too
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Missing those 10 Atk does hurt bald points
Then again, I didnt use any DK buffs so yea
Cuz its either he enters rage early and i fail to kill or i nuke ans hes like 2-4 hits off
So i waste like an extra 2-5 sec killing his last hp
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
My HoFs dmg is slightly off to kill him
I just wanted even numbers
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
i know its not, thats why i said im waiting to get kicked out tmr
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
im just waiting to get kicked out tomorrow
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
like:

>You are... 

>Mr. Potato?!?!
but it ends up being the same shit
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Insta break all Core for QUA collapse
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Skip QUA Boss stages
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
QUA Ice to kill the already dead Nyx even further
So cosmetics whaling
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
For me, im also semi smart with my pulls, with some occasional dumb sht

But most of my whaling involved the Pyramid Skins and Skins in general
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Im suprised its less than mine
Wow
Neb PRI works for both HoS and AE in Abyss afterall
Neb PRI or new Valk imo
With all the Zhenyi i had to upgrade too
Resource drainages
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I maxed 7TR and thus suffered, but whatever
Yesnt, but yea
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Ah yes, the Dawei Card Arc
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
21 pulls and I got 7TR + 1 full set of Zhenyi, with the Zhenyi I had, it automatically turned into 2 full set of Zhenyi TMB
Anyways, ima be delivering food so adios for now
I rather not bald
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
SpA shouldve been IMG or QUA tbh, but Dudu Shills
Then I can run full Nat S team with Hofs, AE and S rank Ignite support
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Yes, even if it was a S rank Ignite support ill take it
Its why I just want a SP Ignite support
Who thought it was a good idea to replace HoFs flame trauma with another Flame Flame DoT debuff instead
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
When HoF inherited Himeko stuff but not her Ignite mechanics
Sirin ELF
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
N O
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I can cope once Ignite Support arrive
theres also the 9.8k Mobimaid gacha too
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
The cat definitely stole the gacha luck for me
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
but yea, now i can save for Mobimaid
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
so yea
I got my final Zhenyi piece + 7TR and another Zhenyi full set in 21
21 pulls
or be like me and get full Zhenyi + 7TR

we get a new special Ely Herrscher, HoC Ely and 13th Ely, QUA and IMG Type, you can swap between the 2 version, but you need double the gear because it will have a set for each separate Herrscher but you can only pick one to use at the time
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
me with 2 Bianka T so I cant even use the set
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
too annoying, i still call them mihole, mihoyo, and mhy
IMG Ice
but Memento <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
imagine having an ignite unit for QTE <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> knock-up is just as rare
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Oh, Fob
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
and then theres Raven
 Stonk Bella


Support Lobster
 this was her new Affix i got hers today... ignore how broken it is
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
who? my healer just have healing affix and SP regen... though she was originally random affixes
unironically the OPest unit in this event
she did so much dmg while also healing
Flute Girl Mvp
wow, <:PiKek:973573411911659540> anyways, try using Sunflower there, 5 second Time Slow on Ult and Lobster also is QUA so extra dmg vs QUA enemies too

then someone to gather Raven or kill her like Bkek or an Assassin
all 3*?
I usually use Bkek against Raven cuz her Ult can gather Raven for Bella to kill them all with Tornado... though im pretty sure HoS does better but my HoS is 1*
who do you have?
just run Bella, Sunflower Lobster and the Flute Healer
i just use my Yae and drop her totems and then just look away and wait for them to come out and die
for the Hydro x Dendro reaction
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
it went from Crystalize Texture to actual texture
yep
Dendro Traveler summon a Green Kokomi Jellyfish
Oooo?
Abysslao
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
yea, i posted a screenshot earlier that i was in 2nd place
oh, I cleared f45 using just Bella, Lobster, Flute Lady, and either Bkek or Kallen + Raven
is the QUA Crab, Tona?
the real mvp is the healer though
Mob stages are easy for her
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Bella just stonk in general
congrats
<:PiKek:973573411911659540> yea, mine is too trash
literal OHKO
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
it did 62-80k dmg btw
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I recommend killing him before he kills you, or try to I-frame it
i'll post a clip later of Houdou killing my entire team in 1 hit
and rank 1-8 already cleared 50
im pretty sure Abyss is f50 + how fast you clear it, cuz I was 10th when I cleared 49
how tf I got there, idk
I think Abyss Floor 50 is max rn so Im happy with 2nd
good luck
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
luck plays a big factor here for me
but it was balding
i cleared it though
even at full hp
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
like im not kidding, he one shot my entire team
this is the most Aids floor though btw... 2 Waves, 1st Wave you have to deal with HoT with I-frames cuz Dragon riding... and then the 2nd wave, Houdou one shot your team
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I didnt use my HoT either because shes also same situation
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
you honestly think a lvl 10 Sento can live
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
just base Senti
i have no Senti so I couldnt use her for the gather
yea, when I deal with Raven, I use Bkek because even with type disadvantage, Bkek Ult always seem to be able to bring Raven closer to Bella
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
since ig you gather them all, Bella Ult tend to kinda kill them all with the AoE + Anti-Heal
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
you can sub out Tona if you need gather with Senti or Bkek
and its pretty brain dead since most of my run were basically just on auto
add in Kallen or an Assassin to help with extra dmg
oh, you havent cleared 30? then sub out Bkek,

just Bella + Sunflower and Healer in the back tend to be able to breeze through everything
<:PiKek:973573411911659540> I wished my Zombie Tank was higher level though
I usually alternate between these teams
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
same team you saw there, but I sometime replace Kallen and Raven for Bkek because I need the Gather/Crowd control on the stages where I have to deal with Raven... because I have no Assassin built to deal with backline Range enemies
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
5 second time slow is pretty OP though, use it right and thats free dmg there before Bella goes into I-frame mode
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I think its a 1 time effect though, but for the start of the fight and abyss, its definitely useful
Raven affix is cope though,
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
after the fight, just click on statistics
maybe? and this is my Houdou scores
I just left it on auto too
cope but good enough for me
Bella score
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I used Bella and Sun Flower
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I cleared Abyss Balding without her and Houdou
Yatta doko?
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
5 second Time Slow
Sun Flower is also nice
Morbinmaid
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
too poor at the time
I skipped SpA too
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
just Ignite Weather in general cuz no Ignite Support outside of Whalerin

and also cuz MA stuff
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I think I have 2/4 DA, weapon and a stig piece, but I dont even have her... I have 3/4 Nyx too but no Nyx either
all your input is irrelavent, only bald input allowed
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
N O
I just want an Ignite support already
because the game is ass
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
they fixed Sushang resistance too so trying to use SW is cope asf
im in Kekvana so im dropping regardless
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
like 99% of the A ranks in this game all want SS minimum, only the gacha S rank tend to be fine at S0
I only get a new phone once every 5+ years, but I tend to get 128+ GB
Get a better phone
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Mobius vs Mobius again?
which ER boss should i fight?
lmao
I shouldve pob streamed my ER run
too late, oh well
rip
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
k, so Star 2 ig since i think im fighting Husk
for ER
I forgot, does Mobius go Star 1 or Star 2?
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Sutr PRI and Tranquil PRI...
Nyx
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
mine is even more of a mess, I have Tranquil Rhasphody...
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
true, unironically, 11th passive is strong if it wasnt for the fact that only CH can use it
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
everyone in my Nirvana run hates Sushang
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
this was why my 11th was maxed btw
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Just3c, wow you make me feel old
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
lmao
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
its a Griseo Frame so its fine for me
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I already bought Paladin, I just want to get DA and then be done... sice I already have SS Bkek
They all sleeping
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Retained in Sleepvana
Lmao
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
if only I wasnt fighting Crab
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
none of these people ever came close to my score, I honestly couldve slept if I wanted to
I have Mobi and spent 20k xtal to get her gears, so yea, I’ll be suffering the full 9.6k more xtal for her skin
QUA will always be the death of me anyways
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Itshoke, I also need to get 7TR and Morbinmaid
scammed ig
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
god its pretty
if its good, then its good
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
at least its better than NFTs...
so its fine
Hes cute
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
shouldve used my Flame Tuna on Doom for better score
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Balding Impact
pulling for 7T will hopefully resolve that issue
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I still missing B Zhenyi
im poor enough rn to only be able to whale 7T and Morbmaid
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
got T last
nope, I got B first
the most important piece too
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
not gonna be touching any other SP gears though, I can cope with Aslaug on any new Ignite Support
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I skipped Caroles gear and I suffered, so now I cope with full Griseo gear
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Change it to SA
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
whose? mine?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
it wouldnt have been much of an issue had the accident not happened in the first place though
oh rip, gl, i got lucky this semester, even though I got into an accident, one of my friend have 2 days where they go onto campus which are same days as mine so we can carpool together... so I only need to worry about my Tuesday class
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
gotta find a way to attend my Tuesday Class
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Im going back to college in like 1-2 months too, though more like continuing it and im also doomed
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Just cope harder like this person
2 Senti stuff and 2 Fu Hua stuff
Now i need to wait for the other 3 packages
Hua Merchs arrived uwu
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
...
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Top 5 are prob hackers anyways
2 waves, 1st wave is 5 Courtier, 2nd Wave and QUA Horseman
so my Benares would get one shotted and my tank just dead squishy
this stage is like fighting 5 Courtier
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Corriour changes often cuz I dont have enough space to add in Raven nor Tona
My tank is too squishy for this stage
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
though i cant get any higher rn though
Benares stonk
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
its still a spoiler anyways
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
why spoil
or spoiler box it and yea
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Chibi Kebin Shamash ELF
<:sussge:968897150249484389>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Its called being hypocrite
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
You underestimate how dumb people can be
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
but it depends on quite a few factors for tax returns
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
You can never avoid paying tax unless you're tax evading, the only time you ever get your money back is when they do tax returns, you pay tax to get back tax
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
thats tax evasion mr
also debt
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
you have to worry about money and taxes
it does
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
anyone want to help me on NA later, ive been slacking and havent been doing co-op raids fr the past like 6-7+ patches
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
cuz its the 1.5 situation all over again
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
its why they are all out way earlier than usual
devkit got leaked again, be prepared for another vision hunt
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Sushang gonna be Lightning Impair Support
Nah Ely Ice Herrscher with Ignite Support
its already dead saving for 7T and Morbin
as long as its Story Driven/Trial Char for me...
I dont need to bald more
I already bald enough from trying to gear my units
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I fine with them playable as long as I dont need to gacha for them
FC Males are my favs
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
the side quest are my least favorite yea...
yea, for expressions, 1st is def best, but the 2nd one is good for certain situation like groups talk too
Oh, thats actually a good question for PoV...
lmao, shes been using a turret
its quite low
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I like malding in story
Plot specific for me
and wholesome bait
you forgot depression
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oh wow, thats nice, ig its because CN is ahead so they get more in depth stuff as compared to Glb and SEA where things is just an issue with translation and whatnot
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
I know, but one can still cope
what are the CN surveys like?
oh?
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
then he can come in here as a Stigmata Chibi
Kosma Stigmata
and then get dropped kick by Ely Herrscher whos going to be our Ice Support that Ignites
anyways, who else is gonna be doomed poor with me after pulling for Griseo gear, soon 7T gears and then Morbin Skin
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
~~I just want to see Kalpas raining meteors as him~~
just not gacha
considering Valks are just females warrior anyways, and we are the Kanchou leading them

but for content like APHO or story where we arent really involved the males being playable doesnt really change much since we can still get immersed just the same, like when we controls MECH to fight our enemies
Im fine with Playable Male char, just make them playable in content like APHO <:PiKek:973573411911659540> or story content like when we controlled Su and co then i dont have to worry about doing gacha for them
my Ely is still PRI-less
<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
I dont want DA spending outfit to rot either
i am
yes cuz i have everyone but Nyx DA and Aponia
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I honestly dont know
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
....
for genshin? or honkek? the former seems quite likely since I rarely see this happen for Honkek
But i have a boomer brain, cant remember or learn sht
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Im playing CN GGZ and whatnot, i should at least try
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Same...
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
but i upgraded the wrong units
mines kinda low
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
unironically, hackers
so yea
its the exact same scores
this one is kinda dogsht though
I just need to max the dragon and I can get 3*
rng on which cards you get upgrades of
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
ye
so exactly enough for S Griseo
I only need 15 pulls for Griseo and did event
my Griseo is only S rn
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
just git gud and snipe across servers and brackets
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Im neutral for Dudu too, only built her cuz of Abuse Flower
ye
same ngl
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I need hat Zhenyi B, though pulling for 7T would prob give me a pice regardless
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
...
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I need a PRI refund system to refund my 11th and Tranquil Arias
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
...
then it turned into a S rank Griseo with full SP gears
at first, I was gonna cope with Holmes...
but can prob find itsself a niche still
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
the Mid piece feels like a SW mid piece ngl, where the 3p effect and M piece just feels lackluster
<:kekcry:973697358799978626>
I got full set, costed me like more or less 15k xtal ig
ye, even for just applying bleed, its not that needed cuz of how Griseo Ult works unlike someone like Pardo
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
poor like me and i still need to pull for 7T and Mobi skin too
<:whaleri:973697463984717836>
tdyfjygidtdyufgilhgjhb,jxydtufgkhn df gukjn
......
. . .

<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Only issue is that MA presence is dogsht
Pardo fixed all the freeze problem afterall
I have SS SW so im gucchi
In the Middle
Ice is Ice
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Anyways, I can ignore my Phys team now, even though my Ligtning team is kinda good, I still need 7T or else it will somehow be copium cuz Mobius is mainly Abyss... and Fire.... ima ignore Fire Completely cuz no Ignite Support and plus, my Fire Team is already decked out.... just the Ignite stages are fucking me over
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
kinda niche now, Cezanne is like the new Newton B
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I need to save my remaining mats for 7TR
always get excess cross too
both of them, I was missing the T piece as the last piece
Griseo is truly Mobius's grandchild
got 2 crosses
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Sadly, the last piece i needed was T
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
Griseo Bullying
I retained at #1
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
congrats
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
what are the chances of me being able to stay in top 2% by the end of the week
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I cant cuz I need my Carole for Doom
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
they gave me another KoC on Griseo Banner just to rub salt on my wound
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
because people have Key of Castigation PRI for the oldy so they can still use their HoT til 7T but i cant
no 7T so I cant use HoT
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
QUA bosses will always be the death of me
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
weak
my crystal count for 7T and Mobius Skin, totally not gonna whale
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Im using Mobius on Doom...
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
My Doom score is dead to the ground though
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I know I will be kicked out on Sunday, but I am happy to cope with this

<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
76% with Holmes, I can cope
at first, I unga bunga and only got 730, didnt know about hitcount shield, found out and got a ref, go to 770, and then balded another reference and got to 792 and then balded again for 795
by 7 hours
mine was so sleepy I did it early

If your cousin asks why
Its not that hard
Just ban them
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Smh
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Tell them you are very grateful and as to so your appreciation for his hard work, he’ll be awarded a ban
Ban then
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
Tf said this? Your cousin?
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Just say you arent paid enough cookies to deal with this
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
My 2.5 and 2.75 run are always way longer than I need it to be

Honkai has the best drip marketing
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>

I havent played Genshin in like forever outside of log in
which one of yall are in NA?
I was asleep but Ooooo Horror Manga <:slacc:963350438940397588>
just break it, easier than slow painful rot and balding trauma
any other Phys Dps unit though?
so high hitcount muy wanted
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
also, SA is most likely better here than Carole, even Pardo is prob better only because its a hitcount shield
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
nah, i dont think it makes much difference, though im just surprise you have SS Ely
<:draculaRip:814619093721415703>
SS Ely  <:deadge:975652771082698782>
whale for the solution
rip ig
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
show me your team unless you posted it earlier already
boss stage?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
better to get the rewards and sleep instead
so Elie will still be scuffed regardless
who do you have, also, mobs are mech/zombie
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
for what? Nirvana?
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
Bad end cuz they were also killed
<:worrymad:987990517453303820>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
RL? or Agony
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I just happy with coping with 750+, somehow made it increase it time from 770 to 792 to 795 and then 815
they got 830 in Nirvana with their run
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I used a Nirvana Reference for my score
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
but never for Nirvana
I bald in RL
N O
Only my Fischl is undergeared but shes coping well with Turg
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
How did recording a video somehow improved my score
mobile gamer too, what a chad
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I have gear issue and skill issue so my score was only around 795, while they are like 800+ in Nirvana
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
lemme get you a Nirvana reference
lmao, for me, I scored lower so I cant do that
Handel Cat to replace Eden?
I balded an extra 2 points
of course, you gotta snip whenever possible, and then sleep in Nirvana
idk why im balding in Abyss
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Im bleeding now
done
oh well, ill max Mobi PRI first, get base 7T PRI and max it later as i pull for Morbinsus Pyramid
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
im skipping Griseo, maybe 1 ulti on her foca, but thats it, ill max 7T cuz thats what ive been doing lately fr DK PRI with time stop
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
should I max her PRI?
I dont think there are really any use for Blue Resos is there
should I?
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I can max it ig, but then ill be poor for maxing 7T
nope, unless Fischl running Turg and not being on Zhenyi is gear issue then yea
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
I saw a FR team get 740 too
only 720 pts
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
how does one do so well, my pepega ass can deal with them
<:deadge:975652771082698782>

Season 2 trailer
Owo
anyways, nighty night
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
why isnt this channel, sushang herrscher of taxation
Cali is hella expensive, and quite dangerous now, i was unlucky enough to get bodied by debt cuz of this
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
come to Cali, get into a car accident and watch as your insurance rate for policy cost go up by 78%
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Im the neutral one here ig
GM Aoi
🐳
tf
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I said a very long time ago of my own mistake, since not many PRI were out and I was just prioritizing which PRI i should max first... but the moment I maxed 11th, I was bleeding inside from the cost unlike now which is much easier to farm PRI mats
back when PRI was a new thing
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
this was from a few years back
mix of both
I need to find a reason to use my HoT who currently have 0 Stig and 0 PRI Arms
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I still need to max out Bask PRI but I need to max 7T first cuz HoT shills next patch with Griseo shills
crying
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Me with my 4 Magrave B and 3 Turg B
I have to do the story too so that I can get the rewards
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
like its hella weird to see all the flame chaser talk in JP while Mei has no voiceline and in reverse for CN voiceline
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Anyone know how to fix the voices for Chapter 29? or is it gonna be broken where JP Mei Voiceline is sometime missing while all the flame chaser voiceline except for Ely is missing for CN Voicelines
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I still dont have Fischl's bow
yea
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
after I max 7T, I need to max Bask PRI
I have excess too
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I should have enough to max out 7T next patch
Like me who has 400 Tonus ready for the new DK
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
For newer players, its better to have multiple PRI only whale and hoarding players max their PRI
^^^
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Also, anyone know why the CN Voicelines are missing/broken in the main chapter story of Elysian Everlasting?
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Plus, I dont need another Lightning Char when I have Mobi and gonna be pulling for 7T
I have my SW at SS so im using her over Aponia anyways
Rat first
Bad news
Its not even char like Mobi who I know the CN Va is having issues
Yet when I just changed to JP rn, those voices were there
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Was playing the story and noticing the lack of voices from the characters every now and then
Wait, why are there missing voice files for CN Honkai
HB needs SSS more than cat <:KekPat:966625000339668993> Cat needs SS though
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
why is this channel name changing every day
kekw
oh the dilemma
but I also want to continue with the story
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I keep on forgetting they wont fix this yet
VR rat?
gonna powercreep the steve gear
but the wither set is coming soon
dont have enough to spend on minecraft
I need the money for gacha carv
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
the pc ver obv cuz i have the mobile ver of minecraft
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I forgot minecraft existed, bought the game for my brother but never bought a copy for myself
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
its your sin
n o
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Aponia's is just a thumbs up
<:HelloFbi:977468843884691456>
Ely is the most terrifying one yea
lmao
...
^^^
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Im doing the same but instead of pulling Griseo gear, im skipping her for Morbmaid
im skipping Griseo in the first place, just gonna cope with Holmes and pul for 7T and Mobisus Scam Skin
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
also, we technically only have 1 Herrscher for each Dmg Type except for Phys, we dont need a 3rd one yet
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
you say that but Ice Herrscher is just HoR and we know she is just as outdated abeit better in certain scenerio cuz Ice stonk
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
how lmao
its all the flame chaser sim's death in 4k + farewell
cuz im pretty sure DK is just another form of Impair that isnt Impair
do you mean Chariot?
what is this bullshit
ah yes, minor ignite trauma of 0.1 ignite gauge per hit
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yep
ngl, this actually visually looks nice
sometimes I shoot the weakpoint and it just like hits but doesnt count as a weakpoint it and im like tf
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
^^^
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
only if you hit weakpoint, but if you're unlucky like me who shot a weakpoint for it to somehow miss, its quite sad
I can retain, with mine, but its with Raven, tried with Cat and got decent but the rotation was too scuffed for me too
I cant because my Raven is still SSS with skin and cuz no Sirin, I cant ignite AKA consistently enough for Cat to matter
which is hella scuffed when you start off your rotation
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
you cant even CA consistently unless you have 15+ arrows so that you can get the 20 stacks for the combo
but still have to run her in Abyss cuz no Ignite SP Valk
love the unit, hate the gameplay
god I hate her gameplay so much
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
if only Raven was SP
nah, I also have Aslaug because Raven is copium SSS with skin
Vill V Ignite support
Dont underestimate my Magrave luck, if its possible for me to get 3 Turg B yet only 1 Turg T and 1 Turg M, then its possible with my 4 Magrave B
so I can cope with Magrave on everyone
at least I got Pardo's PRI
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
yes it is, especially because Mobius bodied me of 20k xtal on Pardo patch so I was too poor to pull for Bastet too
gonna pull 7T and save for the Mobi skin
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Holmes on Griseo
anyways, my Griseo will be on mad copium
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Soon we get Ice Herrscher that applies Ignite instead
ishoke, I can cope for when Ignite SP arrives
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I wouldnt be needing HoF if I could actually use her
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
my 0/4 SpA?
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
I can cope against AKA if I could just ignite without needing a Sirin in my life
Psy is fine too, since the only fire she'll be competing against is DEA anyways, well, ig Vill-V now too cuz shes QUA <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Make sure to not let the bed bugs bite
Nighty night

My phone almost dead too
Cuz Hershey Animated Shorts are nice
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
At least I can cry to the next Animated Short
I knew Mei would leave the Realm, but i didnt know she would leave it after giving us depression
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Past midnight but last time, which was yesterday because of my Child Kosma, I stayed up even longer coping and crying from the depression on Honkek Impact
I shouldnt even be awake rn
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Let me be
Im lacking sleep
Just mashed the names together
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>

So yea

Toes, Feet and whaling
Hella cursed game and guild
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I was once in a MMO game where the guild just talked about toes and feet
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Ishoke, not as cursed as Toes Impact
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Its hard to make nickname for people whos name is only like 1 syllables
Im too lazy for that, i just use whatever sounds decent enough at the time, or just pings
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
What nickname, mine was the same til someone turned me into Dia
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
Vvords
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>

<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
GG Mihole
Ignite Weather with an Invested Fire team thats Igniteless
Well, even if they dont need to Ignite, then at that point Mobi prob wouldve been better
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I dont think SK can ignite though
My Fire Team is copium on Ignite sht
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
No Sirin either
With Flame Tun, I only get like 500 something, maybe close to 600 but its never enough
No DA no SpA
Bald in Abyss
No SPA
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
What is a good team to bald in if for this week?
Happy Birthday, you are now one step closer to the true baldness
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
Shadow Knight in ER, Eden + Kevin Signet = Infinite Burst Mode with fat dmg
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Fu Hua in Abyss when? So that she can also get her flame chaser double signet
It gives me a reason to whale for Morbin Skin
I can cope with Pardo current skin I got from whaling for Mobius anyways
So prob Bchip
Spending event during Herrscher banner obv
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Im pulling for 7T only and Morbin Skin, skip everything else and cope with Holmes
Totally smart idea
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Im pulling for 7T and Morbin right b4 Herrscher and Cezanne
Lmao
Same
<:cryge:966624721611403294>

You can still get pregnant while gay smh
Ive once had like 8 pages of apps on my phone of just purely gacha games and rpg games

Being a Virgin is good, too many people in the world anyways
Cute child too

…
<:Lmao:966624069363597362>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I use Mobius to kill Mobius, to find out whos better at morbin each other
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
It was very easy
I only do 2.5 and above
This time, i started a HoFs run and got every single Sig Signet from Ely in the last 2 stages lmao

Killed Hdom is 30 sec cuz infinite black hole + sakura OP Signet 1
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Why else would we bald in MA and Abyss
Balding is a part of the fun
Imagine hating on ER
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Dia just have his own Anti Dudu cult
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
Cuz as a gacha players he would know a unit would be good or not for gacha, if he read, then he wouldve known sht
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
But Dia prob wouldve chosen neither
I choose both
Acts as if the last 5 version wasnt about her
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Legit Ely Realm is all about Mei and her journey
<:PikaXD:966624196564242432>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Of course hes an idiot, act as if Mihole didnt just buff her with 7T and both LE and HoT being some of the most used unit in MA just because of the SP leaderskill
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
and yes, im fat shaming them
why are they so fat though <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
everything is going downhill, except for the story quality
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
you wouldve been banned had this been WFP
I went down to RL so I no meet you
very bad, well, they weren't wrong that she was the one that brought the most change towards the realm, cuz what she did was none other than sending HoC to the Sims, FC vs HoC time <:cryge:966624721611403294> 
since im always 1 bar from ending his 1st phase
losing 50% TDM buff and Freeze Trauma stuff really do fck with your scores
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
NO bastet = dead score cuz I dont have enough dps to one tap Houdou in 1 rotation for his 1st phase
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
My ZL can do dmg so its fine, praise the ~~China~~ Spear that gives Atk and Crate for each ~~China~~ Liyue Characters on the team
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Like how annoying would it be if you have to use ZL Hold E 3 times in a row if you want to get the shield because you casted his Ultimate
But you have to recast the E 3 times
That’s basically Yae
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Its like using ZL Hold E but then when you use his Q, you have to recast his E because the shield gets removed when he cast his Ultimate
Ultimate is just a nuke but then you have to recast her E all over again
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Her gameplay is ass, she pretty much takes almost as much time as ZL casting his long ass Ultimate just to drop down 3 totem that does no initial dmg with dogshit particle gen and no iframe so you can still take dmg using her E
Yae biggest issue is the fact that they decided to make her E take forever to cast with no I-frames
Yae buff doko?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Thats how unappealing Genshin char was for me
I unironically pulled more on weapon banner than characters til Yae banner
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Fuck them
So my wish list is dead
Too bad i cant show mine cuz 6 months past
Woaw
Correct
I tend to lose my 50/50
But for every other char
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
For Yae i lost only 1 50/50 to Mona, everything else was either 2 5* in 1 multi or 50/50 won
Night Heki
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I basically won all my pities with Yae
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
 my luckiest was with Yae
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
You mean Lightning Elf Judah chan
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
That was me til I whaled
Im just waiting for Su and Cyno
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I cope with dps BR
BD is more supportive
It was a decent cope piece for Br
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im talking about back then when Himeko first came out
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Chainsaw Claymore
BD is themed after BR yea, though Sunfire is more suited for her for dmg
So i sleep
But i dont
If I had Bastet, maybe i wouldve bald and see if I can t100 it
Im in Nirvana rn
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Though the Blood Sword was also 1st gen that suits her looks better
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Yea
Like hella old weapon
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
First Gen Fire Claymore for Himeko
<:KekPat:966625000339668993> I got it after getting a Lost Prayer dupe, basically they trolling me like when I got Homa after I got Skyward Spine first
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
The design was a bit too similar to the hilts
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
GGZ Himeko weapon
Thats the Corona Claymore yea
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
What happened Carv?
I also have Atlas
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
LP is R2
I have LP, Memory of ~~Signora~~ Dust, and Kagura Verity <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
What should I use if no Bastet? Full Shui or Shui T with Bethoveen MB
No Bastet sadge
Im in Nirvana so cant do that here
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Nah, just a single hit is fine, then with 2p effect, you can extend the duration via hitcount, which is why people like Raven, HB, Cat or Blood Sword
Similar to Magrave and Newt B
Cuz thats where the Hunter Mark proc in the first place
You need Turg B though
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Just a hit
But its effect will be active regardless as long as you attack
Nope, to extend Turg duration, you need it to have something iff field or high hit count
I forgot

Owo 8ball am i doomed?
Like b4 they reworked it to where the buffs stack on each other as a value (like 229 Atk buff stack), they wouldve stacked as different buff icons… so you would just see 229 of those Atk buff Icon on the screen to where it goes outside the screen
I also remembered a really old Korean game too, b4 their rework, Buffs, even if they were the same kind will pop up on the screen as separate buffs so when you have a bunch of buffers, the entire screen was just a cluster fuck of buffs icons
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
So lifesteal gears will also heal her from the DoT dmg
Btw, the DoT can also proc Lifesteal effect
Just because of that EE alone
Shes still prob the best unit in the game for both pvp and pve
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Hero Cantare with God Killer Zero
So you will see like bosses with like 30-40 stacks of Burn DoT taking like 30-40% of the DoT Caster Atk as dmg
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Btw, the EE can also proc from DoT dmg too, so if you teammate took bleeding, and the artifact proc on the unit, the EE will act as if they took direct dmg from the enemy and proc more burn DoT on the enemy that caused the bleed debuff
There was a gacha game (kr) i played where there was an exclusive equipment for a unit that basically let her stack Burn DoT on her enemies whenever she takes dmg… and then there was an artifact that makes it so that the unit can take x% dmg for your allies… and that artifact will also proc her EE effect


So like an enemy does like an AoE attack that targets like 4 of your team and it hits like 3 times… that’s basically 4x3, 12 stacks of Burn DoT… the EE also has a x% chance to give a 2nd stack of burn DoT so it can even double to 24 burns just from 1 AoE <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Simple enough
Its onlt 50 revives
Rarely are they balanced
So they either come as innately broken or weak asf
Collab Char are also the worse sometimes because you can never buff them or nerf them
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Clusterfuck gacha games
Some Buffs are actually just nerfs
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Atrocious
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
It was like 10-20% chance for another turn
Violet set yea
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
People complain about Genshin Rng for artifacts and then you look at Summoner War and any other artifacts system thats 100x worse
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Rng Upgrade Rates along with RNG Substat rolls
Yea, upgrade failing
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
What BS is that
Yea, like I already spent like millions of gold to upgrade them and now i have to pay 10% of how much the total upgrade amount was to just swap gears around?
Utter dogshit
Imagine using 60-120k gold to equip and unequip Stigmata in Honkai, thats basically the Rune system and system in Epic 7 and Summoner Wars
Runes
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I played 4 years not to get a single nat 5 from the summons, got one from their Anniversary and got another from the next anniversary and guess what? It was one of the worse nat 5 and somehow I got a dupe of that same Nat 5 twice for 2 years in a row
Join Summoner War and FGO too
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Yall cant be more mad than me who pulled SS 6S
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I prob have enough for the next Herrshey though I just want a Ignite Support, watch Vill V be S rank Bleed Dps to synergize with Griseo
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Just to flex
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I have SS AE, so SS Yatta seems normal enough
We all do, if DEA, Bkek and co got into BP, so will the Yatta
And no TP
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I have 2 Bianka T but no M or B piece
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Me in Nirvana and no Bastet
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Anyways, its better to just show us which unit you have and which weap you can PRI
Either Neb PRI or Senti PRI, Neb PRI works for both AE and HoS if its Abyss, but sadge if its MA
But im just using it because its easier to understand, clear 2 Main Stage and a bit of Side stage will always give you enough for 15k
I know, some are 4 waves
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Aka the part where you mald to get more bonus point from speedrunning the boss
Though im pretty sure its just 3k point with 1k point being the bonus points
Boss Stage is 4k points
Main Stage and Side stages are worth 6k point, 1k point per wave with 1k bonus point for clearing the stage
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
^^^
And extra for how much dmg you deal within that time limit
^^^ you get score based off how many waves you clear
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Also, the reason its called a side stage is also because it doesnt use the same weather anyways, like if its Lightning Weather where you deal 50% less Phys dmg, the Side Stage will most likely be something like Phys Weather where you deal 50% less Lightning dmg instead
only those 3 are missing for me to complete the entire roster
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
unironically, those are the exact three im missing
and thus I sleep
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:sussge:968897150249484389>

<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
oh yea, is Paga gonna be in Griseo banner or in HoT banner or in neither
thank god i only got Pardo Chackram and dipped <:KekPat:966625000339668993> never got Bastet and i blame Mobius for that
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>

Keilao
1/4 Pardo
Thats sus asf
<:TeriWeird:973794226754187324>
Especially since you know they are gay, and here you are basically forcing them to play a game where they date only women, not even another male
Yea, thats kinda yikes
I know, still is a form of relationship, even if they are just acquaintances too afterall
Relationship Issues
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Nah, Aponia as the MA boss, that would be the true Aids, confusion will fck up so many people’s score when balding
I need to find the shit I left to kill roaches that isnt the stupid spray
And another pops up the very next day
I can tell, for I have flushed down like 7+ of them the past week
Like its been Canon for a very long time now that Judah likes bdsm, both towards herself and to her enemies
It had been confirmed since GGZ
Question is what stig do you have?
I dont even have the Bastet for Cat
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Even A rank cat work better than SS tbh
Judah chan wont be hanged on a cross, shes just into bdsm
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Judah gonna get a new DK form, Judah Idol
<:concern:966623298639261746>

Wait, im in Nirvana against Houdou rn
Snipe to Nirvana and then sleep
Cuz I am a sniper
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I wanted to flex 730 pts against all the players who did 654 and under
Hell, even Might of an Uwu got bodied with its one time use and then SP and Dmg all gone
Cuz fire scuffed ass team
IO AE and Fischl got me like 100 more pts than my IO SSS FR and Fischl
I just want a Ignite support to replace Raven on Ignite stages and I can use Raven on the non ignite stages
AE carried me on Andrius last rotation so its fine
Unlike my SS VK that’s actually rotting in the corner
I aint letting my SS AE rot
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
AE will forever carry my team even in her grave
AE buff doko?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I blame Honkai Dev for making her basically immune to Atk speed buffs
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
AE sp problem is because she slow
Lmao
Universal but with a slight edge on the element they good at
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Pardo is like AE but better because A rank and newer
Pardo buff is universal, her freeze and ice dmg is the only reason she main ice
I was looking at this
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
No Linn
I saw a IO run with 870 pt though
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Who you think is better, IO or SS Bkek in Houdou rn? Some of the ref i saw, IO is somehow higher than Bkek but the other person Bkek was S3 so yea
Rip
Lmao
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Y e s
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>

<:PiKek:973573411911659540>

Ai driven car when
If it was a Date a Live character, Danganronpa, or Madoka Magica, I prob wouldve whaled better
Too bad i dont like her enough either
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
So shes just a collectible
I have Asuka but mine aint SS
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Unironically, if it wasnt for the gas prices, I wouldve been perfectly fine cuz its like a straight path down on the freeway and I dont have to worry about crashing my car unlike local driving where left turns are dangerous af cuz its Cali
Who knows, they never told me any concrete reason, it seems like the stereotypical rejection cuz a diff Uni did the same for my younger brother, though he got into his other Uni choices, ironically, one of the hardest one to get into from his choices, he was accepted yet the easiest one to get into rejected him for same reason as mine
So I got into my backup Uni which luckily, other than gas bill, im basically going there for free since my financial aid covered most of it
I would take the bus if I could, but too far away, it was my backup Uni cuz I failed to get into the Uni I wanted to get into which is like a 5-15 min drive instead had I gotten into that one


The BS excuse they gave me was that the school was full, which is dogsht cuz some of my friends who did way worse than me got in <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
My Uni requires me to drive cuz its located 25 miles away from where I live
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
What a scam
So im pretty much like paying 3x the price for Car insurance
If you are young, the price is already doubled
Cali Car insurance goes up by like 73% when you get into a accident
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Its pretty much guaranteed that my Insurance Price for Car is gonna be doubled now
Im 19 and im suffering
Then Car accident but get no injuries

Have Carole and Pagnami be bodied
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Nah, next Herrshey gonna be deal more dmg when enemies has shield, deal less dmg if no shield
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Soon, we will get a impair support that impair enemies for 0.1 impair trauma for 0.5 sec cooldown
Just impair and crits
Our Phys Herrshey already has no Bleed nor Stun trauma
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Thats the trend so far
Ice Herrshey gonna lack freeze
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I’ll be pulling for the Ignite support regardless cuz I dont want to bald with Flame Tuna being igniteless

And for me, I have SW so I dont need to worry about Ice Herrshey as much unless they pull a HoS on me and have Ice Herrshey replace HB
Nope, never, prob more SP Valks or Augment if they need to delay things
Watch Vill V be S rank fire support, Ely Ice Herrshey and then we get another A rank support with the Herrshey Elf being ELF Ely
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I’ll cope with Holmes
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Im skipping Griseo gear
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Vill-V will never kill my AE
I need to pull for HoT new DK and I also need to pull for Pagnami M
Cuz fcking all the fire stages are all ignite stages for no reason even though we have barely any ignite support
Anyways, I can at least throw Auslaug on the new Ignite Support whenever they come and replace Raven instead, I can cope and simp for my AE that way
True villain right there
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Vill-V S rank Ignite Fire support
Well, her Ult to Weapon skill is pretty easy, just gathering SP is ass with her cuz her CA sucks ads in both animation and hitboxes
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Mine is SSS with the bartender outfit
Its literally the main reason I hate using her and same
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
God I hate Raven’s CA, so clunky
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Or my SSS Raven will be dead
Cuz then my AE will be dead
God I want a new Ignite SP already but at the same time, ill be smoking hella copium because of that
its like how Mobius is made to body Andrius in Abyss and other teams just get copium scores
and SW can brute force with a similar score
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
ye
^^^
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
nah, cuz its Aponia shills, they want people to spend more, not less afterall
good thing Carole exist rn or else my Nuada would been a dead PRI
well, ig i have a reason for FR at least
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
oh
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
for Sushang, i legit brute force with SW and got a higher score than FR
well, at least i can use her for copium SSS Tona
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I just got her to SSS this patch too
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
though at least for this week, Coalt exists for her to be used
and then bodied again by Eden in other content
bodied by AE for Abyss
rip FR though
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
90 pt increase from balding
I was gonna slack on doggy til I decided to bald my score from 640 to 730
all of them are sub 700 even with Mobius
but my bracket is currently very slack
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
730 but made it look like 845
fake score too
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>

<:slacc:963350438940397588>
Yep, just breakthrough
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>

Im not home so i cant watch it anyways

CN will always be the maldest
Ive been randomly getting into Nirvana very often recently
Getting there aint hard
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
RL is easy to retain but retaining in Nirvana Glb is aids
Yep
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Nah, Glb so it was easier maybe
I once got into T100 for Nirvana and still couldnt retain <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> and then I got booted out in the last 30 min of Abyss
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Even for slack weeks, im still sweating with the fact that you can fall down to Agony at any week
Ever since HoS, i never had to go under RL because I learned to use my resources well and ~~whale~~
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
You are borderline with those trophies
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Griseo too busy trolling Kosma
Griseo is unlikely til after Kosma is dead
Kosma seems unlikely since he’s usually with Griseo, after Kalpass, prob Vill-V or Sakura
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I legit forgot about Abyss, since im on Mobile rn and this is Nirvana, Ez 15k pts and sleep

<:PiKek:973573411911659540>

Same
then all those Aponia couldve gotten snipped by me on lightning weather
if only i had Bastet
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
only 684 with SW on Lightning weather
Husk a bully
i hate this Abyss
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
just use Turg
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
if they just use Eden...
im lacking Bastet so im pretty sure im worse off here
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I havent started on mine so idk how my score will be tbh
....
<:kekcry:973697358799978626>

because i always used her Augment
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I legit forgot that VA had a Shielbreak buff
same, especially for this Abyss because of the Katsumi shield
no Pagnami? just use VA
VA saved me this Abyss ngl
this was mine
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I have Klein but tbh, for my Abyss rotation, i legit didnt need her because of how my rotation work
ah, ice team, nice nice
ye
Dalao, what was your team for Abyss?
lmao
Neko, you got some explaining to do
also, why is Neko's sex slave here
having no Paga M sucks ass
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yay, i did it
oho>
<:Terichew:973794176015675392>
lmao
KEKW
took me like 80 pulls for Rem too
It like a 8-9 turn CD yea, so you need Iseria or like Prophetic Candle/Counter set to help deal with that long ass CD
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I am neutral about her, but imagine getting Emilia from hard pity and then the next day get another 5* Soul Weaver from free pulls
fck, I meant to ping <@704867526877904908> <:KekPat:966625000339668993> ig chat went too fast and it made me reply to wrong msg
...
Scammed by Emilia... wanna know the worse part too? guess what I got from my Free Daily summon the next day... Tamarine
I got mad bullied by Emilia banner
nice, ig, btw, what your username, i need to add you
i need to start on the Honkai Ely Open World first
I havent even touched chasm yet
Cuz i dont ever remember sht from them
Only issue is textbooks stuff
For me, im still good at reading
it looks nice, since i like those kind of style for the drawing
its fine, idk how to describe it either which is why i called it a drawing or painting
the watch or your drawing? if you say the watch, ima slap you, if you say your drawing, ima also slap you
Dalao sewing Rita a new suit?
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I just needed Bianca M or B and I would be set cuz i have Bianca T, Dante M, and Ely B
Give Pardo Ana and give Bastet to HB <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
But instead, i have 2 Bianca T and Midnight
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
If i had PE B piece, then I couldve done Nirvana stages easy
IMA weather is my sleep weather so i get to sleep in Nirvana, my only issue is clearing the stages in Nirvana since my IMA team is pepega
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I accidentally went into Nirvana
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Nirvana skill issue
I have skill issue too so nopers
In Genshin or Honkek?
Oooooo Mihole is up there, I actually feel proud of them
For me, I can skip Aponia, already got Eden stuff and I need to save for HoT DK
I have PE HoS SA or Pardo AE HB… I legit feel like my Pardo team will do better than PE because of how scuffed my PE is
So I might resort to Pardo Felis
PE Dudu with being at 1/4 do really make it hard to coear anything
So I dont think I can even clear 1 stage
Im in Nirvana
Cant be worse than me
Beautiful
Feelsbadman
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I mald to this
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
My PE is missing her Stig so lots of skill issue for me
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I guess I can sleep this rotation
Or can I just sleep in Nirvana
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
What about for Nirvana
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Its worse in the context that she says its her job that pays well and that she got paid extra that day
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
blood is bad, but ~~cum~~ milk is ok
we also have Shigure Kira btw
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
tis Kallen yea
Nice nice, mine is Fu Hua AE, and fav outfit is prob Time Runner though i wished the skirt was a bit longer
Smh, just lose more sleep, have some coffee
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
They crashed their car into me though, but im the one mostly going to be at fault
It took me til my 3rd year in Uni to get a part time job, 1st Year Covid Happened and 2nd year, i was too busy
I only remembered about the textbook after Amazon sent me a mail telling me they charged me for it being overdue… i was too busy dealing the car accident aftermath that i forgot completely about it
Soon ill be trainning and then hopefully start on my part time job since I got accepted during the interview
I also got into a car accident as you already know
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I just lost 30$ because I forgot to return a textbook to Amazon
Its already bad for me
Nice nice
From HS or Uni?
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
Happy Birthday
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Fuck
im also NA though
im at 2.4% so i coping
Bugtto
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
Bug Otto in Nirvana'
Oh...
whats the next boss?
like all of them have Aponia too
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
my bracket is so slack this week im so confused
Ima die in Nirvana
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
this person is whale enough to have SSS Mobi and the other guy has full geared Aponia
why and how am i in first place tf
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Considering they had HoT, yea, eventually
Ye, I got lucky for my SW getting to SS thanks to luck sac and the gear bonus from her banner
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Spending Event dont need whaling afterall
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
My Griseo will just cope with Holmes tbh
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Im never touching my TP, dont even have Hekate afterall
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I dont have Paga either though
The only thing she actually needs is Abuse Flower, but thats equivalent to saying that Flame Tuna wants her gacha weapon or Pardo wanting hers
Bkek team isn’t expensive though, since her team is just the standard team for any Phys team <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
ima be doing some irl stuff asw anyways
bai bai
well, its not SSS clock
XD
XD
because I forgot to do my SSS boss last week, I had to manual all my stages so all my teams were scuffed asf
so now they charged me a 33$ late fee
Because of all the Car accident stuff, I legit forgot I had an Amazon Rental Textbook due for return
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I just lost like 33$
I always usually sleep for around 8 hours unless life says otherwise
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
my Eden isnt SS so i have to cope with SW
Im just suffering because ill most likely be placed at fault for the car accident
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
And its like the most important part too
Same
Yep
Cuz i hold the button too short
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Fcking up her combo attacks
QTE and then somehow pepega clap myself and somehow swap out by accident
Im fcking up so much on her rotation
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I still dont know how to play Eden
Ishigami was a total mood in the special ending
Same
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Theres even a Rap episode
Season 3 is really good so far
Hopefully S4 of Stranger Thing is good
So night
I’ll be sleeping though
And nice
Except for the weapon which is ok
My Rem still need a better everything
Rn I need to farm for better gears for Rem though
Oh, I do have Rem, I only got her because I like her but also because I had the Scythe Artifact for her Sustain, cuz thats the only artifact that kets her play as a bruiser for Self Healing and dmg
Even without the Atk Set bonus, she still gets like 2.9k Atk
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
3.4k Atk
Btw, I made this account like 7 days ago
15% Atk buff from her artifact too
fat 75% self Atk buff, with another 30% Atk passive
She's mainly for Banshee 1 shot team, but she can be pretty decent in general for pve
you can get 3 more copies from the Shop and another next week from the 2nd part of event
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
oh yea, shes stonk for newer players
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
exactly 100 Shards
oh well
sadge
went from 4* Selune to 2* Klein and got 17 more pt
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
817, my Bday
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Lmao
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
You can see her just throw her hands down from disappointment
 like 30-38 sec mark
Like right before Lunch Break, he immediately decide to take her time away
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Rottenborn was also pepega, the Judge couldnt even get her lunch break
True
But rn, im helping my dad so i wont get to watch anymore rn
Oh, im watching it earlier too
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105> <:cryge:966624721611403294>
Cant even Arena LITE either
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Rip my Xtals and other reward
Life is so sht rn that I forgot all about MA and Ely Realm
had to wishing well it
I couldnt even get a single T piece after 20k xtal
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I blame the scam Snek, 20k xtal to Wishing Well a single Linn piece
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
Me who’s Bastet-less because im an idiot
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Oh, you dont have Pardo PRI
My internet also has a lot of skill issue
<:TeriStare:973793234096648202> <:TeriDerp:973794594787590154> <:TeriSweat:973794147683151912> <:TeriWeird:973794226754187324> <:Terichew:973794176015675392> <:TeriMald:973795215045455872> <:TeriGun:973793149992435752> <:TeriSegs:966624167338340372>
Its ok, I have skill issue and only have 800 pt and Inukai over here with his ~~HoR~~ SW with 800+ pts no Bastet and like 840+ with Bastet
I just got her to SSS this week
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Anyways, rip my SSS FR though
Eden Doko?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
They were free tickets but still
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Kallen fcked me over
Lmao
Kekw
what, its true, in the Honkai Kingdom event, every SA photo was just one with longer legs
💢
no, Teri Teri only evolved to be more derped with longer legs
I wonder how much popcorn i would need for that tbh
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Wow~
Mine is in Nirvana and i am suffering the illness known as IRL BS, so i’ll prob let myself fall as per usual
Its so dogsht
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Trying to 6* one character, i used like 20 Yellow one, 4 Purple one and like 60 of the Blue sht
Btw, I had to use wayyyy more of them
Promote all of them to 3* using the 2* fodders
Gl, hopefully if theres any open slot, ill try joining it too with my friend XD
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Yea, I talked about it last night
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Rn, im just coping and just kinda ignoring the fact that I got into a car accident
Good morning, I just woke up
Anyways, you have a guild I can join along with my friend <@704867526877904908> ?
Lmao, my friend pulled a Luluca like a few days ago too
like my sister and i am over here telling my mom not to talk about the situation because my brother is stressed out and shes over here doing literally the opposite
She really doesnt help with the situation either
God i hate my mom still though
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
The irony was that i forgot my driver license too, my mom brought it for me
I am not good with driving laws
Yea
It was too sudden too so i cant tell
Yep
Mostly because it was stacked against him, hes graduating soon, dealing college, moving out, etc
He took trauma damage though
Im suprised im not injured, same for my brother in the passenger seat
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
I would assume im prob not the one at fault
Btw im the red car
Thank you
Yea ig
Also, i lost my glasses so i cant see anything rn
So its hard to tell whos at fault
Not really, i cant even tell whos at fault, prob the other since im the one turning left once it was a yellow light and they were driving straight and they hit my car
No matter what i basically got fcked over regardlesss
So idk whats gonna happen now
So im basically get fucked over
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
But the other person is also good but apparently dont have any car insurance
Im fine, no serious injury so i got pretty lucky, i should be healthy
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
So thats *fun*
Picking my brother up from work
Got in a car accident
Guess m doomed
Feelsbadman
cringe
<:Childe_Sigh:789002373153685504>
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
its as ugly as Discord Mobile new update
still disgusting though, I just want my Garuda Hua without her getting powercrept like immediately because of Stardust enemies and new mechanics added onto new Valk like not a patch after <:despairge:1045736540875280465>
thanks for the showcase tutorials
ew
....
Congrats, Im still waiting for Black Swan… I have like 300+ pulls rn, so I can pull for her as I continue waiting for Hua and Kosma
Im prob pulling for her if it really is Tarot Card based
same
so 1 5* skin with darker ult every decade
<a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620>
ah true, I should have corrected once every blue moon, not full, wrong word there... and for 5* Skin, its once every new World, Diluc will be our only 5* Skin until Teyvat chapter is done and the twins leave the world
I know its less time than that, but its been so long I lost track of when it even came out in the first place because them skins only comes once every full moon
5* Skin equivalent to a 4* Skin in Honkek but costs more and took 2-3 years to make
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
<a:donoo:1076193550070464573>
<a:shotocheer:903862092036198460> <:depresso:1159828653413249086>
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
No sense of time
Because shes tuna and shes on the moon
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
It really has, I just didn’t bother to remember because its old
Right after Horb? Really
Tuna skin rerun
First outfit is nice but I dont really like that veil
When? Oh nvm, you posted it… I forgot im deadge this entire week and have my Econ Finals at 8 in the morning so prob not
Slow patches… Im ok with it only because I have Finals rn, but once thats done

I’ll feel the painfully slow patches
we do get more support powercreep here though
classic Genshin L
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
I know, I saw that in the animation, I was just saying the following evasion attack reminds me of AE where once you evade, you counterattack with your last normal attack sequence
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Oooooo, so like AE
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
homu homu... new rotations <a:A_HuWao:891440994841669653>
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
My actual copium was them having 2 different Ult animation for Hua if she was in Kick or Fist stance

Like how Finality Tuna had 2 depending if shes running Trio or by herself
Well, 2 jobs, the Battlesuit Looks and Gameplay 

They at least did good on the animations and sfx for her attacks
Smh, should have made it both Weapon, Ult and Basic Attack Button all together
Too bad Fist and Kick Stances is just Pardo Weapon active while Ult Button is useless, kinda ruining my Fu Hua Battlesuit immersion
Thanks

Much better gameplay than the first one, you can actually see all the animation
<:HUH:1045346750736638032>
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
I only know of Turkey Day, but we don't eat Turkey and but instead everything else like Hotpot, KBBQ, or whatnot
idk
I only miss watching people suffer with me
Thats so true
I never want to go back to it, but I do miss it sometimes
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
I miss how toxic it was, back when you can also bomb people in Abyss
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
I miss the time when we were forced to pick up the SP Packs so we had to pause the game and everything
I wished her Qi Pao was like AE or that the hair wasn’t another twintail but the wings are cool and the animation is pretty clean
Nah, they only care if shes good and has good animation
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
It is, but she has other combos you just never use
Hawk was funni mash same buttons
Like AE and Phoenix Hua was my fav playstyle
Like if you don’t know the combo by heart, you aren’t a Hua simp… plus just mash buttons if worse comes to worse
They need to stfu
Animation is nice
Thank youuuuuuuuu
At least AE still exist for me and shes beautiful
No scales made me sadge
I am eating good, but I do share the same sentiment with the others on her model
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
prob because of the displacement in color too... like how Nyx Blue Outfit looked hideous when her weapon ability and whatnot are all red
Oh, Hua's Hair looks normal in that one, doesn't look like she had a twintail which makes me happy... though Im assuming the hair prob changes depending on her stances or something <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I had it on repeat before when I was malding
omg, I need that video, I couldn't find it anymore and was looking for it
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
Oh, so it was the other way around
Wtf did I wake up too, yall gaslighting ChatGPT?
when will we get her gameplay?
anyways, I want my Hua Gameplay and Clorinde leaks already
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I guess they just mean similar to her animations from the in-game CG stuff
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
me who still has yet to see a single Clorinde gameplay
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Its gonna be a bitch, better wait for the other merchs to arrive…

Usually packages that stays iver their duration means you get charged like 1 CNY per day or something it stays overtime
its just my taste, I like outfits like Night Squire, AE, and Eden <:deadge:975652771082698782>
though I said pants, its more just like any long length skirts ig <:deadge:975652771082698782> Like at least for Luna, she wore somewhat or a long dress except for the front where its just a nonexistent skirt
true, pants stopped existing for them since like after Arc City or something... at most, we get skirts but even then, those skirts barely even reach their knees
I love everything else though, its why its only a minor complaint <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Prob my only minor complaint... well, complaints... about Garuda Hua (not her fault at all, but more like a Mihole problem)... is once again... why do they no longer give their female character pants anymore <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> 

also, whats with them and twintails... though thats just the old time problem like with HoT, HoRb, Senti, and whatnot where their hair just gets split in the model for the 3d model hair movement to be smoother ig... <:despairge:1045736540875280465>
<a:FuHuaEyes:759232858282786836>
HUAAAAAAAAAAAA
I know nothing about the story, but I just want Hua
the truth of the world
Carv is always correct
<a:RazorHangry_absol:857412188230909972>
why no ping me
Hua, my beloved
Minimum full gear, if possible, then SS
I hope I can max gear it + SS
I will
....
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
lmao
<:Prayge:905334842084970526>
Don't care, gib me more Hua please
I want know cuz its Hua but I really don’t care about the story
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Same
^^^
I’ll get you full gear and SS one day for your new Suit
Hua my beloved
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
both were Ice
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Wild aint it
SW was weird she was prob the first one for me to get to SS... well, my first double S was with Kallen 6S
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
mine was SW because she went to SS in like 100 pulls
so slow and oldge'
I hate myself
you can change it to quotes or add other things that may or may not make it harder or easier for you
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Im only 21-22 but yes, I do indeed already feel oldge
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
because I don't remember where they are well enough because it takes me a while to comprehend where they are without looking at the keyboard
but every other buttons, I just kinda deadge
f
qe
wasd
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im too use to spamming the same button
Im like 60-70
because its a typing speed... my brother was like 110... one of my friend was around 130, and another at like 120
nah, I just said 2 different thing

first was someone should drop the Charmander Copy pasta:

and my 2nd question was just asking about people typing speed in general... use  and just kinda type away ig... I despairged... only 60-70 WPM rn
anyways, whats ya'll typing speed?
<:PepePopcorn:801534993687511080>
just post the charmander copy pasta
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
you can read the darker text though
you'll be blind but whatever
just use lightmode if you can't see us
wait, wtf did you do with your discord?
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
AHHHHHHHHHHH
who is it
wtf
Like is the green slightly darker now
I somehow got tilted
itshoke, at least I can cope with the Geo one becuse theres finally a Atk% Scaling Geo Artifacts
<:PepePopcorn:801534993687511080>
oh yea, what was the channel that I got barred from? I feel left out
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
honestly, who in this server outside of Carv prob has like the most normal relationship with everyone else
...
I was like who's dis person
its why when Tai changed both their name and pfp, I got so confused
<:A_NotLikeHu:813506538139811890>
I remember people by their pfp and name yea
<:PepePopcorn:801534993687511080>
I use nicknames or part of their name if its too long
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I hate pronouns, its too much of a pain to bother ever remembering
All the inflation mods are cursed af... I think I should blame Bao Blueberry for that <:despairge:1045736540875280465>
<a:Essayge:1084932331766304829>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
so is that gonna go away once we're at 1.5?
<:RazorRead_Devonxy:892368679411515392>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<:PepePopcorn:801534993687511080>
Thank god im neutral for all of this
Heki...
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
lmao
prob the horny one <:wheeze:833318723565649950>
its actually one of the better mods out there compared to most of the cringe nsfw one lol
did you also saw the Luka Mod? the one where hes in the Cow Costume, that one was actually a nice mod, had like the Cow and Lifeguard costume <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
....
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
there are mods with peepee physics yes
but hes a Robot?
lmao
There are indeed mods with Penis already, you'll just have to wait for them to make one for Sam ig
<:PepePopcorn:801534993687511080>
I look forward to the model too
I like the Feathers
<:PepePopcorn:801534993687511080>
bold of you to assume they have it in the first place for your to castrate
<a:shotolick:1135611727451537448>
I prob only have like around 100-150 pulls left
Then nvm, I pulled for Brick so my xtals amount dropped
Oh wait.. Hi3 not HSR im assuming <:derp:724856219600289853>
Dont worry Eli, I also have like 200+ pulls waiting on copium
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
At least she has better drip than Misty
I don't hate him, but I don't like him either, doesn't help that his brat personality is the aggravating one and not the likeable kind
Wait why me, wtf, that brat aint even cute <:eek:765359367524188161>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I like his basic attack more than his skill ngl
Flexing on us
Chad Statue <:wheeze:833318723565649950>
My favorite Part of his kit for me, other than him smacking you with a book
I wished there was more to his Ult, still very nice looking Ult though <a:shotolul:903861979582693376>
faster go beyond ourcomprehenion speed
<a:pat:717159864891342848>
thanks
~~Vore~~
🆓 <:DoomMiya:410087014428442636>
Flintlock + Rapier/Sword is just a really nice combo
cuz Gun
for me, its Clorinde (for my Electro collections) <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Thank god I can skip both, Navia does seem nice though… but I gotta save
Ew
I still need to climb back up to like RL
Oh good luck, I think I forgot to do todays Abyss
Its gonna be aids for me
I also play on mobile, I play on both Mobile and Laptop
Its so disgusting, idk how poorly they gonna optimize that for Controllers
Im not against them being a twink either tbh, I just hate the shorts

Wished he’d look more like a scholar though… as for tall men, itshoke, we can cope for a better one
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
Ideally, afterward if possible get her to at least SS
need to 4/4 full gears her when she comes out
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
guess its time to start whaling and log-in for my xtals for Hua
anyways
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
HUAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<:cringeharold:859504595386236958>
like you bothered to wear fancy suit but didn't bothered to wear pants
I like him, hate the shorts though <:eek:765359367524188161> it disgusts me
though for leaks, its a bit unnecessary
tbh, Im fine with them, they are pretty nice when it comes to pirating things like videogames
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
of course it was the russian
the format was the same so I didn't even bother to look at it
I thought that was leaked earlier, but I realized its for another character ig
such a derpy emote i love it
wow
Like the only thing preventing me from completely quiting HI3 is because I love my Account and my copium for Judah PRI and Hua Battlesuit
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
At least back then, I could go to Room 1 and while degen, jt wouldn’t end up having them write out NSFW content in chat
Im pretty sure it got worse too
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Sounds about right, like the cross over thing with Fischl didn’t change much too. It was cool, but not like it could retain many ppl to stay with the game from Genshin


And in some cases like with Kektone, it made Room 1 even more cursed and degenerate
<a:catPls:1159921785890951198>
Who knows tbh
Genshin Star Zero Impact 3rd?
Genshin Star Rail the 3rd
tbh same, well more like neutral about them
imitation meat are nice too, but they're so fucking expensive
Tofu tastes ok, it depends what you eat with it because Tofu by itself is bland asf
Steak though
It has a lot of Yummy meat but the Picture of Obama prob taste very good with pronouns
L
Theres no Chicken or Fish nor Noodles
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
actually, can I just have water instead, I feel like vomiting
I would like a Liberal Pronouns Balding Steak and Imitation Tofu Latte del Horoscrope Cheese Sammy
but why in this channel?
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Pretty cool fighting style ngl
Shes like Itto in a sense, but instead of Def, she plays around Crystalize and Atk
Shes so cool wtf, also really good transition on her skills and animation too
but thats still very depressing
well actually, im assuming the Dmg Bonus can crit and get buffed by Dmg bonus and whatnot like Yunjin buff ig
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
How is it somehow worse than Clam
I still hate how shitty they word their effects for how much they essay this <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> 

Dmg Dealt Increased by 3% of Totaled Healing (max 30k Healing) and 10 proc every 10 sec... which means... you only deal an extra 900 Dmg for 10 hits...
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
too bad you'll need Crystalized Shield which is kinda Yikes in of itself
Their wordings is still as confusing as ever
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
oh yea, I guess it is 40% Geo Dmg Bonus with Shield... ngl, I just read 150% as just it increases by 50% of its original value, so it goes from 16% to 24% Geo Dmg Bonus
16% without it... kinda depressing
only 18% Atk and 24% Geo Dmg Bonus if you have a Crystalized Shield... not even an actual Shield nor higher Dmg Bonus
The set effect needs a buff though
anyways... this will prob be my new Domain for Baizhu/Ningguang
Definitely looks cool though
It looked like one of the Gold Halberg from Elden Ring lol, just more fantasy and fancy looking
Elden Ring?
Noice
<a:BellaPat:832237053370564609>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
tbh, I would get Bella if it wasn't for the ELF Academy and me seeing Belle being pepega
There is 0 Fu Hua vibe here, they are all clowns <:eek:765359367524188161> 

The only reason why I can rationalize them thinking its similar to Jingliu is maybe the eye part where it looks like what her cold stare may look like if she didn't look dead inside when Ulting <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Well, thats if her model looks ok and she has Tarot Cards
Im saving for Black Swan ig while waiting for Kosma and Hua
that was an automatic L Fake Leak
Mei Shiyuan Pyramid Skin <:derp:724856219600289853>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Fu Huaqiang? tf did the Qiang came from
???
So waiting for them to rerun hell
none of which are going into the Standard Banner
there so many 5* <:despairge:1045736540875280465> barely any new 4* in sight
<:derpostasis:834561554858770513>
its the equivalent of all the stupid people streaming themselves harassing people in other countries or doing crime while recording themselves doing it
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
oh, I see now, so its 20% Follow-up Attack Dmg now... and the Atk Buff last for 3 Turns til you either refresh it again or whatnot... truly more buff for JY
more buffs? <:huh:966619839307321394>
oh, Clorinde 4.7 <:derp:724856219600289853> if its true, I'll be both malding but ig I also get to save longer
<a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620>
all the small things builds up and then snowball
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
well, specifically, we just hate his personality during the stories
Because all the characters people simp for, Daniel, Jingliu, Blade, and Partially Midyuan seems to really love beating up the Kid
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
Watch the reason hes so unkillable like a Roach so that they can give him a Limiteed Banner version
It was like pay for Wings or pay for concert for wings
Isnt the Wing for the Concert
<:kek:809950280258945024>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
tbh, ive always had ran Speed Boots on my Mid Yuan and had his LC fix his Dmg Bonus issue and Ting buff his Atk
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
oh, will the Geo Atk Support finally help my Ningguang
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Thanks
I was happy for those who got it in our server though
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>
was so close to getting it too
Got YT notifaction about the event like 3 weeks overdue about the event... and worse part was that I was taking a break from the game due to burn out... just to become even more depressed and burned out lol
*sigh*
I got crippling depression when I found out that I was 3 weeks late to the Vol 2 Artbook event
ty
which version are we even on anymore
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I have 20k for Senti Brick so I should be good, only real problem is when we get a new Hua Battlesuit
I've just been taking my sweet break from the game rn
oh, i'll be pulling for the Brick yea, I should also get on Hi3rd and start farming too ig lmao
207 + 13 = 220 pulls saved up rn
Honestly, I have a lot of good justification to pull for Topaz, VA, Follow-up Attack characters that can copium buff JY... Hunt Dps to help me on Boss Fights... and good Support Skills
though ig its more for Guin since apparently, we can get Luka from the event
same, Guina is also on it so I want to get both of them
I need Topaz to come out already, I want to be able to buy these before the month ends
im at 200 rn, I would've used mine to buy E6 Tingyun but I didn't have enough at the time, and I didn't wanna pull for the rate up characters
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oh, I used my 600 starlight for Geppard LC, my next one will be for Bronya LC lol
if only that was possible
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
trade the extra LC for the extra LC
I'll take the Welt LC, I'll trade for it with my extra Clara LC
my Geppy has his LC so his Def does go higher too, though ig once I swap his set out, his DEf will drop back down to aound same amount
lmao
excluding Geppard rn til I get a Def% mainstat Globe
for my support, if they aren't running that ERR set, they are running the Cdmg one
because I like her Ulting more
I run Energy Recharge on my Tingyun, same with Energy Set
you only need like 2.8k Atk to maintain max buff on Tingyun yea
actually, nvm, I understand how she could reach that much, most of my Speed subs didn't even reach like 4
wtf did they feed that Tingyun lmao
<:PepePopcorn:801534993687511080>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
im even more shocked than my Geppard with 92 base Speed is faster than most my dps
plus, most allies with dmg Ult can heal too, so you can pretty much already overheal
147 Speed Luocha is nice, even if the field last 2 Luocha turns, its fine since faster Luocha means more Skill Points and he can proc his Emergency Heals more often
Speed Boots
yea, since mine can live longer than Tingyun even with an Atk% Chest lmao
<:nolegs_sad:308234392499912705>
mine is only at 3.8k though
a lot of my supports are doing well too <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> at least for their stats requirement
yea, im kinda farming Relics, but at the same time, I don't have any Relics to farm for either... since ima be waiting for JY new set... and I have a set for Topaz for now til then too because its Himeko pieces... ig I can farm for QQ Set
me fr
lmao
Im pulling for Topaz/her 4*, but I don't even know if im going to lose 50/50 or not, since im prob stopping at my 1st 5 star drop... since allies wise, I don't have any other I feel like building rn, mainly because I have both my 2 teams done for MoC
<:derp:724856219600289853>
its because I just get the Stagnant Shadow Dailies, so im like, well, lets just pick one ig
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Honestly, im not sure if I should pre farm for Topaz in the first place when I don't even know if I will get her
Judah chan is too strong I see
Lightning Crosses but no Judah PRI
*sigh*
then again, MC can still be Elation/Harmony <:YEP:815000469902065674>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
wao
Harmony
^^^ basically this
because they noticed it and decided to be a degen
gotta save for Hua
Ain't gonna go for Pyramid when I don't even have the unit
nvm
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
actually, I might get it just to escape the pastel curse
I don't have Horb so I don't have to get tempted by that outfit
the long dress version looks nice, I don't like the Birb one as per usual
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I still don't have Nyx either
The White Claws is really cute
<:shotolurk:892985948382576740>
wtf
not just Lightning Cross, but Lightning Bleed Cross
ew
another Lightning Cross
just to fuck with people
sounds like something Aha would do
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
ikr, Elation to troll the Harmony people
mainly Stelle because I have Caelus anyways
but yea, I can't wait to see it on both Stelle and Caelus when all the sfx are there
<a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620>
it gives a lot of rizz
I like the hat
another set for overheal I see... lmao, first clam, now crystals
Its just Otto for you, still waiting for that Otto in a dress model
Though I really wished they didn’t release so many new characters, would have been nice to see them get fleshed out more before releasing them as playable characters 

Like with Screwllum
Topaz will just me my copium Hua Seiyuu Expy, to justify me pulling a but before going back to saving
Oh, if its CN, then I’ll still be good with that
Regardless, I’ll prob pull until my 50/50 just for that, if I fail, then that just means I’ll be guaranteed and if not, still a win for me
CN or JP, or both? Its why Im getting confused
I keep mixing Jingliu and her Va and just keep getting confused so yea
I forgot who was Topaz VA?
I shall be patient and save
Argenti really wanted to be beautiful, all their skills looks so fancy
So like first hit will be 8%, 2nd hit 16%, 3rd hit 24%, etc til the attack ends
Should be additive
Ngl, im pretty sure I used my College funds on Taobao Hi3 Merch and simping
<:shxtouEhe:1013233702622462034>
As long as you aren’t in debt, use it if you simp hard enough, I dont simp hard enough to justify myself whaling for them so yea
?
<a:shotolick:1135611727451537448>
honestly, I would rather keep it the same word length, so I would've gone, Beauty and the Cock <a:KekWiggleSpin:924047665644322877>
<:Cock:1003648150638174280>
You are stupid, its a mustache, even if you turn it into time, its still not gonna be anywhere near 11 minutes
its like 9:15
<:slapbaka:974814370817273876>
*sigh*
Heki... stop
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
it just validates Heki
I hate the fact that the Rope has a mouth 👄
Im very oblivious
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yee
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
me in same situation as Taihen but instead of misreading it, I just forgot her animations
which does proc the set effect buff
Like those attack where the numbers goes from like 100 to 1000 with a chainsaw but its like 1 hit overall... but watching a vid again, its all separate hits
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
but yea, I keep on forgetting that Hoyo are lazy with skill descriptions, Ive never used Himeko so I thought when you were talking about the 3 hits with follow-up attack thing, it was just looks like 3 hits but the numbers just gets bigger making it one instance of dmg
even if its only for 1 target which is still good for bosses
ye
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
she literally has all the QoL stuff he needs
Topaz is what I wished JY couldve been like
yea, it will be a good alternative considering how much cdmg Numby gets
yee
the trigger is if the Basic or Skill dont crit
the buff is global
Like every other basic attack lol
Its a single blicky shot
Only 1
at least his signature is better than Himeko lc
yea
only for Topaz though
its disgustingly good
Increase the wearer's CRIT Rate by 18% and their follow-up attacks' DMG by 30%. After the wearer uses a follow-up attack, apply the Tame state to the target, stacking up to 2 stacks. When allies hit enemy targets under the Tame state, every Tame stack increases the CRIT DMG dealt by 12%.
For me, ima run Topaz with JY lol
No Huohuo
I though they did drip marketing for her already
Whenever Numby act she recover 5 energy
So Hoyo was just too lazy
16% Dmg Bonus on all Attack seems pretty good for Topaz
The 2p set is worth it tbh
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
This shit is getting too confusing
Does 3 separate number pops up on the same enemy
Its just 1 instance of dmg, the difference is that instead of LL Stack style, Numby gets 50% Action Forward Buff
I was going along this context
Im pretty sure Taihen told the reddit people to krill themselves
So whats the conclusion?
And not you
I thought they told you to tell someone else to krill themselves
Its about the same and only JY will benefit from 4p effect but at least most other can use the 2p effect
Ye, so it should include the initial hit but yea, its not much of a change but at least for characters like Himeko, QQ, etc that does one instance of Follow-up Attack, its 24% and not 16%
Honestly, I thought the initial Follow-up Attack would get the 8% Follow-up attack buff along with the 16% to make it 24%… and then every Attack after is another 8%
Yea
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I use JY LC, so its actually even lower for me
That much was obvious for me ye
15%
It doesn’t?
So it would start at 108, then the next instance should be getting 16% and so on til max stack
The initial hit gets the 8% ye
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
thought it was 20% but thats Genshin's number for their sets
oh, it was 16%
New Set stocks going down
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Tingyun Stocks going up for JY
2p is 20% Follow-up Dmg Bonus
Honestly, its prob because Topaz can already benefit easily from just the 2p Set because all of her Attack, from Basic, Skill, and Ult are all Follow-up Attack, while JY only has LL, while he gets no buff for his Skill/Ult
46.6% is in Genshin, in HSR, its lower yea
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Honestly, I think they still would, its not like they ever dropped new sets for Kafka and whatnot, JY is just really mid so they are using new Set Bonus to help make him slightly better
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
nope, because its all just one number in the end
only within the Attack
oh, can you clarify to us what the effect means?
Taiiiiiiiiii~ hewwo hewwo
We have to wait 3 weeks for it though
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
For instance with JY, they are actual separate numbers whenever LL Acts, we don't know if Topaz is the same way or not... because it could look like multiple hits just to end up being 1 instance of dmg
It doesn't which is why we were talking if they mean 1 instance or actual multiple hits
cuz Numby is only 1 instance of dmg... but it can be AoE and it has Action Forward effect
I feel like its better to give Topaz 2p Follow-up Attack and 2p Fire, that way she gets 20% Follow-up Dmg and 10% Fire Dmg Bonus

Since with Salsotto buffing another like 15% Follow-up Dmg Bonus...


its prob better than 10% Fire, 12% Skill Dmg, and 12% Fire Dmg for 1 Attack after Ult or 28% Follow-up Dmg Bonus...

at least until we find out of they mean multi-hits like Himeko, or multiple instance which is only JY rn
本次攻击内 translates to within this attack or during this attack, which suggests that the effect applies to all additional attack damage dealt during a single attack.

最多叠加8次 means stacking up to a maximum of 8 times, indicating that the 8% increase can accumulate or stack with each additional attack damage instance within the same attack, up to a maximum of 8 times.

We would need Taihen if we want clarification tbh
its for the one attack, because it talks about the one attack
Does she?
not sure if Topaz can use it either, she can 100% use the 2p effect since all of her attacks are Follow-up Attack including his Basic Attack... its because unless they decide to change the wording, Numby will only get like 8% Follow-up Dmg Bonus from the 4p bonus
ye
it also means other follow-up attack characters only need the 2p effect because March, Kafka, Clara, Bladie, Himeko, QQ, Herta, etc only does 1 instance of dmg in their Follow-up Attack
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
says ChatGPT, so its really just a JY Buff... because Lightning Lord attack multiple time
The phrase 装备者对敌方目标造成追加攻击伤害时，本次攻击内的追加攻击伤害提高8%，最多叠加8次 can be translated to:

When the wearer inflicts ~~additional attack~~ Follow-up damage on enemy targets, the ~~additional attack~~ Follow-up damage within this attack is increased by 8%, stacking up to a maximum of 8 times.

This implies that when the person wearing the equipment deals additional attack damage to enemies, each instance of additional damage within the same attack is increased by 8%, and this effect can stack up to a maximum of 8 times.
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>
whats worse is that I already had gears for those 2 with decent stats... even if those were mid sets
Min maxing Midyuan and Topaz...
well, time to despair again
Im assuming it either means Dmg Type, like Asta LC or it means their Class/Dmg Scaling <:derp:724856219600289853>
Oh that’s actually big, no more scuffed retry where I had to repick my entire team because the enemy decided to all target Tingyun
Hua is way more likely but yea
💜
Thank you
Oh Kosma is as cope as my Judah PRI Delulu cope
Cuz from what I remember, his character story just sucked ass
Yea, I hope he gets a bigger part in the story, unless hes going to be doing something else in latter story against the abundance
Im just waiting for Hua and Kosma
Lol
Yea, he’s not being a menance like I want him to be
Just in general as a set up arc for future ships… like with Luocha, Big Booba Lady, other Ships, etc
Luofu to me was like Inazuma for Genshin
Even for Jing Yuan, it was still pretty scuffed story development
But I would agree with Gresham
For me, I haven’t done any of the Characters story so I wouldn’t know
of course, this one needs wear more for their top half but tbh, all Inverse Spirits in Date a Live seems to be more revealing anyways
Like honestly, I thought her Original outfit would look similar to Inverse Origami for their model but obv with different clothing... I wished the Veil was longer though which the new model kinda shows so I hope they go with that
I assume Nikke because of our current context
it gave me Nikke and Epic 7
I already did
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
oh
is that Nikke?
yea, as fanart, its really nice, but for the actual in game model, I rather not have to see the coochie 24/7
Like I like the Nun outfit, basically top half looks good and then bottom half just kinda became cringe
<:eek:765359367524188161>
ew, yea, the bottom half is disgusting
what was her original outfit anyways?
wasn't this lady from the trailer?
lmao
honestly, that sounds cool, except that I don't want another self sacrifice story we had too many of those already if its true
specifically any Flintlock/Musket like weapon are my fav
specifically Clorinde because *gun*
I just want Wrio and Clorinde
20 min timer minimum if it was lol
You know, burrowing bosses are cute and all but their hitboxes are always so ass to deal against
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Sam be reverse Clara <:shxtouCopium:1013233700261072916> instead of Clara getting daddy Svarog protections, Sam just throw in Firefly
be patient
just wait before rioting
unironically though, my favorite part of the model was the cape for me only because it let me cope that its actually the real length of the skirt because its not like i'll ever see the front side while fighting in combat <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
The cape makes it worse for me because it basically shows the length the skirt couldve been but the cape wouldve been as short as the skirt if they hadn’t lowered it from the start
They rarely ever want to make a skirt that isn’t ultra short now… they really just wanna show the <a:uooh:964118021574623243>
And like Cherry said, I really hate the skirt <:deadge:975652771082698782>
The hair really did not aged well
Its so cursed
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
she really do have better effects than the Archon
Games dead on Glb though but at least CN and JP is still alive
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Not as bad as GGZ when they had the game skip from like 3.0 to like 7.1 or something
Well, didn’t they increase the patch month by like a week before? Like it used to be like a new patch every 4 weeks or something
And touch grass
Its why the HoT Stigmata has a better than the actual free skin they gave
I know
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Her stigmata has better design than the actual battlesuit model
Ngl, even the cape is like the size of the skirt if they didnt made it go lower
I know the back is the cape, but im talking how the skirt are always so short for no reason
I dont like the skirt, the colors are nice but it just kinda makes me feel tilted
It feels like its missing something that gives it any impact that a summon was being well, “summoned” like with Oz, Yae’s Totem, Albedo Elevator, etc
But the actual vfx and sfx are pretty mid
Her NA/CA is really nice, her Ele Skill Model animation is cool
The stats it gives is also really good, too bad I have too many swords rn… and Im not sure if I would want to pull for her
Her weapon really does look super pretty
but yea, I only like the hair, I hate everything else about it
<a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620>
yes
cuz the Doll joints
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
oh, I thought it was Herta but if she decided to make a male Doll for herself
what is this anyways?
Once im done with class, ill finally be able to look at the leaks
thanks
Bennet fixes all attack issue anyways
Base Attack is whatever
<:HimekoWTF:423917413063720980>
also, wao. 88% Sword
lmao <:wheeze:833318723565649950> too bad its Atk% Sub
oh pog
I guess they just like the Blob
Honestly, to me, both HoO and Susannah outfits color is still pretty similar <:deadge:975652771082698782> real difference is just Susannah has more pink ig
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
I hate it, for me, like Carv said, I really wanted there to be more Blue and Black… rn, it really just looked like HoO Mei battlesuit colors and I am already sick of it
honestly, it makes sense for the archon to be able to swap between each state
people just bored
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
\/€ry Fu/\/\y
Yikes forever
Hewwo <:Irewave:675925488119709717>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
So how did this convo in <#1062434039186870392> turned into something about god
I woke up to this, lovely
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Fontaine WH<:OMEGALUL:842131641500434432> Tao
true
If theres a 4th Pyro Polearm, I will not remember them
Its another Pyro Polearm so its just gonna be mid like Thoma, unless its 5* then maybe theres a chance lol
Im now waiting for my 4.2 Drip Marketing <:despairge:1045736540875280465>
3 new 1 old, im happy
Oh pog, I can pull for Luka and Guina, Sushang once again lol
2 Genius Society characters is nice
Screwllum, Pog
<:shxtouCopium:1013233700261072916>
tell me when they release Judah chan PRI and do my Hua drip marketing
nice, then I can sleep
even if im taking a break, im still saving for Hua and Judah PRI
ty
you didnt ping me <:Sadge:842131939607183360>
Garuda Hua, Ultimate sends everyone into a fever dream that shes getting a crossover in HSR and Genshin as the self Mihole collab
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Its just their monthly free Multi at this point
Ive been saying that since forever now
<:shotoclown2:924393627529138216>
been so long
yayyyyyyy, Judah chan PRI
<:pog:825793819428913183>
that mean Judah PRI
Psy Lightning, thats the same as OG Teri with Judah's Oath
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
<:shotoclown2:924393627529138216>
For me, Im just waiting for Hua news and battlesuit
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
My Midyuan team was always pretty skill point efficient so Topaz will prob be fine... (I'll just won't have a healer <:run:1065680602168299530> unless I use Luocha)
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
I just realized that Topaz also increase Follow-up dmg enemy received... so I can run her with Midyuan
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
APHO Mei though, they really taking their time with that
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
no Hua in sight
wow, I thought they were just predictions
<:huh:966619839307321394>
whats this?
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I have enough Catalysts, so im no longer pulling for weapons banner, afterall, I went for Baizu Catalyst and got cucked by Amos Bow
I have no pulls for Wrio but i'll do a multi for fun anyways ig
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
ahehehaheheeeheeehaah
honestly just as bad as them not knowing how to give characters proper skirts/pants half the time
I agree
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Hua is the only character to remain consistently flat and mature left now
<:eek:765359367524188161>
Gunblade are nice tbh, do wished it looked a bit more older though rather than modern but yea
thats fine tbh, the real problem are the one basically having the children gamble in their games... heck, they already added in Gacha to Roblox games... some Roblox items be selling for thousands of dollars as if they were CS: Go Weapon lootcrate Skins
~~shes just a DMC character at this point~~ (i know nothing about it)
now I wonder what's her cross gonna look like, I hope its an actual Coffin this time
anyways, back on topic, I didn't expect Tericula to be using a Gunsword tbh
also the usual child predator stuff
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
even Roblox blew up and is now getting sued for not properly moderating their site and allowing kids to gamble with money
never ending cycle as things progressively gets better for the worse
History just repeats itself
Seven Knights, etc
also all those Korean gacha game
I've played Grandchase as well
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
gacha in MMO
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Elsword age too
yee
etc etc
limited means to farm gacha currency, Omni Evo
prob Brave Frontier is one of them
honestly, I don't remember my first gacha game, but i've been through enough gacha hell and still am to know afterall
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
my greatest sadness will be missing all these Captainverse event and not know wtf is happening
correct
and turning it into the new standard like with most MMO as well
natural gacha standard of creating new content/progression systems
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
back when PRI Arms first came out to make older Valks relevant again and now they are essentially required on every new Valk, even the supports now uses a PRI Arm
correct, its why I said she was running on Copium, I can still use her and get decent result if my SP Valk still sucks ass because game wouldn't give me Bastet pieces for Pardo <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> 

but yea, HoTR was just the final nail in the coffin, that was all, all the other SP Valk replacing her was just the ditch being made already as well as the coffins
don't think so
she was replaced by the other lady I forgot the name of other than that it starts with the letter M
though realistically, she didn't
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
like how Bkek was really replaced by PE
I just wanted Hua to be powercrept by Hua
nah, more like Im just a Hua simp and I was running on copium when she got replaced not by another Hua but by Bonya
My faith had long died since AE got replaced, running on pure copium thanks to Teri and soon I hope for more Hua suit
I like the Gunblade tbh, they are in a futuristic enough settings anyways even without it, afterall, with laser canons and whatnot already existing
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Her transformation and Ult animation is gonna be the GGZ Gacha
Not really, I do agree you barely see a Kallen in her, but thats the Teri vibe for you
I like that its actually like a long dress too and not a random short skirt
true, but Herrscher wise, its just been mostly Psy outside of Trio
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
my god
but Psy needs to stop
def not just Bio lmao
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
and I just following my trend of skipping Seele til its long overdue to get her
Im getting her, not like I ever have enough for HoRB anyways
I really do love the design for it
Ngl, she looks really cool
Tericula
Sushang gonna be cursed though
just for Luka and Gunafen
Honestly, I might pull once or twice on Topaz banner
Nopers, but you can’t krill yourself, because I would have to be the first one after all my copium
Hua is Birb
...
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
But Hua… well, actually Hua was just business suit
Then again, Mihole really suck at making Long Dresses it seems when most of the characters nowadays lack any form of pants or ling skirt unless its a Male Character
For me, its kind mid, the Tiara is the best part of the outfit, I wished the skirt was longer though, I wouldve liked it a lot more because she would look like an actual Ice Princess
ah yes, a Glider, Namecard, and 10 Pulls for your Anni... 

Then for any other patch for HSR currently, is a free 10 pull each patch, while Honkek also getting their own free log-in rewards <:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Its always DA or it troll with the Gloria
Watch it be for A Rank Dudu again
Because for normal Dan, half the time, he sounds fine and then the other half is like nerdge for EN Dub
The EN one
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Does Dhil had his voiced fixed to not sound like a nerd?
Thankfully, other than Midyuan, I have no one else to pull for
Nini…
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
totally has no gender
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
the trotter is her body pillow ishoke
the blicky
wao, both Geppy and Midyuan looks nice, I like Midyuan the most though cuz of the clothes reminded me of the Hua Merch I've bought
Teri ELF <:YEP:815000469902065674>
lmao
yes, I understand
wao
both are Catalyst users too
don't worry
samesies
I couldn't pull Luka in HSR so pulling for him in Genshin is good enough for me
Wrio is Genshin Luka animation wise, i'll take it
For me, im neutral about Neuv, cuz im picky
^^^ I care most about the Dog Boy
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I’ll prob pull for Wrio ngl, I just like cute one
Kebin and Sieg we did get some gameplay but those were extra basic controls/attacks
Im fine with GGZ Expy too, on another note, I def agree with Tet here, I really want more male Honkai Expy for HSR over female one since I cri whenever I get to see Kalpas, Su, Kosma, and then not have any of them be playable
haven't played GGZ in so long
if neither of them explodes, thats gonna be a bit annoying
Succubus one and Fake Mei looking one would work, 3rd one should be the Princess Fantasy Weapon (The other Doll Weapon), sadly, idk which one of those explodes though
Its not bad as per say, but Uma  Musume/Horse Racing is extremely huge in Japan


Its like if you were to go to China and then start talking shit about the CCP, you’ll probably disappear and be found in a ditch somewhere the next day
Good Job, congrats wao
He has the usual fake doggo ear
at least when friendship system was a thing
its been there for the longest time too <:KekPat:966625000339668993>

They just can’t read
They can write
They do have the attention span to write reddit level essays, they just don’t have the attention span to actually read it
so I be ignoring QUA 99% of the time now
my QUA hatred is carried over from Hi3
also, wrong channel
but it doesn't matter
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I have a shit ton og IMG one but they are all on the Effect Res Set
I just want my Hua/Kosma expy already
saving for Hi3rd expy or someone cute, but yea, I am essentially skipping everything
Other than the 1 multi i'll do for Luka, im basically good
thank god I get to skip all 3
that drama be hilarious to watch
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
The already have that in Honkek, but watch them add it for HSR first before Genshin
just realized it got removed so heres the screenshot instead of it being in HSR
Im just reposting the YT link lol
HSR
Or add in annoying mechanics and sell the solution, so the usual make the problem then sell the solution


Or sell the solution and then make the problem the next patch to make the solution relevant and people to regret not getting said unit for the new problem
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Because Mihole sucks ass, instead of actually balancing any of their characters, they powercreeps them by making enemies Dmg Sponges so that you’ll never have enough dmg to kill them all in time

They picking stocking over skin again, sadge

Office Worker Bronya
wao
Seele support
The more they delay Hua, the more I cope as I save for her
I like White Night, not because of the effects but just because I like the name
yea, elation + ambundance is nice to deal with Kafka
yea
cuz real one died
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
basically a new path
Heart one is Propogation
The Clown
Mine is startling breeze, or Guinea Pig in Ice Coffin...

no Elation + Preservation combo though so that was sadge
really wanted to farm it for Otto too (still will but its still annoying)
kinda sad its only like a small amount of Cdmg for the effect res Planar Set
More Relics pls Mihole
need new set bonuses already
Lightning Set also kinda ass
I have a really good Atk Boots too but i cant even use it, like Bladie can prob just go Hp Boots and be fine for the most part
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
my JY is depressing because I still don't have good substats + I have to build Speed Boots on him cuz of Ll
same
like I will get Ll to 10 stacks but I have to wait for him to act just for it to go back to 3 stacks... and then cope again when I dont get the 6+ stacks for Ll buff
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
it is good, kinda hate that I can't do much for him
ngl, I like the characters with Summons like JY, its suboptimal but it does feel nice to have another character
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
its a beholder, or its just the Eye of Cthulu from Terraria cross-over
Ignite also known as new Husk
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Same jerma
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Genshin Anti Prefarm mechanics back at it again but for HSR
note she only heals other ppl but not herself so you have to rely on her LC and Talent passive
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
Fu Xuan Boss fight
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Plus, she got that cool entrance for her cutscene while most 4* don’t get shit but regular cutscenes or was clapped (i.e Arlan and Robot lady)
Like the first I heard leaks about her, people been saying she was gonna be 5*
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Shes been Quantum Preservation and was assumed to be 5* for a long while now though
Since I also need to get their Signature LC if its good
If its solo Hua and no new Hua expy, then maybe E6 yea
If there is 2 Hua, then E2-E3 for each, if its Kosma, then automatically E6
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I assume Hunt, but not like I ever cared to remember
Thank god I can skip all of them
Nope, what they do?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I don’t want Klee in there, we already have 2 Pyro 5* in the stupid Standard banner, both of which are Claymore too
Ima just despair and distort
I agree Keilo
def no auto aim, looks like Mika E aim wise
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Ult is cool, Skill i just water gun
The only one im waiting for is the Gun Lady and Yellow ~~Charlotte~~ I mean Yellow Lady
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
They could’ve gave us any other one but instead we basically got an uglier Bennet
Im fine with Jojo Senti
Reminds me of all the Honkai Concept art where we also lost good one
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
They make the nicest concept art for him but picked the worse of the concept art to implement
Day is ruined
Sadness and disappointment
…
<:eek:765359367524188161>
She's basically Dmg Reduction like Fire Mc, though my question is what do they mean by hp reversal capped at 2 times <:despairge:1045736540875280465> cuz her Trace only heals when Reversal happens, if its capped at 2 for the entire battle, thats gonna be extra cringe for auto
oh 2nd set will be nice for Fischl and Yae
ty
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Sirin Valk before Sin Mal, my depression is building up
She just looks like M7 and I hate it <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> due to M7 ptsd
In case of an investigation by any federal entity or similar, I do not have any involvement with this server or with the people in it, I do not know how I am here, probably added by a third party, I do not support any actions by the member of this server.
yes, waiting for any Elysian Realm expy, but just specifically Kosma, its my greatest copium like how I still cope for Judah Oath PRI
for me, I can technically skip til Fu Hua and Kosma expy
Kafka Banner is really good 4*, perfect DoT teams filled with Nihily characters and 1 DoT Euridition lol
yea
well, ig its easy skip for me then, Sussy is maxed, Arlan is almost maxed... and Nat is just gonna be Nat with her useless Eidolon because most my char will die when they go under 30% hp anyways

Kafka unironically have good team/4* if its true
Or just a new Lightning Dps
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Soon we will get a Lighting S Rank Support to replace HoTR for Lightning Team so that they can change it back to the usual Lightning Exclusivity instead of Ice
Lmao
Obviously not dead dead but not seen as often anymore
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Fischl been dead for a while now
Lmao
A Rank Valk dead forever, its only SP Valk as the new A rank
But it makes sense, we already got Ice, Phys been overloaded and Fire usually gets ignored anyways
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Eden
Sirin replacing GD
Id V is a bit taller but yea, true
At least the protagonist looks normal
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I like that the characters actually look like a proper child and not a giant baby like in Genshin
Occasional Premium Furniture you can't craft
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
maybe Characters?
Most like clothing ig
Not a single one of Mihole games had not been a gacha
They always find a way
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Im more questioning how are they gonna turn this into a gacha
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
But its very cute
<a:aintnoway:1053635860559572992>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Ngl, I would play that kind of game
Hes very cute yea
This one?
<:SadBb:552684268921290772>
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
For me, I want twinks or actual buffed characters with actual nice body proportion
Oh, I see it now, yes yes, cope with me and hope its for the actual characters and not just Npc, to give us a reason to play the game
We can cope for actual buffed models now
Hai Taihen, did you like all the leaks that happened today?
instead, we go the worse of both
We could've got Old man Heizhou but we also could've gotten a cuter Heizhou too
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
he does, I mean a uglier looking clone
instead of hot detective man
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
they made Heizhou a Scaramouche Clone
we were
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
but honestly yea, Mihole could've just made concept art books for their behind the scenes stuff for Genshin Art like they already do for Honkai and it would've made them profit anyways
They pretty much said fuck the other leakers going for clout and Mihole and just leaked everything
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
yea, on some of my servers, I see people posting leaks and talking about it in the leaks channel, or at least see the Leak Feeds from Reddit
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Ishoke, do what is most easy for you Tet
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Indeed Gorou, ig the furry was allowed nips
Shhhhhh
It’s probably Xiao
Nvm, i saw the one with nips now
? Which one
Aight
Lemme ask Carv if he can see the thread or not, if he doesn’t, then we good
I don’t trust myself so don’t for me, ill just be happy with seeing the thread Tet made
<a:pat:717159864891342848> <a:pat:717159864891342848> <a:pat:717159864891342848> <a:pat:717159864891342848>
Thank you Tet
Variant A is cute, I don’t like B as much clothing wise but hair is fine for a penguin
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Watched the 6th Model is only for Npc
I forgot about the Loli model
Oh wait, 5
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Hes cute, fluffy hair but im scared what the Model will be like because Genshin will forever use the same 4 basic bitch model
This would’ve been nice cosmetic
<:pepepray:773373711751315466>
So these are all Genshin leaks?
I’ll still be backtracking to see what I miss though
Aight
Oh
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Smh, now I have to backtrack
Oh yea, I should be looking at it, also, why did no one pinged me about leaks
Since sometimes, I’ll download games and my pc would say its unsafe or has a virus but it was just false positive and nothing actually happened nor was it a Trojan, but that depends on your site
Some are false positive
I hope both cities get detroyed to oblivion
Since they swapped Kafka E1 and her Traces around, instead of Serval, you can also run Hook for Fire DoT too

At least rn, only consistent DoT dps characters we have are Sampoo, Serval, and Hook

E1 is now the one that gigaboost Shock DoT, while her trace lets her proc all DoT sources
<a:KEKWbye:849900040864006144>
She really does have the Ningguang hair
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Lmao
Event stig?
Bottom 2 are Stigs I suppose
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Like whats with them recently with making nonexistent skirt and pants
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Her final outfit better not look like that because it looks ugly af
Who yea
ishoke
<a:patpat:1083054453902540865>
and then it ignored the leaks saying Blade/Dan Heng first
My brain just been derping
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I think its because my brain was like:

Seele followed by Jingyuan
SW followed by Luocha
next would be Kafka then Blade 

watch it be Fu Xuan then Dan Heng next instead
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I guess I had my time distorted
For me, I always thought it was Kafka + Luka first followed by Blade
for me, ig I can skip 1.3, 1.4
its been leaked like that for a while now for 1.2, Kafka first followed by bladie <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:Childe_Sigh:789002373153685504>
...
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
HSR is good at making really pretty Ult
Night everyone
<:pepepray:773373711751315466>
Ima go to sleep now
Anyways, Im still coping she is QUA
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Mihole just said Trio was too many IMA Herrscher covering Ice, Lightning and Fire, we gotta increase the Psy Herrscher Count again so that Psy Herrscher now also cover Phys so that we have Phys, Lightning, Fire and Ice Herrscher just for Psy only
Anyways, another Psy Herrscher
Thought they were 2 different lines of text
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
But what you wrote earlier, 

进入领域就有50了

一段大脆弱不够,领域脆弱只有50

I realized that shit was connected, so it should’ve been:

进入领域就有50了一段大脆弱不够,领域脆弱只有50 

For an actual proper sentence
I just assume they forgot the SP part, but it prob just meant Impair
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
This shit
进入领域就有50了
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
I misread “Enter the Field and gain 50” but since I got confused what the 50 meant and that I saw earlier it already talked about 50% Impair, I assumed this was 50 SP

But nah, they just said again that Seele Impair Field is base 50% Impair
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Oh XD, don’t worry, there were so many 50 in there I thought one of the 50 was Starting off with 50 SP
Since even if you rely on google translate for MTL, its still at least comprehensible, but this one had no grammar so it just became even worse to understand
<:KekPat:966625000339668993> <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Ishoke, its confusing, I’ve had my share of reading/interpretating MTL brainrot but this one was quite bad for me XD at least I got the general gist of it thankfully
But yea, 40 sec Impair sounds quite insane ngl, then again she also has high ass SP cost
I assume her Domain 1 is similar to CH/HoS 50% Impair for 8-16 seconds on their skill, while the major 75% Impair is on the 2nd half of the Ult
It was so scuffed to read
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Oh, I prob misread one of the part for that and just assumed she has that
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Oh thank you, I tried my best to understand it
Basically whatever Neko said
or if it was Raven but now her Ult costs 200 SP while having the same SP Regen
My brain was sleepy but a better example would be if Sushang were to have her 150-175 Ult Cost but she had the SP Regen equivalent to Raven
my weird example was with Epi talking about HoS Sp Regen but if her skill cost 250 SP
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
pretty much yea, no one will have enough SP if their Ult cost gets doubled while keeping SP gain the same
HoS has good SP regen, but thats also with her weapon, also, HoS SP Regen is enough for 125, but what if HoS need 250 SP each time instead with her current 125 SP regen
I never thought there would be a day where this would be relevant, even if its useless
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
high SP cost but gain so much SP it doesn't matter
yea, I think its like what Neko says, most likely like Sushang
Here's what I can get from it:

- High SP Cost, Ult cost 250 Sp in Total, Impairs Enemy Defense by 75% 
- Ult 1 is 75 Sp, Ult 2 is 175 (thus 250 Sp)
- Its an Impair Field/Domain Expansion that lasts for 40 Seconds, so like MPE/Griseo Ult 
- Start of with 50 SP (Usual SP Passive)
- Can gain 35 SP (Related to Impair Field)
that is some scuffed translation
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
Thats free Abyss Flower Stack for Luocha
Good enough
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
Posting it on the official forums
Basically she’ll constantly lose hp every turn til she dies and turn into back into a chicken and revive
And we already know Phoenix exist thanks to Sushang
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Goes from Birb back to Chicken
Marshal Hua is the one said to be the Dragon
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
Shes a Phoenix, Rebirth by Flame
even way back then, it was speculated she would replace HoS
yea
For me, my pull plan is:

Pull Luocha + E1... then slap pull once to see if I get Luka in 1 Multi... then 1 Slap pull for Blade, then save for Fu Hua/Kosma Expy

Maybe 1 Slap pull on Dan Heng Banner to if I like his gameplay enough or if his 4* are good
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Yea, her headpiece is really nice, I also like her Scythe/Orb though, the Orb almost looked like a Soul though I wished it didn’t looked like Fake Dudu Headpiece for some part
The only valid argument shouldn’t have been Seele color pallette but that basically from her shorts down, her legs are full on display <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Like how are they that surprised when literally just looking at Stygian Nymph and the Animation short for Seele, thats always been the consistent theme between the 2 unlike with HoO

HoFi I could cope thanks to Time Runner and HoTr makes sense for Bronya
Like if that was Veli, then yea, I would agree that it isn’t “Dark or Red enough” but this is Seele, not Veli
<:10_10Bb:769043694463614996>
Idk what people are thinking complaining about this Seele, for me, 

It definitely actually suit Seele, and the themes actually makes sense for Seele too, at least for me, this one is way better than the Trio design (mainly me malding over HoO)

But anyways, people complaining about this Seele is being dum dumb, literally the DK (Abuse Flower) made from the PE Herrscher of Death Core legit had 2 form, White Flower and Black Abyss… even with Seele, her duality with Veli is like that too, White/Blue and Black/Red… so the current coloring I see on her actually makes sense since Seele is more toward the White Flower Aspect while Veli was for Black Abyss
Ty
I only saw the models that was just the rough outline of what she looked like
Can you show me some pictures of it, I dont think I saw it yet, so I cant make my opinion of it
What happened with this? People not liking Seele’s Herrscher outfit?
So im just doing the same for Seele, like between another Psy Herrscher or actually our first QUA Herrscher, ill pick QUA Seele even if I have yet to actually pulled for any QUA Characters nor their gears in the first place
Like I would say I like HoFin or hate her even though I don't even have her in the first place
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im not, but it wouldn't change much on my opinions for Seele
<a:TeriSmash:595691400260222976>
the amount of malding I get is just
if we get another Psy Herrscher
Its why I want Seele to be QUA
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oh yea, FR, but she became a dps after her PRI came out
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
did we ever had a QUA Support Valk?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Im coping for a QUA Herrscher, because other than Mech having only 1 Herrscher, QUA still has yet to get one and Seele is usually associated with QUA
thankfully im not a tft person, im now a Project Moon Simp because the game is fun and I like their story... just malding over the latest unit though because hes very badly designed, kit effects are good but actually using him is so shit because his coin values is low AF
Hekiation
I bitch about the game once I get tired enough about it, basically its just a matter of how long it takes for the Burn-out debuff to stack high enough for me to bitch about the game

Its mainly because I simp for Hua and having both Senti and Hua getting replaced sooner or later (with AE already killed off) it made me depressed even more than normal


Makes me understand the Kallen/Yae simps where their unit are just mostly dead now, just as dead as Himeko simps
Ah
Hai Keilo
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Ishoke Elie, the problem is that even if I quit the game or people quit, it won’t stop them from bitching about the game
I knew Cyno was Sumeru but Scaramouche and Baizhu also waiting til Sumeru was pain
Didnt expect to have to wait til Sumeru for Baizhu
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Because back in 2020, I said that ill get Baizhu, Yae, Scaradouche and Cyno and thats all I need from Genshin

So I now that I finally got Baizhu, I can finally quit
I didn’t even do Susannah event so I dont even have Susannah
Because all im running on is the copium that Judah PRI and Hua Battlesuit will get released

Same thing as me quitting Genshin now that I finally got Baizhu which I was just retired/took a break til he came out
Didnt do a single MA, if that isn’t retired from Honkai and just login for basically not even my dailies, then idk what is other than quitting the game lol
Missed/Didnt do ER
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
I forgot to do Abyss last rotation too
I haven’t played the game, im legit on the brink of demoting from RL
All im doing now is saving for Hua suit and Judah PRI
I retired from Honkai so itshoke
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
No QUA Herrscher yet, so yea ima assume Seele is our first QUA Herrscher that ill skip too
other than HoR
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
wait, how many Mech Herrscher do we even have
and MECH/BIO just cope with the normal S rank Valk and no Herrscher
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
watch every Herrscher that release from now on is either Psy or IMA
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
and I hate QUA
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
My bet still is that Seele is gonna be QUA
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
At least its either the usual Spending Event Outfit (HoT, Aponia, Bkek, etc)… Pyramid Skin the patch after because they want to drain your xtals and not have it count toward spending event
I don’t remember but probably not
it ignored my request to include sarcasm
ChatGPT is too kind <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
You just block them <:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462> wait, nvm that would make you seem like the one whos close minded
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
having another S rank Mech char is also cringe when we just had Fake Dudu whos S Mech... Creature is direct powercreep for Senti in a literal sense... Psy is well <:eek:765359367524188161>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Non QUA Seele is Cringe when every single Seele battlesuit were QUA, plus, another Psy Herrscher in itself is fucking cringe
This was already shown before
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
But idk if im deciphering it right
^^^ Pretty sure they are asking if Dan Heng is using Enhanced Basic Skill 3 or his Ult
oops capslock
LMAO
my sense of time with Honkek is too distorted ngl
true
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Honestly, idk, considering Trio Herrscher and HoH was like 4 patches apart
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oh, that
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
what schedule?
now I just need actual Judah chan
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
yea, pretty much, actually, you are right, Judah chan was pob the oldest example of a broken weapon
She’ll either guarantees (as long as Boss doesn’t resist the debuff) that the enemy will receive -20% Resistance and Weakness or you only get the -7.5% Resistance because the boss was already weak to said debuff
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Shes solid, but nowhere as good as Seele or ~~Jingyuan LC~~
Yea, SW is solid unit, but we aren’t really in a situation where she is needed… she gets better when we get more characters but rn, with our limited Characters roster for Hunt and limited resources… SW doesnt have much worth rn
Pela is 30% to 40% iirc
All Single Target btw
36% at lvl 1, 45% at lvl 10
Basically its good if the boss isnt already weak to your main dps
But if the boss is already weak to said Element her skill is completely useless except for the chance of decreasing resistance to all elements
You can kinda manipulate her to apply Weakness to the Boss/Mob... 

so for example, Cocolia is weak to Fire, Qua, and Lightning, if I bring Geppy, Jing Yuan, Tingyun, SW... SW will only Apply Ice Weakness... if you use the skill again, she'll try to apply the same Ice Weakness again regardless, its good if you are using certain Hunt Characters where the boss aren't weak to it
For SW, weakness implant is both her greatest strength and her greatest weakness
His kit is unironically really good
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Luocha has everything except tankiness
Since most of SW attacks/debuffs are all Single Target
Depends, shes a solid unit, mainly for Hunt Characters ig

But unless you have Bailu, I would say Luocha has higher priorities because its Luocha
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
ngl, we basically got 1 S Rank per patch for like 6 patches straight if we decided to spread them out with the SP Valk
starting from 6.0 it was just:

S Rank HoH > S Rank Sussy > SP (Ignite Life Support that Fire dearly needed) > S Rank AE Killer > S Rank + S Rank for Trio > SP ~~Honkai Nilou~~ > S Rank Fake Dudu + SP Prom > SP Kira > S Rank HoS killer
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Unlike NA, CN players don’t get the liberty to know whos next a version early
And then you are ~~forced~~ tempted to whale for HoD
Then you become poor as HoD gets released next patch
Kira being free to farm is just there to incentivize you pulling for her gears because of 30 guaranteed like with every SP Valk… but this time with a Boss that forces to use her without any other alternatives
Now ima cope for Hua expy in HSR to be good and pretteh
Only reason I lasted this long was thanks to AE and HoS
Me, considering I have no more reason to play til next Hua suit comes out
Newer Valks nowadays are going back to just quickswap now… Prom is just QTE>Ult>Weapon > Swap

Sushang 
QTE>Weapon>Ult>Charge>Swap

Kira
QTE>Ult>Swap etc
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Tbh, skipping Prom, Kira, or whatnot will all become bad decisions… but at the same time, if you take long enough break of maybe an entire 1.0 worth of version, they’ll probably get replaced by then and become almost nonexistent because a new boss will be added that requires the new mechanics that can only be used by the new Valk
Not if you were in my bracket last time, I was in 8th because I didn’t have Fake Dudu <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
not Lightning though
best support for Fire, Ice, and even Phys
Pardo the universal support
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
they made Bleed into a Meta, before that, they tried it with Soul Link with Nyx and Mobius but was only succesful with Mobius
No if they decided to add in more Hp Loss Enemies and turn Hp Loss kit into a new meta
plus, im going for Luocha
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
Im on NA so I can sleep
Jing Yuan
After Kira, as long as they don't add another BS boss where I have to get the Valk/Build them to even be able to fight the boss, I should be fine for Hua
I have PE and Bkek so thankfully easy skip for me... I still had to skip HoFi though because I don't have enough for Gear + Valk
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
well, 3 because IMA counts as everything
Phys Bosses are now just shieldbreak or bleed, they somehow turned phys into 2 different Element too and its just depressing
true... the last time I remember a good Mech dps was SK back in early Honkek but even then she was still annoying to use because SP drain
I have Bkek so I skipped on Hare, getting Prom 4/4 was good enough for me
yea
for me, I skipped HoFi, got HoO and HoTr 4/4, but HoFi was too much for my wallet, I just want to still cope with my HoF and cope for Garuda Hua
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
tbh, it allowed me to skip Aponia so I was happy there
its so sad
she got replaced so fast
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Stop bullying my SS SW
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
they really do need CPR
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
our oldest BIO was like SW and Aponia
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yea, Garuda with new G4 to replace HoF or at least be a new Fire Alternative because we know Trio is just IMA and general BS
Oath of Sakura got a PRI while Judah chan is still deadge
its Judah chan
Divine Key PRI, for older Divine Keys like Judah's Oath or whichever one remains that have yet to get a PRI... like Black Abyss PRI
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
hell, they didn't even bother to remove Uwu SP Drain passive
yea, its my only hope rn, with the other being Judah PRI which will never happen because they forgot about DK PRI for older DK for a long time now
Kithi^
but yea, powercreep had always been a thing, its just hits harder now that it affected Hua <:despairge:1045736540875280465> because all I cared about was Hua which now that both AE and HoS is getting replaced, I lost my will
<:Balls:1003273279265570866>
honestly, them adding Hp Loss to Kira just makes me feel like that will be likely, or they will scratch that later and have like with Nyx and Mobius being the only one who linked Damages to enemies where its just that one boss with that mechanic
Now all newer Valks have Hp Loss in their kit to actually do anything
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
new mobs/boss mechanics, only takes dmg from Hp Loss skills
or yea, Hp Loss + Impair
Just Impair but translated differently
along with the usual better buffs in general
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
new Seele will prob have a shit ton of Time Freeze like Kira or Trio tbh, with better SP Regen or will be like Prom where its super quickswap... legit Prom is just QTE > Ult > Weapon > Switch
thats Ssword, lemme find her passive
yah, but im pretty sure she also provide it elsewhere
Seele will prob be like HoTr, just HoS but better
all impair sources replaces each other like Ele Breach
dentge was trolling earlier about it being different but yea, they are the same
yep
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
anyways, as for the Kira part, its just me being nickpicky because I need a reason to take a break from Honkek <:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462> so realistically, Kira was just my excuse to take a break after Trio and Susannah stuff
yea, they brought it back to Shield with Prom too <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
rude
and now Seele replaces HoS
Bronya replaces AE
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Seele is like SN but if shes actually replacing Senti
nope
Im skipping Seele though
she is indeed
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
yea
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
or Judah PRI
i'll prob come back to life once they release a new Hua battlesuit
All the more reason for me to have retired
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
no Hua makes my life sad, even if both AE and HoS were long overdue
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
So SN but if SN is HoS
considering all of Seele's suit are only QUA so far
I hope Seele is Ice QUA again so I can skip with no remorse
Kira should've been S rank to make us mald more
Ely 6.0 and Sushang 6.1 and HoTr 6.3
probably because of all the S rank Ice Valks that kept coming out
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I feel old too, I forgot Pardo was like version 5.6 and Kira is like 6.7 or something
I know, its more that I have to build and gacha for more gears once again <:despairge:1045736540875280465> Pardo and Sushang was enough, then Kira just pops up and its not even like shes like Prom or Susannah and whatnot where you can still cope without them, but you have to use them to be able to even be able start damaging the boss

though then again, I haven't checked how f2p friendly is her alternative gears
not like it make a difference at this point
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
At that point, they should change Kebin shield to Only Take Dmg to Trio and whatnot
Mihole casually making sure people want to quit Honkek ngl <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> literally cant even progress the boss without Kira is kinda <:eek:765359367524188161>
<:Kappa:524820851011616768>
Shes gonna be the new Galaxy Type
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Im so happy I retired from Honkai thanks to HSR
not surprised about seele, skin is a surprise though
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130> <:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Not to mine, Bladie being a bottom means I dun need him, because Im the one who wants to bottom smh unless you make it into a threesome
<:run:1065680602168299530>
Hua or Kosma BP pic is auto whale for me
1.2 is tempting though ima wait for one where both BP Pic are cute enough for me to get
I guess im only getting the basic bitch BP
ew
nice, is that for the next one? or 1.2... so is 1.1 Luocha and SW?
BP?
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
he now is
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
its ok, you can get teased by this instead <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> like how you get booba tease with Kebin
which is cool if its true
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
so we have Hua being both the Dragon and Phoenix
yea, tbh, ngl, when I think of Asian stuff for China, the most common mythical creature i associate with them is Dragon and Phoenix, 

the other saying being Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon
<:run:1065680602168299530>
it still says sus on there though
Dragon Hua is General and Phoenix Hua is Ambundance, which ig makes sense too
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Dragon and ~~Chicken~~ Phoenix
Wao
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Im more afraid of the in-game model more than anything
I hate it, thanks <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> showing chest but no chest booba smh
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I love how the comment is coping that Marshal Hua is Senti even though that will never be the case
At least we know Phoenix Hua is supportive, General Hua is another matter
I saw this coming but <:despairge:1045736540875280465> , it means ill prob only get 1 to E2 and maybe the other to E2 or E4… and then E6 whenever they get a rerun


Kosma Expy will be insta E6 <:YEP:815000469902065674>
Good luck, as long as they didn’t change anything, Dragon is Yukon Weekly Boss and not Cocolia
Which one? Weekly Boss or Ascension Boss… Ascension Boss is always the Element, so its just the IMA Bosses

If its Weekly, then iirc, the Dragon guy
Jingyuan is our new mc
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
namely his name, then model, then more model, then kit, then model + kit and now the cutscene stuff
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
here in this channel at least
ishoke, but like there were at least minimum like 4-5 of the 5* Dan Heng leaks
rip ig
oh it uses SP and Hp? <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Blade should be same as Arlan, Hp% cost instead of skill points
nuts
<:Sadge:842131939607183360>
but not the front
We can only see his back
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
...
close enough...
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Bailu is Qiqi

Luocha is just Coffin man
of course, my brain just stop function and just merged Gresham's message with Keilo <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
My brain was sleepy, Gresham said Luocha cracked, I just zoned out only saw your messages and assumed Gresham’s was yours
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Field last 2 Luocha Turns, so anyone faster than Luocha can spam heal more too
His AoE is the most cracked part, honestly, they already revealed his kit so idk why theres a need to say it here other than his values ig


But basically, his field makes it so that when an ally attack, they get to heal themselves, and with his Traces, it can even proc healing for other teammate so instead of self healing you get AoE team healing
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Ambundance? Nah, Ambulance characters
I just woke up
Like what Keilo said, super cracked other than the fact that his LC sucks and hes gonna be squishier than most Ambulance (which is only 2 rn)

But in return he essentially has everything, Buff Wipe, Cleanse, Free Heal, AoE heal
Theres leeks?
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Blood Voide wao
its good on SW, can be useful for others, but there are cheaper alternative
yea, there are quite of alternative options, its not like its Jing Yuan LC where its super cracked or like Kafka where it gives Break Efficiency which is a unique stats that we can't get from Relics or Bronya's that gives Energy Recharge which is also a rare stat
so thats why her Ult had higher scaling that I thought it did
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
wait, is SW Ult AoE or single target
<:KekPat:966625000339668993> support wise, it might be, but for Dmg, Welt LC should be better cuz better base stats and 24% Dmg Bonus, 24% Atk when using Skill
kinda depends since SW does have Def Shred on her rng Bug Debuff and her Ult also Def shred
theres also the new 4* LC that gives 40% Effect Hit Rate and then another 8 Energy when hitting Defense Decreased Enemies
and Support wise, we have Luka 4* LC which is 12-16% Def Shred (60-100%)

SW LC is 12% Dmg Taken Increased
its why while its good but not that worth, theres better substitutes
yep
her LC is just more Effect Hit Rate, Crate when enemies has 3+ debuffs, and the Dmg Taken increased on Basic, Skill, Ult
not really, her dmg scaling is still ok, mainly her Ult i guess, I would say no sadly
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Wording sucks as per usual i guess
Its not like Luka's eithere where its base off hit count... Luka's can be applied on multiple enemies at once, SW LC only proc once every Basic, Skill, or Ult, so at most 2 times using Basic/Skill + Ult
so rng single target Dmg Taken increase
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
on a random target
Its good but I would say its not worth it tbh, similarly Luocha LC i would say is not worth it either

They can be good but doesn’t mean they are really worth getting, since for instance, we already have Luka LC for Defense Shred

With SW, we now technically have 2 Nihility Characters with Defense Shred, but not like we use both on the same team, similarly Welt and SW LC has Dmg Taken increase but it only last 1 turn

SW LC targets a random enemy for the Dmg Taken Increase Debuff btw for 1 turn… only applies if the enemy already doesnt have the debuff
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Welt himself has Dmg Taken, his LC is just pure stats essentially
LC is just pure dmg
Character
Welt has Dmg Taken Source too
Yes it does
At that point, if you need dmg, just cope with Welt LC and if you need support, Luka LC is there with Defense Shred
Nope, its essentially just another Dps Nihility LC, only thing support about it is the Aether code that increases Dmg Taken by enemies
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
At least I know we wont have an Itto situation
True
and a bit with Hua
specifically only the coffin
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
but I still know about the coffin
I won't spoil the coffin, not like i know much about 7 sword either tbh
yea, Jingliu and Shenhe doesn't have much in common, I just say Jingliu is the closest to a Shenhe expy for Genshin just on looks alone XD
you know you'll be disappointed in the end, though ig unlike Genshin, they aren't exactly using the same character rigg for each characters so maybe its possible for actual good buffed model
just more fancy for space
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
almost 1:1 in design
lol
Like you can't say HSR Sushang and Luoocha isnt just Otto/Sushang 7 Sword expy
yea, though Hua just use it primarily for Harmony, occasional Nihility
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
im just going off a checklist with Hua now
we already have 7 Sword Sushang and ~~Otto~~ Luocha
Fenghuang Down is Illusion-based which is why she can lean towards Nihility, but it can also help with support thus also Harmony, Fu Hua herself prob lean towards that too

Old Fu Hua could've leaned toward Destruction, but with Xianzhou stuff, she's prob closer to AE/7 Sword Hua imo

obv HSR Hua will be diff but hey making assumptions can be fun like how we have SW bronya and Beloborg Bronya
Harmony makes the most sense yea
its just a meme ngl, plus, with how Hua's battlesuit/gameplay were like, Nihility/Harmony would've made more sense <:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462> 

Like they did Yae/Mei Hunt for memes too

we have yet to have a Hua expy in Genshin either anyways... Jingliu is just Shenhe expy <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
lol
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
ah yes, biweekly abyss with the same mobs but either worse or better abyss blessings
true
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Thanks, worse part was that Genshin doesn't have the same issue as Honkek cuz Honkek also has Weapon Effects which stays the same even after the skin changes, Genshin Weapon are all basically the same except for the initial model
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I forgot I left my bread in the mini oven, so now its a bit burnt, I blame Genshin for this
like even the Jean's summer skin, like ok, its the first Genshin skin, alright, whatever, but with all their other skins, you would think it would not be that hard to just change the color of the sfx while keeping everything else the same... they are even using better Engines for Genshin than Honkai whos running on a super outdated Engine rn
Darker Flames for a 5* skin is kinda... eh... <:kekhands:993771590275846245> even the Phoenix is the same basically
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I know i'm being mean, but at that point, I rather just have that Diluc skin be considered a 4* skin with sfx
like the Diluc 5* skin is just like a worse Sushang 4* B-chip skin that actually give her newer sfx anyways, like wtf <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
most of Genshin skin i've seen been very basic, and they still charge about the same amount of a Honkai skin that has Sfx to them
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
take so long to add in any skins, rare Skin W for Genshin tbh
and I hate them for it
because specifically for Genshin't they said they won't do those kind of skins
thats Honkai, me talking about Genshin't
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
ishoke, I know but I just like giving the skin a theme to seasonal stuff even when Mihole says they won't make it irl seasonal skin
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
same
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
though it looks more like is should be a halloween skin
^^^
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
That Nyx skin with the bow on her head will always make me <:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Klee bow on her head is nice, since the hat compliments it compared to Nyx <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Jingliu is more like Shenhe than Hua tbh
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
just gonna be 1 4*
So like if you use Sushang for instance, and then use Sushang Ult that gives her a 2nd normal turn, then thats 2 stacks gone already one her turns end... so for it to buff Lightning Lord, Yukong would have to go last or 2nd to last b4 he attacks so that you can keep the buff for Lightning Lord
Ulting/Seele Resurgence doesn't count as Turn so the buff remains, but any normal turn end will make her auto lose her stacks
as long as anyone turns end, she lose a stack, only exception is if they were using their Ult or Seele's Resurgence
still doesnt matter
correct
since it applies to the whole team and not just 1 ally like Tingyun
buff doesn't scale off anything because it ends in 2 turns for any ally... so if you use her, and the one going next was like March 7th or Bailu, say goodbye to one of the Stack <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
2 turns
i have a headache now
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Idk why I read this
- wao

<:huh:966619839307321394>
- huh?
90% of the reason why I haven't completely retired from Honkai like I did with Genshin is because of Hua
and soon, they trying be replacing HoS, and thats gonna make me even more depressed
<:Sadge:842131939607183360>
It is true I am losing interest in the game yea, I rarely ever get to use AE anymore, no new Hua battlesuit either
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
valid, I did clear the Susannah boss, though the malding I needed for that was unnecessary <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> I dont have MPE PRI maxed so its just gear issue there for me, im coping with PE against that boss
so for me, its not that its just started changing, but that it increasingly getting worse faster than I can adapt
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
true, I knew its been shilling since ER, but I felt like it just got even worse <:KekPat:966625000339668993> like at least back then, I felt like I can skip the unit, still bald but at least do ok, now its just if I don't have it, I can't even think about clearing it
I thought it would be like 5.5, cuz thats when new Dudu came out
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
ngl, I don't even keep track of the version anymore
like the niche boss is now not only niche but even with the Valks, its still ass to fight
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I know, but it just progressively gets even worse and more aids each time
fake Jingwei
Nah, its just a giant chicken
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
prob another niche ass boss
wao
<:bidenblast:1109118334940754001>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I was gonna make a Genshin Reference instead lol
borderline teen
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
ima say hes 12
hes prob like 14-16
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
<:eek:765359367524188161>
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
Tbh, its cursed but reminded of how my dad was like 50 years older than me
QUA and IMG are too rare rn for Hunt MC to get them, at least not with Hunt Mc
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
Im still wondering which Element Hunt mc will be, prob not Fire, Phys, QUA or IMG tbh... so either Wind, Lightning or Ice
same
ever so degen and a lost cause
Ah yes, the Room 1
focused on Dmg Reduction iirc
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
shes QUA Preservation
another lady boss
wao
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
Cuz I already gacha for the Characters I was ~~contractually obligated~~ to get
Unless they actually add in Hua
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I cant even both to get past Chasm, chances of me coming back to Genshin is nonexistent
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
he done so in the visual novel, who says he cant do it again even as a different person
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
Obviously Kallen's corpse
2nd one is stiff yea
Luocha 1st idle is nice
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
They had to even buff her to let her be even remotely useable
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
the only thing satisfying about her animation is her Ult, but most of HSR Ults are satisfying so that doesnt change much
Atk Buff thats nonexistent the less mobs there are... and dmg buff only last 1 turn after proc-ing a break
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
It doesn't help that Himeko's LC is also the most dogshit LC too
Even with all the buffs they gave her, shes barely on Serval’s level
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
She can barely even compete against Serval
Himeko is so depressing
Her damage itself is meh, but her real dmg comes from DoT
Serval is Euridition, but shes mostly for her AoE DoT dmg from her lightning debuff
DoT is Damage over Time
Asta is good 4* support
Sushang is Phys dps
Ye, Serval is good Lightning DoT
Hate her gameplay, love her lifestyle
I basically feel the same way as Neko
Thankfully I hate that part of her kit which is why I dont use her, it would be nice if using all her skill points doesnt result in it being a pointless single target basic attack
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Yep
Correct
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Soending it increase her dmg yes, but I spend it all and it just a single target basic attack because rng sucks ass
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I hate that part tbh, the AoE is nice but thats if I ever even get it in the first place… the amount of time where I can spend all my skill points and not even get a single match is just depressing
I hate using her because the tiles are BS <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Ye
Whats even good about her for you anyways <:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Oh, Welt is pretty good with Dan Heng
Same with Serval
Sushang is pretty solid
^^^
Hes solid
Lol
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I wouldnt say so, her Bug debuff is random 10% Atk/Def/Spd debuff ig, Random Weakness is ok, the issue is that its random
You get her for free so its just more Eidolon
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Asta and Yukong is nice, I dislike Qingque kit though
Im skipping that banner
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Qingque
See, I wasn’t lying when I said she basically looks like Serval in that outfit
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Dudu one just reminds me of Serval
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Ngl, they somehow made it look worse than her base skin imo
the disappearing nose
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
but did it fix his face
lol
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
L Diluc skin, slightly darker fire for all his animation... 5* skin my ass
I do too, why not make it worse by having those skin not have any actual good sfx either <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:pointandlaugh:999950395705151508>
nah, its gonna be like the EVA Pyramid Gacha, you can only pick 1 out of the 3
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
or Bronya free and the rest are paid, HoTr being the most f2p
Dudu was originally the golden goose and now Trio is paid, subverting expectation
subverting expectation
Trio paid and Dudu free
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
nah, im assuming 1 free 3 paid
tbh, I dont have HoFi, so even if its all Pyramid, I can skip at least 1
lmao Keilo
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
watch it be Spending Event, B-Chips, Pyramid, and Bingo
<@483689649727078400> ^^^^
same
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
This is in GGZ so you wont see her actual weapon sadly
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
Idol Shigure makes sense too, in GGZ, Shigure got released as an Idol too
might be Idol theme
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
yea, Summer is coming up soon so that makes sense
it is, too bad ill never get it because I dont have her
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
NEKO CHARM
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
But other than that, I dont remember much else
She also joined for one of the Honkai Fan Animation event for the music
iirc she does Song Covers mostly back then
But that was like years ago
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I know her
Lmao
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
Ill take this if its for HoO, I wonder if her Ult makes her wear the glasses instead
Yea, we have a lot of limited amount of cast at the start, so it makes sense with all the units Mihole been stock piling as shown with Luocha, Kafka and SW
2 copy would make sense for Mirror Abyss, but the question is if Im ever gonna raise more than 2 Euridition too <:deadge:975652771082698782> like how im already raising 2 Preservation
His LC do be basically Staff of Homa, its so OP, dunno if I should keep an extra copy or refine them together
I know I will get him + LC1 minimum, but im just debating if I should get more copies of him or his LC <:deadge:975652771082698782> I have to pull Luocha later anyways and suffer so I hope hes on 2nd half instead of 1st half
that way, if I do whale, ill be whaling with you
ig you'll find out once Jing Yuan banner pops up, make sure to ping me Gresham
ngl, I prob will have to whale Jing Yuan E0 and LC1, dunno if I should go for his E1 or LC2 though yet cuz I still need to go for Luocha + LC afterward... <:despairge:1045736540875280465>
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
oh ty
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
the one with Long whos dead now
Im assuming Dan Heng is going the Dragon Path, forgot what the name was though or its just going to be Hunt
thank you?
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Im sorry Lan, but im on team Yaoi
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Yaoishi is just a fangirl of Yaoi
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I didnt mute my phone so the ping kept me awake
<:run:1065680602168299530>
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Its 2 am for me rn
….
<:run:1065680602168299530>
He looks like a scam artist
Though Honkek does a pretty good job where half the time, we get different weapon animation anyways… Genshin still kinda <:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Considering they have Lightcones instead of Weapons, Mihole arent being limited like with Genshit and Honkek
Or a weird shovel
<:Kappapa:659810164873887748>
That’s obviously a Dust Pan, not a Broom
Focalor kekw
more time for me to save for Luocha ig
Good luck suffering
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I rather have Ely make Mei a pink dress than have her wear what shes wearing rn
@/prileek <a:KianaCooking2:653170566362300437>
Im assuming 1 per world, not like they cant mix the Elements and Path later, afterall, like the Equilibrium Path is actually just our World Level <:KekPat:966625000339668993> 

we might get another Preservation Path but instead of Fire its Wind or IMA for instance<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462> or its just 1 Path per Aeon's World and some world we go to will be like bonus World like with Dragonspine or Chasm
Lol
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
You gotta get impaled for the powerup ig
True lmao
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I never saw him in-game so idk
Essentially yea
Hua if I ever truly whale for anything
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
I have like 3, MC (I just simp for their clothes <:KianaDrool:652709420752699403> )

Jing Yuan (I have my reasons)

Luocha (Cuz remind me of Seven Sword LN)

At least thats for the one I know ig… For Luka, it has to depend on the Model later
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
Ishoke, for me Im fine with it

Reason why I want certain characters is due to my simping

I prefer HI3 Kafka art over HSR Kafka tbh <:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
For me, Im suffering because I’ll be pulling for Jing Yuan and Luocha and then I have to save for Hua
Basically yea
ult animation wise
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
ngl, I just thought it was M7
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
So its not even a leak
He was playable on Beta
I want Luka
lmao
For me, I want Luka, Otto, Jing Yuan

The one I want and hope to be playable is Yae, Hua, and Kosma
Makes sense… I can still pull on the limited banner and if they give any Dorm Supply Tickers, then ill pull on Standard banner ig
Nice, since it doesnt have a timer on it, I can pull for my Limited Banner Character and come back to this whenever I feel like it ig


How hard was it to get summons for you during the beta?
Waow
Thats fine
Noice
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Dont worry, I went for C6 Yae and even then I didnt even get C0 Jean
Thats nice
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Watch I fail 50/50 and get Welt, ima get so tilted
If theres no easy way to reroll, I aint rerolling ig, just pray I get Jing Yuan
Im playing way too many gacha game to bother as well
Yea, its why I dont email CS lmao
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Tbh they could’ve just added a Delete Account Data Option for rerolling if they wanted to
Fml
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Oh yea… I remember now…
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
True, they dont do guest account?
Or is it actually 1 single Summon currency now
The Standard Guarantee is never going away so I guess I can delay on it depending on how it goes…

Is the gacha the same as Genshin?
I should do the same ig
Are you gonna pull on standard for the guarantee and then go for the limited one?
Knowing Mihole
How hard you think its gonna be to reroll in the game
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Thanks…
Everytime Luke banner stuff happens, my non existent wallet screams for help 

As for Honkek, its the usual… ~~as for the other gacha’s~~ its mostly Monthly/BP stuff so ishokes
I already spend enough on ToT and Honkai… and all my other gacha games
N O
Whats worse is that I know how trash Mihole reroll system is
What great suffering ill be going through
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
His banner anytime soon?
Fml
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Ye
Guess ima be saving for ~~Otto~~ the other one, i forgot if hes in Standard Banner or not
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
Feed?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
better than Genshin's skin at least, but tbh, most cosmetics in any game will probably be better than Genshin's
Spring and Winter is nonexistent
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Cali is just Fall and Summer
<:Pikahands:973266725837623326>
weather weird in Cali
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
they are like 10-15% of my grades too
when I say overdue, some are like prob a month overdue
im doing overdue assignments rn
yea
maybe new CG showing possible new Valk
nothing is new
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Im also Tp-less so its ok
but most older players by now have SS Bkek with Abuse Flower anyways, so Hare is really for newer players or Bkek-less players
true enough
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
I know, but the context was already about Shigure being another SW, which the only thing that makes sense here would be Hare being another Bkek but for newer players
Mihole adding in new lore to them wont ever change it
we already gave them their nicknames
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
we know Tuna is Kiana anyways
Fake Dudu =/= Fake Kiana smh Dudu is a goose afterall
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
unless Mihole wants to do the new player unit rerun trend where they just essentially rerun old units disguised as new battlesuits
well, I don't think her situation can't be worse than Fake Dudu
I wanna see her use Black Abyss and White Flower
nah, we have enough range ice, shes gonna be melee Ice to replace AKA <a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Abuse Flower
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
honestly, they couldve just made the older characters that were already introduced and have them be playable but nah, Genshin Impact time <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> at least have them be APHO valks or something... 

Shigure Kira makes sense ig
as long as the Apron doesn't look weird, ill be happy
unless the weird apron is still there
its much better now
nice
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I need to sleep <:despairge:1045736540875280465> and cope
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
Lizard Maid
Wasnt that shown quite a while back ago?
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
a sticker is just a 3x3 Emote
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
it helps when we drown out chat
we truly do
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
woaw, lucky you dont have to read CN novels that spans over 1k chapters
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
read more Chinese novels
level up your shamelessness more
I just call Hotr or htr, im fine with either... though hotb makes no sense for me
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
its just nicknames at that point
<:PepePoint:857792708479680552>
no 4 letters, didnt say anything about 5 letters
no, it would just be Senti
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
we should do that
Senti2
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I was gonna type that as well but I was busy responding to another
KEKW
the usual discount pulls like with HoO, I just waiting to see how good the Stigs are... if it somehow beats Cezanne B ima have to throw hands <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Ima see how Prom plays out, kinda still sad because my poor Griseo <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:KEKW:788545502961729547>
Fuck All
^^^
But I dont want Prom to replace my Griseo <:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Be funny if the reason why made Hare Phys was so that they can add Abyss Flower V2 Hare edition
They are… my 4/4 SS HoR, 4/4 SS SW, and 1/4 HoHe suffered so badly when Sushang and Pardo dont have their Stigmata… Sus got better now but Pardo still suffering
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
No, I just mean its like we are getting another Dudu

So in a joking way, I could say Dudu is a Shariac and Hare is also a Shariac technically, and we had Dudu for Bkek, Dudu for PE, and now another Shariac when she’s starting out is now gonna be Phys too

We going back to Dudu Impact
Kekw
Tbh, its most likely slight vfx change or none at all… its just the event Stigmata finally getting their skin version which is ok for me
Hare leaked to be Phys kinda made me mald a bit… its legit just another Dudu at this point
Yea
Unlike all the other recolor, this one made the most sense for the color fitting with the characters
Pardo BP is unironically really nice recolor
As shown when I circle the specific part that made me hate it <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Its ok, but the front side for Ai-chan outfit makes me hate it
Thank god
Oh, I dont need it then
Wasnt S rank usually the Spending Event?

Or is it the other spending event one like Haxxor and Pardo
Yea, its definitely free skin, since even the Hands are the same for the most part
Im happy for that
They finally made the HoT Stigmata a skin, pog
it literally couldve just been an actual separate piece of clothing
like the fuck is this shit
weirdest mismatch I see
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
thats ugly ngl
waow
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
C1 Faruge who ill never use either because I dont use any Anemo outside of Scara who I use for movement
I only like the monocle
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
bald roboto
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
Dazai Osamu?
no 3rd one?
Kekw
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I believe so, but i cant be bothered to remember who or which one they were talking about
I love how the leakers keep on contradicting each other
kekw
also, not like hes the only one who buffs only the active char... even Nahida does the same with her A1... many supports with some exceptions just really only buff the Active char <:deadge:975652771082698782>
that idk, maybe for his E, but Im sure his Burst heals way more than Yaoyao

shield is just there to act as a buffer for interrupt resistance, if it break, it heals and deal dmg to apply Dendro... my only concern is the shield icd for applying dendro and his energy issue without Nahida or another Dendro <:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462> 

A2 prob need to last longer but Genshin sucks ass at making support buff ever actually lasting long enough <:deadge:975652771082698782> A1 is the one that needs the rework/buff the most
Im happy with Baizhu, hes the dendro healer I needed tbh
that is true under certain condition <:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462> but thats really for buff wise ig, I want his A1 buffed or reworked tbh
Ye
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
“Not worth the ping” *proceeds to ping anyways*
lmao, oof, I dont have the illiterate emote and gacha player emote
I wanted to play as Kebin with the bat
occasional buff
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
its always v2 nerf and then v3 is more nerf, a buff or both
....
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
ill still play it for Hua and Judah chan, ive been on Judah copium since forever with my 6 (originally 8) Judah's Oath
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
yea, I had so much hope with HoTR and then everything after just went downhill for me
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I really do hate this act for the most part
new mc, Kebin
essays on Friday, Essays on Sunday, Quiz on Monday, essays on Wednesday
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
same, but for me its every week on friday, sunday and wednesday and monday
I was just going along with the Augment joke
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
oh, I know Time Runner was referencing Finality, its why when they showed HoFin, I wasn't as weirded out against the outfit

Since even the costume description was a reference to it
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
im still annoyed over HoO, gib me skin to replace her base one already, I know Ely shouldn't make bad clothing decision so why does HoO get bad clothes
uglier augment while also removing bella yes

and that definition applies to HoFin as shes just an augment of Time Runner outfit
booli someone else instead
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
are you trolling me Keilao
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
its as dead as Dorm and A rank Valks
Hawk of the Fog, Delta, etc
Augment is old mechanic wdym
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
watch Teri  be CH Augment/Awaken or something
Seele tease doesnt count
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Other than Hua/Teri, HoTR is fine, the rest feels meh for me
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
no no
double Teri suit
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
im saying Teri will just be Teri + APHO Teri later
its gonna be Hua solo with APHO Seele/Teri next
same with Teri
watch the seele teaser was for APHO Seele
couldve been better too
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
weak cgs
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
I dont have HoFin, and I dont have her gears, and im pretty sure I drained all my luck after pulling 4/4 HoO in 3 multi
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
tbh, ill prob skip HoFin and get her Pyramid skin instead, then cope til new Hua/Teri
pretty
<:eek:765359367524188161>
even worse when its not even meant to be at 60 frames because its like they placed that sht in 5x speed going at 1x speed
this shit is the worse, my eyes hurt trying to watch any of that sht tbh, I rather just look up the anime to skip directly to the opening/ending
I want Baizhu drip already… cuz after getting Baizhu is when i can truly retire from Genshin
Lol
til the next time they feel like adding in Bleed which will be taken by Bkek or PE
and then 0 times after
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
3S Coatl that's as shit as fighting 3S Bella
ima mald if that happens
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
and wake up to copium well knowing that ill skip most patches til Judah PRI and Hua reveal
anyways, its late for me, i prob should sleep now
<:KEKW:788545502961729547>
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
skin
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I did say event Susannah
have Susannah synergize with Griseo
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Qua Bleed Weather
tbh, everytime its an A rank Valk, i always assume they are SP anyways
if they can release triple Herrscher, they can make Sussanah SP
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
you know that any A rank Valk is usually dead unless they are SP anyways
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
oh, I dont care about War Treasury tbh, but with Sussy being WT, Hua being WT is prob impossible, gotta milk the CN playerbase with their Phoenix afterall
whats WT valk?
yee
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Kebin a booli, I still need to do the story, been busy

Event Susanah <:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462> <a:NodBb:561613076844249130> or Flopsanah because we would have to farm her normal fragments since only SP Valk has the fragment shop (excluding Witch Shop) and not having SP Skills do suck a lot... our last A rank I remember too was Raven and she flopped badly in terms of being sht to play
and raining bombs
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
most likely SP Susanah, with the Gather like what she did during Arc City
shes came back from the grave as a new suit
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
it took til Herscher Bronya to properly kill AE afterall
be relevant for another 2 years like HoS and AE
stronger AE
shes gonna be the Dps that buffs everyone
Hua gonna be dps tis time <a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
I'll also be waiting for APHO 3 Seele and Teri
yea, I know, but I still need to save for Teri so with all this info, its easy skip HoFin for me
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
from Hua Stig to stronger Hua Stig
Hua suit + Hua G4 Stig, makes sense for G3 Stig mats to be Margrave
<:KEKW:788545502961729547>
same
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
ill take that, I have like 2 full set of Marg
Margrave <a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
I miss Judah chan... and yea, G4 Fire will save us
only reason I used Teri b4 was because of Judah chan
I'll take that
unironically, I kinda agree with this, her battlesuit looks like GGZ Kallen for clothing
just long hair
any kind of Judah PRI is a win
Teri gives me hope for Judah PRI
I prioritize Hua and Teri
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Hua Suit... I see Fire, I skip Finality, yay
it doesn't affect me at all since I play only with CN/JP va anyways <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
Once the Flame Chaser comes to HSR and Kosma becomes playable, ill make HSR my new home
true
lmao
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
Ew, Genshin ui
Its really nice ui
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Artifacts/Equip banners
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I wished he was healer so that I could use him in a Yae, Ning, ZL, Dendro team or something... but ig a Razor/Cyno team will work too... now my hope is that his Dendro uptime is good enough
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
so why the shield
E providing a heal with Q being Changsang coordinate attack wouldve made more sense tbh
tis sad, we got the Snek, we got the Catalyst, but we missed the Doctor part <:kekpalm:901574024830791690>
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Garuhua
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
SA got replaced by Carole just to be replaced by Griseo
and thats true too
you just make HoS powercreep HoS
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
anyways, im prob ignoring the HoS powercreep if its Seele since so far, ive skipped every Seele/Nyx battlesuit... and it seems quite hard to powercreep HoS that easily tbh unless they add in longer buff/debuff duration or stronger buffs
they trying to replace Pardo like how they replaced Fischl with HoTr?
we have Pardo and Sus... <:deadge:975652771082698782>
Ice SP, that was fast
they did the same with Nahida too iirc
Why do they always gotta nerf the cute animation
FUCK
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
since at least I can justify pulling a unit not just for their looks but for their kit as well... or else ill just pull them to only use them for 1 patch and never again... (basically a good chunk of my char i dont even use anymore... ie Hu Tao, Raiden, Cyno, Childe, etc...) and my team was still 

Razor, Qiqi, XQ, Flex... Ning, ZL, Yae, Bennet
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
ngl, I rather have powercreep over shitty character kit design
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Kokomi definitely was the first... tbh, for Dehya, with how much hp they gave her, just change her dmg scaling to Hp% like Kokopium and at least a decent chunk of her dmg will be solved
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Genshin devs are just <:huh:966619839307321394> lately with Dendro Kekqing and now Dehya
Imagine having worse dps than even Xinyan, thats a new low, and they want to cope that she’ll be a dps <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:cattoblush:675924852598636544>
hes so cute
<:huh:966619839307321394>
no, its actually can chan with fish
HoT with Can-chan plushie
<:cattoblush:675924852598636544>
Kebin
Ooooo
I know that, I didn't know the bleed also stop for your teammate thats off the field as well though
you just bleed out while casting any i-frame skills too yea, so your team will still bleed to death on the sidelines
if you're unlucky, you just die before Diona, Bennet or other field healer can drop their heal circle for the heal to save you
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
yea, and unless you have Barbara, Jean, Kokomi or Qiqi, you're usually fucked cuz the bleed affect your whole team, not just the one on the field
im just talking about rifthound bleed in general since im pretty sure their bleed dmg is based off max hp <:deadge:975652771082698782> and yea, she can mitigate up to 50% of the dmg taken by the ally on the field by up to 200% of her max hp... 

and when shes on the field, she'll take that dmg over the course of 10 second
tbh, most of genshin combat isnt that rewarding at all
<:kekpalm:901574024830791690>
tbh, the more hp she has, the more fucked she is when fighting rifthounds with bleed
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
new tank character in Genshin when everything is just a dps check or a element check
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
same reason her weapon giving Hp for no reason as well
and for SP, its the SP Fire Support that everyone wanted for Fire to be relevant again too because Fire was so scuffed without an ignite support valk, and its our first SP Fire Valk too
soon we'll have to add in APHO too
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
what a way to start the year
yea
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
especially with APHO prob being around the corner too
same, triple herrscher patch, then pyramid gacha kinda too much
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
too bad its prob Pyramid Gacha and I aint ready for that
pretteh
Oooooo
<:kekhands:993771590275846245>
Mika idles is very cute, Dehya is just the normal stretches and ig make-up
For an end game content which is still just Abyss that is usually always bias toward the newer unit… which ngl is prob even worse than Honkai Bosses for me <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
It just feels like I am making my characters 1% stronger with 1 more flat attack every 3 month of grinding the same domain just to have a new character with new artifact domain that is a 1% dps increase from the old one for you to farm
Its like self powercreep for nothing
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Tbh, for me, no matter how many new unit they add, the combat still feels like sht and theres still no proper pve end game
The Pen indeed is mightier than the sword, for it can let me shoot my gun
Its just gonna be a Catalyst user with a gun
We already have guns in Genshin, just only our enemies has them, same for fat characters, only fat enemies and fat npc
With all the unskippable dialogue that kinda made me tired too
I just kinda quit the game during Chasm
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
Too burnt out by the game, especially the combat
I dont even play Genshin anymore
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
I want Mika but hes a 4* and there’s no 5* i want rn except Baizhu and that Robinhood lady
<:chorry:966005898013192203>
Basically like how Raiden is polearm but pulls out a sword during burst
Mika uses a spear and crossbow
halo and everything
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
2nd to last pic just looks like 11th PRI
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
im sick and tired of open world already
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
looks like more giant hands to beat up
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
why
but that face
that fucking smile
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
that should be an emote when we can actually share it without getting in trouble
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
I dont care about the other part, but tf is that head
Wtf is that clown shit
<:pepepoint:887695198577127474>
No, cuz it was Phoenix Hua
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
When even Owl has a presence in HoO stig more than Hua for Kiana
Yea, at least with Hyperion and Siberia, I can reference Sirin… but no Hua is kinda bummer
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Tet already spotted Himeko on their 3rd sentence
Its prob went like this:
T Piece - Tuna/Saint Freya Arc with the Siberia Tower

M Piece - False God Otto Arc with PE Dudu, SpA, and Sus, and slight callback with HoF + Himeko inherit the flame… wished Hua was included in T piece at least
?
my fav one is the last one
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
so pretteh
<:cattoblush:675924852598636544>
Ah
What?
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Connection is key
<:sex:1055894548754219070>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Chainsawman collab with Makima
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Whats next, Galaxy is weak to all Type except Galaxy?
^^^
Also, wtf is a Galaxy typing
Especially with QUA and IMA still lacking
^^^ a new typing doesnt make sense
^^^
new type and 3 new suit? right after the trio, sounds sus
yea
<:huh:966619839307321394>
...
tero3 is Judahchan
its not a Judah PRI server, i aint joining
cursed server
<a:catpov:751440913066098819>
<:tero3:1016476690194628740>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I dont even know what is teriteri server
HFI set iirc
Owl my other child, me like the HoT and Kiana, Ely is event so its nice in general
<a:shotobongotap:1135611530356981911>
that would've taken me the whole day tbh because im a slow bitch, and it won't even look great... anyways, its super pretty
one was just Kosma
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
nice, I need to make an OC sooner or later, too bad most of them are inspired too much by others
I suck with digital drawing so I went old school hand drawn stuff
its not finished but whatever
turned out better than expected, but I dont wanna color it
Decided to doodle Summer Chibi Kosma but without the horns and googles
Cuz school assignments and im like, why not
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
I love that every time I update the launcher, my game travels back in time to version 4.8
tf
....
actually, was gonna ask what you've done to anger the Minecraft god but then I remember all of us are prob going to hell anyways
Tet...
....
yee
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
I still haven’t done any of the Hi3 story so im 100% lost here
Yippe
Vita is Rita but with a V instead of R <:derpostasis:834561554858770513>
3
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
I love that Yae they gave her tower 60% more range but it only target the nearest enemy
I hate it, it makes me depressed
Not only do we have 4 slots… most buffs last for like nonexistent duration and swapping to them also takes 10 years
For me, its to have scuffed kits that makes no sense other than so that they can add in newer characters that does the same thing but better or worse


So like with Ningguang using her Ult, but like 10-20% of her attacks just staright up miss because they were to close to the ground and thus shatters before they can even do anything 


Or Yae’s Totem targeting the nearest enemy and not the active enemy you’re targeting even though Furina, Fischl, and other summons can do the same thing

<:deadge:975652771082698782> but most are also kinda innate issue like Elemental Reaction system being poorly optimized
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
Sounds about right Keilo
Lmao

I like having my units be strong even if theres no pvp

Because I don’t want to feel shit playing said character
Well, Anemo is alright

Dendro is good

Geo is sad because Geo as a whole suck

And Electro/Hydro is the most copium you can get as a kit
…
Me too Eli
Nah, cuz Hydro MC ans Electro MC were both shit from the moment they came out,

Only Dendro MC was actually remotely useful or good in any way
At least for combat non story related, all the traveler are shit except for like Dendro
Lmao
Oh thanks
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Which server did you get it from
Ngl, where tf did this emote even came from
Heck even more 10s and 20s dollar bills wouldve nice
<:depresso:1159828653413249086>
And my mom was too pepega to just give me 100$ Bills instead
For $300+ Dollars because the Kiosk cant accept multiple bills at once
So I was just sitting there… inserting 1$ bill 1 at a time
I went to the DMV today to pay for my mom’s Car Renewal… Went to the Kiosk, opened up her mail that also contained the cash she gave me to pay for it… proceed to see that more than half of them were 1$ Bills
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
well, I know passed my ART History and and MKT Class... im only having anxiety about my Internship and Econ Class
<a:shotocheer:903862092036198460>
Yippe
congrats
ty cherry, it was joever though
good luck, this week is my Finals
At least I finished the event
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Now I have to wait until next year
I was only 40 pulls off from getting his last copy
<a:cry_kayo:728701346332672131>

thats quite true
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
<:derpostasis:834561554858770513>
as in characters that aren't total side character/npc dying
ummm... i guess people dying?
Im over here thinking of the outline I have to write for my Finals thats happening in 12 hours
<:depresso:1159828653413249086>

Finals ain't treating me well enough for this
yea, there are so many stig I would want, but Im still burnt out by HI3rd, I'll prob come back for Hua so that I can get her 4/4 and to SS if possible
<:JingYuan_Sleep:1084670039485071361>
I love it too but im on my break still so ima have to skip it sadly
🕳️

<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
missing all the good stuff
Me backreading all of this
because if we look at AE, it shows her at low CC even though she had at least 2 CC skills
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
apparently not as according to Eli, some with high CC/gather were ranked low and vice versa
its joever
restart your run
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Pray for my Wallet please
Its so Joever for it
<:TeriDerp:973794594787590154>
if I could, I could prob ransack Chasm, Sumeru and Fontaine and easily get enough
can't even farm anything
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
me with Finals so I have to skip her
<:RazorRead_Devonxy:892368679411515392>
When HoTr lifespan gonna be less than AE <:PepePopcorn:801534993687511080> just kidding, she'll still prob live for a while
Im the Garlic one
hewwo Carv
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<a:shotobongotap:1135611530356981911>
<@704867526877904908> oh yea, ping me whenever you plan to play so I can join ig... I'll just prob be listening to some ASMR and doing school stuff in the meanwhile
But after Finals, because I have too little time outside of random games to play with fwiends
I should start crafting G4 Fire tbh
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
And it will prob remain that way for a long time
I have her hut shes like 0/4 because I was taking my break from the game still
You guys bothered to build Sirin?
<a:worryramen:967581731395870770>
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
I just went to get In N Out and I come back to Furry Porn… wao
I got no access there
ishoke, its the same for me too
<a:pat:717159864891342848>
wao
all 3 are sibblings
yea
Goofy ah fight
I just read it, it really is peak lmao

Wild ass fight
i am yes
2-3 weeks left until Finals and I can cry then die
good luck... I have to apply for internship next semester because I realized there is one I can do but the application is due in like 4-5 days
CATTTTTT
<a:shotobongotap:1135611530356981911>
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I believe in you, I am similar in that aspect too... it worse for questions where I just studied the answers and then my brain went blank on it though
but its useless for characters like XL since the Fanfare buff won't buff Pyronado after it was casts
when you lose/gain hp, you get Dmg Bonus and Incoming Healing Buff, applies to the whole team so anyone off field will get the buff... so extremely good for characters like XQ or Yae who's dmg is off field and they can't snapshot their dmg
too bad I still use my 4* one
I guess its thanks to the mods that allowed motivated me to use older 5* characters <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
like all I wanted was a nice dress or suit but I just see horny one... but then again, thats Genshin for you ig, bunch of horny teens
Ngl, I wished there were more male mods... I also wished there were more tamed females one... there are so many NSFW one and they aren't even good <:despairge:1045736540875280465> half of them are like nudity
Her particle gen is almost as nonexistent as ZL Pillars <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
When Genshin is too lazy to add in cosmetics that the modders had to do it themselves
<:shxtouPancakes:892987466447994900>
ty
Where do ya'll get your mods?
neither do I, but since its prob not breaking any serious rules, I guess we are good
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I forgot if we'll get in any trouble for this, it prob doesn't matter right as long as we aren't messing with the game dmg numbers and whatnot im assuming
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
They just didn’t wanna update the ratings
The rules weren’t as strict back then too considering back then, even on YT, you can play games without having yo censors things like Panties from Yandere Simulator and hentai could even be found on YT
Yea, ngl Im also surprised about GGZ rating too
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Magic of Old game I guess, they are all too distracted by Hi3, Jenshin and HSR and ig ZZZ soon
purely as a form of love for my Hua
congrats, don't worry Cata, I'm still waiting for the day I can SSS my AE
nothing appeals to me more than muskeet and flintlock pistols... and Scythes ig
ngl, I would get her, only for the gun
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
Nah, Brick is just that good
Brick Active skill gives like 20 SP when outside of Burst Mode
Im im Sinful rn so none of this matters for me
Lmao
Oh
Prob SP?
Also free all day for me too
<a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620>
thats fine, study well
nah nah smh, the real important phys dps is none other than B<:KEKW:720670047718080592>
<@516591030326525983> <@704867526877904908> I'll prob be doing something else in like 7 hours, but before then, I'll prob be free to play... but i'll prob be free all day tomorrow
make it easier on yourselves?
should we join VC?
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
?
lemme restart the game and ill try again
rn I was benchmarking my game to see how it run
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
so do your things
and restart the game and whatnot
thats ok, its a good time for me to change my settings
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I got disconnected
cuz ill have to grab my headphones if we do
well later ig
should we just join in discord VC or something?
not to die
thats a very hard task you gave me
im fine both ways
my laptop will be cooked, but it can should be able to run the game, dunno if playing on Mouse and Keyboard is better than Controller though
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
but ishoke
I also didn't know I have to restart the game if I wanted to set the new setting changes
I know jack shit about the game
nope
I know nothing about the game
ishoke Hak
LMAO
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
my game is still stuck in the loading screen... nvm, just as I typed it, it stopped
literally any Ambundance Chara that has a cleanse auto powercreep Bailu because thats just how useful Cleanse it
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
The only reason Bailu is now as shit as Qiqi is because she has no Cleanse, if she had any cleanse, it would've kept her relevant, but like Nat, Lynx, Luocha, and soon Huo Huo will just replace her so easily
So no Bailu, Clara or Yanqing... I've only been tainted by Clara Lightcones because I got 2 of that and still no Clara
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I have yet to be cursed with any 5* Child
Geppy is pogger

Forgot Senti Weapon was today
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I forgot to update Hi3, so I have to wait who knows how many hours on my slow internet
I love updating to the new version, this Luna Kindred really look similar to someone else... hmmm....
which one do I buy? <@704867526877904908>
oh wait, its is on Sales
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
If its on Sale, I would get it, but I haven't noticed
Good luck there Heki
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I have no rizz, so impressing them is impossible
Rose Gold is pretty
but that just means an equal amount of Copium is now generated
thats a lot of Hopium
Ugo went insane and had dementia, so probably not
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Alibaba does have the rizz for the muscled women and men
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
He stole Morgana's first kiss iirc
honestly, once Ren became an edgy boi, he prob stopped loving Morgana <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
in the end
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
they did
Shut it, I like Ren
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
Yep, but thats just gacha gamers for you, reading comprehension 0
better than KR playerbase, ngl, I can't tell which of the two are more toxic
<a:shotocheer:903862092036198460>
Wrio in 13 pulls
Im even guaranteed for if I decide to pull for Wrio C1 or wait for Clorinde/Furina
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
I wonder if a powercrept Aqua would be a worse or better cook
Doesn’t help that I know like at least 2 other Aqua that are chill
Too bad im not there for the Aqua cooking
True
My brain just kinda removed him from my mind so other than the fact that he’s the reason why we’d square up because of him, I dont even rmb much about anything else
Well, tbh, i was very neutral about him, I just actually didn’t care about him whatsoever <:PiKek:973573411911659540>
He wasn’t a good cook and way too cringe
Well, he was one of the reason I stop caring to interact in WFP in the first place other than the mods there so yea
though ig im just as surprised with the actual server ban though for Hi3
honestly, when Carv said Dia got banned, I thought he meant in WFP at first, but then I realized how incompentent those guys are considering how wonky their ban and warn system are
<:gayge:1009087290099904552>
oh, nice nice
what game is this?
prob never
never thought there would be a day where we finally see Dia gets banned
How long has it been?
<:shxtouPog:892987459003117628>
alright, ty
yea, I can get it if its on Sales, I can also get it if you want too quickly, ig Gres haven't bought the game yet either?
ishoke Tet, you'll live, even if our human bodies are built to essentially elf destruct
I don't think I have it sadly, and for Epic Games, I don't really want another Game Store... did Gres bought it? I can prob buy the game too if you want me too <:despairge:1045736540875280465> Im just wondering if Steam and Epic Game are crossplay
World War Z? I don't think I have the game, is it free on Steam?
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
…
thank you
Thank Carv, the Fire Hua prediction will hopefully bring me back when it becomes true
<:shotolurk:892985948382576740>
Called you old and compatible with Superpowa people
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
🤓
how generous of them
1280 genesis crystal but you only get 980 xtals back
Yikes forever
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Why doesn’t she like it? To me its all the same
When I am water, I am compatible but when Im Ice im on Gresham side
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Better skincare than what I could ever do too
Its very nice
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Apparently I become a Fairy if I decide to do the opposite of all my Ice Options
<a:shotobongotap:1135611530356981911>
Oh, my water personality is compatible with Tet
Ishoke
<a:gf_pat:1077167310219006012>
Dont worry Gresh, I’ll be Ice and Water with you
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Ice and Water
Ishoke, this one is neutral at least
Well, actually, the no logic part makes sense, I have no logic
I think I have to retake this
<:derp:724856219600289853>
Where?
<:draculaT:814619077489852448>
Still at chasm though
They really did improve the story a lot after Inazuma which I am happy for
Muwi is like mono water team that basically turn your team into turbo speed team
since most bosses have fat amount of hp
For Epic 7? well, its a 3* Artifact and each hit you do with it is like extra 3% max hp as dmg... like you can go from doing like 2k dmg with it to like 10-11k
like if you're doing Wyvern 13, a mid 5* Muwi (with high eff hitrate at least) + built Sigret with Daydream Joker makes everything so much easier
<@704867526877904908> oh yea, for Epic 7, I forgot to mention this if I already haven't, but this Artifact is probably the most strongest pve Artifact in the game... its a 3* Artifact called Daydream Joker and you can give it too any of your dps or fast support dps... at max level it does like 3% of the Boss Max Hp as dmg everytime you attack with it
The proc is quite low for lower rank, and you’ll want it on ranger that specializes in debuffing because enemies can also resist the debuff
But if your team doesn’t have Def Debuff character, then its very good
I have that too, its pretty nice, sadly, most team characters has Def Shred in there so it might not be as strong, but it can be good for general QoL runs due to it just being straight up free Def Debuff
Prob Feira, Ran, Zahak or Lua, so Feira though she does have stricter gear requirements, same for Ran…. They are both Pvp/Guildwar characters… i just realized most 5* characters are just pvp characters… the pve one are usually the 4* and free characters
Thats fine tbh, at least that way, I can see who you already got
Shes a pvp char, I don’t think you’ll need her, which 5* do you have already
I really want to play again because of Hua though
I keep on forgetting to log into Hi3, same for Genshin <:deadge:975652771082698782>
never seen it but I know about it
Anyone want to play on my Genshin’t account and grind the events for me <:deadge:975652771082698782>
I just want Wrio/Clorinde
😭
most of the 5* I pulled, I don't even use
I don't even use Wanderer outside of overworld either though
true
cuz Ning's dress changing to blue means MoD looks uglier
if you want to have fun, I pulled for MoD back when Copium Shaper was on rate up, I got 2 Copium Shaper and an Aquila Favonia before pulling it so that I can give it to Ningguang well knowing ill never use it
nope, I don't even use my lvl 80 C1 Childe
I have a spare Skyward Atlas/Lost Prayer for them
thankfully, I don't have to pull for anymore Catalysts
I wished I was
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
like I don't even use any bow characters anymore, you can kinda see how much I even bothered about them
I know but I don’t want another Bow for my nonexistent bow characters
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Shit combo tbh, since I really don’t want whatever was Venti Bow on the weapon banner
Wrio + Venti
<a:MEGASADGE:828478281140535317>
Herrscher of Reasonable Russian?
<a:shotobongotap:1135611530356981911>
Just Pick both
I dont like Eichi, because he was mean to Shu, I like Valky and Subaru, Rabbits are also very cute
Rosemi?
All the people in my Lobby were using HoFi and whatnot, so fighting a Bio mob with Psy is depressy
I dropped down this Abysss
Crown on Glory is only good in Real Time pvp, Noble Oath is decent ig

Rem one is ok, only useful thing about it is the stats and Crate, you can ignore the Voraz one ig, the Alencinox one is like the Rem one, good statstick and sometime passive
you should just limit break the Ram one tbh
yea, its a 4* one, it depends on the healer but its usually that and like the Debuff Cleanse 4* one
anyways, Magahara's Tome is just too good, most 5* Artifacts are niche/useless unless its on their signature character
<a:Y_KEK:792821099062362122>
I keep saying the same thing because gold fish memory
Goblet is niche, only useful in Pvp and only a few units/Thief can actually make use of it (cuz I also have it <:deadge:975652771082698782> )

same for the 2nd Thief one, basically those 2 are really good on the units you see in the image (so their signature gear)

the first one is best as a signature one, same as the other 2 but at least this one is slightly less niche ig
<a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620>
oh, I think we can add each other then
nice, which server are you on anyways?
Got it
Is there a time limit to the selector? Once I get home from my field trip that I have in like an hour for like 5 hours, ill try finding any decent Artifact for you to pick


At least one that works at Base and doesnt need refinement
We are suffering now
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
They aren’t wrong
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Note that I have outdated knowledge
Which 5* are available?
Oh congrats, Politis was pretty good for Pvp back when I used to play, not sure if the Meta has changed or not though
<:TeriMald:973795215045455872>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
ok, so its my browser
I need to see if YT short is deadge on my laptop
I'll prob use it when you make her into a 6* only because it gives imprint buffs for dupes ig... for Light lady idk because I took a long break from the game, fire lady was super OP but they nerfed her so I can't say how strong she is now
I also remember losing my account and then starting a brand new one afterward
Ive played E7
You just gotta take a break from the game and they'll try to tempt you back with Xtals
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
this was from like last patch when I forgot to ever refresh it
yay...
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
anyone want to use my Hi3 account to farm Abyss/ER
I has no water
save me
malded so hard on that shit
got cucked from using HoT on Kosma but instead on BKEK, and then forced to use HoH and Bronie and that was actually hell
I was so tilted
so I couldn't use HoT on Kosma
because the other boss was BKEK
same
and most QUA Valk are either outdated AF or scuffed to use anyways
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
me who uses them on QUA Bosses because I don't have a single proper QUA Dps
I don’t even have Kira though tbh
Sp nonexistent
No Sushang glove is like not have Neb Duality on AE
Very bad
Welcome to Hi3 where we mald for 1 more point in MA and Abyss
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
Lmao
She was, at least for CN because of GGZ as well, similar to how Sin Mal is actually also quite popular in CN even though shes nonexistent in Hi3 now
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
They are trying to retain me via other means but all I cared about was the artbook
and thats by like Friday at the earliest
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
This is so fucked, this week, I'll only be able to get up to 1410
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Guess ima be fucked
me realizing I have to clear 39-2 to start farming the 2k and 4k+ Moonstone bs
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Im assuming I can replay the story like with Ely Everlasting
time to skip all the story because I didn't catch up to any of the previous chapter and don't wanna spoil myself and be more lost than I need to be
yea, that was who I noticed other than Jinyang
lmao
Nini and someone with no name
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
true, but then again, im just a boomer who forget that even existed
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
self deprecation time
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
tbh, if I had let either of those 4 play on my Account, I prob could've gotten the Artbook by now
samesies, if I were to cope, at most maybe Taihen, for Gres, Nini and Tet, I would love to let them play on my Hi3 account if it wasn't it also linking to Genshin and HSR and ToT... honestly, I don't actually care for who plays on my Genshin Acc either, so really just HSR and ToT im worried about lol
ngl, I would let someone else play on my Hi3 accounnt, but I always get anxiety <:KEK:1024468566835204137>
congrats on the last piece
so you would be on the last wave with the last mob but lost because you didn't have 5-10 more seconds
for a first timer, you should be able to clear the first few waves before running out of time
troll, thats too high for a first timer but also too low
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Honestly, I no longer appear in WFP nor any other maincord except occasional one
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
its bad for your skin afterall
one of my problem is 100% sleeping late
same
<:A_HuTaoHug:803337298476400690>
thank you Cata
one day, rn first thing first is coping over the Vol 2 Artbook, the fact that I have school tmr, and then also finding a part time job
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I need to learn how to work out but also skincare ig
I need to know how tf he keeps his skin so beautiful
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
people do change, now im into a Vtuber named Shoto after YT decided to gib me a bunch of his shorts
<:BronyaStare:895020665915207720>
so I just follow the usual set pattern
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
its  hard to like the unliked person because for me, its just sometime both person
I just kinda lag out sometime
also, ishoke, I for some reason have a habit of liking the one to the right of me, and if im on the right, then its the next right, thus left-most person
I played the game back in JP but also when Sakura Open World wasn't even a thing yet
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
i thought I was the only one that got that
it was weird
idk
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I know, but for HSR and Genshin, I can set your name as Cata to make me less confused
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
they gotta let me do nicknames
im just not used to the name
nvm, I do have Cata added
100106976
I know I have Gres added, I don't think I ever added Cata, lemme grab my id
inv me, forgot if I have Cata added
alright
soul throne?
which DK?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I cry each time I look at this though
ok, lemme get on
most of the time, I just help out with raid if people ask for it, but I usually don't do them because I forget they exist
but ill join
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
if you want to know I havent done a single raid since like way b4 Ely realm
rn? thought raid reset on Monday
when
?
always had
yea
now I just filthy whalao
I was still f2p while AE was there, even got her Pyramid Skin as f2p
I lost my f2p status during Senti run
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
School funds usually ends up being the least of my concerns and its actually my Car/Gas funds thats the issue
til then, me can't fund myself for much
and I have school mats to gather
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I would say I could top-up for you but then realized I no have funds rn... spent too much money on my nephew and nieces
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
I take that over scam Yoimiya splash art rope vs actual in-game rope
i need artbook farming help
I guess I can go for Vol 3 next year ig
Half the Books are gone, and my chances are Abyssmal, but at least I can try anyways
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
I just gotta hope that Glb players sucks ass and take too long to grind shit
I guess I can only go for the 3k one
Fml
How much can you get in a day?
But how long?
Also, how long does it take to farm 7k Moonstone thingy?
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Rip, I need to do mine too, cope I get to RL before all the Books are gone
<:huh:966619839307321394>
If I had started at least a week earlier, I prob would've had a better chance, rn, even if I made it to next week, I'll still be at 1340-1400, 100 off from 1500
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
For Artbook event, just ping me even if I am taking a break from the game, I want to be able to get the Merch
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
and no one told me
<:huh:966619839307321394>
btw when did this event even started
I guess I should've been active an playing Abyss, but I really just can't bother with how burnt out I was from the game
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
not sure if I can even get the Book b4 its all sold out
Im feeling despair
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
We cant type shit
Its on Read only
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
You didn’t give us chat perms
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I prob got demoted all the way to the bottom
Wait how much do you get from Abyss?
<a:PepeLeave:828024366632534036>
<:Cringe:975612628779024434>
absolutely not, but Heki did profit once and I cri inside
I love you Heki but the Heki moments needs to be on a break
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im taking my proper Hi3 break and here Heki doing the opposite
<a:Bbreathe:567592614669582346>
<:eek:765359367524188161>
I don't want to be reminded that new Seele is there to kill my HoS
I am taking my Hi3 Break, why rub salt on me with Kekle
...
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I love Hua, I keep on forgetting whos the one who hates her
I still have the Kithi one
<:A_HuTaoStareIntense:899444164570267648>
hmmm...
ah yes, Carb, out special leaker
yea, this is basically my few month break from Honkai cuz of burn-out...

I did something similar during the Raven/Bianca part with Owl/Ice Herrscher Ice, so I missed that story completely lol
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
you think im missing much?
ngl, I haven't been play Hi3 at all for the past couple month
just ignore this flashbang where a game event screen broke on me
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
my nephew is like 9-10, so he's already half my age
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
my half brother is like in his 40s and im like barely 20
Screenshot fun wao
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
This doesn't look like Faust
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
congrats
It was super stupid
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I also figured it out during my PE Dudu run trying to see if I can get a higher score… first time, I got 450 pts with BKek because I didn’t know that, my HoS dropped down to like 200 hp too because I was in her field for too long without knowing
I didn’t touch my Abyss for like 1-2 weeks straight cuz of Finals, almost went down to Agony <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
and getting nothing out of it
so I kept losing -100
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
For my past RL runs, been so busy with Finals that I haven't even been doing Abyss nor MA nor ER
Lmao
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I did this on mobile in class
Chūnibyō is a Japanese colloquial term typically used to describe early teens who have grandiose delusions, who desperately want to stand out, and who have convinced themselves that they have hidden knowledge or secret powers

None of them every grew out of it <:KekPat:966625000339668993> Megumin has power, but she doesn't have any hidden knowledge or forbidden power
99% of her village are Chuuni too
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
I agree
cutie
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Fitgirl Repack is a mood
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
why this channel in the Study Corner
WAIT
WAIT
WAIT
same
True enough
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
True, but I mean why not make it worse and make it so that they literally take 0 dmg from everything but that one specific unit, no budget option
Yea, pretty much, the shield only taking dmg from Bleed is kinda dogsht
Soon, we’ll have a new boss that cant take damage unless you are specifically using Herrscher Seele or something
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Oh, it will 100% kill the game, especially with all the new bosses being more annoying to deal with than ever if you dont have the latest Valk
Thats some copium im on
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
12S Abyss, get rid of all the Mob stages, all 4 stages are 3S bosses
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Theres that too, this is a sign that we’ll get 9S MA, Trio covering 1 and then the other normal team covering the other 2
Yea, especially since HoTr is the new AE
Yea, thank you for wording it better for me
But not replace HoFin, even though HoFin is pretty copium without Trio
I guess they mean new Fire replace Flamescion and Helix
Lol
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Lumi detained someone?
Nice
Nini being Nini
Oooo Link Click right?
<a:KianaCooking1:653170565519245312>

Not even charred, I dont theres even anything left in that pan
Maincord just sucks at cooking
Lmao
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
You can always practice cooking
Sadge, but ill take it anyways
Is it spicy?
<:KianaDrool:652709420752699403>
The dried pepper looks nice
Lmao
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Tbh, I never pay attention to the food I eat, so if I ever had any food like goose liver, I would never know
Which is?
<:kekw:803302409707061285>
We are gonna get 9S MA and then just all retire from the game officially
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Mine is just 4/4 Mpe but no PRI and not SSS, me have the 2 Dudu at 4/4 though <:KekPat:966625000339668993> 

I just cant be bothered to max another PRI for Phys with all these stupid Phys characters coming out and making me annoyed
I have no SSS MPE either <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I wanna doom post, its entertaining that way
^^^
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Watch after Hare, we get another S rank Valk
Im skipping both, prob at most go for Hare depending on whos next…
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
SP is just the new A Rank Valk now but with extra passives with Rank-Up… so just Bootleg S rank, Rank up system
 also, they made Enryu so hot wtf for ToG Idle game
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
im not gonna even bother with Genshin rn
<a:clappyclap:850274850828058634>
Congrats
nah, still more time, but this is the first 4 weeks on what banner gonna look like... they dropped the PV though so its close
2 Pyramid Skin, Trio Rerun, 2 new units, Shickshal Arsenal, etc
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
god these are disgusting
<:Hehe:524821459915374592>
waiting til Hua, til then, my counter gonna stay at 69
Plus, my HoHe is 1/4 using Willows as the substitute
I would do the same if my pity is too closw for me to risk it when I gotta save for Hua
Also I hate the new discord buttons with the mic
<:KEKW:788545502961729547>
I simp for the males
You got my alter ego who simps for mainly females
Waow
Lol
I love Fu Hua so im immune
with every patch, I want to retire from Honkai like I did with Genshin... but still playing cuz of Hua
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
she summons a Stands, that shouldve counted as a summoned unit
if only Bkek Ult also considered as Summoned
fuck, i forgot about that
most niche boss
this boss makes me hate life even more
im so done this patch, got HoH skin, now im sleeping
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
yep, cuz sometimes, I just forget to apply bleed with Griseo... im pretty sure it was 4 stacks of bleed to keep it from healing
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
SSS one that keeps healing itself <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> Abyss one is easy AF with Griseo compared to MA tilting one
yea
I cant find anything
show me pls
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
cuz Mihole decided it would be smart to only have the shield be broken by bleed dmg
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
no Susannah = cant break shield fast enough = no dmg
what is with this bullshit
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
why tf is it healing to full hp
why is his SSS MA so aids
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
wtf
im malding so hard against pistachio
<:huh:966619839307321394>
cuz no Susannah
HoS Griseo PE
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
how do you fight SSS Pistachio
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
I wonder whats wrong with Dudu
hmmmm...
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
shouldve nerfed it all to oblivion like Honkai
lmao
tft?
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Obviously gonna be Fire, then we’ll get a 2nd Hua
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
New Fu Hua will powercreep Fu Hua
We’ll be fine
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I think AE was also like 2+ years til HoTr
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Senti is gonna be like AE, she’ll die out soon enough but its gonna take a while
Me agree
I wasnt really paying attention tbh
time skip happens a lot… iirc, in the most current Arc, they are prob around 16-17 because its their last year in Highschool
Lmao
playing HoS and Kallen just kills you instantly so the 70% Dmg Reduction was useless
it was hell
Judah one shotting you when it procs too
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
For the Pyramid Gacha, instead of S rank selector, I rather get a Stigmata instead
Still missing M piece
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I need funds for the last Sushang Stigmata
<a:KianaCooking2:653170566362300437>
^^^ its sadness for me... i wanted to pull for baizhu first and then go for nahida 2nd... now im just skipping nahida cuz mihole is rude af
i already retired from Genshin til baizhu tbh
congrats, im still playing it cuz Hua and Judah copium fuel
Im so out of it today
So we would have to start at the very beginning for me <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I havent done any Honkai raids
Oh
Scara?
for what content?
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Meow?
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Bronya with the Anti Qua canon
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
its why I retired from helping
<:huh:966619839307321394>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
even number though
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<@375625398542925825> there you go, I did meh considering my FR PRI is only lvl 50 and not 55
Ty
Been playing Ensemble Stars
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Havent even started on Abyss
such a long wait
April 14th for Ely, <:despairge:1045736540875280465>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
its like any gacha game in Asia, hell
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
hey, its a good thing to be able to save that long, you can even pull for dupes
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
too bad the BP outfits are kinda ass
my favorite part is the chibi and the MV
Glb still have 1-2 years worth of songs left lol
I have Subaru so im happy rn, both his Bloom and non Bloom is too adorable for me
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
super comfy floor
nah, he just sleeping on the cool floor
its fine, just play for the MV outfits and Room outfits
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I once cause an error in the tutorial and it skipped the whole thing for me
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
do you increase your note size?
basically hes the next one (one on the right)
we just did the Tales of Antique
ye
it knows
<:KEKW:720670047718080592>
because it is
lmao
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Theres the Private/Random Multi-Live

and theres also the Guild/Society Joint-Live... both are essentially the same thing, but the guild one affects the guild and helps it and is available on the weekends... the other is whenever
<a:kekah:844467095227990028>
well, I prob am explaining it very badly
nah specific Guild one are on weekends, but the random one are always open iirc
every Saturday/Sunday you can do Multi-Live with your friend/Society members
Multi-live seem fun
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
since the character you raise affect your scores... and lmao
well, the event just ended, we are on the collab one rn, so its fine... you aint getting into the leaderboard anytime soon anyways
ranked 45 on NA
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
me looking at some of my Group/Society friends event leaderboard
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
tbh, I kinda like this song
lol
that was fast, I cant do that <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> ill take my time and improve ig... though with 5 other gacha games + school, cant say for sure how that will go
so it goes higher
theres a lvl 30 one
Link Click collab makes me sad I missed it
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
Mika is nice tbh, I like their heterochromia eyes
like middle school or a bit of highschool with Cytus
I used to play Rhythm game, but thats like... years... ago...
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
so slow
I do have speed faster in Easy/Normal cuz good the normal speed is hell
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
makes sense
sometimes, notes goes faster than I remember to click
I am too boomer to be able to play properly
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
yea, flick is hell, its why I slow down my speed
they have a better dorm chibi game option which is better than any other dorm ive seen
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I play at 7x speed rn, because any faster kills me, while any slower also kills me except for some song
also when you have 90 BP that expires in a few hours <:wheeze:833318723565649950>
every day, random stages are given bonus drop rate
the stamina system in the game is fine, use more stamina = more drop when you clear the stage

no stamina = 1x loot drop, 1 BP = 5x, 2 BP = 8x, and 3 is like 10x drop rate for items and exp
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
some are just covers of their own song but with different cast
^^^
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I just pick the 5* but somehow, the 4* are usually harder to get
I picked Hiiro for my start because I liked some of the Alkaloid casts, mainly Mayoi and Hiiro... as for TrickStar, its Subaru
as for oufits, there are the 2* one that usually give the same outfit as the 5* one for the General Pool 5*
but in the end, they are in the General Pool anyways
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
it doesnt, you just get to gacha for who you want at the start from the one you selected
i can and will never do that
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yea, cuz i missed flick notes cuz of that
wasnt there the right, left, up, down flick?
you sure?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I hate the flick one
at least it has some
rip
does Ensemble Stars Music have Ensemble Stars base music too?
slowly doing Normal and Hard difficulty songs... expert is impossible for me
I cant react fast enough
rhythm games is 1/2 1/2 for me
I play NA cuz me like reading
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
yea, JP, me play NA version
collab card so yea
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Rhythm games bleeds my hand though <:wheeze:833318723565649950> watching people clear expert is just on another level for me
I started playing because I like the cute cards
<a:uwu:854358144456458260>
its pretteh
waow
better to start late than never ig
<:rip:654220221292478465>
oh, lmao
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
whats are ! and !! card?
?
I started EN version like 2 days ago, I am staying on NA because I want to be able to read
oof
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i rarely see any good YT vids for it
added another gacha game to suffer, was gonna play it like months earlier but forgot too <a:Y_KEK:792821099062362122> saw the Subaru collab image and just felt like it was the right time to start the game so I can simp for him
<:Hehe:524821459915374592>
I even thought I would have to reroll more than once to get him
At least I got the AniPop event and got the one I simping for which is Subaru

Who you simping for in the game?
I even missed the Link Click Collab
<:Sadge:842131939607183360> makes sense though, since NA/Glb only been out for like a year from what I heard
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Game decided to give me like 90 BP that all expires today
My hands are dying
Which server? Me on NA and nice, I only started playing like 2-3 days ago
Anyone playing Ensemble Stars or Limbus Company want to suffer with me? <:KEKW:788545502961729547>
same
...
good luck
im just sleeping til baizhu
I will 100% retain, but going to Nirvana is another question since its QUA weather
yee
cuz Handel was for HoT/GD
with Handel, her attack goes down
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
my FR isnt 55 PRI either
still got pretty good score back then ngl
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I had S1 or S2 HoT for the longest time til Ely Realm
ah, rip
the free HoT event back then
I got to SS thanks to the event + stamps
SS I believe
I have SSS FR but I dont wanna max her PRI
oh, I might be able to do HoT, FR, HoTr
its decent enough
kinda yea, Tona is crab right? but tbh, who knows FR dps is deadge for me since no max PRI for that
Idk tbh, I hate QUA
prob HoT, FR, Fischl/Eden
even my MA score looks nice kinda
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
cuz I like nice looking numbers
sorry 745
using PE got me 600~, swapped to Bkek and did around 730, fixed my rotations and went to around 747
theyd ef slacced cuz mine had 733
while also playing Ensemble Stars and writing my essays
I did everything today too, from MA to Abyss to Ely Realm
if I go up, im going to Nirvana with you
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I kinda got 1st place in my RL bracket I think using Bkek Dudu while 2nd was a 4/4 SS Susannah with max PRI
Uwu
yes is me
I like her base gameplay over her Burst mode tbh
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I hate Hare's Ult
I have SS Bkek + Abuse Flower so im fine there
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
that was a good 1st chapter, I love the horror theme stuff
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
should've drawn derp face
True !
lmao
oh
kinda hard to tell withh all the barrages to names flying down
maybe, she was kinda involved near the beginning on the New Altra wen they went on the moon and Dudu needed to do something with it
oh, I prob didnt pay enough attention

I think I heard Shigure
honestly, the only one that i noticed talk were just those involved in this arc/chapter tbh
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
nope
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I specifically noticed Sin Mal because she was a rare existence
she did
yea
I felt bad when Sin Mal name appeared tbh <:KekPat:966625000339668993> GGZ love her but she was non-existent in Honkai tbh
Tericula is like 1/2 of that
nah, I would say shorter than Kongming
prob not as long as the newer one, but it was still a good length of time
it was a decent amount of time
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
heck, I think I did the Ai-chan one like 2-3 days before it was over
I havent done the event except when it first came out tbh, havent had enough time for events, so I just do them selectively sometimes
like when was the last time we had the Yae event with the Ferryman, event recently has been about the Flame Chaser, with no actual Captainverse event
the issue with the Ai-chan event too is that for players who never experienced it in the first place, Captain appearing in the main story felt like it happened out of nowhere without any indicator in the main story which felt unnecessary

Since obviously, we have events that occurs and sometime rerun, but usually once we missed it, it rarely comes back if ever
^
tbh, them saying it can be anything, even complaints and then after you enter the message, telling you it should be more serious doesn't really help
I know event story is canon in the captainverse, but my thought of it was the Captain traveling through the sea of Quanta essentially having their own journey while being in the same world as Honkai
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I honestly thought of the Ai chan event as just the usual captainverse event filled with memes and the usual stuff
Oh, for me, I was mainly talking about signs in the Main Story, I forgot about the Ai-chan Hacking Event outside of the Code part tbh
I hate the idea of self insert when it feels out of place there <:KekPat:966625000339668993> really outside of just Ai Hyperion Lamda, there wasn’t really any indicator for Captainverse people to randomly join in from different parallel world
They were there for the hitcount shield
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Captain had shield hitcounter buff
Deliverance Kebin design was also a big L for me, he was just 11th PRI but if it was a boss <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I feel so bad for Kebin
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
The worse part was that it didnt felt like that, it just felt like us Captainverse people decided to join in for no reason thanks to Ai Hyperion Lamda from Ai-chan patch
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
the self-insert moment in this chapter didnt help either
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
Doing the story now made me see her ultra short skirt right above the text
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Theres one thing I remember that I complained about for HoF Time Runner was that the Skirt was too short and then they decided to make it nonexistent for HoFin
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Im sleeping through the next 2 patches until Hua or Judah PRI
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
hopefully, I can binge it all on Monday
school makes me so busy
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I havent even started the story yet, and we have less than 4 days left til the New Patch
who would pull for a copium unit when they will most likely get her when they lose 50/50 anyways and have it be worse than Qiqi
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Reason Genshin lost was because it took a big L with dead patch called having Standard Dehya
Dudu impact
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Though replacing CN also works since mine is only 1/4
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
I’ll prob retain Fire easy when next Hua comes out, I want next Hua to either be dps or replace my 4/4 HoTR
im a nirvana bouncer afterall
im surprised i even retained 3 rounds in Nirvana in the first place
finally falling down from Nirvana
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
playing Carole for shieldbreak sucked so much for me I went with HoR even though I had type disadvantage
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Im so happy I retired from there ans the fact that we basically made our own cave to live in
Lmao
Bleed Vill-V was pretty painful for people
Did CN and SEA went down too?
cuz then I can give Pardo Cezanne
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
ngl, just Bastet T would've fixed most my issues
specifically 3 missing Stigmata issue
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
304
im even more trash
Thank you Kithi
not even SSS Pardo
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
because im missing only 1 Stig from each character to full set them
when I look at this, it makes me feel sad
Lmao
<:kek:809950280258945024>
... especially the Bleed Vill-V where I retained at 10th
I've been a decent Nirvana bouncer except for the past 3 Nirvana Abyss where I somehow retained
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
this is prob my 2nd time in Gres's lobby
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
whos in your lobby?

also, Gres is in my lobby, I think Kithi is in Lumi's lobby
I did that like one or twice like 1-2 patch ago
<:pog:825793819428913183>
Cool
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
True, I barely retained this run, I aint gonna push my luck
I have HoHe, but shes using 4/4 Willows and max PRI, which isnt good enough against those 4/4 HoHe
Well… im falling I guess
That will probably decide if I retain again or finally fall back down
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Who is it this rotation btw?
I literally retained by the hair of it all
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Pog, Im in same bracket as Gres and Lumi in same one as Kithi
Oh waow, I even retained tf
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
especially once the disgusting Nirvana stages started occurring as if it already didn't happen when I almost failed the 2nd Bleed Stage cuz that Zombie Summoner + Mechs was tanky
anyways, I hopefully retain Nirvana again even though I would rather prefer RL instead ngl
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I wanted to see Gres or someone I knew in Nirvana rn but game said no
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
gotta wait til tmr to reroll for crit
ima change it tmr ig
thank you for telling me
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
Kosma is still my favorite, though im annoyed his Red Affix is not that great
is his Red Affix better or worse than those
ty
oh, I thought Kebin Ult was just Enhance Basic, while Ult Dmg only buff the dmg if the Ult does dmg
oh, Ult Dmg buff it?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I need better one for mine
whats your affixes?
also, <@291907279291285506> did you only use Kebin for your 1st place on Ganesha?
the one in first is MPE
dont worry, same for mine including myself, for me, its cuz I dont have Griseo max PRI and I dont have enough dmg to 1 rot her first phase <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> and during 2nd phase, I ran out of SP for Griseo Ult
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
gres nini
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
oh, its Bleed Vill-V?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
whatever
got sniped to 6th
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
like its so bait
I just realized it was a mistake because the message on the announcement was the wrong date (so it was old...) but the irony was that it said 02/20/23 which was a monday and 03/20/23 was also a monday both on the same day <:KekPat:966625000339668993> but Canvas still shows the Join Zoom Class link so I misread the announcement
<:huhjj:1076112282255372349>
for me, I think it was a bit less than that... I balded over an hour just for my T3 score and I know theres a high chance im getting sniped

and I have like less like 15 min before my class starts because one of my professor is a bitch for still telling us that we still have to show up for class during spring break
prob deleted 20+ clip/vid of me clearing Abyss because of that
I balded like for more than an hour
the 2 in front of me... btw, guess how many time I had to restart my run cuz of that
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
the amount of time I had to restart because of this
How my Kalpas Run gets ruined each time
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<@197871478950068224> 
Its a sign telling me to sleep ig so nighty night
Tf you doing randomly causing me to do a discord call
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Oops stupid mobile device
And she said she took on the appearance due to her memory of Kallen
Her Idol version is also really cute, the irony was that Judah’s design came out first before Kallen did
I got Judah chan back when she first got released
I lost 2 somehow idk, but I still have 6 left so im fine
I maxed 1 back then for gene and also cuz Judah was OP back then

I used to play GGZ and I simp for Judah chan in GGZ back then… thus why I have like 6 Judah Oath + 1 Sakura PRI
They are forever locked never to be salvaged though
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
I was sane enough not to max all my Judah’s Oath
I pulled for 8 Judah’s Oath
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
Well 11th PRI and 4* Selune
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
No JST sadly, most of the older stig, I dont have cuz back then, I was very pepega

And my luck in gacha was even worse back then… and it was bad enough where I even max out 11th PRI
Gl retaining in yours too
Thank you Lumi
Cuz for that one, I have the core 2p… but Bastet core 2p is TM
Sushang M is nice too, but TB + Beach M is good enough
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Yea, cuz most of my issue is lack of Bastet T
Cuz it wouldve let me use Cezanne or Newt B

Im fine, im using HoTR stig on Pardo rn, unironically just as good as Turg and uptime on it is easy to maintain
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Bastet T wouldve solved a lot of problems for me but game never gave me it
SS SW so SW, if my HoTr luck wasnt so bad and allowed me to have SS like everyone else, I wouldve tried HoTR
ill prob bald tmr for an extra 10-20 pts
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
My Bracket is relatively slack lmao
for me, im lacking the dmg necessary because I dont have 2 stig pieces
not having Bastet T really bodied me
I just hope to retain somehow lol
Dudu Impact
<:LUL:524820987703721987>
Kithi
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
not as badly as HoF does though unless you have Sirin
but i was talking in terms of getting bodied by ignite
shes not since HoF has more raw dps
so its more like bodied by ignite content
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
bodied by not having ignite nor good support with barely any weather that helps her... SpA usually steals her content in the end... while Vill-V is just Qua
HoHe and HoF just got bodied... though HoF became better with Hotr and Cn
the power of type advantage ig but yea... Herrscher lately been kinda bait ngl, except HoTR and HoO for longevity/f2p-ness
they have 4* Ely Elf
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
cuz max PRI and the 2 stig im missing
one of them used HoTR and got 60 pts more than me
I have to wait til tmr to see my chances of retaining Nirvana... its ironic that im retaining Nirvana with my old Valk like Mobi and SW <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:HimekoWTF:423917413063720980>
yea, normally NA tend to have lower dist
im on NA
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oh, NA is higher disturbance
 was this yours?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
for Kalpas/this Abyss, yes, in MA, usually not
lmao
like the only reason I can get higher than 500+ is cuz im missing those 2 stig... also max PRI but that one is super whalao
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I have M B, but B is useless cuz its taking Newt B... and M is useless without T
yea
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yes, I have like 4/4 Verne + Nyx Scythe but no Nyx
lack dmg to 1 phase it... I dont have Bastet T so I ended giving her HoTR stig cuz Bastet MB is copium
<:TeriDerpMelon:1061942041157840947>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im missing like 2 stig to 4/4 my Sus and Pardo
whats your team looking like?
<:SadBb:552684268921290772>
I only 500 pts
ishoke, im also Nirvana
Nirvana Lumi?
couldve gotten at least to 600-700 if I did
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Im not complaining, Kal run is nice with her, i just wished I had Sus M and Bastet T
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I have more Atk on SW than the ref, but my Sushang is missing M Piece, and Pardo missing Bastet T... and neither PRI are maxed either
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I couldn't 1 rot his first phase so I lost like 50~ pt there... and then his 2nd phase just extra tanky so extra rot there so I lost like another 200 pts
lmao
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
its sad
no Bastet TM, and no Sushang M
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
im in Nirvana, only got 504 rn
oh, I thought it was Nirvana
Nirvana?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
<:BarbaraHeart:996112936055615488>
Lol
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
oh, SS SW
whats next week's suffering?
ty for reminding me Cata
OH WAIT, ER
<:deadge:975652771082698782> the one above me has max PRI for Eden
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
cuz I only max PRI weapons I want to max
all the other were actual good investment
11th PRI was my most sinned PRI to max out
gonna 55 Sushang's and already 55 Eden
just maxed HoTR PRI this patch
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
my list of maxed PRI rn
no, I need to save for Judah PRI and new Hua battlesuit PRI whenever those comes out... also need to 55 Sushang's PRI too
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
brought Eden PRI to 55 buffed my score quite a lot tf
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
hoarding them
I feel old with all of these
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I pretty sure Tet has more than me but yea
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
but yea, me old enough for 1st Anni and Pre-Registration Emblem
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
old day memes where my Selune does more dmg than my HoR
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
just Ice Dmg, nothing else good
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
stop it, I have 4* Selune if you want to feel even more disgusted
should I 55 Eden PRI?
they are prob trolling cuz its at 561 for that, but like 705 on the Handel one
max PRI + 4* Tuna
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
not as whale as these 2 though
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
The rerolls were rigged btw, <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Swapped it to new affixes
yea, I have changed affixes for it yet, I should for more atk
I think I have all DK rn except Black Abyss and Xuayuan Sword
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Mine because I wanted SP cuz why not <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
oh, I just realized im in Nirvana this Abyss
Im just trying out Discord new themes option, I went Green to match Kosma
rip ig
oh
oh lmao <:KekPat:966625000339668993> my theme been just Kosma... and which maincord made you change it?
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
oh Kithi, did you changed your Discord Theme to anything new that they gave us? I think I chose Forest because im going green theme with Kosma
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I should start doing Abyss later
I thought it was an amongus centuar
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
dont worry, it wont be as outdated as the fact that every new edition of a textbook is literally just the same textbook but at higher prices
US Education is outdated AF
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
this was Chat's response for me
<:Kappapa:659810164873887748>
cuz thats ChatGPT, I used DAN
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
so many Tuna in RL tf
same
congrats
I still havent started for mine
so a lumi
he, she, they, them, something...

whichever I feel like assuming at the time depending on pfp and name <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
If I am in top 3 again, im going to Nirvana next Abyss
I don’t remember anyone in my bracket
I dont have Jin TM <:KekPat:966625000339668993> another reason why I cant do this strat
My issue is that my HoHe is 1/4 and the other stig was HoR best stig anyways
31733
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I take it over trying to mald with HoHe
Hellmaru was nice with HoR
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
No Turg?
I was 2/4 missing weapon and best piece

Then said fuck it, got best piece to be at 1/4 for Griseo/Sushang instead and then got her weapon like 1-2 patch ago
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
My Paga luck was so ass that I just used my only Paga TB for wishing well for M cuz I rarely ever use SnS anyways
I got SnS weapon recently, 2 of them but one is still 1 away from 5*
Ishoke, after spending an extra 11k+ for barely 1 stig of Sushang and 1 wishing well for the other piece for 2 set bonus

Now im back to like maybe 5-6k for Ely skin rn
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Cheaper than getting 4/4 of a brand new character
Well, Budget for budget Stigmata ig, since signature weapon are usually a must anyways in Honkai 2023
I use it only for the 1st half though cuz 2nd half, I was able to one shot with Dudu Ult
 I was using this as a reference for Otto, my god I had better gears but still did worse <:KekPat:966625000339668993> but thats cuz skill issue
even more me, other than Honkai and Genshit, im also playing at least 5 other gacha games
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
our attention span is also went to the shitter
I balded for like 1-2 hour for my score cuz I kept messing up the starlight shield bs
god I hate Otto
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I was only fine with us cuz i was too much of a boomer to be able to do 0s strats
I was fine with 3s MA til they decided to add in more
true, good old time, same with how they created Exalted Abyss so that older players can suffer from having to run around in old bleed abyss... though not as old as 31 floor Abyss
but ill never 0s it because my boomer hand says no
I have SW so i can prob go that strat
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
waow, 704 but still falling
but at least I beated Kebin
ill still fall this Abyss
<:KekPat:966625000339668993> my rotation just end up going well to where I deal dmg during shield phase and my support can run and gather sp during shield-down phase anyways cuz ill be popping off Eden and Htr Ult and then shield is back up for HoO
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
context was with regard to using 1 Element Team when you dont have Trio
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
cuz i've tried HoO, CN, and HoTR, it felt scuffed
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
cuz its not like your support will do enough damage for Kebin to switch his shield element to the support so that you can do more dmg during his shieldless phase
its just better to use one team cuz theres no real point in using another Element unless you really want the extra like 10% from Stage Bonus which prob wont be worth it compared to having an actual support like CN for HoF or GD for HoT/HoO
it could be slightly higher if I did it more smoothly but yea
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
for nirvana?
ill try it in a bit
haven't tried that yet
cuz half the time, I ignore their effects so i end up scuffing everything
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
i wanted to find some ref when its for a Boss I dont know
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Kebin - Deal Normal to no damage while his shield is up

Shield goes down - still deals no damage because he got higher resistance and the one that can deal dmg is currently on cooldown (i.e no Ult ready for HoT and overheat for HoF)
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
whats worse is that when I use HoO, CN, and HoTR, I get a similar score, or slightly less than that
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<@291907279291285506>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
ill try, kinda, but yea, i know I wont retain against all those Trio team, but at least ill try to beat kebin up
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I dont even know why I am doing this when I wont retain anyways
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
this is for suffering in Nirvana lmao
k, ty
I have HoO and HoT... so would HoO or HoT be better with HoF and HoTR
can I just use HoF as replacement?
that doesn't include HoFin
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
what team can I use against Kebin?
also, most organization in the novels are either neutral or evil, because they all have to deal with madness
theres also a talking dog
~~the baby is special~~
some of the Official/Qidian art of the different characters... I will say the start is painfully slow
its apparently gonna be a Trilogy... with 3 different main book, 2nd book started with a different protagonist
its a very long chinese light novel, of course not as long as usual wuxia kind...

its theme involve Elritch Horror, Victorian/Steampunk Era themes, Churches, Supernatural Power, and quite a lot of other stuff... oh, the power of bullshitting til it actually became true in the end (as in Secret Organization that started as BS, but became an actual real thing)

start is very slow (like every Chinese novels), but the best part is whenever it nears the end of each volume for its climax
on another note, Eli Eli, Lord of the Mystery 2 came out and i am happy, i need to refresh my memory of the first book but i really love the cn novel of cuttlefish
at least it isnt as bad as Genshin's long animation for switching and attacking
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
the shitty part is that you know they couldve added time stop back to them if they wanted to like with FR, HoR, and HoT weapon but they just said nah, fuck it... 

like AE could've easily stay alive even longer and stronger if Neb Pri let her Ult time stop cuz you waste so much buff time going through that animation
didn't know they had violence against Aponia
oh, I thought he had violence against the current herrschers
gib context
also, what was this for?
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
I just wanted something more than just Abyss Floor 9-12 that only refreshes once every 2 week for only 3~ single pull <:KekPat:966625000339668993> or at least content where my character are just useless cuz now that i have both my team, i really had no reason to pull for anyone else anymore... 

especially with how niche they were unless i simp for them or said i would pull for them in the past
is it for the latest animated short?
?
13-15 is 3 teams
just do 15 floor of Abyss
I really want 3 sides now... cuz my Raide, Cyno, Hu Tao, Childe, Shenhe are all dying and rusting away because I never use them in abyss anymore
it would be 3rd now
yea
same
ngl, I almost want the Genshin Abyss 2 chamber style so that I can use a 2nd team in Abyss... just because I want to use my older teams

Genshin Abyss is ass, but its the only place I could actually use more than just the same team from overworld over and over (abeit ive been doing that)
so 9S and we all die
we are at 8S
soon thaat will die off when Mihole decided to add in 9S MA
HoFs is just happier for me now that I got ignite after so long
lmao
i would want to use DA if i actually had the mats to build her... but i cant justify crafting her PRI
I just said mobi died, which isnt wrong cuz she did die, literally <a:Run:828749243820802130> but anyways, I have so many valks now but so many i dont even use anymore because its hard finding content for them which is the sad part
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I know, i shouldve worded myself better ig
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
and now with HoO, it was just as easy cuz it took only 3 multi for 4/4 HoO
irony was when HoT became my easiest char to build cuz of that
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I still use Mobi in Homu so im happy with that, I said Mobi died but in a joking matter with how many new character/dps there are now... cuz i fully geared her and then HoT 7tr came out with Hannel, get SS SW and later Ely shills occur etc
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Mobi died
shes really the only range dps outside of Aponia so yea, sw should beat it
killed it at the last second
<a:AlySweats:770160546041167885>
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
its why htr replaced her
nope
<:huh:966619839307321394>
you dont have her weapon still?
rip
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
i have DA but no pri
why not use HoFs
Ely B
lmao
i havent even started for mine
lmao
congrats, you got it too now
it doesn't really matter in the end since you'll get a bunch of SSR and the 4* at higher constellation is usually better than the C0 SSR character
<@781539392039682058>  just in case... you can prob skip straight to the tierlist... its obviously subjective but still good to know, rerolling in the game is super easy too
skip to 15 sec if you want to see her ult there
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
the hero cantare one, yea, was during after hell train
this is the Rachel in the idle game, pre time skip
Hero Cantare
also, if you're asking about Rachel, yes shes in both game too... for the idle game, shes 4*, for Hero Cantare, shes a SSR
 you can see her Ult here ig
Hwa in another game
 heres Christmas Hwa
the one up here is Arie Inieta apparently
Hoaquin, the other sibbling
yea
Lo Po Bia Elaine
from a different game
ye
Kaiser and Elaine, during the name steal arc
here's Elaine
I think 4
this one is new for me, idk who they are, but they in KR version
wait, lemme get better image
waiting for these 2 broken ass character
I thought he was still with her
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Evan
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
though idk if they all expired already or not
there are a lot of codes too
its an idle game, dont expect anything else other than to look at pretty picture
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
SR version
the latest version, cuz we only have his SR version in Global rn
SSR Hatz
this asshole? or another
3rd Bam isnt in Global yet
like season 1 Bam vs current Bam
cuz some are from certain arc/time
normally never the same, only exception are the holiday version or at the start with their 4* version, like how we have B Rank Kiana, Mei and Bronya and now we have their S rank version
this is the 4* Khun you get
Khun in another gacha game called Hero Cantare
Anaak
heres Khun Ran
yea, theres another Khun
tower of god M: great journey
when you equip their signature gear, you unlock their 2nd art
I'll give you both
one of my fav
shes so pretty
Hwa is here, I dont have her
no, its a different one
been playing Tower of God idle game, I love and hate it, the usual gacha game but yea, art is really nice though,
stacking chapters for that long is fun
I know, cuz it was like 2+ years ago
yep, so you wont know really who I am talking about unless I post their image
so I have a lot to binge for but Im still stacking the chapters
I know, i still want to wait... realistically, I think I was around the part where they were saving Hansung Yu, Viole sensei and they were in that weird board game
I need to catch up to Tower of God, I know the creator took a break for it so I didn''t want to be stuck on a cliffhanger so I waited
<:Kek:898256955922067466>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
tease people to read it
Solo Leveling will probably be the same
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
same with God of Hishschool tbh
from game ye
some of the Tower of God game other than the usual gacha have really nice art too <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
the art at the start is not the great, it improves more starting the 2nd season
ishoke, I dont even have that weapon
Omniscient Readers Viewpoint is a good novel, I love and hate the ending
Omniscient Readers Viewpoint
The Beginning After the End

both are great novels too
it still buffs less than Hakushin though, and Haku gives ER too... i guess the weapon will be useful if hes the solo Dendro
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
oh, creating a shield... i misread it so yea, i guess its slightly better then
same, but i vary myself a lot from thriller/horror to even wuxia kind for cn stuff, and then manga for jp
but its 4 every 2.5 seconds... effect is 3 sec... so you literally get like no energy lmao
I guess the only other good thing about the weapon is the energy regen but thats about it...
it buff his own Elemental Damage... but hes a healer/shielder, why would he need to buff his non-existent dmg... its like Kokomi Donut buffing her own damage when she does literally no damage
oh
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
im not good with acronymns
?
im more random with mine
i read monthly chapter of Bungou Stray Dog, sometimes chainsawman and blue lock when i remember
<:eek:765359367524188161>
the one thing I like Honkai is that at least their gears is actually relevant and not dead useless like the one in Genshin
I only need Baizhu, his weapon does nothing for him so I have no reason to get it unless they change it
so not that much
I only need to work on Baizhu ig
i never checked how much I have or need
same, I like the taste but I cant drink them or me die with bad headache
I live without coffee and without energy
... I get a migraine/headache if I were to drink coffee, so cant relate

its why I prefer tea more
cuz its been over 3 years afterall
yea, it was during HIghschool so idk if they stopped or not
either a monster or energy drinks
same
true, but im alive without any of those, but yea...
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
someone I know would have a monster for breakfast, lunch and dinner everyday and I wonder how they are even alive and havent crashed yet
same
milk tea doko?
I like coffee but it gives me migraine, so I end up liking tea over it
im blind
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
oh, I wouldve ranked it higher if it was Sprite lmao
<:eek:765359367524188161>
I old enough now for milk to give me stomache
I dont like corn as much, just neutral about it
Kekw
Feelsbadman
So many you haven’t tried Carv
Waow
I only had 1 shot of tequila during Halloween
…
<a:StabbyDed:576647937371668486>
Shut up baban, your taste is just as shitty if thats the case
I have to see the inside to know if its the one i know
me no see all of them listed though
mine is most A rank, few S rank
waow, so many S rank
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
I forgot to include Mango there to if the mango was not sweet enough or was too sweet
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
grinded salt and some spicy chili together... cuz I like spicy stuff
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
for watermelon and grapes and oranges... I eat them with salt and chili
tierlist didnt list it so i didnt bother
D and F are kinda around the same for me
why
neutral for green tea/matcha desert... and yea, pistachio in those desert kinda...
im neutral about them, its random
for what?
?
I cleared mine easy with Ning + Yae... so my issue was 2nd half which cant really be solved cuz of gather issue
^^^
trying to clear this abyss with c0 DMC and no Kazoo/gather for 3rd chamber is hell
anyways, most my issue will be solved after I get Baizhu
almost thought you called me an idiot <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yea, it was impossible for me because I couldnt gather the 2nd half
Hoyolab... also, how did you 3* the oh- nvm
ZL Ult helped so much
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
it was worse for me who fought the Hydro Herald with Razor and Ning
same
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
same, I missed old Condensed Ice stage
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I feel bad for my Raiden, Hu Tao, Shenhe, and Cyno who are kinda dead useless rn tbh
nani?
^ ?
<:kannagun:850909568845873232>
lvl 40 yes <a:NodBb:561613076844249130> I dont use Anemo character at all, Im Geo (just Ning) aligned, my brother is the Anemo guy... my only anemo was Scara cuz I was obligated to get him in 1 multi back in 2020
yea, im contractually obligated to use Ning and Razor so I cant 36* cuz 3rd chamber <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
im just suffering cuz of that
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
anyways, Electro was saved by Dendro... now they just need to fix Phys and Geo please
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
ikr
most character that uses Benny at this point dont even care about his C6 and those affected by C6 dont like teaming up with Bennet anyways
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I still dont have C5 or C6 Bennet
im only 35* cuz Ning and Razor are must use for me... Yae is also must use but shes still good so im not having any issue there
I did, but they spawn in 2 waves and 2nd wave all 3 are fucking in their own triangle in their corner while summon more shit
dogshit 3rd chamber... cant 9* it cuz they are so fucking spread out
yea, C6 Razor and Yae, cuz I love my Razor, one of my OG 4* along with C6 Ning
yea, ill be going Yae, Baizhu, Razor, and prob XQ or hydro for fun
also... i got 35* rn... i cant get 36 because I dont have Kazuha for the 3rd chambers cuz the enemies are so fucking spreaded out like human garbage
im suffering rn because im using Ning and Razor this abyss... geo is ass, and Phys is just as dead
yes
same Tet
Baizhu is the dendro healer/shielder i needed cuz my ZL is tied to Ningguang
and then quit the game
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
im going for Baizhu cuz back in 2020, i said i would pull for Yae, Scara, Cyno, and Baizhu
2p is hp so yea, somewhat useful ig 
even Kokomi ~~coc~~  donut ring is just as useless as Baizhu's sig weapon
though you get to lose against Dehya hp artis that does nothing cuz it only buff her non-existent dmg
yea, so new set works best for all his dmg <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yes, another one
Childe and copium Dehya
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
personal dmg is useless for Baizhu
the Kokomi donut? at that point, I rather just use an ER weapon tbh
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
im happy in MA though at least
no one here in my bracket though, and alright, lemme open the game back up
I did
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
just got there today
im in Nirvana <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
in nirvana?
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
and go
cuz i get to sleep
show me pls. im happy to be in Myriad this run
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I take it back, i am in Myriad... just not with Eli, Gresham, or any other ppl i know
no HoFin lol
im still in RL cuz yea
waow
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I suffered last week, forgot about MA so i cri on inside
maxed Trio in RL, ew, even max PRI, <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
yea, I saw a bunch of 9S Trio
<@781539392039682058> <@197871478950068224> Honkai Impact 3 has given you an Anniversary Voyage Gift Box. Open it now! heres mine
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
I havent done Abyss yet
the Bull? or in Abyss?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
except against Phys
all 3 Element afterall
The HyperX Cloud Alpha is prob worse
The Headphones themselves is pretty good but the Mic sucks ass (not bad but its prob the most basic btch kind of mic)
I think I am using the HyperX Cloud 2, its ok, at least decent enough that I bought the wireless version like a year later <:kekpat:913676309744451634>
Yea, I was busy playing Minecraft on Hard mode, I got the last hit on the Endy Drawgon on the Realm I was in
I dont even think I can 1 rot her first phase
Turg TB Paga M Sus
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
ty, and ew, im so doomed then
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
my Cat is on Full HoTr Stig cuz im pretty sure thats better than Bastet MB
I havent even started yet
who are we fighting?
Ima be extra doom this run
Lets suffer together, dont worry, I only got unlucky because it was Bleed Weather and barely anyone had a proper Bkek <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
this aint it chief
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I miss the 32 floors + bombing Abyss Era
<:MissMeWithThatSht:561649397650161664>
Surveys still asks about Singularis to remind me about them lmao
<:Borrysit:1055469373550252062>
I never noticed since im in Exalted
waow
im just staying RL and bouncing to Nirvana so mine is random
shut it, when Hawk came out, she was quite good and relevant for quite a while
Raven need those kinds of meds
look at Hawk of the Fog though, basically a complete good rework
PRI + Augment
only way to revive her and have her at SSS not be useless for me
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Raven Augment doko?
Raven can die
I still use my AE
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I legit gave Sushang HB gear and HB HoTr gears
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
778 in rl with this one
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i havent done any of those
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
its Lunar New Year, maybe higher chances
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
<:huh:966619839307321394>
I just realized why I was doing no dmg either
snipe by 1 point
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I have her weapon but no PRI
Note that my Phys Ely is 3/4 with no PRI
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Should I just go PE on Bull, HoT + HoTr on Tank and then HoFs on Heimdall?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I have HoTr, I just want to use AE
HoR?
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
Trio team + PE Dudu basically means you have a staple team for basically all IMA bosses too, though the Quantum one are still the more annoying bosses to beat up
They dont even need to be on the leaderboard, just be there for me to use them
<:Despairge:1002519666050211941>
I want a 4th MA boss soon so that I can use my older unit like Mobius and Fischl
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
For me, ill just use AE before sniping on the last day with HoTr
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
rip my Fischl and Zhenyi too
even though ill have 4/4 HoTr, my boomer hand isn't gonna use her well enough
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Buff my AE again please
I really wanna retire soon too
<:despairge:1045736540875280465>
on another note, I still debating if I should even go for HoTr and the Trio or wait and see for new battlesuit that totally should be another IMA S rank just to body people
<:pepeBox:857826727249313813>
its NA, ill be asleep so when I wake up, servers will be up anyways
cant decide if I should skip HoTr or not
ill be asleep anyways
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Story Speedrun time, but at the same time not rushing it before the update drop
I have Paga M so im fine there, ~~dont ask how~~ totally didnt get Paga TB and used them in Wishing well because game is rigged
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i hate this
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Must i use Carole
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
what was your team?
waow
<:TeriStonks:1009416806898868254>
im assuming bronya died from that
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
lmao, wtf is that combo
so if I can binge a game for this long, I can do the same with the story and suffer
bought this game on steam on Jan 2nd or Jan 3rd btw
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I will, but thats my life for wasting it away grinding out a farming sim type game
<:E_PoliwhirlConcern:793960306882773003>
time to do all the story in 1 day before the update
I forgot to do ER
oh fuck
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I just realized I already do have it
I want the border so bad
<:Prayge:905334842084970526>
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I dont want Tet dead, its just that Tet coincidentally dies because of me... tbh, me and cata kills each other by accident the most
just 1 in 2.5 rounds for tet and like every game with cata, but cata kills me back so its ok
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I only betray Cata by accident, same for killing Tet
why am I the uncle though
omg, a birb
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
oh, im the uncle with cata
???
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
because you gymbro
AE was prob one of my best investment too considering how long she lasted... heck, even with HoTr, shes not completely dead either since not everyone has enough for HoTr when HoTr wants full set and theres still CNY units <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
cuz I was using Aslaug TB Himeko M on Himeko for ER and forgot to give it back to Tuna afterward
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I just realized that I was running my Flame Tuna with Aslaug when I was fighting Bella
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
my bracket is filled with weirdos
side stage is also pain
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
it was mimi yea, since I posted the vid of that run earlier today... if it was RL and not Nirvana, I wouldve been tempted to do that run
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
im so tempted to do this for Nirvana but I know I cant because I dont have 4/4 Sushang
3 stage, 100 xtal, sleep
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
thank god
ig its easy sleep in Nirvana
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
which boss is next rotation?
fighting her is less malding than fighting Kosma
im not complaining about bella, since unironically, I got 666 pts on her and her rotation was pretty smooth, just lacking dmg near the end or else I couldve gotten around 700+ pts
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
I can finally have fun using my SS Himeko
Ai chan on Turg anyways
tbh, I could do better but its without any reference so good enough for me
good enough for me
wow does CN make my life so much easier against Parvati
so i lost 100 trophy there
I feel asleep during Finals and missed a RL run
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I dont wanna use cat <:kekhandss:969204829354328105> no matter what, my issue is that I keep on fcking up and letting Heimald enter Overload way too early
because I am shit at my timing
and still do worse
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
 me who used a Nirvana ref for Heimdal because I couldnt find any other
Heimald
oof
<:draculaWtf:814619087526559754>
i look at all the Heimdal runs and I see them perfectly timing his shield break with overload so that it resets him and im over here like
oh, I think I got around that the first time around
and then I lose like 50-100 pts cuz of that
so he just got Overload like a piece of garbage
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Flame Tuna, CN, AE... my AE/HoFs are maxed for a long time now, so CN just helped with Ignite for smoother rotation... couldve gotten higher but I suck at timing Heimdal Shieldbreak
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I have skill issue against Heimdal so ima cope with 647 I think was my score
yea, though we do also see Mei and Raven as well at the train station, i only say Mei vs Raven because they seem to love sparring each other
We know Mei is next at least (or high probably) with what is shown near the end of the PV (Mei vs Raven)
The biggest bait is if next Kiana/Mei does the same thing but with Lightning/Fire
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Fully Geared AE is better than a scuffed 0/4 or 1/4 HoTr at S0 anyways
Ye, my only fire dps is HoFs anyways
<:deadge:975652771082698782> thats fines with me, AE forever
It gives me more of a reason to skip her now and cope with my already solid SS 4/4 AE, since all my other teams are pretty solid rn so i just need to wait for new Kiana/Mei and pull for support gears for Pardo/Sus
legit only missing like 1k~ ether fuel left til I can craft all 3 and turn poor
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
cuz im still running Ana
I would've remained top 2% had my HoHe not been so scuffed
congrats Whalao
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
too busy
I couldn't even bother to get top 2% this MA
If they had SS Gris, prob wouldve been a bit higher
S Rank Gris is prob the other reason
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
...
congrats
while I also have no Fuxi or Sirin so no QTE for my fire teams unless rng is being nice
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Klein 2* is super copium, cant even let me trigger QTE for Lightning so its extra scuffed in lightning team
who needs ice teams for Kasumi
I just dont have the time anymore
I stopped going to WFP altogether, so im essentially dead there
yep, and she was the only class that fits my schedule
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
she doesnt curve the grades either
the lucky one got 50~/100

unlucky one got 11/100


only 1-2 person got over 70... 1 of them maybe around 80~
yea, got 31/100 on the first midterm... and that was me being lucky... I lost 12% of my grade from 1 exam... now my 2nd one is coming up... and Finals will literally end me
professor has 2 Midterms, worth 17.5% (35) each... Finals are worth 50%
If I fail this midterm, i basically fail the class, not even the Final exam can save be
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Econ exam that will literally fuck me over if I fail it
I have midterms to do
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
you're good then, cuz im sleeping this Nirvana
In Nirvana?
But night Eli, make sure to get enough rest
And Narutoes is in First
I dont know the rest
Sasuka is 5th, and then theres Barbara and Xiao
10th is Psyduck
<:huh:966619839307321394>
Good night, Hua is in Top 5
They reply in CN, I reply in English
Literally google translate is the mvp here…
I bought the Key of Castigation Umbrella once but it got Rejected cuz it was too long… so I had to talk go Mihole CS and get a refund… do note that I was texting in English while Mihole CS only text back in CN
It does ship to NA, why else you think I got all of my Taobao Mihole merch, its just that the shipping price is utter garbage and it takes 10 years to ship out to the warehouse… theres also a size limit and shipping price increases the heavier it is (every 0.5 kg increases the price past 1 kg)
Kekw
US or us
Curtains
<:slacc:963350438940397588>
548-648… and another 179 for the stage
So i wasnt lying when I said hers was relatively on the cheaper side
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Teri is 700-900 CNY for reference compared to Hua
Its among the cheaper one
So around $65 USD… with shipping, thats like another 20-40
The whole Hua set (Including the keychains) wouldve costed 461 CNY (excluding shipping)
I want them so bad but I cant
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Stage is only 2 CNY less than the Figurine
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
Im too poor rn, but know that I would bought them all if I could
Sometime it was food too
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I remember when Mihole sold some of their merch with promo…

Like you can buy their coffee mugs for like 1-5 CNY for the first 5 customers who bought it
Most likely CN
Its why I bought and paid for my Griseo, Eden and Aponia charm
I wouldve bought it just to gift it to my friend
Its on Taobao
It is
My first one was like back in 2015 or something
Ive gotten free artbook from a diff game before so i used to it, Mihole is like my 2nd company to ever ship me game artbook
I Already do that anyways
I would pay 50$+ just to ship it to NA
Lmao
I was actually <:cryge:966624721611403294> til i saw how slacc NA was
Ngl i thought it wouldve only lasted like an hour b4 its all sold out
Yea, if it wasnt for Abyss, wouldve been really hard for me to get it… thankfully i got it like 15 over
thank god
lost 500 xtal there
<:cryge:966624721611403294>
didnt even get to do ER last week
barely BP lvl 53 too
such nice bridge but ive been too busy to even play the game
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
im at like end of ch 1, I also need to start on the Seele event rerun too iirc
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
i still barely am on ch 1
same
its so annoying
but that is true
lmao
I slept on mine
12 player co-op doko?
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I wished I was there
wtf is all your chaos
im already balding this week with Dudu on Otto, Dudu on Parvati, and then Doom
disgusting
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
and then mald more
we gonna get a SP Fire Support with no Ignite
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
praying for SP Fire
im already malding for next patch
lmao
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
prob shouldve maxed Purana too
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
no Bastet T really do fuck me over
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
1 bar left
<:Terismol:994096001197543444>
I couldnt kill him in time during 2nd phase
though i ulted phase 1 so thats prob why
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im just satisfied with 625 pts rn because i dont wanna mald against the boss entering I-frame mode because I accidentally froze him too early with cat
congrats
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i legit forgot this was Dudu Week
<:duduL:963697489179975710>
if so, then weak
RL?
lmao
but Lightning can brute force most content like QUA
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Lightning main issue is lack of gather
Ice is fine
Phys is Fine

Fire - Everything
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
the Phys side stage with 3 waves and the shitty 2 Mechs that wont die
I remember the one i Nirvana with the Ice Helicopter and Phys Stage
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
still doesnt stop it from being annoying in RL though
I dont, except for the 1 side stage in Nirvana that i gave up on
im in RL so ill bald less
Shut it, I only got her from Bp so that her spending event outfit can be worn
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
My DA is PRI-less and Stigless
with Ana
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
i just have HoT for mine, i only got HoH so that I can cope and see if i can stay in top 2%
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
now im also tempted
oh, so you didnt skip her?
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Watch as Clock appear in Genshin, HSR and ZZZ
You are just jinxing yourself
I couldn’t even use Mobius here because its -50% Lightning
<:TeriSweat:973794147683151912>
I legit thought I only need to kill them and then more mobs spawned and I ran out of time…
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
The Fire/Ice Mech like took 0 dmg
Like tf
They were so tanky and some took like 0 dmg
And then I had less than 1 min to clear wave 3
Since I cant get past the first stage but yea… Wave 1 legit took me 3-4 min to clear
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Not even the other Nirvana rounds was this much of a cuck
So I lost 100 xtal, thought I could just clear the 3 stage and sleep this nirvana but they really told me to fuck off if i have no full gear
Like full gears support and semi-decent gears for PE, and even that was not enough
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
And since I dont have Bianka, I got to the last stage and ran out of time
So i prob needed Bianca too
Like I have max gear HoS and Griseo… but my PE only has her weapon, Ely TB and Dante M and even then, I couldnt clear it
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Im in Nirvana and i got fucked so badly that I cant even get past the 1st stage
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
Ruby predicting the future
im happy my Armanda is slack, but does weekly... I forgot whose i joined because of that
<:deadge:975652771082698782> I cant pronouns, like my memory too ass, to the point ill prob call everyone he or she whenever my brains goes to sleep
<:kekpat:913676309744451634>
I lost 100 because I had class and couldnt clear Husk
im pretty sure she does, Gresham is prob the other
<a:worryGanbatte:900369496907350016>
yep, thats quite normal, unlike me who dont give a fuck because I dont actually know them
<:yep:833766933685076029>
5 fps mobile gaming
i wouldve been in the same situation if my brother didnt leave his gaming laptop behind when he built his pc and bought a new laptop
I dont bald on weeks I know I will fail miserably for
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Im Abyss Balder and MA Balder... though MA Bald depends on the week
<:draculaSweat:855191596492783677>
You just get tilted
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I am even worse
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
I am finally in like top 2% MA occasionally for the most part... but yea, I dont really like talking to people much outside of those I know or chatted with
<:Razorpopcorn_Devonxy:907631571354386462>
for me, idk people so ishoke, 99% of the people on the leaderboard, i dont even know them
3% roll
I was lucky with Mobimaid
<:deadge:975652771082698782>
wasted an extra 2.8k x 2 xtal
and game said no
but I wanted T piece
It took me like 2-3 multi for Baster 2/3
I prob wouldve had an extra 6k xtal had I not wasted 2 extra multi
and Mobimaid
no, I pulled for Bastet
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
cant be me with only 5k xtal for 6.0
Maybe 2nd
Prob wont beat the SS Vill V, but i def can snipe 3rd
I’ll prob snipe them all tmr after the Concert
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
So ig Morb is better
But thats with my laggy phone
I just got 728 with Morb
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
Wait, whos better here, Morb or HoT
How do you get your Mobi score that high, even with HoT, for me, the run was like 712 pts or something
Disgusting Vill-V bracket
Is this RL?
Should Ruby get a role for this
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
Legit everything Ruby picked is cursed, thats why when Ruby said he picked Aponia, its already fated that Pardo will win
though now im just watching it in general to see if I won
and then see how bs it is
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I watch whenever I lose and see how I lost
Silence vs Can chan
<:PiKek:973573411911659540>
This is gonna be hard
Hmmm… so Pardo…
I need to know so that I can bet the complete opposite
<:E_PoliwhirlConcern:793960306882773003>
Btw, who are you betting on
me with no Dudu Elf
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
<:kekers:809958778812366908>
The Diluc Skin is a 5* Skin thats like equivalent to our f2p Skin in Honkai with basic sfx changes <:KekPat:966625000339668993> 

Then theres the actual 5* skin in Honkai
<:eek:765359367524188161>
same, whats worse is that Felis almost died too until Can chan proc twice otta nowhere
For me, its Honkai Schedule with my Anime stuff
botta lose all my Votes
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I betted Vill V too
rip me then
knowing that Aponia is just fcking Broken
<:kek:809950280258945024>
I also went all in for Kosma

<:wheeze:833318723565649950>

<:Copium:834822065231364156>
Me no have Luka
ngl, I didn't expect my discord to be this old being 2016 XD
good luck aster
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
ah yes, my favorite, the backrooms
yeye
On another note, for Pro Sekai, I did a Multi on the Anni Banner and got the sibbling Vocaloid, so yay i guess
Instead, out all of people, the one character I hated the most appeared and crushed my dreams
Instead, I got 3 other 5*, which two were from Rhythm Link while the last one had Star PRO popped up so I had hope it was Shinobu
It was Shinobu Bday for Enstar and so I was pulling on his Banner to get the Combo Saver Furry Shinobu
I got cucked
<a:pat:717159864891342848>
UWA
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I love and hate Sekai, the songs are good and I love the characters, but the gameplays feels like its bullying me for being a thumb player because the notes don't respond to me half the time
<a:gf_pat:1077167310219006012> <a:pat:969402615538520064> <a:pat:717159864891342848>
<a:Run:828749243820802130>
Got his paid invitation, sleeping luke and doggo judt too good
I can save for Anniversary Luke and Baby Luke so in happy
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
60 pulls for both of them
Thankfully, Luke saved the day immediately after
Got cucked by Vyn but the cat is cute
I did it
 The cat is adorable, Luke is still my favorite, there is a Rosa one in Vyn card but that one is sus
<a:uwu:854358144456458260>
 Me love Luke, you get to see Rosa cook too
i just hope the best of luck for mine
also, good luck aster on your discord name
 Prob my favorite Christmas song/mv for Ensemble stars <:KekPat:966625000339668993>
Unless they are really shit Idol games
Im still a mew players, at I know why these Idol games never die out easily
Not even a day, how tf do these people have over 10 mil points <:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
But its my favorite card design-wise so im not sad about it
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
11 multi away from Hard Pity
191 pulls for my Fav
This was my greatest pain
I go take shower too and play HSR, ishoke, I read to suffer too
<a:hugd:748431565453000784>
<:paimonthink:1077568911056326706>
Limbus Company ftw as I watch all my Sinners go insane and kill each other with friendly fire
Though good gameplay is still secondary for me which was why I quit Genshin
Thats just me in any gacha games, cute characters = simp

One of the main reason I started playing ES!!
I wished my hand eye coordination was that good
<:wheeze:833318723565649950>
it was quite entertaining to watch
oh, I dont mean bots hacking, im just saying if they were to fight ai, it will prob be hell in the end anyways <:KekPat:966625000339668993> like with the one Osu match where 12 people fought against an AI streamer, they were just getting clapped
they will all lose to AI anyways
<a:NodBb:561613076844249130>
There are a lot of decent one for Neuv already but not enough good one for Wrio <:Sadge:842131939607183360> of course, if you look hard enough, they’ll prob be one with a Patreon where they actually store their actual mods/skins
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
oh
oh
whats this about
<:KekPat:966625000339668993>
I went on the game today, saw a sniper rifle, pulled for sniper rifle, took hard pity, quit the game again
make sure to get a nice plushie to squish for yourselves too
yes yes, I have 2, this one I don't hug though because its a tsundere, so I can only dress it in good clothes... theres another one ima bring with me to school to help me destress during Finals because that one is fine with me squishing it
<a:shotowigglepup2:1031425690442149979>
Yatta Birb here to cheer you up too
<:shxtouEhe:1013233702622462034>
it made me nostalgic because I listen to other versions of this too
We all can suffer together and find happiness in our copium
<:depresso:1159828653413249086>
Don't die on me
 Heres more song <a:PattingSkippy:731400933094719569>
at least the braces part, but for periods, I wish thee best of luck
you'll get used to it... maybe...
<a:pat:717159864891342848>
<a:KianaWaiting:652262801796104227>
<a:pat:969402615538520064>
I hope its not too serious Chrom, hope whatever is going on gets resolved
Wao
too bad I prob won't play it... too many games for me rn, plus, me not really a fan of the characters... I might play it for the rhythm game later
soon huh
I question myself why I even bothered to listen and watch the entire clip
...
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
its sad, well, at least its not like some culture where its like they are molding their babies head to show that they are royalty or of high status... 

though there are some kinda self deprecating one where the people who lived were really short people because all the strong healthy one with good genetics were sacrificing themselves for their gods as an offering for prosperity
well, it already is but like there will be a point it just speeds up
we'll get to the point where humanity just self destruct
<a:classic:1164190242992033932>
Idk how times change either, at least from what I learn from Art History, homosexuality was the norm back in ancient time like Ancient Greek, Roman, Minoan, etc time

Then again, relationship between young men and older men was also a thing and females were kinda just bodied left alone by themselves which was also kinda depressing<:deadge:975652771082698782>
Or just be closeted
if anything, it'd be the other way around
its not
and completely ignore everything else
but yea, I just thought it was based that they just went:

your feelings are not facts 🤓 
99.8% of all people identify as the sex they were born with <:CatNerd:1068598542639317092>
<:KEK:1024468566835204137>
I always word things badly, every single time too, so I end up having to clarify it
I just worded it very badly <a:kekah:844467095227990028> but yea
but everything that combines it makes it completely false
so the kinda true part is just, its like random words/sentences that are true
just me strawman pulling random info, like the fact that people with vagina do indeed usually have a period where they bleed from it
<:kekhandss:969204829354328105>
I should swapped the word, kinda true, the based part is that they were so specific that so many people can't even fall under their category at all
it does but its still pretty funny
well, its all hormones in the end
<a:shotonodders:1135611601974722620>
under very specific circumstances yes
<:YEP:815000469902065674>
Though the Men cant be pregante or lactation is gone the moment you involve the omegaverse
I love it <:wheeze:833318723565649950> Idk why, its so silly but kinda based and true
<:icy:828402220151603231>
Why you gotta do dat to Tet
....
<a:pat:717159864891342848>
Happy Birthday you two
<:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294> <:cryge:966624721611403294>
